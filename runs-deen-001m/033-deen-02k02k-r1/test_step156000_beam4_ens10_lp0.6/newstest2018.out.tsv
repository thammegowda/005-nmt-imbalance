Munich 1856 : Four maps that change your view of the city .	-3.2298
A mistake where young people should meet today .	-3.4374
A chapel where the S-Bahn tunnel is dug now .	-4.1496
Small farmers manage the former reason of farmers .	-2.9998
The oldest official map in Munich promotes exciting stories .	-1.9603
It is nervous if maps are not up-to-date .	-2.7401
Everyone who had to get excited because the car navi displayed a green meadow instead of a bypass .	-4.1719
The historical maps of the digital Bavarian Atlase , an offer by the Bavarian state government of Bavaria , are far from current , but it is precisely for this reason that it is very interesting .	-5.8571
Especially if you compare it with current online cards .	-2.2284
Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the spread area of Munich ’ s Mercury since the 19th century .	-3.8269
The digital Bavarian Atlas is a patchwork that is not recognized as such .	-3.3715
The big overview map included more detailed maps for cities and municipalities , so-called original sheets .	-4.8481
It was created by the Bavarian Management Board between 1810 and 1864 and derived from the first survey of Bavaria .	-5.4878
Your client : Napoleon .	-1.0001
The French army leader has occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .	-2.7090
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic reception of Bavaria , of course for military purposes .	-3.1924
Even though the French troops eventually withdrew from the peace of Lunéville on 9 February 1801 , the present neighbours created the idea of a covering Bavarian card .	-4.9011
Kurfürst Max IV Joseph continued to push the project forward , founded the " Topographical Bureau " - and thus the Bavarian survey management .	-3.8179
The Munich Urposition Journal dates back to 1856 and , like all others , it can be found on the Bavarian National Library website .	-5.4555
The comparison of earlier / present is the most impressive example of the capital of the country .	-4.1537
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .	-3.3828
An example of this is Untersendling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856 .	-2.8239
Sendling was meant to be a Munich district 21 years after the map was created in 1877 .	-4.0517
Today Untersendling is in the middle of the city .	-3.0496
The Untersendlings houses concentrate around 1856 along today ’ s Plinganserstra<unk>e , which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878 , a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705 .	-3.7751
Where the Western Park is today , nothing is seen as a field - at first glance : a smaller card with dozens of lines and numbers appears : handwritten corridors from the so-called " purchase " , from which the base tax was derived .	-5.9693
Small plots no longer occupy farmers there today - but small gardens of the land in the sun .	-5.2680
A large green area stands out north of Untersendling .	-2.6928
The Theresienwiese , since 1810 the site of Oktoberfest , was in fact still a meadow in the 19th century - not a concrete desert .	-11.1261
On the other side of the Isar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine .	-2.0996
In the area of today 's Au-Haidhausen district you can read not only the street name " am Gasteig " or the hill " On the fans " - but also in large letters " Irren Anstalt " .	-6.1240
Yes , here on the Auerfeldstra<unk>e people were once blocked in with madness ideas .	-4.2661
In 1858 / 59 the Munich district Irrenanstalt " On the Auer Lüften " was founded . in the was .	-9.9360
From 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the establishment - the psychiatrist who is associated with the death of King Ludwigs II .	-3.8137
" He was progressive for his time and , for example , ended the chain of the so-called errors .	-3.3829
He also prohibited the staff from applying violence against the occupants ' , says Hermann Wilhelm , Head of the Museum Haidhausen , who has worked for an exhibition at the Institute .	-4.5973
There was room for 280 patients , and later it was extended to 500 places .	-4.2513
Eventually , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the circular installation in Haar 1905 .	-4.7013
The Isar-Amper-Klinikum München-Ost , one of Germany 's largest psychiatric hospitals , has been located there since 2006 .	-4.8475
The former Auer Installation area now contains young people in the Munich Salesianum .	-4.3930
The order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth home with training facilities .	-3.2840
Western lies the soccer pitch of TSV Munich East , east residential houses from the 1980s .	-3.8222
In 2015 , the “ Casa Don Bosco ” children ’ s house was built in architectural reflection on the origin of the Irrenal Institute , which was destroyed during World War II during bombing attacks .	-5.5854
The Marienplatz was listed as " Hauptplatz " in 1856 , and the Kaufinger Gasse was called " Kaufinger Gasse " .	-5.0787
The Second World War brought a significant change in the heart of Munich .	-3.2067
The Allied bombs took many holes into the city centre in December 1944 .	-2.7120
A big staying at the Marienhof .	-3.4510
The English Institute , small shops and a Middle Ages grub chapel once stood at the Marienhof , where these days the preparatory work and on April 5 , 2017 the Spatenscheich für die second S-Bahn-Stammstrasse . in . in , , in , , , , , , , ,	-12.2334
With the slider the old Munich card can be compared to today 's aerial image - and the hole at the Marienhof is filled .	-13.6024
Civil rights group publishes travel warning for Missouri	-1.7289
The National Association for the Promotion of Colors has issued a warning to coloured people travelling to Missouri because of discriminatory policies and racist attacks by the state .	-3.7439
" The NAACP Travel Advisory for the federal state of Missouri , which is to enter into force by 28 August 2017 , calls on African-American travellers , visitors , and missourians to pay special attention to travel through the state and to exercise extreme caution , as a series of questionable racial incidents occur and are recently noted throughout the state , " said it in the group 's opini.	-6.9393
A recent law of Missouri , which makes it more difficult for people to win discrimination claims , as well as the state ’ s prosecution authorities , which aim disproportionately at minorities , led the group to issue the travel warning , said NAACP .	-5.4762
" They have violations of civil rights that happen to people .	-2.7050
They are stopped because of their skin color , beaten or killed , " said the President of Missouri NAACP , Rod Chapel , the Kansas City Star .	-3.0847
'We hear complaints of this kind that we have not heard yet ' .	-2.7709
It is the first such warning that the Organization has issued for a State in the USA .	-2.2543
The group quoted incidents such as racist crimes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .	-2.3868
Sanders died in dubious circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no gasoline during the journey through the state and was detained by the Missouri police without being accused of crime .	-4.1267
The Council also draws attention to a recent report by the Office of the Prosecutor General of Missouri , which shows that 75 % of black drivers in the state are more often stopped as white .	-5.0185
" The recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what might happen in Missouri , " said Chapel .	-2.4976
'People must be prepared to pay for deposits or let relatives know that they are travelling through the state ' .	-3.9173
In 2015 , Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes , according to the latest figures from the FBI ’ s Hass Crime Report Programme , classifying the state as the country ’ s 16th rank for the number of such injuries .	-4.5724
Travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law , which would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination .	-10.1319
Previously , the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona , after the states had adopted immigration laws , obliged local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for infringement of immigration , which , in the opinion of the ACLU , will contribute to further race profiling . in , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-9.1682
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to other countries , but recently stakeholders have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US .	-2.9770
Gastro-fencing project is fundamental .	-3.4547
The Fischerbach Weidezaun project is a success project and will continue next year .	-1.5217
The CDU MEPs Peter Wei<unk> and Kordula Kovac have got a picture there .	-3.6614
Representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU local association met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MEPs at the Rightgrabenhof of of the Schwendemann family .	-4.0726
Markus Schwendemann initially gave insights into his plant , where he managed 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , supplied 40 milk cows and as many young animals and housed holiday guests in five apartments .	-4.7468
The " black forest milk " is for him the alternative way of marketing for the milk of his cows , says Schwendemann .	-3.5179
On the table of the guests is only regional .	-4.3346
Since he is also BLHV Chairman of Fischerbach , he called the fence project " fundamental " .	-3.5402
I cannot manage profitably on such steep areas .	-10.1582
The green surface provides a lot of work , and the engine sense must be processed .	-4.9609
" We are struggling with the conditions and topography , " emphasized Schwendemann . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-8.4285
In 2003 , he took over the parental company and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if he did not run a biobetric .	-12.5253
For mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : " The municipality recognized the importance of the fence project and is glad about leader promotion " .	-3.9112
Farmers should be supported at a cost of EUR 3000 to EUR 4000 per hectare .	-2.6735
It is hoped that this will be a long way from afforestation .	-4.8628
" The greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they carry on their business , " emphasized the mayor .	-4.3238
Farmers are often criticised for promotion .	-3.2432
In 2013 , a total of 25 plots of 11 participants were fenced by fencing fencing .	-3.5463
The open space is therefore 40 hectares which must not be upgraded until at least 2023 .	-4.2091
Of the total cost of EUR 71 500 , half was supported over leader , a quarter borne the municipality of Fischerbach .	-3.9209
The farmers thus left 12 610 euros , which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of fence .	-3.5928
" The great advantage is the longevity of fences " , explained Schwendemann .	-2.3506
Kordula Kovac emphasized : ' You do a really good job without farmers and agricultural women ' .	-3.6751
Peter Wei<unk> also stated : ' Best food is produced here ' .	-4.2624
The Landscape Care Directive ( LPR ) Baden-Württemberg allows the state to promote fences .	-3.2271
The aim is to keep the Black Forest open .	-1.6497
The presence of a screen called by the LPR is a prerequisite .	-3.9845
Furthermore , fenced land must not be labor-managed ( slowing above 35 % ) and must therefore be threatened with afforestation .	-5.2424
The 2018 Fischerbach Weidezaunproject is currently submitted by eight participants with 24 pitches who want to build almost 16 kilometres of fences .	-4.5101
The open space is equivalent to 35 hectares , with the cost of calculating more than EUR 112 000 .	-4.7018
Is no more sacred ?	-1.7975
Now the White House of Trump is taking the Statue of Liberty	-9.4821
The safest sign of regime change is to start attacking statues .	-2.4265
The Americans appreciate them as much as any other – hence Saddam Hussein ’ s carefully staged fall in Baghdad in 2003 .	-3.6778
Stephen Miller , one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN about the president ’ s proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration with the status of liberty .	-3.9010
To remain fair , Miller did not attack the statue itself .	-1.2135
A horde of boat owners and liberty imitators would have liked him to have done so .	-1.9831
But he attacked its importance , and especially the importance attributed to it when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus was added in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , its base .	-3.5654
When Miller Acosta shouted : " I will not go into a complete thing about history here , but the statue of liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world .	-4.3579
The poem to which you refer , which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Freedom . '	-2.7635
Miller is actually right , but , as he put it , it is not really a question of history .	-3.8084
It is a question of contemporary response to the upsetting words of Lazarus , the only one in which a state not only invites old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : ' Your mouths , your poor , / your afflicted masses who yearn to breathe freely , / the wretched waste of your rich coasts ' .	-6.6110
There was never a time when the " miserable waste " on our screens was better to see .	-3.2975
Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump ’ s US .	-2.9040
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural dispute : it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America .	-3.3008
Lazarus - and her friends who campaigned to put their words on the ground after their death - knew very well that they did a highly political job .	-4.8637
The sculpture should show the links between French and American Republicanism by representing the female embodiment of freedom in a classical picture used .	-3.9341
Lazarus changed this meaning : In her poem , the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received one voice .	-3.3250
And she gives himself a very different name : Mother of the exiles .	-2.8656
The combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism .	-2.1177
And just as Lazarus changed the importance of the statue , people from the right wanted to change that for a long time .	-3.6931
The great rebellion of Rush Limbaugh , a kind of Johannes of the Baptist for the Coming of Trump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was not inviting anyone , but rather an early neo-conservative that brings the American flame into the night world : " Lady Liberty is moving forward .	-5.2571
It is meant to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .	-2.1626
The torch should not illuminate the way to the United States ' .	-8.6587
It is quite unusual that Limbaugh has come up against something here .	-4.4327
The importance of the statue is quite a question of the position of perception .	-2.7251
The great imagination of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted , miserable but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships .	-3.9323
The real issue is to see the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and an opportunity to improve their lives .	-2.0768
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome that they must hear .	-2.4366
And that , of course , is not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to recognize .	-2.4632
Their torch is not intended to illuminate the way , but to inflame the hatred that is their only source of power .	-8.3299
World Cup 2017 : Neil Black praises Scottish members of the British Team	-1.8194
Eilidh Doyle reminds us of a time when only two Scots belonged to the British team .	-2.7163
Neil Black , the UK ’ s Director of athletics , says that the 16-headed Scottish quota in the World Championship Cader will ' make a massive contribution to the team ' .	-4.6941
A record number of Scottish athletes were selected for London 2017 , which starts on Friday .	-2.1893
Black believes that ' something special develops in Scotland ' and the UK ’ s athletics must learn something from it .	-3.3913
" We welcome it , and we try to understand it , and we will continue it until we find out , " said Black .	-2.6001
" I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think that it has something to do with what they have done .	-7.9297
The Scottish athletes think that it has something to do with what they have done .	-2.0464
British athletics : it has something to do with what they have done .	-2.5750
And also with the type on the street corner .	-2.2995
Whatever the combination of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . '	-1.4050
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal contenders , including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart , who will take Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track , while Eilidh Doyle was elected team captain by the team .	-4.7786
" Eilidh is rather modest .	-1.5960
Her captain speech was incredible ' , says Black .	-1.9705
" A series of athletes , whether they were Scottish or whatever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and very motivated . .	-12.0924
The passion and the genuine feeling that Eilidh brought about naturally were great ' .	-4.1926
The Commonwealth silver medal winner , who will take over the 400-m hurdles in her fifth World Cup , says that it is " incredible " that 16 Scots are in the British team .	-4.4875
Scotland ’ s best total number of athletes at the World Cup was seven achieved in 1983 and 2015 .	-2.4632
The middle range runner Muir is heading along this road and established five British and two European records last year .	-4.8120
It will participate in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m races .	-2.9068
Chris O 'Hare , who runs 1,500 metres , is another Scot to be seen after a great season that included the victory of the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games .	-4.2355
Doyle is reminiscent of her first World Championships , when the only other Scot in Team Lee McConnell was .	-3.4958
The team captain says that she is " enormously proud " of the fact that many of her compatriots will not only belong to the team , but also , in some cases , to the medals and finals .	-3.8652
" Being a team captain in particular is that she was elected by the other members of the team , so it was a great honour anyway , but to know that my team colleagues voted for me and voted for me , it makes me something very special for me , " she added .	-5.2769
" Obviously I am very proud of all the Scots that belong to the team .	-8.5113
It only shows how far we have come .	-1.5914
And they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to rise on podia .	-3.2059
Regarding my speech as a captain ?	-2.4319
Yes , I think she went well .	-1.1270
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation , as we have a World Cup .	-3.6216
So it is really important to focus on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back in the Olympic Stadium .	-3.4531
I get a second chance to go out and compete there and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there . '	-3.8066
Block critics about Facebook : Don 't apply for a public office if you cannot bear the heating of voters .	-4.4613
The father of our country knew something of a bad press .	-1.7401
Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long for the newspapers to beat him for everything , from domestic politics to its political principles .	-2.5090
He swept to criticism , safe .	-3.2760
But he has not silenced his critics .	-0.9348
Because in 1783 , Washington said : ' Freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and silent , like sheep , we are going to battle . '	-3.5836
This brings me to Maryland as governor Larry Hogan , who must work to be more like Washington .	-2.6858
Hogan ’ s staff have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .	-3.1349
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him earlier this week .	-2.0475
The Governor 's staff resolved the complaint as frivol , and the online comment was full of a backlash with " Na , and ? " .	-3.2140
" It is only Facebook " , many people said .	-2.3495
But it is important .	-0.8318
And it is especially important when it is a type like Hogan .	-2.1257
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is astonishingly popular .	-2.3949
He has the second highest approval of the 50 nation governors .	-2.2775
Hogan is not a reactionary heat .	-1.1460
He has shown a firm hand in leading his state and strict compliance with the principles .	-3.6239
He was also very skilful in using Facebook as a primary means of joining his voters and playing his hairless head for chemotherapy on his side .	-3.5024
Therefore , the blocking of people who come to the side of the governor - a public forum that is formally described as official and is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous for employees paid with a public tax dollar .	-6.4483
In an interview with The Washington Post , Hogan ’ s spokesman Amelia Chasse defended the governor ’ s actions and argued that blocking comments was nothing more than a moderation .	-2.5801
But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people who swing the stick online .	-3.3986
The post spoke to some of the real people blocked by Hogan .	-1.5525
And these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur , and a parish , not a troll .	-8.2492
They all said that their comments were respectful , thoughtful and not profan .	-1.9539
The parish quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith .	-2.3204
Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie , Md . , was not hateful , but she asked for hate crimes .	-2.2163
" I commented politely that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other current news , " she wrote in the commentary area of the news sending " The Post " .	-3.5929
" I do not appreciate this idea , either , if a number of people take a position on the same subject , they are disregarded by some rather than a so-called collective effort and not recognised as a large group of citizens affected ' .	-6.1347
What the governor ’ s staff called “ concentrated spam attack , ” others would probably call “ advocacy . ”	-4.4434
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment .	-1.7186
It is much cleaner than in the past if we had done the same thing that staff were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles , or to arrest and silence demonstrators .	-3.5879
But that is precisely what is happening digitally .	-1.7951
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticised for having vaccinated Facebook and other social media .	-2.5261
President Trump is sued by Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed .	-1.6212
One of the first milestones on this issue fell in Virginia last week .	-2.1165
The chairman of the Loudoun County ’ s Board of Supervisors injured the First Amendment , according to US judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria , when she banned a voter from her Facebook page .	-3.9998
And in Kentucky , governor Matt Bevin ( R ) also received a visit from ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter .	-2.5845
This should not be so difficult .	-1.7520
At the time of Washington , affordable portos had a similar effect to the Internet .	-2.6702
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800 , and anonymous letters suggested his leadership .	-2.4955
Even then , Washington had anonymous trolls .	-0.9687
People using pseudonyms such as " Juricola " , " Valerius " , " Belisarius " and " Portius " write all letters to newspapers that set down Washington 's decisions .	-3.5654
Petitions that criticized his position on the Treaty of Amity , trade and shipping with the UK overwhelmed his position , according to the historical documents collected by the George Washington Project 's online papers .	-3.8920
But he did not silence them .	-1.2483
Freedom of speech , disagreement and discourse are the basis of our nation .	-1.8215
And real leadership means accepting that .	-1.4877
Ronan Rafferty hopes for domestic comfort at the Renaissance Club .	-1.6716

Less lung cancer caused by passive smoking	-1.6276
In the past two decades , fewer and fewer people have died because of passive smoking of lung cancer .	-2.1485
This is the result of a study by scientists from the University Clinic Hamburg-Eppendorf ( UKE ) .	-3.1617
" According to our estimates , 167 lung cancer deaths per year are caused by passive smoking , " said Heiko Becher .	-3.2798
As a comparison , he drawn up his own study on this subject from 1994 .	-8.2720
At that time , there were 400 lung cancer deaths for passive smoking per year in Germany .	-2.6304
The new investigation is published in the " International Journal of Public Health " .	-9.8964

The construction works on the Villinger Strasse are in full swing and " lie somewhat in the time " , says the head of the Bauhof Fred Heinze .	-4.4181
In the area of domestic connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected , because there is a lot of hidden underground , which is not noted in the plans .	-5.3825

In their wooden house in Enarotali , the capital of the Paniai Regency in the troubled Indonesian province of Papua , the housewife usually lays a sweet potato - called " local " - directly into the fireplace .	-4.0816

It is a rare insight into daily life in the highlands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was admitted in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,026 elders should vote through public handling before the occupying forces .	-4.6129
An existing movement stemming from independence against Dutch rule quickly turned against the Jakarta Government , which maintains control of the region and excludes foreign journalists or observers of justice .	-4.3323
In 2003 , the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua , with the independent part of Papua New Guinea covering the eastern part of the island .	-3.0081

Papua is Indonesia ’ s poorest province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and some of the worst rates of child mortality and literacy in Asia .	-10.1939
But it is also Indonesia ’ s goldland .	-1.8457
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Grasberg , owned by Freeport McMoran from Phoenix , is only 60 miles from Paniai , a highlands province of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants .	-3.3615
In 2015 alone , Freeport lost $ 3.1 billion of gold and copper .	-1.8652
Moreover , Papua has an estimated $ 78 billion wood resources .	-2.2866
These wealth , however , are a source of misery for the Papua , ensuring that Indonesia ’ s powerful military presence is stifling .	-3.3786
A 2005 investigation in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid nearly $ 20 million to local military and units between 1998 and 2004 , including up to $ 150,000 to a single officer .	-3.5776

Indonesia ’ s president , Joko Widodo , known to be Jokowi , promised to address inequalities and infringements in Papua during his election campaign in 2014 .	-15.8530
The former carpenter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua , including Paniai , on the way to the presidential palace in Jakarta .	-3.3513
But little has changed in Papua , and now locals feel cheated .	-3.0481
" Our hearts have broken because we voted in favour of Jokowi in 2014 , with the expectation that he will fulfil our hopes that justice will be restored , " says You .	-3.8974
In fact , only two months after Jokowi ’ s inauguration , Paniai suffered a low point in October .	-1.7634

The shocked children told them that they should turn their headlights on .	-11.8677
One of the soldiers took offense and later came back with four soldiers , so the local pastor Yavedt Tebai .	-3.3590
The soldiers who had drinked hunted and beat the group with their pistons of guns , said victims and witnesses .	-2.9570
One of the soldiers then fired into the group of children .	-1.7850
A child , 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo , was so badly beaten that he fell into coma .	-2.8614
A few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was fired and things escalated the next day .	-2.6882
About 1,000 young Papua men , women , and children gathered in a football court in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice .	-3.3909
They presented ceremonial hunting sheets and introduced the Waita dance - constantly and imitating a bird song - by Papuas Mee Pago tribe .	-5.4848
Some demonstrators started shifting stones on police and military posts .	-2.9411
When the mood was heated , the soldier was sent a command on an internal radio : " If the masses resist more than three times , they shoot dead , " it is said in an official TIME document that was not released to the local media .	-5.1407
Yeremias Kayame , 56 , the head of the Kego Koto Quarter of Enarotali , saw the threat and called for calm and asked the crowd to return home .	-3.6153
No one was listening to the mood .	-8.7145
" When I turned around , I was suddenly shot into my left handjoint , " he said TIME on the veranda of his colorful painted wooden house .	-3.2756
Kayame still does not know who has fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here .	-2.5275
" It was crowded , many shots were fired , " he adds .	-1.8898
The local man Alfius Youw was met three times , so his cousin who witnessed the shootings .	-3.1379

The chief spectrum of the Papua police , Yotje Mende , said reporters that his officers wanted to secure their station only because they were attacked .	-3.6036
" We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us , " said the spokesman of the Papua police , Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo , in 2015 .	-2.3393
'It is about life and death ' .	-1.1674
According to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstrators were killed and many others were injured .	-1.7029
The news of the killings came to Jakarta only the following day .	-2.5917
Three weeks in Jayapura , Jokowi delivered a passionate speech in which he expressed sympathy for the victims ' families and swore to address the historical abuses in Papua .	-3.9783
" I want this case to be resolved immediately , so it will not happen in the future , " he said .	-2.3948
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he established an extrajudicial mechanism for settling historical human rights violations .	-2.3396
But the excuses began almost immediately .	-0.9349
" Most injuries occurred long ago .	-1.8163
Some were in the 90s and early 2000s .	-2.2368
The point is that we have committed ourselves to addressing these infringements , but there are processes that must be passed , " he said .	-3.2852
Then Wiranto retreated when he spoke to TIME in Jakarta on 5 June and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua .	-3.1794
Instead , ' everything is regulated by law ' , he said .	-1.6032
Wiranto , accused of crimes against humanity , which claimed more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor 's bloody independence vote of 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights violations have already been settled in Papua , including the Paniai incident .	-3.5426
Families of the Paniai victims accepted such claims with gross unbelief .	-3.1820
" I have been interviewed four times over the past three years , but there has been no progress " , says Yohanes .	-2.3275
'I am tired ' .	-0.6299
He says that he lives in fear years later .	-2.2872
" I am afraid , " he says .	-1.8736
'I am afraid to be arrested by the military is afraid to be shot ' .	-2.3396
His brother Yacobus repeated the view that the people of Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident .	-2.9071
He says that he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four of the victims .	-1.8758
" After burying the bodies , the military was looking for me , " he says .	-2.5847
The shooters have not stopped .	-1.9102
On Tuesday , the Indonesian police shot villagers in Paniai ’ s neighborhood Deiyai .	-2.3399
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a building company that refused to bring a conscious man to the hospital , one person and 17 others were injured , including children .	-3.2317
The man , the 24-year-old Ravianus Douw , who was drowned when fishing in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .	-2.7153
Excursed villagers protested before the company ’ s office .	-3.1010
The police said that the villagers threw stones to officers who responded by firing warning shots .	-2.0236
But locals say that the mobile brigade ( Indonesian paramilitary police ) began to shoot and kill one .	-1.7476
" We were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , " says the 29-year-old Dominggu Badii , who lived near the hospital and witnessed how the injured here was quickly delivered , said TIME .	-4.2515
'I hidden myself in my house two days ' .	-2.2735
The Deiyai parliament has called for the officers involved to be held accountable and the mobile brigade of the police to be withdrawn from the area .	-3.7517
Paniai has always been a troublemaker for the Indonesian Government .	-2.3988
The lack of meaningful development reinforces the dissatisfaction of the tribal meadows , Moni , Dani and Damal living in the green Papua highlands .	-3.9515
Many joined the " Free Papua Movement " ( OPM ) , the rebel army , which claims to defend the rights of the Papua by encouraging sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers .	-9.4847
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai , including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya .	-1.8659
In response , thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and arbitrarily detained in recent years , on the pretext of ' safeguarding national sovereignty ' .	-2.7559
Some people never dive again .	-2.7883
Among the people of Papua , Paniai is known as " a tragic , forgotten place " .	-2.2485
Poverty increases discontent .	-1.6894
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals .	-2.1396
Brot is just as beyond reach .	-2.3657
People here are building everything they eat : especially nota and fruit and leaf vegetables .	-3.3025
Agriculture is the responsibility of women who can work four or five fields of sweeteners each .	-9.6350
They keep most of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market .	-2.5773
Ten pieces of nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees ( 75 cents ) .	-1.7304
Over time , economic inequalities between local Papua and the new migrants have grown , who have arrived in larger numbers since the opening of new flight routes to Nabire airport .	-11.1625
The few jobs in the region usually go to the more educated and prosperous migrants .	-3.1776
Papua rarely have the capital or the skills needed to run its own companies competitively .	-3.5335
" Young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there is no jobs or money here , " says John Gobai , Chairman of the Tribal Council of Paniai .	-3.1082
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua .	-1.3952
Moreover , restrictions on reporting remain tense to international media .	-2.3899
Earlier this year , French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported for lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua , although they were given the rare permission to film .	-3.1685
According to Phelim Kine , Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch , Jokowi ’ s campaign promises to lift the restrictions on reporting in order to promote transparency and development were not implemented .	-3.6880
" There are new dangers to foreign journalists trying to report to Indonesia 's troubled eastern provinces of Papua and Western Papua : visa refusal and a blacklist , " he said in a declaration .	-3.1629
Lack of press control means that the international pressure on Indonesia ’ s government remains largely confined to Papua ’ s immediate neighbours .	-14.0622
In March , six Pacific states - Tonga , Nauru , Palau , Tuvalu , Marshall Islands and the Salomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate ' various and widespread violations ' in Papua , including the Paniai shooting .	-2.9304
The same countries have historically supported the OPM .	-1.2437
The spokesman of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Arrmanatha Nasir rejected the group 's accusations and said journalists in Jakarta : ' In Indonesia , there is still a democratic system and free media , so it is difficult to conceal evidence of human rights cases ' .	-4.2058
People on the ground want more foreign governments to take note of .	-1.8443
When an official delegation from the Netherlands visited Jayapura on 4 May , under the leadership of the Human Rights Ambassador Kees Van Baar , indigenous people broke silence and urged him " We want freedom " , according to a source that also attended the meeting , but wanted to remain anonymous .	-4.5871
Indonesia holds another presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua is unlikely to vote for Jokowi again .	-2.4075
" Jokowi is a person with good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Paniai shots , " says Gobai , Chairman of the Tribal Council .	-3.4334
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people , apart from living under the constant threat of a predatory military , are in poor education and health services .	-3.0148
Gobai says that the Paniai people , like other Papua , see their voice for Jokowi as a " guilt " that he must pay back .	-3.6902
" They do not need money , they just want justice , " he says .	-1.7150
Despite the threats and intimidation , families of the Paniai shooting victims carried out a final symbolic act of defiance : the corpses of a victim were buried on a precise ground in front of the police and the military stati. , , , was , , , , , , ,	-9.7725
They know that they may never be justified , but at least they will not forget their crimes .	-2.8036

Fire capture the Torch skyscraper of Dubai for the second time .	-3.0315
On Friday , one of the world ’ s highest housing towers in Dubai found its way through and forced hundreds of inhabitants from which 337 metres high to flee 79-storey buildings .	-5.6741
It is the second fire that , in just two years , flaps through the high house , which randomly is called the Torch Tower ( Tower ) .	-6.0695
The building was evacuated , injuries were not reported and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .	-2.2238
" We slept and stood up at the fire alarm and shouting the people .	-2.9952
We ran down the staircase and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor , " a resident who gave his name as George Reuters told .	-3.5315
Dubai ’ s civil protection authorities said that the fire fight units deleted the fire and cooled the building against 4 a.m. local time ( 00.00 a.m. GMT ) . .	-11.8052
The government said she is working on providing accommodation for those affected .	-10.0517
This incident can revive safety issues used in high-rise houses around the world .	-5.0626
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage came from clothing , outside clothing to decoration or isolation .	-4.5049
In Britain , the police said that they believe that the system of plates could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in June , with about 80 people died .	-4.8145
No Davis Cup reform : Further best-of-five	-1.7456
The president of the International Tennis Association ( ITF ) has fallen through his great Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly .	-3.6830
At the Ho-Chi-Minh City meeting , the revolutionary proposal for this sport to only play Davis Cup on two winnings was not supported by the required two-thirds majority .	-4.8757
The five-sentence classics , which are often very long , but also highly valued , remain in keeping with the tradition competition .	-13.4212
63.54 % of the Member States voted in favour of reform , so the goal of ITF President David Haggerty was scarcely missed .	-3.6089
" We respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members have not adopted the entire Davis Cup and Fed Cup reform package .	-2.2224
We need a change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historical competitions , " said Haggerty .	-2.3315
We will continue to work to improve applications .	-1.8942
It was not until the vote , after many objections , that the proposal had already been made to put the final in a neutral place .	-5.3723
New from 2018 are only comparatively smaller details : For example , the finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have host law in the following year .	-4.4718
In order to reduce costs for the organizers , the requirements for training places and so on will be facilitated and players will have to complete less official media dates before the Davis Cup .	-5.2488
More than 1 out of 5 U.S. travellers bring forbidden objects into the plane , find out a poll out of a survey .	-11.9425
A survey by air passengers found that more than 20 % deliberately or unconsciously forbidden items at the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration were smuggled past , including at least 6 % of the aircraft entering , while accidentally carrying blades or other items .	-6.3844
Less than 1 % claimed that they had late discovered that they were mistaken with guns , ammunition , or explosive .	-3.6502
The survey of more than 1,000 people - carried out by a jet charter service , Stratos Jet Charters Inc . - also found that younger travellers tend to ignore the rules .	-4.0596
Of the respondents who admitted that they knowingly tried to fly with something prohibited by the TSA , 19.7 % were Millennials , compared to less than 15 % , who were members of Generation X.	-4.2302
The most common items deliberately passed by TSA agents were food and liquids .	-2.3191
More than 3 % admitted knowledgeable to have borne with blades through the security control , while 2.2 % of female respondents and 3.7 % of male respondents also confirmed that they intentionally brought forbidden drugs into the plane .	-5.8258
The company said that travellers across the country asked how many accidentally smuggling goods would have brought through airport safety and how many people intentionally would have done .	-5.0104
It is no surprise that the most frequent smuggling commodities - knowledgeable or unknowingly - were those who fly most .	-5.5260
However , the company points out that TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing .	-2.5790
People are often uncertain of what fluids they can take with them or how much of it .	-3.9883
So it is no surprise that the greatest amount of liquids banned from TSA seized are the items .	-4.2151
For a while , people thought that TSA could see books as smuggling .	-2.5846
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .	-1.4778
Elon Musk doesn 't care : tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel orders .	-2.2684
Electro-thousand sassa Elon Musk is happy to give a huge number of preorder for his new Tesla " Model 3 " .	-4.3159
He has hitherto suggested that some of the clients have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation .	-3.9801
In addition to the always triumphant figures on revenue increases and even more massive sales targets , Tesla Chairman Elon Musk betrayed another , less glamorous number for the first time in announcing the latest quarterly balance : the cancellation of the new Mass Market Model 3 .	-6.3171
In recent months , Musk has often promoted more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car , whose delivery is beginning .	-4.2842
Now Musk admits : 63,000 of the 518,000 pre-orders have already been withdrawn .	-3.2522
Critics repeatedly pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations .	-3.1209
In case of cancellation , Tesla will return the $ 1000 ( in the USA $ 1000 and $ 1000 in the UK ) " Reservation payment " entirely .	-6.2132
Currently there are 455,000 non-binding reservations , Musk granted a telephone conference with analysts .	-3.3068
However , the Tesla chief does not believe that the cancellation of roughly twelve percent of all orders could be a problem .	-4.2419
His argument is that the challenge of ambitious growth targets is not demand , but on the production side .	-3.0580
Last year Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles .	-1.3087
In 2018 , all models combined - 500,000 will be , in 2020 , one million .	-3.1987
The demand for this is obviously there .	-1.6699
According to Musk , there are currently 1800 reservations per day .	-1.4110
Anyone who orders a " Model 3 " today can expect extradition at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive its brand new production routes , which have never been tested in practice , without any major interruptions .	-6.1035
Many experts doubt that this is possible .	-7.8191
If there is a major delay , the non-binding reservation could become a problem for Tesla .	-3.9148
Because then the company will not be able to prevent dissatisfied customers from running away in droves .	-5.1704
EPA Chief Pruitt is withdrawing from delaying Obama Era ’ s rules to reduce emissions .	-3.5584
One day after being sued by 15 states , Scott Pruitt , the head of the Environmental Protection Agency , took back his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules to reduce emissions of smog .	-12.6798
Pruitt presented the change when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administrations .	-3.3723
He did not mention the complaint that had been raised against his previous office in a federal appeal court .	-3.6034
It is a time limit that was scheduled for states on 1 October to meet the 2015 standards for ground-level ozone .	-3.1340
In June , Pruitt announced that he would delay compliance by one year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid ' interfering in local decisions or impeding economic growth ' .	-3.3165
Pruitt , who was Oklahoma ’ s Public Prosecutor before he was appointed President Donald Trump , has long been a reliable opponent of stricter environmental rules .	-3.4496
Since his arrival in Washington , Pruitt has repeatedly resisted or delayed regulations that the chemical industry and fossil fuel industry oppose .	-3.1823
The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the recent legal setback for the Pruitts regulatory rollback agenda .	-1.7648
Last month , a federal appeal court in Washington decided that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority by attempting to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration that committed oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks .	-3.1659
In a statement published on Wednesday evening , Pruitt proposed that its turnaround in ozone standards simply reinforce the EPA ’ s willingness to cooperate with the states through the complex process of complying with the new standards in good time .	-4.1740
" Under previous administrations , the EPA has often failed to meet the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be charged by activist groups and others , and to set the deadline for implementation in an agreement , " said Pruitt , who sued the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job .	-4.6081
" We do not believe in judicial regulation , and we take deadlines seriously .	-2.3092
We also take the law and the authority that exists to us seriously ' .	-2.5197
Nevertheless , the opinion of the EPA said that at some point Pruitt will use its ' delay authority and all other legally available powers ' to ensure that the rules ' are based on sound policies and the best available information ' . . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-12.2565
Congressional Republicans urge a broader recast of the ozone rules .	-2.7624
A bill approved last month is to delay implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .	-2.2448
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate .	-1.4367
The New York Public Prosecutor Eric Schneiderman , who headed the coalition of the states that sued the EPA this week , said that the Group intends to maintain legal pressure .	-3.4167
" The reversal of the EPA - after our complaints - is an important gain for health and safety from these 6.7 million New Yorks and over 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog flooding into their communities , " said Schneiderman .	-4.1561
New York joined California , Connecticut , Delaware , Illinois , Iowa , Maine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Pennsylvania , Rhode Island , Vermont , and Washington and the District of Columbia .	-2.1635
Soil ozone arises when pollutants from cars , power stations , oil refineries , chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere respond to sunlight .	-2.9386
The emerging smog can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups , and contribute to thousands of premature deaths every year .	-3.0735
Public healthcare representatives and environmentalists celebrated surprising changes in course over Pruitts .	-3.8103
" It is worrying how much pressure it takes to get this sensible step from the responsible for protecting the air we breathe , " said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity .	-3.5886
" We must continue to fight the Trump administration ’ s ideological crusade to attract polluters and their particular interests . "	-8.5972
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church	-1.9054
750 years of St. Hilarius Church : On the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church , the old cemetery area in Tumlingen is invited to a serenade on Sunday 16 July .	-3.5779
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historic St. Hilarius complex is a popular place to stay .	-3.9488
Visitors of the sixth Benefiz Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place .	-2.9005
The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village made the friends and promoters of Tumlingen their concern .	-3.7443
Walter Martini emphasizes : " It is a unique village dress " .	-2.4143
In 1267 the St. Hilarius Chapel was first mentioned in the Württembergische Urkundenbuch : Graf Hermann von Sulz sold " the mountain with the parish church to Tumlingen and the Vogtei " to Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver .	-4.4909
According to the text of the document , in the Tumlinger Mountain , apart from the former parish church , there was also a dominant court of which the church or the patronage law belonged and not the other way round .	-6.5214

Association wants to test the approval of wind wheels	-2.6624
" Boisheim resists " does not see any legal requirement for construction and has therefore turned to the Landrat Council .	-4.4394
Landrat Andreas Coenen ( CDU ) has called on the Boisheim Association to withdraw its authorisation for the establishment of planned wind turbines in Boisheim ’ s net .	-4.7139
It was done unlawfully .	-2.3380
The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 , no wind turbines could have been approved in Boisheimer 's Nette , because at the time in Viersen , only a wind power concentration zone existed at the city border with Schwalmtal .	-5.3050
Within this concentration zone , the construction and operation of wind energy plants are possible in principle , while at the same time the concentration zone does not allow wind power to be excluded for the rest of the city .	-6.1154
Such zones should prevent the landscape from saving .	-3.6094
The city of Viersen had decided on a second concentration of wind power in the Boisheimer Nette just a few days earlier , although it had not approved the Düsseldorf district government because of a form error .	-6.2890
" Due to the lack of a planning requirement , the authorisation certificate granted remains unlawful and therefore also to be withdrawn , " said Christoph Erkens , Chairman of " Boisheim resists " .	-5.5961
The current state of affairs : before the summer break the city council decided again the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette ; an authorisation of the district government is still pending .	-6.5853
Erkens : " This means that the granting of authorisation for the establishment of wind power plants is excluded from planning law at this point . "	-5.4431
The circle confirms receipt of the invitation .	-7.7426
" The corresponding letters were received at the Viersen circle last week " , said a speaker .	-3.7962
The circle takes it as an opportunity to review the matter .	-2.4358
They are not likely to lead to a halt to the procedure .	-3.4602
With regard to ongoing procedures in the administrative court , the circle on Thursday did not want to express its opinion on the content of the Boisheim ass.	-13.0893
The NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , plans to build four wind wheels of 200 metres on a surface of Boisheim Nette .	-4.5884
Last year , the company , in which the city of Viersen is directly involved , had signed inspection contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of terrain .	-4.7795
With the establishment of the four wind energy plants , the electricity demand of around 11 400 households will be able to be met - roughly one fifth of the electricity requirements of all four-sensitive households .	-5.8224
NEW Re wants to invest some EUR 20 million .	-2.1995
Last summer , Viersen ’ s city council gave the green light to buy three wind turbines at the Linnich wind farm at Aachen and to participate in a wind energy plant in <unk>bach-Palenberg in the Heinsberg district .	-4.7597

City and dealers plan " Home-Shopping " weekends	-4.4118
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region are to rediscover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September .	-3.9082
The Gewerbeverein and the city administration want to take advantage of the weekend on 8 and 9 September to attract the inhabitants to the shopping centre .	-5.4438
As the chairman of the trade association , Christian König , announced , the " home shopping " weekend is supposed to raise awareness of the offers offered by its own city beyond the usual supermarket goods .	-5.8774
So there is a plan for a market with regional providers , similar to the weekly market .	-3.5226
In addition , local companies will be presenting themselves with their training places .	-3.5951
The shops of the city centre are also invited to the " Midnight shopping " .	-4.5300
The action is not only aimed at residents of the city and the nearest region .	-4.3091
In preparation are advertising spots in the radio , an Internet video and printed bags pointing out the action weekend , Christian King said .	-3.5757
City administration and trade associations cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .	-2.8284
Thus , the Gewerbeverein and the city go into another stage of the project " Attractive City " .	-5.0615
This includes new offers such as the first " Active Day " to the Brunnenfest and open Sunday for sale , talks with all traders and hosts to get them to participate actively .	-6.4117
Also attractive offers on Saturday and the waiver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept . .	-11.1222
In addition , customer potential should be re-developed or re-opened .	-3.4940
These include cure guests and tourists .	-2.0137
But many locals would have lost sight of the city when shopping .	-3.2313
In the end , everyone would have to contribute to bringing the city to life - to landlords , the farms of the whole city and associations .	-6.4374
In the spring , King said .	-4.4218
Birgit Streich , head of the IHK Center in Mühlhausen , announced that the third " home shopping " day , the first time five Thuringian cities participated .	-4.9793
Besides Bad Langensalza these are Weimar , Sömmerda , Holy City and Bleicherode .	-2.9250
The day should ' advertise for the valuation of local trade and emphasise its importance to the common good of our cities ' , says Street .	-9.6676
The action under the auspices of the IHK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen with his or her purchasing behaviour can influence his or her direct environment .	-4.4101

Trump put pressure on Mexico , after leaked telephone calls , to pay the border wall , for Mexico .	-4.2541
Transcripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .	-2.0302
On January 27 , Trump , in a telephone call to Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto , called on him to stop publicly saying that he would not pay for a planned border wall .	-9.7060
The US president shouted him for publicly denouncing the wall , according to reports he said to him : ' You cannot say that to the press . '	-5.1141
Trump launched his presidential campaign , promising to build a wall on the southern border of the US , and swore to pay Mexico for the project .	-3.6596
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and unveiled a tense exchange .	-2.3338
Mr. Trump said to Mr Turnbull that trafficking for the US would be ' ridiculous ' , ' mies ' and ' stupid ' for refugees emigrating to Australia , and that the insistence on trade brought by the Obama administration would make him look like a ' Depp ' after proposing a ban on the relocation of refugees to the US .	-5.6950
Mr. Trump ended the call after Mr Turnbull said ' this is the most unpleasant call for the whole day ' .	-3.8919
Moore ’ s Ford Massacre : Activists revive racist lynchack as a call for justice .	-8.0622
A 1948 Ford Mercury went through a group of spectators in rural Monroe , Georgia , and rushed to the Ford bridge of Moore .	-3.5143
Before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver could reach the bridge , a group of white men with guns emerged to block his way .	-2.9320
The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man in a needle-strip suit - took a long train on his cigar and looked examinedly through the windscreen .	-12.7330
Inside the occupants flourished in fear .	-3.0801
" We want this n ---- r Roger ! " broke the man .	-2.6496
'Get it out of the car ! '	-2.2610
Cries torn the silence when a young black man was crushed by the front-passenger seat .	-2.9605
Fortunately , this terrible scene , which was played on 22 July , is only one postponement .	-3.0686
But when a snake is thrown around the neck by " Roger " , almost everyone in the audience was very real .	-12.1538
Since 2005 , civil rights activists have returned to the Moore 's Ford Bridge to imitate the night when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by Ku Klux Klan in 1946 .	-3.8214
Nobody has ever been accused of murdering .	-2.2587
" It is truly incomprehensible that in all these years not a single person has been arrested - although we see them in our communities , although we know who they are , " said Tyrone Brooks , who helps to organize the reproduction .	-5.1164
'It is a dirt spot in a story , but it is a burden on our souls ' .	-2.3306
Brooks is a former congressional member of the state of Georgia and a life of civil rights activists .	-3.2640
For him , the adjustment serves as a dramatic call for action and constitutes an annual memory of the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected .	-3.4907
" We want prosecution , we want an end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we need to get justice , " he said .	-3.2056
'We cannot get healing and reconciliation until we get justice ' .	-2.5620
A medical court lays down a squeeze on the body of one of the victims of the Moore Ford Lynchen on July 27 , 1946 .	-5.5459
According to FBI files received by the NBC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the lynch process .	-2.6749
But no one has ever been charged .	-2.2073
Although the suspects have remained free for decades , civil rights activists say that the double motivation for lynch actions has always been known throughout the city : politics and sex .	-4.1818
In April 1946 , a Supreme Court ruling allowed the Black citizens of Georgia to vote for the first time in the pre-election campaign in the summer .	-3.3629
About at the same time as the election staged , according to the FBI of Roger Malcom , a white landlord , Barnett Hester , during a struggle - supposedly because of a woman .	-12.6126
Brooks said that the rumor in the city was that Hester slept with Malcom ’ s wife Dorothy , and that the baby she carried was not from her husband .	-3.0445
On July 25 , 1946 , Loy Harrison , a prominent white land owner , paid $ 600 to free Malcom from prison , according to the FBI .	-2.8481
He was accompanied by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey to prison .	-2.2587
But when they moved away from prison and approached Moore 's Ford Bridge , a lynchmob surrounded the car .	-3.3887
" As it turns out , it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murders , " concludes an FBI report .	-2.4528
" It is also obvious that there was a plot between state and local prosecution , which was not only involved in the murders , eliminated evidence and concealed the identity of witnesses ' .	-3.8585
Brooks put it even more concise .	-2.7001
" It was an electoral massacre , " he said .	-1.4007
'You have all been killed to send a message to black people in this community : ' If you register and when you vote , that will happen to you here ' .	-3.1941
For almost a decade , Cassandra Greene led the annual reconstruction of Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murders .	-3.0127
Their presentation is illustrative , intriguing and is based in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe is no longer in America .	-5.2251
It is hard to watch and watch out even more difficult , but Greene said that this is the point .	-3.1596
" We do not want to talk about lynching , because we are confronted with its ugly , " she said .	-3.1927
" But I cannot build a relationship with you if you do not want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have gone through " .	-3.7049
The samples for this year 's production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest of black - were pushing into a room and listening when Greene launched a good overview of the piece .	-4.9392
Wade Marbaugh is here Greenes co-director .	-1.2802
He has played the role of chief clan member for years , but he said that the role would never be easier .	-2.8562
" I feel dirty because I am not so , " said Marbaugh .	-1.8321
'But I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return at this time ' .	-2.8784
On the other side of the room , the actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona , who played Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester , tried their lines .	-2.9474
The piece begins with Malcom , who attacks and pushes him , angry that he slept with his wife Dorothy .	-4.0062
'I said , n -- he , disappear from my property ! '	-1.8053
Rascona responds the fire .	-2.1987
There is a break .	-0.6749
And then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks into laughter .	-2.4082
Greene laughs loudest .	-1.1623
" What ? " asked Rascona .	-1.3620
It is alarmed and confused .	-0.9221
Was I too hard ?	-0.8177
" No " , Greene said , still cherning .	-3.4583
'I simply do not believe that white people at the time ' n -- he said ' .	-2.8591
" But , " one of the other black actors weighed .	-4.1443
'You just have to meet the hard ' R. ' .	-1.9524
This is where the energy shifts in the room , and a sense of comradeship replaces the unease .	-12.0450
Everyone is busy getting this right , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four people killed .	-3.1126
The scene is beginning again .	-8.7347
This time , when Rascona says the N-word , he says it sharply and forcefully .	-2.6489
Absolutely no one laughs .	-1.2276
This repetition ends violently and quickly .	-1.7609
There are cries , shots and then silence .	-1.6806
A woman clothed with a dress stands above the corpses of the actors and performs Billie Holiday 's grim lobe " Strang Fruit " .	-5.4913
Your vote will break with every second word .	-2.6909
About a hundred metres behind it , a group of about four dozen spectators is blending sweat and tears from the eyes .	-10.4209
The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white .	-1.6125
A couple arrived from Ithaca , New York , to see the performance , many come down only the street .	-3.4532
They have experienced pressing moisture every eight hours of Georgia , when Brooks leads them to the tombs of Malcoms and Dorseys on a pilgrimage .	-12.0248
Up to this point , the murders have remained an anecdote , but now , when you stand on the same land where the lynch murders took place , the air feels spectacular .	-4.9327
When the last notes of the song finish , Greene invites the amount to come closer and inspect the body name .	-12.5444
Children stock their heads , register the fake blood and the quiet body and whisper each other .	-3.8177
" They are not really dead " , murmur a little boy as if he would remember it .	-3.4337
After a few minutes , Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it is over .	-2.3511
The actors discard the lynch ropes and wipe out their tears .	-3.2975
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh , the man suited to the clan member .	-2.6991
Nick Rascona embraces two of his players and then breaks together in their poor , the emotional burden of performance eventually breaks through with him .	-4.4574
" It is okay " , whisper one of the women .	-2.0817
" We know that this is not your heart .	-1.8538
You did so for one reason ' .	-1.6189
Later , the audience consists of actors for dinner .	-3.0087
On a table , a white couple from Atlanta stimulates the adjustment with a black pair that they have just met .	-5.0895
Denise Duplinski fighted to find words that leave the performance feeling .	-4.0702
" It is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like you and who do that because they look like you , " she said .	-3.2171
" What really does with me allows me to believe that the lynching continues , " she added , " today it is called only police shooting . "	-5.2869
In the same space , Tyrone Brooks holds court at his table , eating and reminding civil rights .	-3.5004
He said he has already started planning the performance next year .	-2.3549
" The adjustment is somewhat inspiring , because it describes the horror of what we have bestowed , but it is also a moment of learning , " he said .	-3.9833
" It is the case if we do not learn anything from it , then it can happen again .	-3.8654

Great applause for the Festival Orchestra , which appears on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat again in empty leisure clothing .	-5.5308
The appearance of Frank Castorf and his team of directors was expected with excitement .	-2.5173
In 2013 , if he had to get a slick pipe concert , five years later , there was big cheer , undergoing the singular " Buh " calls .	-9.2518
Head of Festival Katharina Wagner should have been pleased about this .	-3.2148
" You notice that the audience had grown up with the " ring " in a way , " she said just before the performance of the dpa .	-12.2399
The audience has not only made a form of peace with Castorf , but it has also grown an understanding of its vision .	-10.6718

In the end , the decision was clear : in the case of two votes against , the Council of Fluorn-Winzeln decides to establish a Community space in the future senior residential complex .	-5.4361
Prior to the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase contract is signed for the part that is still missing , Mayor Bernhard Tjaden reports .	-5.1259
Although it will take some time for the area belonging to the church community to date to be in community possession , there is no longer any planning obstacle to the project to be conducted by a private investor .	-7.0101
There is a discussion on a common area for that purpose .	-2.7742
One of the two investors who are still on boat has offered to come to the municipality .	-3.1068
On the ground floor it would provide a living area - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with an area of 70 square meters for a special price .	-3.9219
The administration and the majority of the councils propose that such a common area should not be provided as a meeting place only for the residents of the senior resident , but openly entered into the community .	-7.3174
As an example , the word " Strickcafé " made the round .	-3.1395
The decision , which was decided by providing funds for the current budget as early as last autumn , is sweetened by opportunities for funding .	-5.2168
The building is located in the renovation area .	-2.5696
The establishment of a common area , Tjaden reports , would be eligible for 60 % of 30 % .	-3.8821

Walk from star to star in the resin of Stern .	-12.0995
The first " Star Trail " is to be established in Harz .	-4.6007
This is the plan of the association Sternwarte Sankt Andreasberg .	-2.7100
There is a planetary route in Göttingen - since 2003 .	-2.3475
A " star path " meets the needs of many visitors of medicine .	-4.5513
It combines nature , science , movement and sports performance .	-1.8729
Members want to set up tables along the planned route and inform them about stars and constellations .	-4.1134
In a first phase until 2018 , the association plans " well accessible installations at five to six places " in Oberharz .	-4.2263
St. Andreasberg , Braunlage , Hohegeiss and Sieber would be questioned .	-5.0946
The information on the table should be supplemented via the Internet .	-2.6629
Therefore a good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of locations .	-4.3999
Freedom of barrier is also a criterion .	-1.1899
The train should be extended later by train .	-4.0000
" On the Star Trail , the viewers learn a lot about the physics of the individual stars " .	-5.4162
Furthermore , they learned why stars had different colors or why a star shined more than another , although it was much further away .	-5.2162
It also provides information on the constellation in which a selected star is located and when it is best to see .	-5.0998
Since 2014 , the association has been operating the highest standard stars in Northern Germany in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg .	-4.7466
According to the Federal Office for Nature Protection , the location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany .	-3.5759
From there , the Milky Way and even the Andromeda galaxy can be seen with a single eye .	-11.8113
Since 2003 , on the initiative of the Förderverein Planetarium Göttingen , there is something similar to the planned star weight - the planetary path .	-4.7713
Starting in front of Gebhard 's Hotel in the Goetheallee , which forms the interior of our solar system , the Planetenweg with its Stelen leads up to Hainberg and Sternwarte - as well as a " extraterrestrial " location in Diemarden ( municipality of equals ) with the planet Sedna .	-6.3849
The Stelen with the individual planets - including the pluto at the end point degraded to the Dwarf Planet - are precisely placed at the distance and scale of one to two billion .	-5.5015
The Earth thus shrinks to a ball of 6.5 millimetres in diameter , while the exactly 75 metres away sun measures 70 centimeters .	-4.4098
The entire distance from the planet path is four kilometres .	-3.2515
While the light from sun to pluto takes about eight hours , pedestrians need a good hour to the Stele with Pluto .	-3.2950
So pedestrians are faster than light in the space .	-11.5853
But the march for the next fixed star would take half a year .	-2.8792
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time , discuss a possible showdown .	-1.8644

They were in separate rooms in ESPN offices in Los Angeles , to Garcia , the unbeatable World Boxing Council light weight champion , down the corridor to welcome Lomachenko , the World Boxing Organization Super-Federweight champion .	-3.5449
After Garcia ’ s victory by unanimous decision on the former four-division World Champion Adrien Broner on Saturday on Showtime , both fighters are members of the top five pound-for pound list .	-4.1685
Garcia stretched out the right hand and said : " How is it going to you , Champion ?	-2.3638
I wish you good luck ' .	-1.3651
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday evening at ESPN at 7 p.	-2.4995
When the pair positioned for photos , Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas noted that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the " perfect size " .	-3.5888
" I am a former feather weight " , Garcia reminded us .	-3.0056
" I have risen for bronners [ to 140 pounds ] , but I 'm not so big .	-3.2639
I am small for 140 .	-0.8548
I want to go down on light .	-3.1576
And he must move to light weights [ 135 pounds ] and then we fight .	-2.9581
That is what the fans demand .	-1.7600
Let us give them that . '	-0.6933
Lomachenko agreed .	-0.7985
'Boxing needs this fight ' .	-1.3789
Climate asked whether it should be on pay-per-view , part of a strategy that Lomachenko must fight with a 135-pound debut this year to agree with Garcia a date next summer ( 37-0 , 30 bone outs ) , which also has interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Linares Luke Campbell after their lightweight title battle in the forum on 23 September .	-5.6644
" This battle could take place in pay-per-view mode , because all fans asked for it , " said Garcia and later openly expressed themselves fighting for the network that offers the best financial package .	-4.9443
We are the best .	-0.6193
No other names can generate this kind of attention .	-1.3183
Whenever they are ready ... '	-1.4293
Garcia said he treasured Lomachenko as " an enormous fighter " , and he may be taking part in his Saturday battle .	-3.7429
But Lomachenko stood at the generous praise for Garcia and said that he thought the tri-campaign champion from Riverside looks " very slow , sorry Mikey ... you wanted the co-out " .	-4.8563
Garcia said that the focus is to show strong , then boxes .	-3.2333
Both said they could feel the momentum built for their own battle .	-2.7871
" This is the struggle that must be conducted .	-2.4289
No other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .	-2.4343
I am more than happy to work on it , " said Garcia .	-1.6488
Lomachenko said : " I waited for the top fighters , and that is Mikey .	-1.8248
It will be a great battle . '	-1.7148
Four injured after Reifenplatz	-2.2861
Some of the four people were seriously injured on Thursday afternoon in the event of an accident on the A7 .	-3.4481
According to initial information , the driver of an Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle at 4.30 p.m. just before the port market width , probably after a tire place .	-5.3663
The car dropped to the right in the slope where it was overlooking and then stayed on the roof in the green strip .	-6.3835
The four inmates - two adults and two children - were partly seriously injured in the event of an accident .	-2.4793
During the initial supply of the injured by the rescue service , the A7 was closed to the north for about one hour , then the traffic on the left-hand road at the accident centre was passed .	-5.3543
Fortunas Hoffmann : ' Triple chain works better '	-1.5759
After 2 : 2 , Andre Hoffmann hopes to optimize the defense formation in Aue Points against Braunschweig .	-4.2602
Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the first season match , with the result too , if the two opponents had not been in the 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .	-5.5773
" These were two opponents too much , and we need to be even better aware of them " , says the defender of Fortuna Düsseldorf .	-4.6401
The triple chain is to be further optimized in the Archgebirge .	-4.0153
And a gateway for free wants to get rid of the tunnels .	-4.9069
'For the future it will be that no one will stand alongside Michael ( Rensing ) . '	-4.1309
Hoffmann is convinced that his team can cope better after the experience of preparing the triple chain than with the four-chain .	-4.6674
" I don 't know how we will act in Aue , " says his coach Friedhelm Funkel , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause " because we have semi-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gie<unk>elmann players that can build well , " said Hoffmann .	-4.7672
'It is necessary , but that we harmonise even better and that we do not make so many mistakes in the construction ' .	-5.6744
Of course , Hoffmann also goes to the eye to win the game .	-3.5426
" Whether you can speak of a lack of decisions does not know .	-5.3190
The achievement could well be okay , " said Hoffmann .	-3.7561
'However , if we are on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the popal , we will certainly be able to talk about a proper start to the season ' .	-5.6036
His coach did not want to know anything about that .	-3.0129
" I judge the start of the season only after six to eight days of play , " said Friedhelm Funkel , who does not want to speak of an advantage over Aue , just because the game of Saxony in Heidenheim had to be broken prematurely because of a storm .	-4.8638
" Now they can start the season almost with a home game , " said Funkel and Hoffmann , that players from the eye may even be a little more fresher because they would not have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against an ascent favorite in the bone .	-5.9215
" But they do not know 100-percent where they currently stand , " says the interior defender of Fortuna .	-2.8968
While guests from the Rhineland go to the meeting in the final ( almost ) finished stadium of Aue as a lighter favorite on Sunday .	-4.8756
" The fact that we are pushing them away simply because we are entitled to come under the first six is bloodshed , " says Funkel , whose balance sheet is very positive in the event of a defeat against the eye of nine games .	-6.4804
" There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga to beat from the beginning " , explains Fortunas Chefcoach .	-3.8472
'To make such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant ' .	-1.8710
So Funkel certainly does not want to see his players on Sunday .	-3.7230
New results of Swedish asylum rating tests published	-2.7493
Recent tests of asylum seekers in Sweden , subject to a new method of medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 % of those tested are over 18 years old , but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .	-4.0986
The Swedish Authority for Forensic Medicine ( Rattle Medicine ) has begun to carry out the tests last .	-4.7982
During the asylum procedure , they should make the assessment of age more accurate after the Swedish migration authority ( migration vehicle ) was criticised for mistakes in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were under-age .	-5.7327
To date , migration verification has sent 6,880 cases to test , and the Forensic Medicine Agency has released a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to July 31 , 2017 .	-3.9081
Eighty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in other 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the person was " possibly 18 years or older " .	-2.9194
In 432 cases , the conclusion was that the person is ' possibly under 18 years old ' .	-2.4714
The tests will only be carried out in cases where the age of the person is called into question .	-2.6270
According to Johan Goransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency , the results have been constant in recent months .	-2.4613
" We see no great difference in the statistics of recent months , the numbers are fairly constant , " he said The Local magazine .	-3.1723
The high proportion of cases in which the person was judged over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has lied above his age .	-10.3294
In May , the agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases proposing ' that the investigated person be 18 years or older ' .	-3.4126
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladt examined the 581 results published , it found that in 243 of these cases , the person had frankly said that it was 18 years old this year .	-4.2038
The method of medical assessment , X-ray images of wisdom teeth and MRT images of knee joints , which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists , has also been criticised in some areas .	-4.0960
One skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute , whose work includes the assessment of human biological maturity to see whether they were usually passed through puberty sooner or later .	-4.2377
" I had reason to think about it , and I do not believe that the type of measurement should be used .	-2.7302
To judge biological age in this way is very uncertain .	-2.6602
If we cannot say it safely , we should not act as if we could , " he said the newspaper Metro .	-2.6996
Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of the tests : " In general , you can say that the risk of misjudging a child as adults is low .	-15.2102
The greatest risk is that if the person is just under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 % . '	-9.7273

Work on the three bridges of the road 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well .	-2.5773
On Wednesday a seven tonnes of heavy concrete component was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach .	-10.2013

In the southern part of the bridge a 2.20 metres wide bridge cap will be used on Friday .	-4.0714
The pedestrian route should then be followed .	-3.6268
The particular thing is that these are finished parts , a patent of the Schramberger company Dizwo .	-4.2346
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps .	-1.5143
The laying of lines through the structure in Lauterbach has required particular sensitivity .	-5.3120
There is also a fibre cable , to which many companies are connected .	-4.4533
The inhabitants were informed about the project in advance of the work by hand papers .	-4.6449
Furthermore , fish and cancer had to be fished first .	-2.9533

He said that he is sorry for ' all athletes who have been snapped away in competitions of gold and silver medals ' .	-3.9747
Despite his comments , the IAAF Congress voted in favour of maintaining the ban imposed in November 2015 after a World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) report found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia .	-3.0594
" I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , " said IAAF President Coe to the reporters .	-1.9677

Coe said that he was also ' pleased ' about Russia accepting the criteria for its reintroduction .	-2.7676
" I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress has been made , but Congress supports the recommendations of the task force that this is not the time to reinstate Russia , " said Coe .	-3.1020
" We must do everything in the coming months to normalise this situation .	-2.4008
The guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate clean athletes from the spoiled system , " he added , " he added .	-3.3862

Prime Minister Weil wants rapid re-election	-1.6068
CDU and FDP before a possible majority in Lower Saxony	-1.6675
Lower Saxony ’ s Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) , after the loss of the red-green majority , is in favour of a rapid re-election of the country , but he does not want to resign . , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-8.7850
Because on Friday , Parliament 's dissolution was in favour .	-3.1305
Previously , the surprising withdrawal of a Green MEP from her country group in Lower Saxony had overthrown Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) ’ s government into a sever.	-3.7831
Five months before the official date of the national election , the red and green coalition in Hanover lost its narrow one-vote majority in Parliament to the opposition from CDU and FDP .	-3.9590
Previous Green MEP Elke Twesten justified her step with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg ( worship ) .	-4.3798
" I see my political future in the CDU " , she explained on Friday in Hanover .	-2.0003
CDU Group head Björn Thümler recommends to his group that they be included .	-3.4526
This means that CDU and FDP , together with 69 seats in Lower Saxony , SPD and Green , would have 68 seats .	-4.1836
So far , the relationship has been the opposite .	-2.0937
The new day will be elected regularly on 14 January next year .	-2.6817
Thümler said that the red-green government now has to decide whether to rule further in this situation without a majority .	-3.8608
However , Stephan Weil considers it essential for the country to decide its self-resolution as quickly as possible .	-4.1196
The CDU Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .	-2.4175
The national constitution also provides for the possibility that the country ’ s day will withdraw trust to the Prime Minister and elect a successor .	-5.1455
" Our Constitution offers several options .	-1.5456
These possibilities must be checked clearly by law , " said Thümler .	-3.2386
'You will discuss all questions when they are legally reasonable . '	-4.8289
Thümler called Twesten step " rather curious " .	-3.3339
The politician himself emphasised : " I am not a traitor .	-3.3749
I feel very good ' .	-1.3990
She was a supporter of Black Green .	-2.4975
The Greens called on the dissenting Members to return their country 's mandate .	-2.9517
" We assume , of course , that she returns with immediate effect her land-day mandate through the green list , " said Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner .	-4.8816
The Group Chairman of the Greens , Anja Piel , said : ' We extremely regret the decision taken by Elke Twest ' .	-3.6080
You have deliberately chosen not to have a debate in the group .	-2.7455
'Even against the background that there were no differences in content , we cannot understand this step ' .	-3.4529
SPD candidate Martin Schulz condemns the transfer of the Lower Saxon Green MEP Elke Twesten to the CDU as betrayal .	-2.9784
" The behaviour of former Green MEPs in Lower Saxony is not only betrayal to voters , but also betrayal of red green , " the head of the Social Democrats wrote on Facebook on Friday .	-3.7004
He supports Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) ’ s decision to quickly re-elect the country .	-2.4735
The Twesten exit costs the majority of the Green Red Green in Lower Saxony .	-3.3696
The politician " in her injured vanity and in her frustration their personal interests before the well-being of the country , " criticized SPD Secretary-General Hubertus Heil .	-4.0668
" It is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony is participating in this dirty intrigue game and is trying to beat political capital . "	-4.4162
Lower Saxony ’ s CDU Group head , Björn Thümler , will recommend to his MEPs that Elke Twesten be included in the CDU .	-3.6823
The head of the SPD in Bundestag , Thomas Opermann , accused Twesten of falsifying the country ’ s 2013 election with personal career memory .	-4.4921

Agriculture Minister in the interview - How do we protect ourselves against poisoners , Mr Schmidt ?	-2.6605
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs .	-0.9112
How could the scandal happen ?	-1.4347
How can consumers protect themselves .	-1.1824
Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt ( CSU ) is interviewing with the editorial network Germany ( RND ) .	-2.7191
Mr Schmidt , how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs ?	-1.6551
I can only encourage all consumers to look closely at the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp print .	-2.7406
On the consumer protection portal www.Food Warnung.de , the Federal Länders provide the latest information on the egg charges concerned .	-4.9184
Subject eggs should be destroyed or returned .	-1.9332
Even if , after everything we know at the moment , there is virtually no health risk .	-10.8016
Does Aldi now take the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of offer - because the Federal Agriculture Minister 's central role is not really fulfilled ?	-3.8090
Food surveillance is a matter for the federal states .	-2.0672
Nevertheless , my house has opened up immediately and has been in close consultation with the authorities of the countries since it became known that Germany is affected .	-5.1642
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers .	-1.6309
Trade , like manufacturers , must ensure that products sold are transport and safe to health .	-3.8636
If the residue limit of 0.005mg / kg for eggs is exceeded , these are not traffic .	-4.7365
Uncontaminated eggs can , however , be sold and consumed .	-2.4834
This time , the farms are not to blame .	-1.8932
Are manufacturing companies and consumers in the same boat ?	-10.7712
According to current knowledge , production factories are not directly responsible .	-2.9523
Instead , they must expect economic damage because of supposedly illegal practices by service companies .	-4.0874
As always , there are too few controllers in the event of an emergency .	-2.8519
Does it only lack consistent personnel or competence ?	-4.1340
It was exactly the official controls that revealed the process .	-3.9582
The truth , however , is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded 100 % .	-2.2620
It is precisely for this reason that consistent information on such events and transfer to public prosecutors is crucial in cases where crimes can be committed .	-4.9239
I have already made it clear on several occasions that I expect the responsible authorities to be fully informed .	-2.9028
Is regular alarmism in food scandals really necessary ?	-1.4186
Consumers have the right to have safe and transport only .	-2.8098
If an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly indignant .	-2.9428
The adjusted means mean that manufacturers , traders and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not .	-4.6222
In principle , it must be clear that the illegal use of insecticide fipronil in the attitude of life-supplying animals is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately .	-4.7381
This must be done consistently and with great pressure at all levels .	-2.7222
I expect all the competent authorities to bring the matter up quickly and completely .	-3.6451
The impact of the football ’ s financial rules on Neymar ’ s move to Paris on Neymar ’ s move to Neymar	-4.0396
The rules aimed at preventing unhindered expenditure from European football clubs will not disturb Neymar ’ s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to French Paris-Saint Germain .	-3.3385
Some consequences will still come for UEFA Paris Saint-Germain , because the leading organization monitoring the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions-League tournament .	-4.4641
Financial fair play rules , launched by UEFA in 2011 , mean that PSG will eventually have to prove that Neymar ’ s transfer was financed without great losses .	-3.8047
Barcelona has paid EUR 222 million ( $ 262 million ) to buy the Brazilian out of its treaty , and Neymar will receive a salary of $ 10 million a year .	-2.6743
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar ’ s move to France .	-1.4712
PSG can certainly make money easier for Neymar to sign and bring him to a galaxy of other stars , given the financing of the team through the energy-rich family of Qatar .	-4.8819
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on purchasing players , but they need to counter with legitimate revenue sources that allow them to use the Break Even point in their football business .	-5.9609
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA president in 2007 .	-2.1289
The former French player believed that clubs that had taken on huge debt in their quest for success were effectively cheating and risking ruining when banks or owners withdrawn their support .	-4.2165
In 2011 , FFP shifted from focusing on club debt to monitoring its losses .	-2.2863
The change meant that the business model originally used by Roman Abramovich in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a tougher business .	-3.9964
During the current three-year FFP period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million .	-3.1309
And , while Platini has fallen into disgnant from the presidency in 2015 , his UEFA successor , Aleksander Ceferin , continues to work to deter excessive spending .	-4.0899
" Certainly , FFP is not dead and we will certainly strengthen the rules for the future , " said Andrea Traverso , who is responsible for FFP at UEFA , to The Associated Press last week .	-3.4643
Although the PSG has paid the Neymar buy-out clause in a flat rate , it can distribute the amount for accounting for the duration of its contract .	-3.6747
Neymar signed a five-year contract so that the replacement sum can be expelled for the next five years in the amount of EUR 44.4 million in the annual accounts .	-4.5097
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 , together with Abu Dhabi , owned by Manchester City , hit the PSG with the most severe sanctions .	-2.9409
The PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million ( then $ 82 million ) , which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players .	-4.6620
UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to overrun their financial supervision by floating their revenue from companies associated with club owners .	-5.5865
While a Catarian company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsorship exceeded standard market rates , UEFA would not consider this to be a legitimate income .	-3.5003
This was exactly what happened in 2014 , when the UEFA decided that the value of PSA sponsorship was bloated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .	-2.9849
It has been reported that some of the PSG payments to Neymar on payments from the World Cup 2022 could be in Qatar .	-3.6652
But PSG and Qatar 2022 denied that Neymar will become WM ambassadors , and that such manoeuvres could easily be found out for UEFA regulators .	-3.7139
Previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules .	-2.3355
UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG on Neymar ’ s transfer , saying on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .	-3.5785
They spoke with The Associated Press on condition of anonymity , as they were not able to discuss the PSG situation .	-2.6399
The recent reports show that PSG achieved a profit of more than EUR 10 million in 2015 / 16 with a turnover of EUR 542.4 million .	-3.6934
The accounts for the last fiscal year have yet to be published .	-9.5145
PSG expects Neymar ’ s arrival to be a blessing for sponsoring deals , merchandising , and tricot sales .	-2.3186
The association expects sales to rise by at least 30 percent after the signing .	-2.6979
The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players going , and it tried to prevent Neymar ’ s departure by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP .	-3.5795
" It is a clear case of " financial doping " with the club and the state , " said the President of La League , Javier Tebas , the Spanish daily AS with regard to Qatar 's ultimate ownership of PSG .	-2.9989
Arsenal-Manager Arsene Wenger , whose association is owned by an American sports tycoon , shares the reservations of La League against a state that finances an association .	-3.2635
" It is the consequence of ownership and this has completely changed the entire football landscape over the last 15 years , " said Wenger on Thursday .	-2.9454
" As soon as a country has a club , everything is possible .	-2.3232
It will be very difficult to respect financial fair play because you can go down different paths or have different interests when a country has such a large player to represent a country . '	-4.2838

Now sweet cooperation is coming to an end : the airline rewrites the order .	-3.6968
Swiss-Speaker Meike Fuhlrott confirmed at the request of the news agency sda a a corresponding report from the newspaper " Northwest Switzerland " on Friday .	-3.4975
According to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .	-1.5696

About 17 million small , red-white choggitables distribute 14 grams per year the flight pets to passengers before landing .	-5.5959
The cost was not what the Swiss wanted to give .	-11.3111
Industry insiders estimate the volume of orders according to " Northwestern Switzerland " to 1.5 to 2 million francs - the Migros daughter generates annual sales of around one billion francs .	-5.1821
But , once and for all , the advertising effect is more important : it is a prestigious order for a Schoggie manufacturer .	-4.7238
Swiss does not want to betray how many applicants there are in the new invitation to tender .	-3.1842
However , only Swiss manufacturers are eligible .	-3.2742
According to the newspaper report , Chocolat Frey intends to seek to renew the Treaty beyond the spring of 2018 .	-2.9708
For sda , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion .	-2.5336
Swiss has been distributing chocolate tables on board their flights since 2006 .	-2.5066
Before the Swiss concluded a contract with the Migros daughter , Barry Callebaut had supplied chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hug .	-2.8059
The possibility of placing the logo was introduced by Swiss two and a half years ago with the start of cooperation with Chocolat Frey .	-3.2240
The airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers .	-1.7531
On long-haul flights , First Class customers are pampered with delicacies by the Sprüngli Confiserie , the Business Class nache passengers Schoggi of Lindt and the Chocolat Frey Economy Class Schoggi .	-4.4548

Nostalgie goes into niche in " Wet Hot American Summer " and " Comrade Detective " .	-2.2598
This repetition of history is nostalgic at the same time because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80s , for the 90-year-old grunge era ( when the thinkers David Wain and Michael Showalter turned the Sketch comedy " The State " for MTV ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , such as Elizabeth Banks , Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd , went to major things .	-5.0689
As a cultural artifact , it is also a parody and a embodiment of our facebook-capable era of permanent memories .	-2.7040
But as a franchise it feels like time is short .	-2.4290
" First Day of Camp " worked surprisingly well , not only because of his absurd humor ( it contained an original story for a speaking vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .	-3.2049
By fueling at the heart of the gag - medium-aged actors play horny children who will grow up - they nevertheless created the impossibility of recovering the last part of the joke .	-12.7805
" Ten Years Later " , with its adults who are now playing adults , is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more according to the pottery principle , including a reef on the stalker movies of the 1990s such as " The Hand That Rocks the Cradle " ( " The Hand , which swings the cradle " ) .	-5.4879
At one point , a character floats through an Apple Powerbook , some inline skates and " a number of other things from 1991 " .	-4.2991
Many of the central stories are the same .	-0.8983
The loving Coop ( Mr. Showalter ) , now Romanauthor , has still not forgotten Katie ( Marguerite Moreau ) .	-2.7870
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost his virgin spirit .	-12.3864
And there is another crazy malicious plot involved in the Ronald Reagan ( also Mr. Showalter ) , which is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good impression of Michael Ian Black ) .	-3.3559
As always , the excursions are the best part of the franchise .	-1.5264
It is especially fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd , who shows Matt Dillon 's sublip of " singles " , whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old cracker .	-4.4941
It is the moments of random madness that could fuel this franchise like a kind of repeated " Seven Up ! " series until it reaches what I accept as its logical conclusion : " Wet Hot American Summer : Twenty Years Later " whose last scene will show the band how to visit the film premiere of " Wet Hot American Summer " .	-4.7758
" Comrade Detective " on Amazon is now reminiscent of another kind of nostalgia : the revival of the Cold War of " The Americans " , the film " Atomic Blonde " and even " GLOW " with its east-west ring iconography .	-3.6797
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as director indicates to be a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two police officers as friends , two officers from Bucharest fighting for truth , atheism and the path of Marxist Leninism .	-10.8839
Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici , whose dialogues are synchronized by Channing Tatum ( also an executive producer ) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt .	-3.2932
It is a brilliant idea .	-1.0095
But it is not much more than an idea .	-1.1360
There are some beautiful gags to reputation ( the police spend the time watching chess on television , as Americans may do with football ) .	-3.9032
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate , Nick Offerman , Mahershala Ali and Chlo<unk> Sevigny - ensures a decent game ' Find out the voice ' .	-3.0707
But Comrade Detective is so committed to the truth of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask is included - that it often plays as one .	-3.2231
At six long episodes , the comedy is not fast or frequent enough .	-4.3471
Comrade Detective , edited to a lesser length , could deliver its agitprop satire better , as Gregor and Iosef always visit the American embassy whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who swallow a pile of Hamburg .	-5.4284
The message to the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can make everything a feed for an elage .	-3.9278

Therefore , the two are probably delivered to Germany .	-3.3948
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action .	-2.2068
More than 300 police officers were in operation .	-2.8306
Mafia 's members are accused of organised crime , serious violence , attempted murder , robbery and blackmail .	-3.3450
Since summer 2016 , the Public Prosecutor has been investigating consistency against organised drug trafficking in southern Germany .	-3.2318
There was a thorough exchange between prosecutors in Constance and Palermo and the investigators of the Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .	-4.1658
Therefore , on Wednesday morning , four officials from Palermo accompanied the great effort .	-3.3756
In the vision of the investigations , Italian nationals in particular drew close reference to the Italian mafia .	-4.4343
Another incident in Hüfingen on May 27 , when several shots were fired in a restaurant early in the morning , is likely to go to the band 's account .	-4.8928
Major loopholes in the foreigner register complain of large gaps .	-3.9682
" Data of citizens who should not appear here " : according to a report , the foreigner register in Germany has significant shortcomings .	-4.0161
This leads to some serious misdecisions on asylum procedures .	-2.5495
The Federal Government ’ s Refugee Management Officer Frank-Jürgen Weirgen , according to a media report , has drawn attention to large gaps in the foreign-central register .	-4.3089
The shortcomings in the data registered there could lead to ' partly serious misdecisions ' in asylum procedures and expulsions , warned in an analysis presented by the " South German newspaper " .	-5.2932
The register states that ten million people are registered with foreign nationality , including some 5.7 million from non-EU countries .	-3.8833
So the data is managed by some 600 foreign authorities in Germany .	-2.9091
Because the data had not been adequately maintained , the quality of data in parts has not been good yet .	-4.0249
In individual cases , data was found in 1921 , ' of people who have long since stopped living or of citizens who have become German citizens and who should no longer appear in the register ' .	-5.1205
" Flawed data input can slow return processes considerably , " the report goes on .	-4.5075
Furthermore , statistics on people with travel who are travelling should cover EU citizens who do not need to leave .	-5.1057
Such false allocations , however , led ' to a distorted debate on the handling of travellers ' , so it is in analysis .	-5.4971
Meanwhile , the Federal Government seems to have begun to send refugee families with children under 16 to Italy when they arrive from there .	-4.0025
This emerges from an internal paper from the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees ( BAMF ) , the Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung reports .	-3.3883
The paper therefore states that the BAMF has returned to Italy since 1 June 2017 ' with the exception of infants and micro-child families .	-4.4066
In practice , since the end of 2014 , the newspaper referred to the difficult situation on the ground .	-3.3249
Under the Dublin Agreement , refugees from the EU State are responsible for achieving them first .	-3.5026
If a migrant travels to another EU country , that state can send it back to the country of entry .	-3.3107
As regards the explanatory statement , the Office now says : ' The absorption capacity for families with minors in Italy has significantly increased ' .	-4.9795
Italy has given guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families .	-2.4636
Even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECHR ) considers these commitments to be sufficient .	-2.1131
Other EU countries would also send refugees back there under the Dublin Agreement .	-2.2736
The internal left-wing spokesperson in the Bundestag , Ulla Yelpke , criticized this decision : ' Families with children threaten to reception conditions and threaten child welfare because of the shortcomings in the Italian asylum system ' .	-5.1733

Traditionally , at the meeting of the council , the municipality appreciates the multiple willingness to donate blood .	-3.7916
" It is brilliant how our body is designed for this , and we pay respect to the donors who make their blood available to strangers , " emphasized Mayor Kistner .	-6.1315
" One blood donation helps several people " , explained the circle head of the German Red Cross ( DRK ) , Holger Maisenbacher , because the canned are dismantled into their components .	-4.7968
Three people could benefit from donations of blood .	-3.0191
At the same time , Maisenbacher reported about the actions being carried out in Oberberichenbach in spring .	-4.4724
" This year we achieved the second best result with 114 donors , " said DRK Circle Leader .	-3.4307
Obviously , the change to the theatre house led to higher numbers a few years ago .	-3.5669
Even before that , Thomas Bockstadt , Susanne Reichle , Sandra Schöck , Thomas Reichle and Meta Umberer were multiple donations and were awarded for 50 blood donations each .	-3.3039

The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25 % .	-9.2079
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and inflation weakening have damped speculation over a rise .	-3.3425
The Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain " sluggish " when it maintained interest rates on family income in the middle of increasing pressure .	-3.1242
The Bank ’ s political decision-makers , with 6 to 2 , voted to keep interest rates to 0.25 % , with fewer members seeking a rise this month , as weak economic growth weakened support for an increase .	-15.9716
In its quarterly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts to 1.7 % in 2017 , and to 1.6 % in 2018 , warning that household pressure would continue , with inflation expected to rise to just under 3 % in the autumn .	-3.3162
But it signaled that , in the next few years , interest rate hikes would be needed to rein in Brexit ’ s fueled inflation , and it said that borrowing costs might have to rise more than expected in financial markets .	-4.1696
Members also voted to withdraw part of the Mammut stimulus package issued a year ago after Brexit .	-2.3811
It will demand time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funding for banks from next February , although it has been said that it is now being expected to contribute <unk> 15 billion more within the framework of this system - at <unk> 115 billion .	-5.3947
Minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the bank said : ' In the central forecast of the MPC , gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak in the short term , as pressure on household real incomes continues to burden consumption . '	-4.4245
On interest rates , it repeated that ' a certain tightening of monetary policy ' would be needed to cool inflation and a ' somewhat larger ' scale than markets expect .	-3.1637
Markets are currently predicting the first rise in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .	-2.7350
However , the bank stressed that increases would be ' gradual ' and ' limited ' .	-2.9721
The Bank ’ s down-adjusted growth forecasts for this year and next are compared to the 1.9 % and 1.7 % predicted in May .	-3.1764
It maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .	-1.5902
The pound fell vis-à-vis the dollar and the euro according to these news .	-2.3723
The pound fell by 0.5 % to $ 1.31 and fell by 0.4 % to EUR 1.11 .	-1.9612
The decision will not be amended after the recent disappointing growth figures have dampened expectations of an increase in interest rates , and GDP increased to 0.3 % in the second quarter of the previous three months .	-14.1474
Growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will easily recover towards the end of the year .	-2.9476
The recent inflation report did not provide much enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and slightly higher salaries , since tightening will first become worse before it improves .	-5.4062
She added that monetary policy cannot " prevent " income collapse in the next few years , but she added that wages will recover " significantly " at the end of its three-year forecast .	-4.2233
The economy is also strengthened by rising demand for British goods , owing to the weak pound , which will compensate some of the lower consumer spending .	-3.1970
The decision comes one year after lowering interest rates to 0.25 % last August following the shocking EU vote that caused the pound to fall .	-2.9124
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years to achieve full prices and the economy .	-2.6843
Before the Bank ’ s last judgment on interest rates , the call for an increase in interest rates had risen , as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households , with three policymakers demanding an increase to 0.5 % in July .	-3.9836
Last month , inflation fell from 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % , although the bank said that this was expected and will raise it again in the coming months .	-3.2986
The Bank said that exceeding the 2 % target is ' entirely ' to the pound .	-3.5438
Andrew Montlake , director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers , said : " Given the recent decline in swap rates , the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again , as creditors are looking for business loudly and want to end the year positively .	-4.8636
The market looks particularly good for those who are expiring the existing deals and closing the new mortgages , and many with toll-free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . '	-4.2608
NHS ( The National Health Service ) is supposed to prescribe 10,000 people with controversial HIV drugs .	-2.4397
Patients will receive access to " transformative " HIV prevention treatment from September after a fight before the High Court against the financing of the NHS medicine .	-4.2090
NHS England announced that a pre-exposure prophylax ( PREP ) that can reduce the risk of infection for high-risk patients by around 86 % is now supplied by the health service over a first three-year study for an estimated 10,000 people .	-4.4177
He agreed to finance the process after last year 's appeal court confirmed a Supreme Court ruling that the NHS had the power to pay for the PrEP despite the claim that local authorities should finance it .	-3.3690
The move announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England Chairman Simon Stevens as ' important new intervention ' , while the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) called this a ' decisive moment ' .	-3.4702
Sexual health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to enable people to be registered , and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced across England in April 2018 .	-3.2125
Preexposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) is a consequence of HIV drugs taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .	-2.8470
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission at risk of infection .	-1.8923
Taking PrEP before sexual intercourse means that there are enough medicines in a person 's body to prevent HIV infection .	-4.3328
Such drugs can be taken every day or two hours before sex .	-3.1373
Those who are eligible for treatment include gays or bisexual men , transsexuals and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated .	-3.3458
Clinics identify suitable participants who agree with the study , including men , women , transgenders and individuals with a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment .	-3.1623
People living in England and registered with a home doctor can also register for participation in their local participating sex clinic .	-11.3687
The program will be signed <unk> 10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply medicines this week after international competitive procurement .	-12.0003
The study is intended to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence , as targeted , absorbed and implemented on a large scale .	-4.0030
Stevens said : " This great new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .	-2.4912
It is another milestone in the progress made over three decades in dealing with one of the greatest health challenges facing humanity . ' , , , is , , , , , , , , , , ,	-10.7884
Deborah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National Aids Trust ) , said : " This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .	-2.0281
PrEP , if targeted at needy and vulnerable people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic .	-3.0913
From September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-financed attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is truly controlled individually and not subject to negotiations with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives .	-4.3885
We warmly welcome this announcement . '	-1.3154
Ian Green , Chairman of the Executive Board of Higgins Trust , said : " The priority must now be for the study to be carried out quickly throughout the country and that nobody with a risk to HIV will be left behind .	-4.3994
Now that the PrEP test medicine has been obtained , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people . '	-3.9991
Sharon Hodgson , Shadow Health Minister , said : " The beginning of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and hesitation by the government .	-3.2655
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection .	-2.7624
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP .	-2.0080
It is now important for this study to be carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country in order to protect people who are HIV infected and to help bring us closer to ending the spread of HIV in society ' .	-4.7127
Living big lives : Intermediate floor and clever designer tricks have transformed this small Earls Court apartment into a generous home .	-4.9065
Joanne Leigh , a former banker with a passion for real estate , diminished in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to an earls court apartment .	-2.5752
It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her pockets .	-3.1046
" Before that I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room " , says Joanne .	-2.4946
" I was looking for something that was comparable to my price .	-1.7660
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings .	-2.3409
I have fallen in love with them and made an offer on that day ' .	-2.5346
Since the first visit , the 1,000 square feet apartment has been completely overhauled .	-4.1961
Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to walk through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne Stauraum and an intermediate floor to make the most of the large ceiling height .	-4.6290
" I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .	-1.5213
That was my request ' she says .	-1.3284
For this purpose , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 feet high ceilings and to create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne .	-9.0261
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms together , so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor where you could stand .	-3.3876
Initiate had to think creatively to solve the preset .	-3.5451
" The steel plant is rather complicated " , he explains .	-2.3928
" We had to arrange the spaces in such a way that they were stacked with each other without us having to block .	-4.7954
It was not just a question of building a simple platform , but of creating the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . '	-4.0198
This arrangement allowed the inventor to place two rooms in full height - with a lot more drama .	-3.3070
For the intermediate floor , a classic copper light window of Retrouvius looks down the glamorous living area .	-3.5674
Mirrors of gold furniture , silver accents and Vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program .	-2.4623
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatres , space and light .	-2.2838
At both end , a short corridor is mirrored to allow it to work longer .	-3.4338
In the kitchen , the reflection feels like a window in another room .	-2.3339
At the entrance , mirrored units offer space for all tables and glasses from Joanne .	-3.8830
By perceiving a more glamorous room , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .	-2.7154
Folding cuisine is nothing new .	-3.1764
What is special about this is that it is a garage door .	-2.8365
" A bit of engineering art went into it , " explains Erfan of the steel enhanced MDF door .	-2.9216
'It is very difficult , so when you push the door up , it will be very easy to slide ' .	-7.0952
Thanks to the smooth use of space and storage space Joanne could win an extra 16 m <unk> , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .	-3.4525
" At the end of the day you will sell the base area - or as your property is estimated " , Erfan says .	-2.8776
'In a rudimentary form , a real estate broker will occur and perform a calculation based on the size of the ground ' .	-3.7825
Here they have managed to increase the soil surface while using high quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage .	-5.3528
" The materials are the things you touch and which therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home , " says Erfan .	-3.8583
" You don 't fall in love with the electric sockets in the walls .	-3.0986
They are important , but they do not play with your heart . '	-1.8814
It shows that due to good design and increased square metres of square metres , a flat can convert from somewhat standard to something quite astonishing .	-6.0598
Indeed , like Joanne , you may decide not to leave .	-2.0771
Brothers are fighting for a $ 500 million real estate empire	-2.0074
Two brothers , four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty , are in dispute over one of Victoria ’ s largest real estate empires worth more than $ 500 million .	-3.3390
The former director of the Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak , only three doors away from his younger brother Paul , who brought him to the Supreme Court to explain how their property and business assets are to be shared .	-3.8203
Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp dispute over separation is taking place in the Supreme Court .	-3.2174
Together with her mother Anna , the brothers possess 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars since the family bought a business in Smith Street , Collingwood in 1973 .	-3.1353
The Westco Jeans family founded there and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores .	-2.9283
It was sold for USD 85 million in 1999 .	-1.0180
This money has been invested in real estate , and De Lutis 's portfolio now includes offices in the city centre , the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centres in the suburbs .	-3.9833
According to an agreement with her late father , Colin - described by Paul as " primary operator and the dominant personality " in the De Lutis family - approximately two-thirds of corporate assets and Paul owns about one third .	-4.9923
One court case says that this means that Colin owns $ 316 million and Paul worth $ 176 million .	-3.1848
The distribution of property and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .	-2.5123
" The divisions proposed by Colin left him with what I thought to be the best objects , " he wrote in a first affidavit in 2015 .	-2.4214
Last Friday , after several failed conciliations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place .	-2.2551
The brothers are now also fighting for control of the existing business - of which Colin , as Paul claims , has excluded him .	-3.5745
Colin argues that this is not true , but accuses Paul of incompetently managing some possessions .	-2.4528
In an early affidavit submitted by Colin , he says that he hopes to settle the dispute .	-3.1045
" My Italian heritage prescribes that the family is the most important priority , " he wrote .	-1.9901
The cost is rising in the case , with hundreds of companies with affidavits , e-mails and reports , including Deloitte , Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan Myers , QC , and both sides of law firms .	-9.6708
Ms De Lutis and her late husband , Luigi , were Italian immigrants who operated dairy bars and delicate shops from the late 1950s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early 1970s .	-3.7540
They used the security to buy the Collingwood property in which Colin opened the first Jeansload of the family .	-3.9565
Colin says that he began there when he was ' the high school in my last years , when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) ' .	-4.0417
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass their property comfortably to their sons .	-2.3739
" Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to come to justice , " she wrote .	-2.5267
Two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lutis group , claiming that Mark was paid $ 10 million in leaving the company and $ 26 million in Luke .	-3.4439
Both Lukas and Mark were , Paul says , ' became bitter about the terms of their financial separation ' .	-3.1826
Colin has been very restrained , although he was a former AFL member and Eddie McGuire ’ s best friend of television star after biography in 2015 .	-4.6083
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers .	-1.9612
Only Colin replied by SMS to say " I really cannot say much " because the case is before the courts .	-3.3486
" It is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and draw our family name through the courts " , he wrote .	-2.9412
In mid-2016 , Colin wrote to the court that he tried to meet his brother ’ s demands .	-2.2886
" Our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end our current dispute , " he said and added that he " still hope for a solution " .	-3.2263
On Friday , this hope seemed to be over .	-1.9045
" Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future , " wrote Colin .	-1.8769
Trump ’ s new chief of staff plans to limit presidential media abstinence .	-1.9346
Others tried and failed .	-1.0874
Perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it .	-1.5422
If so , he will be the first .	-1.0854
Politico reports that the White House ’ s new chief of staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump , including news reports , in the hope of keeping the head on a more equal course .	-3.5592
Here is a piece of Reporter Josh Dawsey :	-1.4159
" When John F. Kelly , the White House ’ s new chief of staff , met senior employees on his first working day , he posed a major problem in President Donald Trump ’ s White House that he wanted to repair : bad information that came into the hands of the president .	-3.9138
Kelly said to the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he had got good information ' .	-3.9637
Kelly ’ s diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media .	-1.6918
President Trump ’ s television relationship lags decades back – and now that he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong .	-3.5216
" When candidate Trump was annoyed because of unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting of jobs to be convinced , " said former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg in February to Politico .	-4.3331
Politico 's Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that ' the key to keeping Trump ’ s Twitter habit under control , according to six former campaign officials , is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise . '	-3.6755
Okay .	-0.4243
But the idea that Trump ’ s twitter habit ever was “ under control ” is ridiculous .	-1.6581
Perhaps these campaign officials know something we do not know others - that , without their interventions , Trump ’ s tweets would have contained even more fuel .	-3.3245
We will probably never hear about the tweets that Trump has not sent .	-2.4000
If his colleagues managed to keep his troubles away from him , their efforts have been worthwhile .	-5.1119
But no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump from causing controversy .	-2.2204
Part of the problem is that people in a White House made up of competing parties are constantly trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views from the world .	-3.6181
Politico - dealing with this history - reported in May the preference of advisers to provide dubious information to the president for strategic reasons .	-4.0999
This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher :	-1.9668
" Trump ’ s current and former Trump officials say that Trump can respond like a volcano to negative press sections , especially those with damaging leaks , and that he is steering to find out where they come from .	-12.4352
This was exactly what happened at the end of February , when someone maliciously accused the President of being a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com , the website of the Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being " the source behind a pile of leaks " in the White House .	-4.4927
Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter due to harassment , or had not offered any concrete evidence , or had , in the past , made false accusations and revoked them .	-5.0147
Trump read the article and began to consult employees about Walsh . ' . , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-8.5494
Goldmaker added that the then Chief of Staff , Reence Priebus , and Secretary-General of the White House , Rob Porter , " tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper that Trump receives . "	-4.3152
How did this work ?	-1.4778
Kelly tries to do the same three months later .	-7.9364
Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective manager than a priebus , but Trump is still his impulsive self , and his advisers still seek influence .	-3.6743
These unchanging factors make Kelly ’ s mission very difficult .	-2.2926
Most wanted criminals will receive mail from Europol	-3.4672

The police throughout Europe are sending virtual postcards to dangerous criminals this summer .	-3.4074
Naturally , as the addresses of the heavy criminals are not known , evidence from the population is hoped and asked .	-4.4795
On Friday , Europol reported on the action following the " EU Most Wanted " Advent Calendar of winter .	-3.7011

Travellers negotiate on a ditch and return to the ' Millionaires ' series of . in , , , , , , , , , , ,	-9.0176
Some of the wealthiest homeowners of the West Midlands are back on war with some determined travellers , who negotiated a municipal ditch to reclaim a field in front of their homes .	-5.2628
Travellers have parked their 20 caravans on a field outside a prosperous street of Solihull , called the " Millionaires series " .	-4.0245
They brought horses , babies and an army of transporters only after they were thrown out in May , but without being deterred by a ditch excavated by the Council to prevent their incidents .	-16.1502
The tactful group found a defense gap and pushed its vehicles through a section that remained unhindered to find a way .	-3.5175
Deserting inhabitants have urged the Solihull Council to say that it is ' useless to address the problem ' .	-4.5438
An anonymous inhabitant said : " They went there on Monday night after being sent to Bentley Heath where they threw stones on the passers-by .	-3.8330
The Council must be forced into action by shame to implement it , as it was useless in dealing with the problem .	-3.4298
The travellers were there in May , were moved on and are now back .	-3.4229
More were arrived yesterday evening , probably even more today . '	-2.7102
She added : ' The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by holding long instructions to protect its parks .	-3.0070
I live on the Streetsbrook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my local tax if the Council cannot even stop that . '	-2.6173
A resident who did not want to be called said : " It is ridiculous , we have just seen the last round of these travellers just to be plundered by another round .	-3.9691
The figures have increased this time and you have even seen a horse in the parking area . '	-3.2374
A spokesperson from the Solihull Council said : ' We are aware of an unauthorised camp in the countryside beyond the Streetsbrook Road and work with the Solihull police and we are taking the necessary legal steps to move them forward as soon as possible .	-4.6609

Birkenhof becomes Waldhotel Luise of Birkenhof WaldWaldin . in Walthe of the .	-13.6662
The former Hotel Birkenhof becomes the Waldhotel Luise .	-1.7160
The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadts is being renovated and is due to be reopened on 1 March next year .	-3.7587
This is good news for the city .	-1.6016
Because , with the closure of Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on April 13 , 2014 , about 30 000 nights were lost each year and income was also lost by the cure tax .	-5.3405
In the autumn of 2014 , with dramatically increasing numbers of refugees arriving in the district , the hotel building was offered to the Land Council as a collection accommodation office , causing controversial discussion .	-5.4451
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a plan to secure the area as a hotel location .	-3.8473
The decision was not uncontroversial at the time in the local coun.	-2.9221
But especially Freudenstadt ’ s Oberbürgermeister Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and spoke of serious interests in the house back then .	-5.0768
He should be right .	-0.9259
The Luisenhotels Group with Managing Director Birgit Scherer , headquartered in Bad Bergzabern , purchased the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and intends to return to a house of the Three Star Plus category under the name of Waldhotel Luise .	-4.8836
The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt Object .	-3.2904
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb .	-1.6776
You are called Hotel Luise , Luisenpark , Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise .	-1.4532
The former Hotel Birkenhof has been in front of the entrance for a long time , and when you enter the house it becomes clear what extensive renovation work will be done .	-5.5620
The floors were expelled , some of the ceilings were dismantled , old bathtubs removed from the rooms .	-5.3994
The entire hotel building is a single building site .	-2.2668
There is still much to be done by March .	-1.8917
" It 's actually a nice hotel " , says Thomas Scherer in talks with our newspaper .	-2.9252
Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style .	-1.8668
The rooms are equipped with large walkable showers , the entrance area is changed , new windows are installed .	-4.0114
Everything should later become ' nice near the citizens ' , as Thomas Scherer expresses .	-4.4378
'We want to make a jewelry out ' .	-2.4345
Swimming pool , spa and meeting room are all equipped .	-3.3519
Sherer emphasized the quality of the hotels in Lauterbad .	-5.4915
The Waldhotel Luise , with its about 60 rooms , wants to establish itself , explains Scherer on .	-11.4257
Both individual holidaymakers , groups or businessmen should feel at home in the hotel . !	-13.2566
He had talks with OB Julian Osswald and tourist director Michael Krause , says Scherer .	-2.8497
The city 's ideas are similar to those of the hotel group .	-2.8016
'We are on the same line . '	-0.9737
As for the amount of investment , Thomas Scherer does not want to determine precisely .	-3.7275
It expects just under one million euros .	-2.7682
The outdoor facilities are also brought to front , which is already clear .	-4.2333
A large terrace is created in an inner courtyard , which will be accessible from the restaurant , which is public .	-4.6282

Russia affair : US Special Investigators are setting Grand Ja Grand Jury	-3.7896
In the Russian affair surrounding US President Donald Trump , special investigators Robert Mueller have , after a report , set up a so-called Grand Jury .	-3.8682
The body has started work in recent weeks , wrote the Wall Street Journal , invoking familiar people .	-12.0887
The newspaper took the step as a sign that Mueller had extended and intensified his investigations .	-3.4618
The CNN channel reported that there are already first submissions from the body in connection with a meeting between Trump ’ s oldest son and a Russian lawyer .	-3.4398
US intelligence services have been accusing the Kremlin for a long time of targeted interference in the presidential campaign in 2016 .	-2.6923
Mueller investigates whether there were agreements between Trump ’ s campaign team and Moscow .	-2.1234
The investigation is intended to focus on several men who acted in the campaign as Republican adviser .	-3.5594
According to reports , Mueller also looked more and more at Trump ’ s private and business environment .	-2.4359
The Washington Post wrote a few weeks ago that Trump Special Investor personally brought Trump to the centre and investigate the charge of whether the president may have hampered the judiciary during the aff.	-5.2085
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine current evidence in possible cases of crime and to decide whether to make charges .	-4.4137
Grand Jurys are therefore also called charges .	-2.9970
They are usually activated if they are larger and controversial cases .	-3.3454
The procedure is always done behind closed doors .	-9.1342
The body can also be activated by the Public Prosecutor 's Office in order to invite people to interrogate under oath . in . in , , , , in , , , , , ,	-12.1929
According to the CNN channel , submissions have already been issued that are about the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer .	-3.4945
People who were involved in the meeting were asked to make a statement , as was stated in the report .	-3.8067
They should also provide documents .	-0.6539
In addition to Trump Jr. , Trump ’ s consultants and son of Schwiegerson , Jared Kushner , and his then campaign chief Paul Manafort , were present in the conversation .	-4.8583
Legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the establishment shows that Mueller was not intimidating in his work and that he wanted to act quickly if necessary .	-4.3174
However , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury is enabled at the end to decide on the charge .	-4.0995
Nevertheless , setting up the body is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Trump .	-3.5879
Amid the new revelations , the President took a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portray the Russian affair as a campaign by his political opponents .	-3.0653
" Russia 's history is a total invention , " said Trump .	-1.3376
The issue gives Democrats an opportunity to ' feel good because they have nothing else they can talk about ' . . , , .	-8.6217
His Special Adviser Ty Cobb stated in an opinion that he knew nothing about setting up a Grand Jury .	-3.4276
But he also usually works in secret , he emphasized .	-4.0298
The White House is in favour of any measures that accelerated the work of the special investigator in a ' fair ' way .	-3.4261
Former FBI chief James Comey said three times that it was not being investigated against the president .	-14.2460
There is no reason to believe that this has changed , as the statement continued .	-4.1268
But Mueller was only used after Trump Comey had fired .	-2.1462
Because of this throw-out , accusations against Trump had become accusations that he wanted to hinder the judiciary .	-5.2539
Comey said before a Senate Committee in June that Trump asked him to cease investigations against the then national security adviser , Michael Flynn .	-3.2878
The President is under great pressure because of the inquiry .	-2.2187
According to US media , the White House collected material against the special investigator and his employees .	-3.4275
The triggered speculation about whether Trump Mueller wanted to fire .	-2.8439
Unlike an independent Congressional Special Investor , such as the Watergate affair around the later resigned President Richard Nixon , Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired by the Ministry of Justice at the pressure of the president .	-8.2402
Several senators from both parties , however , want to prevent such a move .	-2.3744
Two groups of Republican and Democratic Senators presented legislative proposals on Thursday that the special investigator could no longer be easily dismissed .	-3.5058
Antarctica : Gigantic Ice Mountain Drives in Antarctica	-2.8069
In the West Antarctica , a gigantic iceberg seven times the size of Berlin has dissolved from the Schelfeis .	-5.8185
This was announced by the Bremerhaven Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar and Sea Research on Wednesday .	-2.9399
More than a trillion tonnes of heavy and 5800 square kilometres now drive to the north and will probably take two , three years until he is melted .	-4.8785
It is 175 kilometres long and a width of up to 50 kilometres one of the largest ice-giants that researchers have registered in the past three decades .	-4.0590
He does not pose a threat to people .	-2.6099
The extent to which climate change has played a role in the break-up of the iceberg is unclear according to research . the of in . , , , , , , , , ,	-10.4554
Overall , however , there has been a series of unusual collapses in the region for some 30 years , writing the US Snow and Ice Research Centre ( NSIDC ) in a factual background .	-4.5145
Many researchers believe that this could be linked to global warming .	-2.0862
The now aborted coloss has been part of the Larsen-C Schelfeis .	-2.5360
Schelfeis swimming on the sea and is fed by large glaciers .	-2.4318
It therefore continues to grow into the sea and breaks regularly .	-3.4335
The Larsen-C Schelfeis is located almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula south of South America .	-3.1224
North of this helmet , the balance of growth and breakdown was disturbed a few years ago .	-4.7396
Daniela Jansen writes an AWI researcher to fall apart .	-5.3625
There are some arguments in favour of the Larsen C Schelfeis being threatened , because the front edge has never withdrawn as far as it is now .	-4.9988
Furthermore , the ice plate is under tension and can fall off if a key point breaks down .	-4.7202
Melting Schelfeis and Ice Mountains does not increase sea level as they swim on the water and drive ice as much water as it results after melting itself .	-4.4315
However , the loss of the Schelfeis means that the glaciers can turn directly into the sea and flow much faster than before .	-4.8231
This could possibly increase marine levels , but only to a small extent , the British research project to monitor the Antarctic ( Midas ) .	-4.5484
The Larsen-C Schelfeis is the fourth largest Schelfeis in Antarctica , according to AWI statements of almost 50 000 square kilometres .	-4.5349
At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters .	-3.8689
There it regularly breaks down .	-2.3837
" Although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change , the Ice Shield is now in a more dangerous position , " said Martin O 'Leary of the British Swansea University .	-4.3972
" This is the most extensive withdrawal since the records began , " he also confirmed .	-3.0925
Among scientists , it is controversial whether the Larsen-C Schelfeis will now grow again or , in the long term , go back and perhaps collapse , his colleague Adrian Luckman said and added : ' Our models say that it will be less stable ' .	-5.3394
But this development will take decades .	-1.3261
Although these researchers do not attribute the abortion of this giant iceberg to climate change , the Antarctic Peninsula has declined in recent decades .	-5.5495
This long tip of the Antarctic stretches towards South America .	-2.1024
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey research programme , the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s .	-2.9952
The increase in temperature has contributed to the decline .	-1.9691
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed around three degrees over the past 50 years and is one of the areas where temperature rises fastest .	-3.7148
CDU wants a house tariff with staff .	-3.8670
Because it is becoming increasingly difficult to fill jobs , the CDU is calling for employers ' associations to be withdrawn in order to become more attractive .	-4.3101
Just before the summer break , the Kreistag gave 41 new posts in the administration .	-3.8175
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the Mettmann circle .	-2.2003
Once again , 17 apprentices have left their first working day .	-2.3388
The courses in the circle appear to be very desirable .	-3.6668
Around 620 applications were recorded for the places to be forgiven this year .	-3.8855
Nevertheless , the circle still lacks staff to meet increased demands and tasks .	-3.3263
At the Mettmann circle there are still 50 unoccupied posts .	-2.9364
Amongst other things , doctors and engineers and general administration forces are being sought .	-3.8350
The CDU , together with the FDP and UWG , now wants to take the initiative in the Kreistag to counter the shortage of experts in the administration .	-5.4825
The administration should , according to the request of the parties , draw up a concept of recruitment and human resources development .	-4.4878
The aim is not only to meet short-term requirements for professionals , but to counter the shortage of candidates in the future .	-11.9979
The overall concept should be oriented internally and externally , identified concrete measures for cross-country beginners and included a training offensive , calls for CDU , FDP and UWG .	-5.5704
That sounds like a good approach .	-1.5306
The circle is dealing with human resources problems that were not known before .	-4.0264
Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .	-2.0944
We are talking about real ' competition between public employers ' .	-2.8157
In addition , a large number of employees excluding illness or age from the service .	-10.4349
So it is high time to act so that there are no more jobs left unoccupied .	-4.3161
However , Klaus-Dieter Peoples , head of the CDU Group , goes beyond the joint motion with his party .	-3.2658
He recently caused a fisting surprise in the circular day , when he publicly challenged the staffing cost cover and stunned the other parties .	-5.8465
People want to see all the opportunities to leave the municipal employers ' association reviewed .	-4.4503
" If we do not find a satisfactory solution here in the short term , circle management with the trade unions - perhaps in cooperation with circle cities - should seek a house tariff " , says peoples .	-5.1670
In this way , the CDU is trying to pay the employees and officials better than the public service tariff actually envisages .	-4.7637
The salaries are currently prescribed accurately , and there is only increases or more money if you change to a higher level , oriented towards professional years . in , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-14.5240
But the circle ’ s tasks have increased in recent years .	-2.6353
Just a few weeks ago , new premises had to be set up to deal with the provisions of the new prostitute protection law .	-3.8776
Landrat Thomas Hendele and district director Martin Richter have a problem , not least because of the rising number of asylum seekers : they have too little staff .	-3.5454
Italy is exacerbating the tone of NGO migrant rescue boats	-2.7441
Italy has warned NGOs who use bailout boats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they cannot continue this unless they abide by new rules for their operations .	-3.6876
" If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , " said Home Secretary Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turins daily newspaper La Stampa .	-3.1794
Minniti ’ s warning came one day after the Italian authorities had seized a boat from the German Youth Saving Organisation , because its team had worked effectively with human traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration .	-3.8505
The Assistance Organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to comment on detailed accusations by the Italian Public Prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio .	-3.9005
" For us , saving human life is and remains our top priority , so we are very sorry that at the moment we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone , " said the organisation in an opinion on social media .	-3.5832
'We can judge all accusations that are currently being made only after we have gathered all the information and can assess the situation ' .	-4.7393
The Italian authorities had monitored the boat of ' Youth Rescue ' , the Iuventa , since October .	-2.6392
It is suspected that his crew takes hull boat migrants on board , who are directly supplied to them by human traffickers , and that smugglers can depart so that the ships can be used again .	-5.6332
At least such a meeting was supposedly held only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the acts of the Public Prosecutor whose content was published by Italian media .	-3.6228
The crew is suspected of overseeing the authority of the Italian Coastguard , the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other motives .	-11.4978
Under the code of conduct , boats such as the Iuventa must above all have an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities .	-2.6317
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the code : Save the Children , MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain .	-2.5162
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable , as they would not bring about ' substantial changes or disabilities ' of their bailouts .	-4.1497
Among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel laureate organization is doctors without borders ( MSF ) .	-10.8608
Minniti has now said that the number of migrants arriving after the rescue measures in Italy has fallen sharply in recent weeks , indicating that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and cooperate with the local mayors have borne fruit .	-4.0253
" In recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , " the Minister said .	-2.4230
He announced plans for further discussions with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of achieving Europe .	-2.9075
Rising and Trials	-1.8149
Nine Weilermer Biker , the " Berlin Outpost " and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the north palace to enjoy trials and sights for four days .	-3.7710
Three friendly guides were available for this pur. in . in , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-10.9671
The accommodation in the Wachenheimer Valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .	-2.9564
The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra .	-1.9090
The first tour led to the Michael chapel above Deidesheim at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards .	-9.4496
There were sights , some of them on towers , from which one could look far beyond the forest and the plains behind it .	-6.7992
In between , there have been longer and longer increases , rewarding long trials .	-11.0339
On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to Saline and to the Volksfest sausage market .	-3.5300
Again there was a viewpoint linked to " flowery " trials and moderate rises .	-4.2858
On the last two days , many altitude meters were announced .	-3.5838
Caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and refuges brought welcome breaks .	-1.6188
In Bad Dürkheim , the bikers breathed in the open-air inhalation of healing soles .	-3.5869
Neustadt has also been steered .	-8.5498
After 173 kilometres and almost 4500 metres of altitude , the group had met the Pfälzer Forest from its best side - sporty and cultural .	-9.8285
Konsole instead of grass - Bundesliga equips for e-sports equipment .	-2.9484
In the future , are the sports stars in front of computer consoles instead of fighting over the stadium grass in the event of wind and weather ?	-4.9289
Fact : E-Sport has long become a serious industry , a lucrative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gags .	-13.7694
The first federal leagues have recognized this , which are increasingly engaged in this area .	-10.1214
The VfL Wolfsburg began in 2015 , later the FC Schalke 04 and last but not least the VfB Stuttgart , who founded an e-sports department in mid-July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract .	-5.0570
" We hope to inspire entirely new young target groups for the VfB , " says Management Board Jochen Röttgermann .	-3.5204
He is sure " that a number of clubs are still rising on this train " .	-4.6808
Next weekend , the FIFA World Football Federation organizes the first Interactive Club World Cup in London , where the gamers of various clubs compete against each other .	-4.2910
Besides Schalke and Wolfsburg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint-Germain or the PSV Eindhoven have qualified .	-2.5974
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sport .	-1.4629
The ex-trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players .	-8.9212
" Real football has to deal with the 14 to 30-year-olds in particular , that young people are still stadium in the future , " says the 52-year-old .	-5.4468
And : the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian ones .	-2.4927
With prominent e-sportsmen under contract , one could be present online much more often in these markets than only once a year to send the Federal League to Asia .	-5.2682
What exactly is at stake ?	-1.5981
In e-sport , computer games such as " League of Legends " , " Dota 2 " , " Counterstrike " or the football simulation FIFA are fought at competitive level .	-3.9153
As in normal sports , leagues have long established in which professionals compete against each other .	-4.8042
And in the 2022 Asian Games , e-sport is already part of the official programme .	-2.7551
But is it a real sport ?	-2.1928
For many , the idea is certainly useful .	-2.6169
Ingo Froböse , too , has long addressed the question .	-3.6223
For the professor at the Deutsche Sportschule in Cologne , e-Sport is a sport because it is competent and shows many biological and physical reactions that are also found in classical sport - for example , increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormonal changes .	-5.1065
It also requires cognitive skills , technical and tactical understanding and rapid reaction capability .	-9.9751
Professional gamers should train not only at the console but also their body and pay attention to nutrition .	-3.3355
'The tired player is a good player ' .	-2.3000
Frobous also sees problems : ' Doping is becoming more and more a subject ' .	-4.0553
Control is difficult to perform in online games , and the structures of classical sport were missing in the scene .	-4.6136
The scientist positively highlights the high integrative effect of e-sport .	-2.7483
Players are travelling internationally , this is like a large global family , there are no intercultural barriers .	-3.3421
A study of the consultancy Deloitte and the Federal Association for Interactive Entertainment ( BIU ) predicts rapid growth for e-sport .	-3.8779
In 2016 , EUR 50 million had been implemented in Germany , mainly through advertising , sponsoring , and large tournaments .	-3.0535
Revenue is expected to be 130 million in three years .	-3.2925
That is little against the nearly EUR 2.4 billion of the Federal League of Football .	-3.6916
However , e-sport is " no longer far from other established sports such as handball , basketball or ice hockey " , the Deloitte consultants write .	-3.5575
Many countries have already gone on International .	-2.8373
Large markets are Asia and the USA , where ex-basketball players Shaquille O<unk>Neal and baseballstar Alex Rodriguez participate in the US team NRG eSports .	-12.3333
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in eSports betting provider Unikr.	-3.5726
There is also something going on in Europe .	-2.3381
In a Norwegian school , e-sport was introduced as a computer of lessons , says Froböse .	-3.5451
In the Netherlands and France , according to Dutt , football first league associations are now obliged to set up an e-sports department .	-3.5902
" Compared to Europe , Germany lags behind , " explains VfB Board of Directors Röttgermann .	-3.5738
Only falling into nostalgia and selling the old times is no longer enough today .	-4.4828
The aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but also to align the company in the modern market .	-10.3631

Michelle Carter condemns the texts that urge Conrad Roy to suicide .	-2.3073
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend to suicide through texts and calls .	-2.4011
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of condemnation behind bars , and five years have been suspended .	-3.0838
Carter was condemned in June for negligent killing of Conrad Roy , who took life on July 13 , 2014 .	-7.7783
The father of Roy said at the hearing on Thursday : ' My family is uncomfortable .	-1.9117
My son was my best friend ' .	-1.1180
Carter was allowed to remain free until the appointment .	-10.0838
She was faced with a maximum sentence of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr. Roy suffered from mental illness .	-3.6312
Closed in red trousers and a cream-coloured blouse , Carter stood in the eyes with tears , with folded hands and down eyes when she was sentenced .	-4.4702
" Their actions killed Conrad Roy , " said the prosecutor to the court .	-2.0009
" She ended his life to make their own better .	-1.8087
She took no responsibility ' , she said .	-2.5457
" She has shown no repentance " .	-2.4229
But Carter ’ s lawyer said it was a ' terrible circumstance that she totally regrets ' .	-7.3645
Judge Lawrence Moniz , however , said that he did not find that their " age or maturity , or even their mental illness , have a significant influence on their actions " .	-4.1105
A Public Prosecutor read a statement by Roy 's mother Lynn Roy , who said that there is ' no day when I bear the loss of my beloved son .	-4.6196
I want him to be proud of me and how I treat everything , and I try to be there for his sisters despite all my pain that we will carry with us for eternity ' .	-6.0840
Roy 's sister , Camdyn Roy , said that she would be " persecuted " by the realization that she would never participate in the wedding of her brother , or that she would be an aunt for his children .	-11.0440
" No longer having this only person with whom I have been with since my birth every day is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , " she said .	-3.6011
The case seems to set a legal precedent , as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide .	-12.9261
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014 .	-1.8252
The case attracted national attention after Carter ’ s text communications revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life .	-3.4230
" Hold up , jump from a building , first yourself , I do not know there are many ways , " she said in several news that she sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on holiday with his family .	-4.2054
In the moments before his suicide she wrote : ' You have to do it , Conrad ' and ' All you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy ' .	-10.4739
Judge Moniz said that Carter was looking for attention through the death of Roy and arranged that it should benefit from the case through any press .	-3.6486
The case shared legal opinion .	-1.7413
Amanda Knox was one of the few who defended Carter , who was sentenced in 2007 for murdering her British cohabitant in Italy before she was released two years ago .	-3.8123

Something else was different in his place in the cabin , that saw Joshua Kimmich immediately , even though the additional garment was very small .	-12.7006
But since there was no Philipp Lahm or Manuel Neuer on the second day of the Audi Cup , he stopped the binding to the arm .	-5.4356
" The trainer did not announce it " , the Confed Cup winner told him after his first bet as Bavarian captain .	-3.5186
Well , it could have done better than the 0.2 against the SSC Naples .	-4.3754
But the sign of the coach could interpret Kimmich as well .	-3.6539
Not the eight years older Arturo Vidal was selected as a game guide in the C-Elf , which was made up of youth players , debutants and just from the holiday professionals , but he .	-6.2284
Sugar is best distributed to those who want to keep a lot of mood .	-4.0090
Those who have been chosen to join the legacy of Lahm can only use a small extra motivation .	-3.8302
Kimmich confirmed : " This is what you want as a player to assume responsibility " . , , , , , , . , , , , , , was , , , and , , , , ,	-11.7063
On Wednesday , the 22-year-old fled over the field as a mini-lame .	-3.8731
To the back , that is his position , the white binding on the arm did its rest .	-3.5206
And Kimmich acted in this start formation as the one who can best take the hand in the hand .	-5.7639
He gave instructions to try to direct the unprecedented force .	-2.9580
He had a look for the whole while many others were engaged in themselves .	-3.7178
Vidal with overplaying his lack of fitness ( scarcely folded ) ; Renato Sanches with linking devils to Asia ’ s performance ( even folded conditional ) ; and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle with not negatively striking in their first appearance in the Bavarian tricot .	-7.2508
That , after all , worked very well .	-2.1531
Süle ran beside Kimmich , Rudy before the defense , both acting sovereign .	-2.5664
The well-known occupied Napoli storm has often been difficult , and souls have also been successful in gambling for a couple . in the was .	-14.7520
His colleague Mr Rudy admitted that the result was ' not as we had hoped for ' .	-2.8742
But he also showed a good performance in the debut .	-2.9127
Moving of games , changing tempo : " For this style I was also taken " .	-5.1684
How unusual this Bavarian world is for new entrances , one saw after the match .	-5.0606
Rudy , for example , did not give one or two in the catacombs , but certainly gave six or seven interviews .	-2.3805
Kimmich abandoned a few nasty statements at the back of his new players .	-4.3223
He heard an interesting phrase from Süle : " What is going on here I have already noticed .	-3.9265
At Bavaria you simply have to win each game " .	-2.4748
After all , he no longer need to teach the new .	-3.0090
Alaba Motivates <unk>FB Ladies	-1.4869
David Alaba believes in the success of our <unk>FB ladies and gentlemen	-8.5476
Austria ’ s most famous footballer was about Twitter just before the game and wished the <unk>FB ladies all the best .	-12.6168
The Bavarian Legionary is , of course , almost a club college of <unk>FB captain Schnaderbeck and fever with our lady .	-5.2273
The tweet of the Austrian footballer of the year and Champions League winner should be a special injection of motivation .	-2.8024

Company satisfied with Rhineland-Pfalsical Minister : Economy praises Wissings pace	-3.8632
It was often inconceivable , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when Eveline Lemke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhineland-Palatinate .	-3.4565
This is evident after more than a year in which the new Minister for Economic Affairs , Volker Wissing ( FDP ) , is in office .	-3.6860
Chambers and businesses in the region speak of a change in economic policy on T V , while reiterating the old minister .	-4.9549
Frank Natus , Chairman of the Association of Trierer Unternehmen ( VTU ) , says : " Wissing takes up the wishes of the economy , which Lemke has all blocked .	-9.6543
The biggest turnaround is Natus ’ s infrastructure policy : the motorway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now in the country ’ s list of .	-12.5835
This year , the Ministry hopes for a plan determination procedure , and by 2021 the right of construction will stand .	-5.8666
The Western circumvention of Trier , which is in the primary need of the federal transport route , also plays a role in the country ’ s plans .	-5.6192
The aim is to start the route in December 2020 , Ministry speaker Cornelia Holtmann says .	-3.0563
Natus sees it as a signpost to support regional but internationally competing companies .	-3.5483
The Chamber of Industry and Commerce ( IHK ) Trier , as inspired by knowledge , is seeking a Rhineland-Palatinate label in order to increase sales in supermarkets and stop the trend of German wine exports that have been declining for ten years .	-5.3430
Moreover , knowledge has an open ear for people who want to create their own company , the IHK praises .	-3.3658
The Trier craft chamber sees in the new master bonus an additional incentive for young trainees , says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach .	-3.2042
A premium of EUR 1000 is envisaged for the existing master examination and EUR 2500 if graduates self-employed within ten years of master education .	-13.5227
But the homework list for the country remains long .	-2.2823
The planned road construction is quick to create facts , while the country lacks the necessary staff , says Jan Glockauer , IHK Trier ’ s principal manager .	-5.1974
Of 56 new engineers wishing to stop knowledge at the local company mobility , only 29 jobs have been occupied .	-6.4121
The IHK is asking for more orders to be placed at external offices .	-3.0826
CDU Group Vice Christian Baldauf refers to the calculations of the Court of Auditors that the country invests more than EUR 20 million less than proposed in 2017 and 2018 .	-3.9983
Frank Natus also expects a country ’ s approach to address the shortfall in the region .	-3.9812
Moreover , the country ’ s previous broadband construction is sobering .	-4.2045
In 2016 , regional companies had rated network supplies in an IHK survey only with note 3.4 .	-10.7139
They complained about stalling Internet connections and abortions .	-2.4753
Ex-Economic Minister Eveline Lemke is now out of politics and is still on the Pro Wind Supervisory Board .	-3.7168
The Green Group left Lemke in April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe , where , after four months of inconsistency , she returned to the field .	-4.7468
Audi is supposed to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - automakers are faced with a backlash .	-3.2177
One day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles .	-2.8028
The BMW Chairman said that the company believed that ' there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions ' , referring to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - banning or restricting diesel vehicles .	-3.8426
On Tuesday Daimler announced that there would be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .	-2.6145
None of the companies described the enterprises as calling back .	-3.7263
European car manufacturers have greatly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions rules .	-2.7041
But nitrogen oxides emitting diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma .	-1.5386
The costs of car manufacturers to install plants to neutralise the exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles are also increasing , which makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .	-3.9979
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has also been charged with disguising the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem .	-3.2866
Companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so-called shutdown devices that regulate emissions in order to comply with the rules when a car has been tested but reduced in normal driving conditions .	-4.8713
In the United States , several Volkswagen employees have been indicted , others are investigated on both sides of the Atlantic .	-2.4338
Last month , the former head of the thermodynamics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .	-2.2414
Former manager Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be tried in the United States .	-2.7250
Earlier this year , Audi was included in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen , accusing the Audi authorities of having installed a system to circumvent emissions rules in Europe , and a question focused on the United States has been extended .	-4.3261
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could heavily burden Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to the profit of Volkswagen .	-3.1757
This is the message that the flow in Isar on Saturday .	-3.3732
The city wants to protect the Isar .	-1.5811
For the Isar visitors to take part , tomorrow there will be a flow through Munich with a special message .	-13.3621
Those who attract it again on Saturday to Isar will see a big float between Flaucher and Reichenbachbrücke .	-4.8215
And this is not a common raft with Isar tourists .	-3.0481
But the building conference wants to explain .	-5.3883
There is a big transparency on the flow .	-4.3204
It shows a rubbish mountain .	-1.6751
The opening of a public sphere campaign to appeal to Isar visitors .	-3.1232
The motto " True Love is ... " is intended to sharpen understanding for the Isar as a protective game flow .	-3.9130
Last summer , the float broke over Isar and again this year there are further actions and measures to achieve careful and environmentally conscious behaviour .	-5.8817
Murdillous knisses and the Laughter against suffering	-4.5556
Mordillo was temporarily one of the most published cartoon drawings , the noses of his characters are his trademark .	-3.7769
With 85 the Argentine still draws and works on a film .	-3.5301
His message is laughing , ' because there is too much suffering in the world ' .	-2.5583
Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .	-1.8369
In the first years as an artist , he beat among other things as a drawing for congratulations cards - which frustrated him .	-4.4679
" The happiest day in my professional life was the day when my job lost , " he once said .	-1.8934
After stations in Lima , New York and Paris , he succeeded in breaking through at the end of the 1960s : with the release of his cartoons in " Paris Match " , and then in " Stern " and other leading magazines around the world .	-9.9782
Even in China , Mordillo found many fans .	-1.8035
Time and again the artist of cities was inspired .	-3.4906
Large , roundabout Mordillo figures dream in drawings with the Pisa Tower , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .	-4.8966
In the early morning , according to his own data , he is still on the drawing table today , working almost ten hours a day .	-5.2245
His rolling figures remain widespread worldwide via calendars , puzzles , books for adults and children , t-shirts , plushes and watches .	-5.2351
For six years he has also worked on a cartoon film and a TV series with his characters .	-3.9909
The main person in the film " Crazy Island " is a giraffe - murderless popular animal in his drawings - which has a thousand feet as an opponent .	-4.7330
For the first time , his characters speak in the 3D movie , which is due to come to cinema in 2019 .	-4.0927
" I do not know exactly what they will say , it is strange for me , " says Mordillo .	-2.1778
The script is not written by him .	-1.3052
Therefore , it is more relevant to the TV series , which , like its original drawings , is produced wordless .	-5.0074
Provence ’ s Lavendel Threatens Climate Change	-1.7438
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France , but there is a warning that it is threatened with climate change .	-1.9882
The lavender is declining due to drought conditions and insects transmitted to the disease , causing great headaches to scientists and farmers trying to find solutions .	-4.8397
Eric Chaisse , expert at the CRIEPPAM Agricultural Research Institute in Provence , said : " The lavender in Provence is effectively vulnerable because the plant in recent years has been exposed to the effects of climate change , which brought much less rain in spring and much more in autumn .	-4.5883
This affects the lifetime of Lavendel .	-2.6888
There is also a small cicade , a microbacterium that transfers dwarf cicades , and in very dry weather there are many of them . '	-3.6261
And there is a lot at stake .	-1.7076
Lavendeöll is not only attractive for holidaymakers , but also for perfumes and cosmetics .	-4.3938
Eric Chaisse said : " Instead of having very long plant noise with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , underdeveloped , and either lacking or we.	-3.4155
So we have fewer parts of essential oil . '	-1.4974
The solutions that are considered include better water distribution and slowing evaporation from the soil , but also spraying plants with a protective mix of sound and water , and developing varieties that are more resistant to drought .	-4.1654
The town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhön celebrates its 1200th anniversary .	-2.7370
The celebration is this Saturday and Sunday with a Medieval Festival .	-3.4620
Krämer , fences , traders , vagants or a countryside camp will be on these days in the city centre .	-5.5958
The murder of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico	-1.3503
The workers of the weekly newspaper Riodoce usually meet Wednesday to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the State of Sinaloa through organised crime , corrupt officials and continuous drug wars .	-4.5798
But on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .	-1.9447
They were told that it is important to change their routines .	-1.6662
Two high-level journalists are discussing what feels more secure : they are supposed to take their children into the office , which in 2009 were the aim of attacking with grenades , or leaving them at home .	-5.7731
Security experts have written three words on a board at the front of the room : opponents , neutral , allies .	-2.7938
You ask the reporters to suggest names for each column - no evidence is necessary , perceptions and abdominal feelings are sufficient .	-3.8137
There are drug smugglers , politicians , businessmen , journalists suspected of being on the government ’ s pay list or the cartels , a catalogue of criminals who make Mexico ’ s chaos dangerous .	-3.6565
There is no rest of violence , and while the bodies are accumulating throughout the country , there are more and more journalists : at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012 ; 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats , and so far there have been at least seven deaths in seven states this year .	-5.1879
Among the latter are their editor and inspirer of Riodoce , co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas .	-3.2194
" The greatest mistake is to live and be a journalist in Mexico , " Valdez wrote in one of his many books on violence relating to drugs .	-3.0250
His absence is deeply felt , although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez , which shows his middle finger with the word " justice " , depends on the facade of the Riodoce building in the , Ain the in the 1930 's , in the of .	-13.7608
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the reporters discuss their divided topics , the trauma , their nightmares , lack of sleep , paranoia .	-3.2439
Although a special federal lawyer was set up in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists , according to the Committee on the Protection of journalists , it only launched two criminal proceedings .	-3.6752
As with most of the thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organised crime every year , journalists ' murderers are rarely tried .	-2.8106
At Riodoce , they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa , although they are uncomfortable and although the terrain is now even more treacherous .	-4.1051
Without information about the murderers , without justice , the meeting on the discussion of security has little benefit , Ibarra says .	-3.2642
" It is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , " he says .	-1.4028
'As long as we do not know why , we all mistrust . '	-3.6157
On the morning of May 15 , Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan .	-2.8326
He only managed to go a few blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men .	-3.6888
The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .	-2.3036
Valdez was 50 years old .	-0.9017
He left a woman and two adult children .	-1.1401
Rumours tend to fly freely around Culiacan .	-1.3905
But on the subject of Valdez , there is virtually nothing but silence .	-2.3371
Since Guzman ’ s arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January , Sinaloa has become one of the country ’ s bloodiest battlefields , with rival groups fighting here to fill the vacuum .	-2.6822
It does not make sense that in Sinaloa someone or several people are shot on the streets every day , or that the cemetery is full of decorated two-storey mausoleums for drugs larger than many houses for the living .	-5.1587
Forget for one minute that there is a state of calm if only one cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States .	-4.1002
Nevertheless , and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work , Ismail Bojorquez ( 60 ) , a co-founder and director of Riodoce , is blamed for not being able to protect his friend .	-3.4660
He believes that two misunderstandings contributed to the murder .	-1.3068
First of all , there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez in February , a leader of one of the rival cartel groups in the war with Guzman ’ s sons .	-3.6654
This release may have annoyed the sons , suspected gang members bought each copy of the issue once it was delivered to newspaper kiosk .	-3.9330
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for its own security after the seizure of another newspaper that had published the same story .	-3.1869
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .	-1.9542
He survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there .	-2.2630
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 , combining five colleagues to establish Riodoce and selling $ 50 .	-4.3631
In Sinaloa , " it was impossible to run journalism without encountering the drugs problem , " said Bojorquez .	-2.5963
Over time , the newspaper earned a reputation because of courageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .	-2.9771
Reporters loved being able to publish hard-hitting investigations without fear of censorship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to treat .	-3.3543
Eight years after Riodoce was founded , she received the prestigious " Maria-Moors-Cabot Prize " for her reporting in Latin America .	-3.3346
In the same year , Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of journalists for his courage in pursuing the Mexican drug history , wherever she hinted .	-4.2236
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid .	-1.2212
" I want to continue living " , he said at the time of the CPJ award .	-2.5748
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa is a way of life , " he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV .	-2.6505
" You must take on the task that happens to you as a journalist - either that or you play the stupid .	-3.5458
I do not want to be asked : ' What did you do about so many deaths ... why did you not say what was going on ? '	-3.1342
The Riodoce team misses Valdez , the fun bird who could flee like a port worker , the friend who was generous with embarrassments and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .	-3.8341
They trusted his routine .	-1.8104
He would always bear his hat .	-1.1405
He would always go to El Guayabo , the bar opposite the office , and always sit at the same table there .	-2.2352
Now they ask : Was his love for routine his corruption ?	-2.3603
His death has also forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their work and stay alive .	-3.2223
" You don 't like it when you deal with your women , their children , their clean shops , their secret runways " to move drugs .	-4.3525
" These things were not allowed , " said Bojorquez .	-1.4549
The result , even in the best times , is a high degree of self-censorship and preservation .	-2.3737
His own instincts trust .	-0.7842
If it smells wrong , it will stay away .	-2.6388
The anger is , said by the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal , that ' smell a sense that can be deceived ... and then it happened with Javier ' .	-4.0095
The old rules , as he and others say , no longer apply in Sinaloa , just as they do in Tamaulipas , Veracruz , Guerrero , and other states where a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes , weak institutions , and corrupt government officials is at home .	-3.3755
The landscape is constantly changing .	-1.2544
Days before , it was known that spyware sold exclusively to governments was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .	-2.8126
Outside , two policemen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 <unk> C ) in the shadow of a tree .	-2.7371
They were commissioned by the national government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a middle class area of Culiacan .	-3.8350
Half in joke , some of the reporters wondered whether these officers were among the 50 % of the police who the governor himself called untrustworthy .	-3.7950
It has been months since the reporters entered the mountainous landscape , where drug gangs are de facto under control .	-13.3512
For this week ’ s edition , Riodoce has looked at three main stories .	-11.9555
There was the murder of the brother of the former famous boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa .	-2.2644
They also had an exposé on government spending that focused on the Governor ’ s home town .	-3.6306
And there was a group that kidnapped in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan , a block from the office of the Public Prosecutor .	-11.9787
There was no official word about who was abducted or what happened , so caution was needed when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favourite place of drug traffickers and authorities .	-4.2857
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belongs to the governing Institutional Revolution Party ( PRI ) , which dominated almost all political levels throughout the century .	-4.0838
Recently , several PRI governors have been accused of high-quality cases of corruption .	-2.4928
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant , including one in which a son of " El Chapo " Guzman escaped a military attack .	-3.3993
Only a few months earlier , readers would have considered the Valdez column the most informed source of the kidnapping .	-3.7011
" Before we knew what happened , " said Villarreal , 46 , with the nickname " El Flaco " because of its slim body stature .	-3.6824
'Now all channels of communication with our sources have broken ' .	-2.4004
The Valdez office has been re-dedicated to the storage space for signs and stickers protesting against the murders of journalists , because employees have become something they never expected : activists on behalf of the press .	-4.4884
Reporter Miriam Ramirez snapped a few signs and went to a demonstration next morning for another journalist to the office of the Public Prosecutor .	-3.5839
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the Western state of Michoacan .	-1.8048
A burned body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests that it is his .	-1.9490
Journalists have become more vocal throughout the country by writing down on walls and buildings in organised protests " SOS Press " .	-4.1600
On that day , the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and is trying to gather international support for the judiciary in the Valdez case .	-3.2221
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez , Ramirez accused the authorities of spying and killing journalists because they said the truth .	-3.0128
She has since asked for it to be re-divided by the government , because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity .	-4.4920
Valdez repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were " surrounded " by organised crime , government officials involved and an indifferent society .	-2.5682
In his last book , " Narco-Journalism " , he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs , but also orders from politicians and security forces under a blanket with organised crime .	-4.4981
Last year , the media guard group " Articulo 19 " allocated more than half of the attacks on police and official journalists .	-3.2357
" In Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth , " said Ramirez .	-2.0222
Obviously , the murders have a deterrent effect .	-2.1751
No one forgets the death of bloggerin Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago .	-8.4478
Your body was found along with a note supposedly signed by the Zetas cartel : ' I am here for my reports ' .	-3.0439
A computer keyboard and headphones laid beside their separate head .	-2.1491
Some branches have chosen to close , like the El Norte newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the assassination of the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March .	-3.0323
Others continue , as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of her director in 2004 .	-2.3696
In 2010 , the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drugs cartel with an item on the front page entitled ' What do you want us ? '	-3.6473
Some journalists have fled from their home countries , or even from the country .	-2.4134
It is a painful decision .	-0.8071
It is difficult to find work in exile and they are still watching the roads and looking for dangers .	-2.6239
And they are sometimes hunted , as seems to be the photographer Ruben Espinosa , who was murdered in 2015 , along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City , three months after the flight from Veracruz .	-3.8392
For those who lag behind and continue the work , it is a daily dance with risky decisions .	-3.4252
Ibarra , who once wanted to be poet , admits that drug trafficking scares him .	-2.4476
" Mexico goes to hell , and therefore I was reporter , " he said .	-2.0837
At midnight last Friday , when the last edition was finished , the editors of Riodoce sat in front of the office and drink beer when all their phones started to sum .	-4.5448
A number of shooters with band rivals and security forces near the resort of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed deaths .	-3.0205
The war continued to escalate , as promised by a number of cartel embassies in the region .	-2.6387
From the edge of the boarding stone , they published the news on the Riodoce website by mobile phone .	-4.9431
The front page had to be changed the next day .	-1.2361
Sirenen hulten near - another shooting in the area .	-2.6795
Bojorquez looked at the policemen who held guard to see if they were ready .	-2.4958
If they were afraid , they did not .	-2.9313
Under the huge portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle fingers were visible to all Sinaloa , Riodoce staff followed his track .	-4.8131
" How can you just think of closing it , " said Bojorquez , " when , on the same day that Javier was murdered , the trainee asked me to send it to the streets for reporting . "	-5.1404
Dinosaurs used camouflage to escape their enemies .	-2.7301
At first glance , it looks like a statue , albeit a frightening .	-2.2061
Now researchers have discovered that the first insights of the incredible Nashorn of a Canadian miner were so well preserved that experts described it as " Mona Lisa of Dinosaurs " .	-4.0702
It was so good that they even discovered that his scaly skin was reddish brown - and they said it had something of a " troubled past " .	-4.1348
The report in the Current Biology magazine called it ' the best preserved dinosaur ever found and one of the best dinosaurs in the world ' .	-4.2165
The fossil is a newly discovered kind of nodosaur living in the middle of the Cretan period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .	-9.3163
His incredibly well preserved state has stunned researchers who describe it as " really remarkable " .	-9.6208
According to reports in National Geographic , the vegetable fresher is the best preserved fossil of his kind .	-3.6625
It was found by Shawn Funk when he grub on 21 March 2011 at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta , Canada .	-2.2501
He met something that seemed misplaced by the surrounding rock , and decided to look more closely .	-9.7091
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology .	-2.3639
They spent the next six years revealing the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,100 kg ) of heavy ground clubs .	-3.3130
After all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .	-1.6162
" If you blind only a little with your eyes , you might almost believe that it has slept , " said the main author Caleb Brown , researcher in the Royal Tyrrell Museum , where the creature is to be seen .	-11.0358
" It will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa of Dinosaurs . "	-3.3457
Researchers have found that , although it is covered with an armor and resembles a changing tank , it was probably threatened by meat eating dinosaurs .	-4.9001
The heavily harvested dinosaur used a red and white dark to hide from predators , and used a shielding technology known as counter-shadow used by many modern animals .	-5.0191
This would have allowed mixing in its surroundings better and escaping its enemies , experts say , indicating that it was threatened by greater dinosaurs .	-12.9872
The 110 million years old creature from the Nodosaurians family made headlines in May and is now seen in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology .	-2.9891
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markmitchelli after the Museum Engineer Mark Mitchell , one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours carefully revealing it .	-9.7527
The astonishing preservation of the copy enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the form of scales and armor over his body .	-3.4864
They discovered the counter-shadow , a common defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was darker than its bottom .	-3.2768
Although the shadow is usual , the results are surprising , as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of today 's animals .	-4.3852
It suggests that the dinosaur was driven by sufficient pressure from meat eating dinosaurs that evolution favored the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival .	-3.5293
But most contemporary animals using the shadow - think of Rehe , Zebras , or belt animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey , which signals that this nodosaur was exposed to a real struggle for survival .	-5.2400
" Strong predatory behavior on a massive , highly tankered dinosaur shows how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the circle time must have been , " said Brown .	-5.0281
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was red brown .	-2.2592
Scientists continue to investigate the animal for evidence of his life , including his preserved intestinal content , to find out what it had eaten as his last meal .	-3.7192
They believe that the dinosaur , when he died , was forced into a river and driven out into the sea , where he fell on the back to the sea .	-4.7838
At that time , Alberta was as warm as South Florida today , and rivers and oceans are likely to spread much further on land than they are today .	-3.8950
" This nodosaur is really remarkable because it is completely covered with conserved scaly skin , but also preserved in three dimensions and maintained the original form of the animal , " said Brown .	-3.5427
" The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as it was in early Creytime .	-3.7722
You don 't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it ; if you only shoot your eyes a little , you might almost believe that it is in the sleep . '	-11.5082
Creytime was a time when huge theropods , carnivorous dinosaurs , which were on two legs , passed through the earth .	-4.6570
Although the king of them , the Tyrannosaurus Rex , lived millions of years after Borealopelta , the fractured dinosaur was driven by some of his terrifying ancestors .	-3.7887
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus , a 38 feet ( 11.5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters .	-2.7682
The scientists , whose latest findings appear in the Current Biology magazine , believe that Borealopelta was mummified after death in the sea .	-3.8097
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he grub on March 21 , 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta , Canada .	-2.4805
According to the museum , it is the best preserved danced dinosaur in the world , including skin and armor , and is completely from the snowboard to the hip .	-4.7452
The creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,300 kg ) .	-2.6767
It contained two 20-inch peaks that stood by its shoulders .	-4.1579
Researchers believe that the plant fresh was swamped through Western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea .	-4.6823
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur preserved its armor in exquisite detail .	-2.2600
The stoned remains of this special copy are so well preserved that the skin remains still cover bumpy tank plates along the dinosaur cover .	-4.4965
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic , such a level of conservation is as rare as a profit in the lotto .	-2.9068
The more I look at it , the more confusing it will be .	-1.7828
Stone remains of the skin still cover the bumpy tank plates that carry the skull of the animal .	-3.5341
His right forefoot lies on his side , his five fingers are spread to the top .	-13.5174
I can count the scales on his sole ' .	-1.7135
In Thunderstorm : Mass Carambolage on A8 : Many people injured . . in . in , , in , , , , ,	-10.3466
Far accident on Thursday night on the A8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carambolage .	-3.9711
There are many injured , kilometre-long congestion and gaffer .	-2.6687
On the motorway Stuttgart-Munich ( A8 ) , about 20 people were injured at a mass carambolage on Thursday afternoon .	-4.0723
According to the police , at 5 p.m. between the adjoining stations Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen ( district Aicachach-Friedberg ) during a thunderstorm , almost 30 vehicles , including probably trucks , were combined .	-5.4614
First there is no information about the exact number of injuries .	-3.4156
They are light to medium serious injuries , said a police speaker .	-3.2419
A huge amount of rescue vehicles was at the accident office . in , was .	-10.6835
The A8 was completely locked in the direction of Munich .	-2.4485
In the direction of Munich , an estimated ten kilometres long backdust was formed .	-4.1442
As an AZ reporter reported , there were massive disabilities on the opposite track - through numerous gaffers .	-5.5795
The fire brigade noted the characteristics of the vehicle drivers , who are now expecting sensitive penalties .	-4.0702
Shortly after 18 : 45 a second accident took place on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and Dasing .	-2.3868
There was a collision between a car transporter and a car .	-2.8611
A rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident .	-3.1406
Deutsche Bahn : Group tests " Comfort Check-in "	-1.7177
It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced before : you don 't know anything about sitting in the train and sleeping .	-5.1504
Or one is deeper in his work and has a brilliant idea .	-3.4902
And then : bufff .	-1.1855
Come and arouse an unsoft or tear the passenger in the middle of the workflow .	-4.7645
Ticket control .	-1.5028
But the times of interruption are over soon .	-2.4862
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the fair-free ticket control .	-3.5411
You simply confirm by mobile that you take your seat and devalue the ticket .	-3.6511
Currently , one test operation runs on two tracks .	-10.3022
" If the offer arrives , we extend it .	-2.8994
It is expected to be available at many other distance routes in Germany early next year , " said a railway speaker .	-4.1186
" Comfort Check-in " calls the railway ticket devaluation without a crew .	-4.4179
To be able to use them , however , some requirements need to be met : you need a smartphone or a tablet .	-4.4886
And you have to have booked an online ticket - what most passengers do anyway .	-4.2312
It is also necessary to have bought the DB Navigator via the app of the railway , which is the most convenient way of booking tickets anyway .	-5.1232
Finally , you need a seat reservation .	-2.5480
Because " Comfort Check-in " works like this : you get into the train , you call your ticket under " My Tickets " .	-4.6113
A button for electronic devaluation will appear with the test customers .	-3.6197
The train pets will be notified to their mobile devices that passenger X is in train and that Y has taken the booked seat .	-4.5144
When the train companion checks Y , he knows that there is a passenger with an already devalued online ticket .	-5.1053
So you can sleep , continue working , remain silent .	-3.4374
The " Check-in " has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the railway - which in turn should use the passenger .	-3.7654
" If you want to travel easily without ticket control by our train accompanying staff , you can check in the DB Navigator by yourself .	-5.5075
This allows passengers to make their travel time more personal in the train , " says Michael Peterson , Marketing Board of DB Far Traffic .	-3.6956
Second plus : " And our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs " .	-3.7332
Those who often travel on the railway know that , in addition to delays and missing trains , ticket controls are one of the greatest troubles .	-5.3574
It is often the case that one of the passengers does not have all the documents needed to degrade online tickets .	-5.7255
Either the credit card or the identity card or any other document you have to show . , , , , , , , , in , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-13.0192
As a result , there are endless discussions between train guides and passengers , which leads to poor mood in the department or large room and delays in controlling one 's own ticket and , at the end of the day , takes time for the creator to take care of other concerns .	-12.6096
Only a small number of test customers can still use the new service .	-2.3025
And this even only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart food .	-2.8903

How an activist came to learn the answer to the question : ' Whose Streets ? '	-2.1111
On 9 August 2014 , Brittany Ferrell was shocked to her core .	-1.6309
Only one day after she arrived in New York City , the born in St. Louis born on the bed of an Airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone .	-3.7056
She stumbled over a post by someone from the High School .	-1.7954
" The police have just killed an 18-year-old child , and it is still on the street , " said it .	-3.5321
Confused because nobody else had posted the information on their feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .	-2.2092
A user with the handle <unk> TheePharoah has been retweeted constantly on their timeline .	-9.1689
The rapper from the area of St. Louis was killing the death of Michael Brown , an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed live by a white policeman in Ferguson , Mo .	-3.5450
He posted a picture of Brown ’ s lively body that was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours .	-3.1933
" That is wild " , Ferrell thought himself .	-3.1967
But death was nothing new to them and their community .	-1.7273
She deposited her mobile phone to return to tweets later in the evening on people on the Canfield Drive .	-3.5666
There were photographs of the police band and people who screened and of a man who claimed to be Brown 's father who was born a sign with the inscription : ' Ferguson 's police just killed my unarmed son ! '	-5.3283
She watched a live feed in which a policeman stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a brilliant dog .	-3.2754
In another video , she said , another policeman unsecured his gun and shouted : ' I will kill you ... animals all killed ' .	-4.4935
" That is not common " , Ferrell remembered her statement .	-2.7396
'This is not the kind of murder we have accustomed to and which we can typically call ' .	-3.1118
At this moment I felt a shake-frost .	-2.4872
I was angry and wept . '	-1.6585
She booked a return flight and went home the next day .	-1.7834
After landing at 23 p.m. , she picked up her six-year daughter from her father ’ s house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning .	-4.7884
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the next three years is the theme of a new documentary , " Whose Streets ? " , in the cinemas from the 11 .	-3.4233
It is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance that consists of people who live in the Community and have filled the roads to demand answers .	-3.5598
When Ferrell went to Ferguson with her daughter , wearing a flower cloth and a matching crown , the two talked about a conversation that they had countless times before this morning » about the black experience and the black condition <unk> .	-4.9064
" You remember how I taught you when black people must fight for what they believe ? " she remembered what she said .	-2.5845
" We are now going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that was not right .	-3.2042
I could not take her with her , " said Ferrell later .	-2.0820
" What happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .	-2.7260
They need to know it and see it and be raised in it .	-3.0598
It must be well developed , not only activism and organisation , but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution , and what we must do to free ourselves .	-3.8690
Although I am fortunate to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience blatant racism , she is no different from the next black women 's child .	-3.6495
I have the feeling that I would be doing her a bad job of keeping them out of it . '	-3.4283
The first station when they arrived in Ferguson was located at the South Florissant Road , a place opposite the police office , which became a campsite when the activists waited for the possible non-charges of Officer Darren Wilson .	-4.8330
Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who served lunch there .	-3.3792
They prepared bags and helped pass them on to demonstrators .	-1.8653
Slowly , a new kind of activism for Ferrell started to take shape .	-1.6501
" My activism changed totally after 9 August , " she said and noticed that she was the President of Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on eating justice and health inequalities in black communities .	-3.8887
" I had no experience in organizing .	-1.6823
Everything has come . '	-1.9011
Weeks later , Ferrell met during an evening demonstration Sabah Folayan , one of the co-directors of the film .	-2.3425
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado Farrar only wanted to " document " what happened .	-1.9740
One question Ferrell asked was : ' Do you want to document or try to find a story you can exploit ? '	-3.2423
This skepticism was fed by countless cases of people , often white - in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience .	-2.8594
As Folayan said recently in an interview : ' We had heard people born and grown up in Ferguson have not centred their votes and we wanted to do it differently ' .	-3.7071
Folayan had already worked with the then co-director Damon Davis , an artist from the field known for his activism around death row inmates .	-3.2317
Ferrell 's commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project , together with six other locals followed the team of " Whose Streets ? " in the years after Brown 's sh.	-4.1903
" This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks to us .	-2.7163
'That was the main thing for me , as these people are presented , for that is how I will be presented . '	-4.1410
The aim was not to focus on Ferrell 's experience - to show that the movement " is not a Messias guide , but a community that comes together , " said Folayan - she turned out to be the most open participant in the film .	-4.0294
As a result , documents from " Whose Streets ? " show surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell 's life as she loves and marries her wife .	-2.9970
" I felt like naked , " said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time .	-7.3189
'But I understand that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanisation of black people . '	-3.0826
Ferrell ’ s history also repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black Live Matter movement .	-2.6548
Two of the three founders of the movement who , after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 , identified the film " BlacklivesMatter " in social media , are gay .	-2.9462
" Black , gay women in leadership positions have borne the movement as a whole , " said Ferrell , " and so we are constantly fighting on different fronts .	-3.5859
Black and gay women must bear the brunt of everything . '	-1.7731
Folayan agreed to note that " the movement really is maintained by black women and many black women " .	-2.6642
However , she insists that " this is not an affirmative type of action " , where Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity .	-3.4204
" She was the person who ravaged this energy , " she said .	-2.3112
" It is no coincidence , although she was at the forefront , because in a life at these crossings as a black gay woman there is so much at stake .	-4.3324
You can feel their energy through the screen . '	-1.9779
The news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared , but the racist links between the community and the police continue .	-10.0220
Ferrell is proven for 2 <unk> years because of the blocking of a motorway at a demonstration .	-3.7771
She describes the area 's political atmosphere , which she calls her home : ' A chaos ' .	-3.8989
Nevertheless , she is clinging to a singing and she is committed to this memory since she went to the streets in Ferguson three years ago .	-5.1753
" It is our duty to fight for our freedom .	-0.8672
It is our duty to win .	-0.8595
We must love one another and support it .	-1.4537
We have nothing to lose except our chains . '	-1.2503
From " dream " to " magnificent " : TV readers discuss bit gallery .	-12.0612
The bit gallery moves people although it is far from built .	-3.0333
But the idea of a shopping centre on the southern side of the pedestrian zone has divided the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation of 2009 .	-3.8419
Cold the subject hardly leaves one thing .	-4.0529
The subject is also discussed on our Facebook page " Volksfreund Bitburg " .	-2.8063
While some say to the bit gallery : " This would be a dream " ( Anja Becker ) or " That would be real class " ( Nicole Shouts ) , the other side comes from " Do not need a person " ( Siggi Betzen ) or quite simply " Great Mission ! " ( Lars Scholz ) .	-7.4177
While advocates rely on a gallery to attract more customers to the city , benefiting the rest of the business , opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will bleed .	-5.4987
In addition , the gallery is planned on the very site where the farmer market hall stands , where 13 direct marketers offer their products .	-4.6977
With the beginning of the construction work this will stop .	-3.4860
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - at the Beda Square with possibility of sitting outside .	-12.7262
Simone Rooms : " We have been buying in the farmers market hall for almost many years .	-3.3948
Our eggs , as well as the delicious cakes of the countryside , are always very happy .	-4.2197
We also discovered the butchery .	-1.4023
We would like to see this offer sustained even during and , above all , after the construction of the gallery .	-3.8852
Other cities have that .	-3.1447
In particular , the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . '	-2.2976
Gerd Densing : " Whether direct marketers are located in a market hall in the gallery depends on the amount of the rent .	-3.7555
This should not be very low in the new project , however . '	-4.2514
Eva Kilic : " Why shopping palaces in Bitburg ?	-1.9512
Whether clothing , shoes , drugs or supermarkets : I find this superfluous .	-10.2696
There is enough of that in our city .	-2.6026
One can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .	-10.9103
However , since there is not even a proper weekly market , it is all the more important that we at least maintain the market hall .	-4.3032
After all , the goods offered there are fresh , largely offered directly by the producer and is cheap .	-4.7532
As you can see , shops in a shopping center are rented only by larger companies , because rents there are often not sustainable for a retailer .	-4.7369
Sadly , there are almost no more specialized shops and what is left of them will probably disappear . '	-5.5003
Wolf Fandel : " A shopping centre with a market hall does not fit for me .	-2.2991
And the gallery does not fit into Bitburg .	-1.8204
Above all , where should the farmers market hall go during the construction period ?	-3.6555
The old edeka would be the solution - even in the long term if the bit gallery actually .	-3.4462
Or does the specter Bit Gallery manage to sell all shops from Bitburg before ? '	-4.1411
George Marquet : " This simply will not work .	-1.7551
And no one needs a shopping centre empty .	-2.2263
I think it would have been better to promote a real farming market rather than this gallery .	-10.3312
However , for a farming market hall , there is no room for any longer thanks to the insane many - I think - pointless construction projects in Bitburg .	-5.6440
If the farming market hall is broken , another piece of culture will disappear . '	-2.7904
A similarity : Artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA .	-2.0635
In the middle of the Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces - white , black and brown , which are almost imperceptible - that are hanging on the ceiling .	-4.2933
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen doppers and hair sections sent to her by Chelsea Manning .	-3.4807
Manning sent the sections from Fort Leavenworth prison , where the former intelligence analyst served a 35-year prison sentence after publishing classified diplomatic messages on the WikiLeaks website .	-4.9377
The new exhibition , which was opened on 2nd August , is called A Becoming Resemblance ( a simil) .	-3.3509
It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg , whose discipline combined its expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Manning , a transfrau and a pioneering dissident whose condemnation was converted by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office .	-4.4450
Dewey-Hagborg , through the algorithmic analysis of DNA , extracted by Manning and created from 30 portraits , as someone could look like these genomic data , has a sharp , albeit intellectual comment not only on the form of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also on identity .	-5.7255
Manning , born as Bradley Edward , but has spoken openly about identification as a woman since her puberty , was condemned in 2013 for 20 charges , including six violations of the spy law , computer fraud , and theft .	-3.3859
Through the prison , her image was suppressed , so much so that there was only one photo - a grained black and white self-fit in which manning is clearly uncomfortably sitting on a driver 's seat and wearing a platinum blonde wig - with which she was associated .	-5.8697
In 2015 , Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of her 2012 project ' Stranger Visions ' .	-2.8718
In this , the artist produced portraits of foreign artifacts such as cigarette stumbling and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to produce an image of what these people might look like .	-4.4593
This was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine .	-9.0628
" They performed an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , " said Dewey-Hagborg at a press review of the new exhibition .	-3.7013
And she could not be visited at this time and she could not be photographed , so she took contact with Chelsea and asked her whether she wanted to make a DNA portrait .	-3.6511
The artist and her detained music became unequal letter figures who exchanged several letters over two years .	-4.3413
They even created a comic " suppressed images " illustrated by Shoili Kanungo , who predicted a future in which President Chelsea 's judgment would convert and would be able to see the exhibition personally .	-3.5771
Indeed , just a few days after the book was published , Obama would call for Manning ’ s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome kind of happy me.	-2.9643
There is also something deep and strong about opening the exhibition , as Donald Trump is waging a war against officials from the government camp and against Transgender troops to find new , tweetable ways to further escape the rigid divisions that he should repair .	-5.9175
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said that ' things happen for a certain reason ' .	-2.8488
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Manning demanded an end to " automatic fragmentation , based on gender , race , sexuality and culture . "	-3.9569
On the opposite wall their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand feet of Cs and Gs and As , is written in pencil .	-3.4314
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show how astonishingly similar , at least in biological terms , we are all .	-2.8082
" What people will hopefully take with them is that our genome is not concerned about who we are and how open genetic data are for interpretation and how subjective they are , " said Dewey-Hagborg , whose video work of 2007 , Spurious Memories , is also to be seen .	-3.7632
'DNA data can tell so many different stories , so that is the 30 of these stories . '	-2.7973
The last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in its own room , is a page from the above mentioned comic novel .	-10.0206
She shows Manning how she appears with a mobile phone in hand from the United States ’ disciplinary barracks like King Kong .	-4.6645
" When they cold your speech , they won , " it says .	-3.1440
" So never stop the mouth " .	-1.9366
" It came directly from a letter she wrote to me , " said the artist who greets from Philadelphia .	-2.4125
'I still get goose skin when I talk about it ' .	-2.7306
Manning has not yet personally seen the exhibition - as foreseen in the comic book - but if she should do it , it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks , by her own genomic simulation , which shape like hordes of protesters .	-5.7026
This was also targeted , as in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 " 2 , Manning 's stature ) , where their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil .	-4.5534
" In the past I had it on the wall , but I wanted it to feel like a crowd , " said Dewey-Hagborg of the portraits .	-9.4609
" I wanted it to feel like a mass movement formed with Chelsea , such as the movement that was also behind its liberation . "	-8.4486
Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of the University of Oxford is looking for killing for killing .	-2.9506
A nationwide celebration is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of the University of Oxford , who are sought as suspects after a man was born in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries .	-5.0172
On Monday , Wyndham Lathem ( 42 ) and Andrew Warren ( 56 ) arrest warrants were issued for murders because of their alleged participation in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau , as the files of the Court of Office of Cook County show .	-3.7168
The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau , 26 , died after several stitches .	-1.7935
A Community warning system published by the Chicago police authority states that the body was discovered on 27 July .	-2.6042
Civil servants received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .	-10.9838
Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead in the place of events , and detectives examine the stitch as murder , while the police actively search for the two suspects , said officials .	-4.1636
Lathem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007 .	-2.0515
Alan K. Cubbbage , Vice-President of University Relations , said in an email statement that Lathem has now been in vacation and was excluded from entering Northwestern University Campus .	-3.6746
" This is now a criminal matter investigated by the competent authorities , and Northwestern University is cooperating in this investigation , " said Cubbbage .	-2.8397
Warren is a Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford . in . in .	-9.0001
A speaker from the University and Somerville College said in an email statement that ' we are in contact with the UK police and ready to help the US investigation authorities in every possible way ' .	-3.3704
The statement added that Warren ’ s colleagues were shocked and want him to stand .	-3.0442
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Authority , Anthony Guglielmi , said that he urge the suspects to confront the authorities .	-2.7832
" The police have an idea of their place of residence , and our efforts to localize them are intensifying , " said Guglielmi .	-3.2317
Guglielmi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the suspects .	-1.7570
Guglielmi said that the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received a puzzling tip saying that something happened in apartment 1008 .	-3.3901
The police described the scene as very cruel .	-0.9908
Guglielmi said that it is unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July .	-2.4132
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building .	-1.5877
" We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship , " said Guglielmi .	-1.6256
The management team of Grand Plaza issued a statement to the inhabitants : ' The police are currently working on the timeline and background of the victim and exploring a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident ' .	-3.8736
" We will conclude the WADA road map in the near future " - Russian Vice-Prime Minister Mutko	-2.6375
Russian Vice Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that it will not take long for the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) to be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti-doping agency ( RUSADA ) .	-2.8612
" At a certain stage in meeting the road map criteria , RUSADA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD ( UK Anti-Doping ) .	-3.0685
The WADA road map has been updated in this respect , " explained Mutko on Thursday .	-2.5313
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA roadmap to comply with the code describing the criteria for reinstating RUSADA and was recently published on the organization 's website .	-3.8018
According to Mutko , it contains nothing that could give Russia cause for concern .	-2.2707
" Everything was announced , everything is implemented .	-11.5749
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and WADA in the near future , " he added .	-1.8678
However , one of the criteria mentioned in the list notes that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by the WADA by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren to allegedly supported state doping in Russian sport .	-4.1865
In relation to the matter , Mutko said : " We are carrying out the investigation because our anti-doping system has admitted a mistake .	-13.8928
All measures have been implemented .	-1.3925
But there were no public programmes and we will not admit something that does not exist . '	-3.2503
Mutko ’ s words agreed with those of Vitaly Smirnov , the head of the independent Russian anti-doping Commission .	-2.3802
In talking to Russian sales office RSport at the beginning of the day , Smirnov added problems to the past in Russian anti-doping organisations , but then added : ' We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .	-3.7340
No one intends to accept this report unconditionally , ' added Smirnov .	-2.1471
RUSADA was excluded from the execution of doping controls in Russia in November 2015 as part of the WADA doping scandal .	-3.3384
However , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping ( UKAD ) .	-2.2925
After a visit to Moscow 's headquarters in July , WADA Director-General Olivier Niggli declared that RUSADA is moving " in the right direction " to be reinstated .	-3.7417
Aldi no longer sells eggs for the moment	-2.7548
This was shared by the business groups .	-3.8817
It was a purely precautionary measure , and no health impairment could be assumed , as the commun.	-5.2257
From now on , only eggs are likely to be delivered to Aldi , which have been proven to have been tested negatively on fipronil-containing anti-cleaning agents .	-5.2100
Aldi wanted to bring clarity and transparency to its customers .	-3.7230
The start-ups that will help your company not to become the next Uber .	-13.6016
Amy Errett wanted to measure luck with your employees at your e-commerce start up , but the polls did not work .	-3.0507
Answers were often vague , little helpful or - even worse - fraudulent .	-2.2213
And even if you promised anonymity , some workers did not trust the process .	-2.0798
" There was simply never consistency and objectivity , " said Errett , who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Society Madison Reed .	-2.5513
She called for help from outside people .	-2.0004
A new breed of the Human Resources start-ups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel .	-9.9175
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it enables companies to carry out surveys , address special groups and demographic groups , offer anonymity and complaint hotlines , and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass C-Suite executives and directly contact the Board of Directors .	-4.8404
" You now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit for the pursuit of your health , but where is the fitbit for your company ? " said Jim Barnett , co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure engagement .	-3.7311
Sadly said that they gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel with Glint in the three years .	-3.9621
In addition to the snap surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat card of the company , which shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which executives have low consent results - so you can drill down why .	-4.9788
Companies come to realise that they must remain at the top of job culture , so that you do not become the next Uber who has been involved in scandals since a former employee has posted a blog post describing an environment of harassment where those who have spoken have been punished .	-5.0838
For start-ups like Glint , this desire for an overview is a lucrative business option .	-11.9839
Global governance , regulation , and compliance could have more than $ 118.7 billion in 2020 , according to the financial site Let 's Talk Payments .	-2.2841
Denver , Colorado , Start-up Convercent , which helps companies prevent and recognize bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity in discredit in the midst of the Uber case earlier this year .	-3.8596
Convercent has nearly 600 clients , including Airbnb , Microsoft and Tesla .	-1.8397
Uber recently registered as a client .	-0.9210
As Glint , convert companies send customized pulse surveys , collect confidential answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas .	-4.2536
It also provides an anonymous SMS hotline to enable employees to report bad behavior .	-3.0565
And if the Managing Director is involved , complaints will go directly to the Supervisory Board .	-3.1276
" The Court of Public opinion captured the regulators , " said Patrick Quinlan , the founder and managing director of Convercent .	-2.6905
If a company is found that treats its employees poorly or behaves unethically , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycott , worker fluctuation and complaints , Quinlan said .	-4.2180
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations , has deployed Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to reach their headquarters .	-4.3549
In earlier times , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or e-mail for the corporate headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously .	-3.8484
It was often intimidation and inconvenient experience , said James Vitrano , Ruby Tuesday ’ s General Counsel , who said that there was no good way to follow the complaints of employees .	-3.4063
Now that the company uses Convercent , problems previously hidden by executives in cities or states , such as discrimination , harassment or unfair internships , can be identified and addressed more quickly .	-4.3933
" I can get closer to this holistic , 360-degree view to the experience of employment , " said Vitrano , who leads the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday .	-3.9896
'And we protect our shareholders from employment disputes ' .	-2.6044
Companies began to take ethics , values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical violations by the Enron scandal , Quinlan said .	-3.7619
But it took until the " social media came to their right " that companies realised that you could not prevent their dirty linen from going online .	-4.0532
" Before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , " he said .	-1.6178
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service and charge companies with recurring fees for using their products .	-3.3951
It is a business model and an opportunity that will gain the approval of Venture Capital investors , who supported both start-ups .	-3.9647
Convercent received $ 10 million in funding from firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital in February , raising the total capital to $ 47 million .	-2.9081
Glitzers secured $ 10 million in November of Bessemer Venture Partners and put all of its funding at $ 60 million .	-3.2286
These investments are hardly surprising , given the interconnected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .	-2.3464
There is a growing research complex that shows that today 's employees expect more from their jobs than they have done so far .	-3.3191
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley , high salaries and interesting projects are only deployments .	-2.6169
The employees want to feel that you are accepted and estimated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .	-3.7426
" If people are happy to be in a company that belongs to their voices , and that the work you do is worthwhile , then they feel more committed to making this company successful , " said Nina McQueen , Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn , which uses both Convercent and Glint .	-3.6988
Investors yield returns when their portfolio companies are well running , and when employees are employed and engaged .	-4.5024
If the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase their commitment and employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .	-3.8846
The data on employee engagement according to the experts of the workplace culture important .	-3.8095
But the data is useless if the managers of a company do not take action .	-3.2034
Indeed , if a company asks employees about your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way .	-3.3955
And if change does not come quickly enough , or if it does not , it can breed disappointments and demotivate employees .	-10.7978
" If you are asking for 4,000 suggestions , you must be prepared to have 4,000 talks , " said Russell Raath , President of Consulting at the Kotter International Business Management company , who has seen companies that have too much relied on collecting data .	-4.8972
" Because if you do not follow staff will ask , " Have you really heard me ?	-10.0587
Are you concerned about this ?	-1.7091
Who do you not care , why should I ? '	-2.6145
Madison Reed , now conducting monthly employee surveys , was able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported about Glint , saved . .	-15.7805
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees , it was capable of reorganizing multiple teams within the company and adding a communication training to tackle problems .	-3.8754
At Ruby Tuesday , the company always gains new insights into employees , and it hopes that in the long run this will lead to a better link between workers in an industry known for high turnover .	-5.1411
" If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , " said Vitrano .	-1.7960
" And if you lose people , you lose customers too .	-2.3437
And if you lose customers , you will lose business .	-2.2130
The NCAA eliminates the two-day practices and makes a long day for the Bruin for a long .	-3.8472
It 's up to 23 o 'clock when a lot of UCLA football players are entertaining on a page of the team 's new exercise fields on .	-14.5082
Some have extracted their tricotop parts and show their back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .	-4.5166
For a good part of the team , these idle minutes represent a lunch break .	-2.0545
Players who are registered for the summer courses will return to their final examinations after the three-hour exercise , before they return to the Waterman Football Center the next morning at 6 : 30 p.m.	-11.4606
" This is a real treasure mill for the next three days for the boys , " said Bruins trainer Jim Mora shortly before Monday became Tues.	-3.9953
NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to facilitate the burden of players and has actually extended their days , at least until the final on Friday .	-3.9477
Therefore , the first three UCLA training courses should start at 19 : 15 in order to meet the player 's already completed timetables .	-5.1959
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins postponed the camp almost a week after the last season and practiced exercises at the summer school for the first time during six playing hours in Westwood .	-5.3086
During the August 18 exercises , 20 before the start of formal game preparations for their launch against Texas A & M in September .	-4.7955
Mora said that he supports NCAA change , even if they add another point to player ’ s busy routes .	-3.9542
" We place this enormous burden on them three or four days , and it is very challenging , " said Mora .	-2.4592
" And they simply pushed it through , they continue to plague , they are great people .	-3.8162
I think that as soon as we get to Saturday and have more time , it will be really great ' .	-3.5674
UCLA will finish its practices once the camp has finished , which will not be an easy task in view of the clear visibility lines of its fields from an adjacent car park and the adjacent Luskin Center , a high-class hotel that has already been thrown with footballs that cleaned up a network behind a peat post .	-7.0405
Bruins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mora admitted that there might be a problem once these rooms are free during the season .	-4.0104
" We will use our security , " said Mora .	-1.9876
" This is a real problem , and it is not very far-reaching to think that people are renting a room there and then preparing to record an exercise there .	-4.6273
If you have the video book of an exercise , it is quite a good business .	-3.6076
But we have security forces there and we have security forces on parking 8 .	-2.6126
We will do the best with what we have .	-1.2814
I am not too concerned , therefore .	-2.6311
We have a plan ' .	-0.8732
Facebook wants to intensify facts review in the fight against counterfeit news .	-2.7039
Facebook wants to send more potential articles containing false reports to third parties and then display their results under the original article , said the world 's largest online social network on Thursday .	-4.9911
The company stated in an opinion on its website that it will begin using updated machine learning methods to detect possible false messages and send them to fact checkers who may display results of the facts examination from the original article .	-5.6403
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news , many of which believe that they also influenced US presidential elections in 2016 .	-2.8307
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with French voters flooding with false stories in the run-up to the May presidential election , and Germany supports a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to eliminate hateful postings quickly as they did before the September elections .	-4.3216
On Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new facts will be launched in the US , France , the Netherlands , and Germany .	-11.8456
" In addition to knowing which stories are contested by fact-checkers of third parties , people want more context to make sound decisions about what they read and share , " said Sara Su , product manager for Facebook news in a blog .	-3.9442
She added that Facebook will continue to test his feature on the " related article " and will work on other changes to his message feed to reduce incorrect messages .	-2.9927
Creating a comic novel : A castle in the history of England	-2.3488
In his recent past , the small Scotney Castle was shown in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s .	-3.1563
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cosy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become the inspiration for a graphical novel by Jamie Rhodes , a mophaaric Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents .	-4.3329
" I find it so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years , " he says horribly .	-4.0891
'What a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand ' .	-1.5721
'A Castle in England ' encompasses the time from the Middle Ages to the Age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney .	-3.9946
It is not the first book of Rhodes , based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 ' Dead Men 's Teeth and Other Stories ' , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotionally .	-2.9160
" I only reacted to the thumb print on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700s who worked for the Jacobiners , " he says .	-11.1617
" This is his thumbnail print .	-10.3285
And letters always smoke , because at that time one burned up a fire because of light .	-3.8052
For someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he were himself .	-4.1680
Oh , I love archives ! '	-0.9954
For someone beaten with old papers , supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council of England and lived in a castle almost four months ( " To be honest : I 've overvalued my welcome greeting a little ) , this seems all too beautiful to be true .	-5.4582
Rhodos spent his days exploring the Victorian " new " castle , watching the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle , such as the mounted Hyanese heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch .	-3.6718
He walked through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle and talked with landscape carers , gardeners and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .	-3.7530
Then , at night he drank " Whiskey and began writing " .	-8.2566
The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown , since National Trust was given full access only in 2006 , when the last heir , Elizabeth Hussey , died .	-3.2358
When Rhodes arrived a decade later , employees just began to look after the archive he described as " hundreds of years in which aristocrats said " Oh , throw it on the top " .	-3.8459
Diaries , letters from the time of the English Empire , maps that represent who owned what : " You might think that land conflicts would be boring , " says Rhodes , " but there was a birch to fought for the two families .	-4.0880
Boys , let everything go ! '	-1.6856
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive into English history on a broader basis , including ' The Labourer ' , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381 .	-4.4961
" There is a record of a turmoil that occurred in 1380 in the castle , in this book entitled ' Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex ' , says Rhodes .	-2.9247
" The uprising began in this area and I thought a uprising was a good beginning .	-2.9606
Perhaps the two are connected ? '	-1.6196
Other stories are deeply rooted in the history of the castle , such as the ' The Priest ' , which tells the story of the Jesuit Pater , which the Darrell family hidden for seven years during English reform .	-4.8092
Or the ' The Smuggler ' , which depicts the smuggler Arthur Darrell from the 18th century , who staged his own burial by filling a coffin with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his sarg was excavated ) .	-4.6665
The Darrels are Rhodes ' favorite family of Scotney : " The men seemed to be pretty gauners , make debts and spend money on things they could not afford .	-4.7372
Other generations of Darrell men triggered their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a pile of good boys , with a talent to advertise peas . '	-3.5672
After the end of his operation in the castle , Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experience .	-4.0910
He had a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel over Elämäki , the site of a sanatorium from the early twentieth century , which has since been demanded by nature .	-5.5441
But Scotney has a special place for him .	-1.1255
" I was sad to go again , " he says .	-0.9825
It was like ' Oh , now I have to deal with the damned life ' .	-3.1617
Launched Campaign : More than 300 years old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf hidden in Rhöndorf .	-4.6828
With the covering of the 301 years old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf , the city of Bad Honnef launched its campaign to introduce a new roof brand ( Rundschau of Thursday ) on Friday .	-4.4371
Until Thursday , Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and slogan secret .	-2.3347
At the end of August there will be a celebration on the island of Grafenwerth .	-3.0640
'Too nice for us .	-2.5023
Or ? " , since yesterday the makers of the action ask on the posters at the Rhöndorfer Chapel .	-3.8796
" We don 't really think of this ( of course ! ) , they write on their yesterday unlocked website .	-4.7596
" But we use this measure to attract your attention .	-1.4930
And to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .	-7.9316
We are basically firmly convinced that we , as a bath honnefer , know very well about the beauty and attractiveness of our city . '	-5.0089
The action is about more than ' just ' a logo and a slogan , it goes on .	-3.1284
" It is necessary to formulate a single promise , one that gives the city an unmistakable unique characteristic of its own stat. , , , , , , , , in in , , , , , . , , , , and , is . ,	-15.8739

Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan 's fear of the army	-1.4900
Every year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( YAS ) advises on retirement and transportation in the Officer Corps .	-3.2929
That is also the week .	-2.2557
At first glance a normal procedure .	-1.6093
But nothing is routine with the Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt .	-2.4205
The sitting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff , as before , but in the Presidency of the Prime Minister .	-3.7606
The consultations under the chairmanship of the Head of Government now include the five Vice-Prime Ministers and the Ministers for Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs .	-3.8604
The YAS civilians were thus overwhelmed .	-3.8533
The government is attracting reins in the military .	-1.9001
Although Hulusi Akar ’ s chief of staff remains in office , the army ’ s commanders , the air force , and the navy were deported .	-4.4223
Since the failed coup , Head of State Erdogan fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals .	-7.8703
More than 10,000 soldiers have been removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the exil-preacher Fethullah Gülen , who Erdogan sees as a coup attempt .	-4.6635
For 486 people directly involved in the coup attempt , negotiations have been taking place in Ankara this week .	-3.4528
On the day after the coup , Erdogan had called the crash attempt " God 's gift " as he gave him the opportunity to " fully clean " the armed forces .	-5.2292
But does Erdogan really have the army under control ?	-1.8478
At the end of February , the newspaper " Hürriyet " published an article entitled " Unease in the military headquarters " .	-2.5391
In the general staff there are concerns about an increasing " Islamization " of the army , which , among other things , manifest itself in the lifting of the ban on headscarves for soldiers , wrote the newspaper .	-4.6327
At any rate , the great purification of the army and the security forces continues .	-3.5259
In mid-July , Erdogan caused another 7395 state servants to fire by decree , including 2303 police officers and 546 soldiers .	-3.3832
It seemed as if Erdogan had tamed the military .	-1.8417
The generals used to be the real masters of the country .	-2.8375
Three times , they clamped into their role as guardians of the secular order . , , , , was in . , was , , , , ,	-9.9455
Following his 2002 election victory , Erdogan pushed back the military ’ s power step by step , not least in invoking the reform requirements of the European Union .	-4.7912
Former officers say that Erdogan is targeting Islamisation of the armed forces .	-3.1656
In the Vocal Europe magazine , a nominally unnamed officer who sought asylum for fear of persecution abroad , the Turkish army will be ' full of extremists and salafists ' in a few years ' time .	-4.5027
If that is true , such a development could not leave NATO cold .	-2.5615
In any case , after the cleansing , there are doubts about the Turkish army ’ s willingness to operate .	-3.7746
The governance structures and operational skills are " weakened " , say NATO diplomats .	-2.4086
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card	-1.4072
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the Green Card rules , said President Donald Trump , quoted by the media .	-1.8722
It provides for the reduction of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stricter rules for obtaining visas for temporary work permits and restrictions on family visas .	-3.5574
The new rules are being proposed by the Republicans and supported by the president in .	-8.8730
The bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .	-2.5856
'This law will reduce poverty , raise wages , and save billions of dollars for taxpayers , and will do so by changing the way in which citizens from other countries are spent Green Cards ' .	-9.4105
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .	-1.2916
This new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English , who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , " said Trump , quoted by the American media .	-3.1904
Ministry wants to repair track for racetrack shuttle . in . in , , in , , , , , , , , , , and , , , , , , , , , ,	-17.9195
Over the past few months , the future of the racing shuttle has been disputed - now it is going very quickly .	-5.5857
Before the end of the year it will be built on the marshy track on which the tourist railway runs .	-5.7957
In order to safeguard the future of the racing shuttle in the long term , according to the Ministry of Transport , construction work will begin on the track this year .	-4.8862
" With the decision to continue ordering and repairing the route Ilmenau , the country commits itself to this connection , which is particularly important for tourism , " said Transport Secretary Klaus Sehl on Friday in Erfurt .	-6.1348
The cost of repairing the route was around EUR 2.5 million .	-2.5649
From this sum , the country takes over 75 % .	-3.3062
The treaty on which the shuttle will continue to be ordered from the country will be finally voted , explained sie .	-12.1294
The Ministry and the South Hurring Railway as operator are already agreed on the technical details .	-2.9280
" Thus the road map , the vehicles used and the quality standards negotiated , " said Sehl .	-3.0800
The planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be concluded for 11 years .	-2.3966
This will regularly order the Racecourse Shuttle on December 2017 .	-3.9900
The racetrack shuttle is one of the most popular railway links between the railway stations of Ilmenau and the racetrack .	-5.4575
In recent months , a pilot factory tested whether the route of sufficient numbers of people would be used to order it again in the future .	-5.3103
The track is also very due in parts .	-3.3444
The rise of sex robots is real , and we should worry about it .	-2.1880
Especially when you thought that 2017 cannot become even more crazy , a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots comes .	-4.1635
Yes , indeed .	-0.7501
Sex robots are a big thing at the moment .	-1.8269
Recently , the Foundation for Responsible Robotics ( Foundation for Responsible Robotics ) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years .	-2.1288
According to Noel Sharkey , emerged professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR , we must begin to take their rise seriously .	-2.5195
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its form of breast warp and the type of fingernagel .	-3.1696
" People are funny about them , but businesses supply a lot of it , and we will see them even more frequently , " said Mr Sharkey when he publishes his new report . , , . , , , , , , , , I , , , . , I , , , , . , , I , , . , ,	-16.5238
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners into robots with a silicone skin that feels warm , deliberately human reactions achieved through artificial intelligence .	-3.7168
The user can also " adapt " his robot according to his convictions , choosing everything from the color of the robot to the form of the breast warts to the type or color of his fingernails .	-11.3168
But it becomes even more worrying , as many robots have the " personalities " that would make a Stepford woman look progressive .	-3.7293
Modern sex dolls have become robots with a silicone skin .	-2.2178
The RealBotix robot , for example , allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing , such as shy .	-12.7054
And then there is the Roxxxy Gold Sex Robot , developed by True Companion , with preprogrammed figures like " Frigid Farrah " , which gives the impression of shy and " Wild Wendy " with an " adventurous " personality .	-10.4685
" Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is as well adapted as possible to your personality , " swarms the True Companion website .	-3.3343
So she likes what you like , and she doesn 't like what you don 't like , , etc .	-11.6711
She also has her moods during the day - how real people !	-3.2262
She can be tired , fixed on conversation , or she can be " in mood " !	-8.6553
There are many worrying aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female characteristics , the allusions of rape , when you take a step towards Frigid ( that is , repulsive ) Farrah , worry one of the most .	-5.8664
On his website , True Companion Roxxxy compared a vibrator , but for men .	-7.1861
" If women ( sic ) can have a vibrator , why can men do not have Roxxxy ? " is it on the website . . , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-9.3759
However , these sex robots are not just a fetish , or just a sex toy .	-3.1525
Their emergence and their growing refinement point to something darker and lower in our culture , to a withdrawal from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with subjugation as an optional addition .	-3.8641
Most men , of course , will not hold sex robots , and while the FRR notes their rising popularity , they will remain on the margins of consumer culture for the time being .	-4.6035
But what leaks through the peripheral zones can be very instructive in the spirit of the time we live in .	-3.4152
And many people are not strange or offensive until the free market gives them permission to do so . in . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , .	-8.5850
There is a certain overlap that these advanced sex robots appear at a time when women 's rights are under threat worldwide , where there is a president in the White House who boasted of sexually attacking women .	-4.4198
The most deterrent aspect of the TV series ' The Handmaid 's Tale ' ( ' The Report of the Magd ' ) is not the graphical images , the snowed body and the eyes erased , but how realistic this vision works .	-4.7667
The Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap .	-2.7142
The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( albeit with porn star proportions ) .	-3.1070
Their builders want to feel humanely that they imitate the movement of a real body .	-2.7603
But when it comes to their ' personalities ' , robots are not real women .	-3.2614
You cannot separate from your pet or simply go away .	-3.5400
They have no mediation or background history , nothing that suggests independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total subjection .	-3.1386
In other words , they are complacent slaves .	-1.3598

Trump ’ s Great Performance ?	-1.4757
It makes Mitt Romney the embodiment of common sense .	-7.8563
The Trump era has become a truism that the political divisions that polarized the US electorate have also split families in small format .	-4.1334
Newspapers in the US for Christmas and Harvest Thanks have been advised on how to deal with Trump ’ s horror .	-4.2322
We are all allegedly striving to burst our filter bubbles .	-3.4728
Less noticed is Trump ’ s power to bring together families .	-2.5094
I mention this because my cousine , a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Republicans in our family , visited me in New York this week .	-3.0080
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .	-1.8105
With Trump in the White House , everyone she knows , including the Republican relationship that she had fought for decades for politics , is suddenly and very strange on the same side .	-11.9862
This is certainly a good thing for the dining table , but it strikes me in another context that this also entails considerable risks .	-4.6380
The Left has been strengthened by Trump , but the apparent effect of his presidency has the strength to push us all to the right . .	-7.8471
When we talk about ' normalisation ' and Trump , we refer to the cruel possibility that one day his mothers will no longer repeal us .	-4.5385
But there is an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump ’ s right-wing Republicans are “ normalized , ” suddenly seen as an embodiment of reasonability in comparison to his standards .	-5.0074
Today , I find myself infected by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney ’ s urcomic version of the crazy – the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew what his tax declaration looked like ) – both of which are indeed a very mild crime compared to Trump .	-6.5441
When Trump goes , the next Republican candidate must be only intellectual healthy to qualify as immense improvement .	-3.1333
When my cousine was in the city , we brought our children to the Karussell in Central Park , the largest of the Carousels of the New York Park department , and the best three dollars to be spent in the city if you don 't need a caffeine .	-5.0840
The horses are enormously large , the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are nurrious and the animals spin to watch full of fear over their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climbing music mediates this in a strange way .	-5.4353
So many clichés of a city disappoint : the views of high buildings are old , the skylines are familiar to offer a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city does not live up to the dream .	-3.9942
Thirty and five years later , and I am still not entirely over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is not indeed a Swiss cottage - the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a great roundabout in the north of London .	-4.4604
The Central Park Karussell is still a strange magical experience , however , since two years , one 11-year-old and two women can go on and have a great time in the 40s .	-10.2196
If I could have assessed the carousel , I would have given him the full number of points , but fortunately nobody asked about it .	-3.0951
On the other hand , this week , in a department store , I was forced to evaluate my " experience " with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card .	-3.5374
In the coffee house on the corner of my street , it is the same , plus the option of balancing the evaluation with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the shop table .	-4.7655
This not only slows down what should actually be a neutral exchange , but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where it is not necessary .	-4.3378
The poor woman in the department store was sorry grinning , while I tired of the experience of reaching her my credit card with five stars .	-4.2358
Oscar Pistorius is hospitable with chest pain from prison .	-3.6583
For the second time Pistorius has left the prison for a hospital .	-2.9716
Last year , he was brought to the hospital for treating cuts on his hands , according to the prison authorities , after a case in his cell .	-4.5024
Pistorius was sentenced to a first ruling for murders after an appeal by the prosecutors .	-3.7224
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of the Valentine Day 2013 by shooting them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria .	-3.8845
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a night invader hiding in the cabin .	-3.1583
The prosecutors have announced their intention , this time , to appeal against the six-year prison sentence of Pistorius , which they say is too lenient .	-3.7586
The National Criminal Prosecution Authority said that it would object to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the objection could be heard this year .	-3.5860
Pistorius risks increasing his punishment to 15 years when prosecutors are successful .	-2.8906

Software Update for Diesel Vehicles : What those concerned need to know now ?	-3.7550
How exactly does the software update take place ?	-1.5823
Do diesel drivers have to take part in the action ?	-3.0175
The most important questions and answers overview .	-2.0104
At the Diesel Summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars .	-11.3046
They aim to improve the exhaust behaviour of cars in the Euro 5 emission class and , in part , Euro 6 .	-4.0049
Euro 4 Diesel or worse are excluded .	-1.9175
Anja Smetanin of the ACE Auto Club Europa has assessed :	-2.8692
Is the new action mandatory ?	-1.3298
No , the negotiated software updates are voluntary .	-1.4367
" The compulsory updates previously apply only to the vehicles that have fuel software " , says Anja Smetanin .	-4.0675
Their retrofitting has been ordered by the Federal Office of Craft ( KBA ) .	-3.7105
How and when are customers informed about updates ?	-1.8425
The manufacturers have announced swift implementation in the coming months , but have not given a precise date .	-3.8657
Daimler has communicated to write to each person concerned .	-3.6073
If an inspection is due anyway , it will be done within its framework .	-3.0105
How long will the overall conversion take ?	-3.0904
" Hard to say , " says Smetanin . .	-2.8584
This depends on the commitment of manufacturers and on political pressure .	-2.9760
'Because we have seen that car manufacturers are not acting voluntarily on the environment ' .	-3.2459
How long should the update take ?	-1.5495
The conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .	-2.4676
Time expensive could be to get an appointment .	-3.9519
What do drivers do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?	-3.0880
The ACE advises you to wait .	-1.3501
Probably foreign manufacturers would follow , says Smetanin .	-3.1169
Does a massive price decline in Euro 4 cars now threaten ?	-10.1827
The ACE fears this .	-1.4568
But it is precisely in the regions where there is a threat to bans .	-3.7621
There has been no loss of value for older diesel in rural areas .	-2.8109

LL Cool J receives Kennedy Center award .	-1.8623
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington .	-1.4566
The first prize ceremony under President Trump promises to become political .	-2.0837
One of the winners does not want to come out of protest .	-1.7839
LL Cool J ( 49 ) is the first rapper to receive one of the sought-after awards from the prestigious Kennedy Center . in , in . in , , in , , , , ,	-9.2959
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday , singer Gloria Estefan ( 59 ) , Lionel Richie ( 68 ) as well as the choreographer Carmen de Lavallade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Lear ( 95 ) are the sponsors .	-4.0739
The awards will be handed over at the beginning of December .	-2.1406
Traditionally , US President Donald Trump will host a reception and participate in the award with his wife Melania .	-3.1519
The award-winning Lear , announced with progressive TV series , has already announced that he will not participate in the gala .	-5.4983
He said ' The New York Times ' : ' This presidency has chosen to completely neglect arts and human rights - even withdraw the resources - and that burdens me ' .	-5.1815
The 59-year-old Estefan emphasized that she will use the talk with Trump to clarify her point of view .	-8.0999
The Kennedy centre , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital .	-2.3179

We make the city worth living .	-2.0933
Roland Wacker , Haslach ’ s city builder , will be retired next year .	-3.5398
The job is already posted - suitable candidates are scarce .	-3.1297
Wacker has been a city builder for 31 years .	-2.4455
And the work is still great fun to him as he communicates in the press .	-4.5953
He reports on diverse and demanding tasks that await his successor .	-4.0707
At the same time , he is surprised that no application has yet fulfilled the requirement profile .	-3.5878
The city is looking for an architect or construction engineer at the next time .	-3.7606
Thus , while respecting the regular deadlines for termination , there is still enough time to be made .	-6.0306
Since Haslach acts as a subcontractor for the administrative community , the Applicant must provide appropriate accounts .	-5.3138
It is this function that the city wants to keep .	-3.8949
If they could no longer fill them , citizens would have to go to Offenburg for consultation .	-4.2012
But proximity to the city and to it itself is important , Wacker says , who reports about a good business climate and good mood between the authority and citizens .	-5.3388
In more than 30 years in office , some important projects have accumulated , with pride in wackers .	-3.7956
" We make the city worth living " , he is safe about the building office and his staff .	-4.3901
But , in the future , diverse projects are on the agenda : the reorganisation of the former Hukla-Areal and the Lower Hofe parking , for example , are started .	-6.3270
The Kingsbrücke between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renewed , as is the stadium renovation .	-3.8086
The latter alone will beat around EUR 1.5 million if we do it right , Wacker estimates .	-4.3555
" Everything in all is waiting for my successor .	-8.8409
Work here is fun . '	-1.2014
It is designed for a city building master of great leeway .	-5.3436
Haslach ’ s own construction and gardening farm can respond to a great deal of flexibility .	-4.7174
" Much can be done " , Wacker said , and the design of the green installations is often commended by citizens and visitors .	-4.0692
Because the old town is protected as an ensemble , it is important to " have an eye for what fits in " when new buildings are approved , the outgoing city master emphasises .	-5.4573
In any case , the city building master bears high responsibility .	-3.9663
He is a builder , " in the end everything runs over my table " .	-3.1457
In care and coordination , he can count on long-standing employees : Markus Neumaier ( Hochbau ) has been working for ten years , Manfred Schöner ( Deepbau ) for 15 years .	-4.9269
Wacker also wants his successor to stay long : " We are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the job " .	-4.7885
Continuity is important not only for a good business climate but also for the further design of the city .	-3.6999
If you want to inherit Roland Wacker , you should be able to study as a diploma engineer or bachelor with a degree in architecture and have good expertise in the areas of construction and construction planning law .	-16.4699
The Municipal Building Office is subject to high and low construction , construction planning , basic business affairs , management of urban properties , Municipal Building Court with Bauhof and Municipal Partnership as well as the Lower Building Authority including Monument Protection .	-9.2479
Bicycle thrown on lines : Southern railway track closed .	-4.2527
According to the police , the previously unknown perpetrators threw the blue bicycle from the railway transfer in the area of Leoben Stra<unk>e ( B116 ) .	-4.6245
They were so seriously damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .	-3.2554
The investigators are based on two male perpetrators and have been looking for them since the night .	-3.6539
A pink scooter and a bicycle driver were observed by witnesses near the town .	-4.3746
" This goes far beyond a leaf strike , " said <unk>BB spokesman Christoph Posch to the APA .	-3.6015
The perpetrators , or the perpetrators , would have put themselves in great danger and would also have endangered traffic .	-4.7338
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and the facility , the delay and the cost of rail replacement , the perpetrators of railway customers could also be attributed to the perpetrators .	-6.2873
Overall , we should assume a " substantial " sum , the speaker said .	-4.3488
The damage was repaired on Friday afternoon , rail transport on the southern railway line could be carried out without disabilities .	-12.9445
Nearly ten trains were available on Friday morning , two of which related to long-distance traffic .	-4.8297
Freight trains did not fall out , but they were late .	-2.5333
According to the <unk>BB spokesman , Christoph Posch had to exchange some 200 metres of lines .	-3.6106
Isolators and masts were also damaged .	-2.1965
Red meat , dairy products , and chocolate could help relieve IBD ( inflammatory intestinal dis) . in , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-9.5807
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system .	-1.3187
But a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate patient symptoms with inflammatory disorders .	-3.0832
The incurable state in the US of about 1.3 million and 300,000 in the United Kingdom causes stomach struggles and blossoms , recurring or bloody diarrhea , weight loss , and extreme fatigue .	-10.9194
While those affected normally run out of meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms , researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine .	-4.7094
The senior researcher , Dr. Marco Colonna , explained that immuncells patrol in the intestine to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in food do not enter the body .	-3.5617
Cells capable of causing inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue .	-13.9480
If the balance tends too far towards inflammation , inflammatory disease may result .	-3.2291
Experiments found that a kind of tolerance-supporting immune cell occurs in mice wearing a particular bacterium in their thoughts .	-5.0523
And the bacterium requires Tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the cell appearance .	-8.5573
Professor Colonna said : " We have established a link between a bacterial type - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbium , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .	-3.3160
The more Tryptophan the mice had in their food , the more they had of these immune cells ' .	-2.5251
He proposed that the combination of L. Reuteri and a nutrition rich in Tryptophan promote more tolerant , less inflammatory intestinal intestinal milieu , if the same system also works for people .	-4.8696
The postdoctoral Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a kind of immuncell that promoted tolerance when it found that a group of study men had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which was housed separately , did not .	-5.4308
She suspected that the difference had to do with the Darmmicrobiomers of the mice - the community of bacteria , viruses and fungi that usually live in the gastrointestinal tract .	-4.2746
The mice ’ s darms were sequenced by DNA , and six bacterial species were found that were present in the mice with immune cells , but without them lacked in the mice . . , in the in , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-11.8040
Mouses were raised in a sterile environment , so that they lacked a Darmmic biom and did not develop this kind of immune cells , and they were obtained the L. Reuteri and the immuncells .	-5.7381
To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system , the researchers L. Researcher L. Reuteri grew up in a fluid and then transferred small quantities of liquid - without the bacteria - to immune cells isolated from the mice .	-4.7911
Immuncells developed into tolerance-promoting cells .	-2.3958
When the active component of fluid was cleaned , it proved to be a by-product of Tryptophan metabolism known as indol-3 acid .	-3.7166
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice ’ s fodder , the number of such cells increased by about 50 % , but when tryptophan values were halved , the number of cells fell by half .	-3.6516
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice , and that most of us L. Reuteri protect in our stomach intestinal tracts .	-3.2088
It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. Reuteri develop cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes related to Tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory disease .	-3.5992
She said : " The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote , as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine .	-2.9807
Potentially , high tryptophan values in the presence of L. Reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population . '	-3.8848
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has committed a " genius " with Nemanja Matic .	-7.5264
At Manchester United signed a " genius " with Nemanja Matic , Jose Mourinho believes , after the mid-field player had his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening .	-10.3626
The 40 million GBP signature of Chelsea began with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre-season game , before the UEFA Super-Cup against Real Madrid begins on Tuesday , and impressed in the holder 's role , when people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marched to favor .	-5.4122
Matic , however , was excluded from the Blues ’ preparatory Asian tour and only created 45 minutes , which Mourinho admitted had to improve before the start of the Premier League season .	-4.4477
" He takes time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , " said Mourinho .	-1.7566
'We will help him to be ready sooner than later . '	-2.1505
Besides Matic , Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started at the Aviva Stadium , when Mourinho formed his launch XI for the beginning of the season .	-4.0681
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted another three new commitments , but he insisted that the club had already done ' fantastic work ' to fulfil three of its four priority new commitments .	-3.5504
" To get three of four , for which I thank the association , " he added .	-3.0610

New depth for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem .	-9.3438
As the wind turns , when Sigmar Gabriel was still SPD chief , Social Democratic Prime Ministers always looked to Berlin with some concern before the elections .	-4.0130
If no fault fire from the party ’ s headquarters were merely no headwinds from the federal government – that was the main desire of the campaigners .	-6.4625
Since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has changed fundamentally .	-2.5386

Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) ’ s government has plunged the surprising opt-out of a Green MEP into a serious crisis .	-4.0379
Five months before the country ’ s election , his red-green coalition lost its one-vote majority to the opposition from CDU and FDP .	-2.9938
The Green Managing Director Michael Kellner has asked the breakaway Lower Saxon Green MEP Elke Twesten to return their mandate .	-3.9481
Transferring to the CDU means clearly distorting the will of the electorate .	-3.0044
Elke Twesten must immediately return its mandate , " said the Federal Managing Director and Election Director of the Greens to the editorial network Germany ( RND ) .	-3.8493
" Surely this must not be true , " a SPD campaign seizes when the new hiobs message reaches the party headquarters on Friday morning .	-5.3913
Stephan Weil , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , will be on the CDU after the assignment of the Green MEP Elke Twesten to the CDU without a majority of the government .	-5.9153
It is the preliminary highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD associations .	-3.0573
And no one knows what comes next .	-1.5803
The misery began with the unexpectedly clear defeat at the Saarland election in March .	-2.4298

Mayor Olaf Scholz , the last strong SPD leader , lost his nimbus at that weekend because he was in the Elbphilharmonic while his city burnt .	-11.4728
And because he then made pretty wrong everything that can be done wrong in crisis communication .	-4.7016
Since then , Scholz has been fighting for his political survival .	-2.1997
Now Stephan Weil , too .	-2.5054
The Lower Saxon Prime Minister has been under criticism for a long time now because of the VW exhaust gas emissions and his role on the supervisory board .	-11.0660
Miese survey values added .	-2.8659
Nonetheless , or perhaps precisely because , in recent weeks , it has been increasingly trying to focus on the federal status .	-5.3434
The aspiration of the former Mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin has not been hidden either in the surroundings of Martin Schulz .	-3.9810
They allowed him to be granted because of their promise of stabilization of the party .	-3.6315
Now the exact opposite could happen .	-2.2297
Because of the party internal conflict of the Lower Saxon Greens , it is basically not to blame .	-10.3385
And Schulz certainly not .	-2.3465
For the time being , therefore , the cooperatives are endeavouring to keep their own ranks closed .	-3.2069
Their anger is directed at the Greens , and particularly at the breakaway MEP Twesten .	-10.0953
" It is intolerable and democratic , as Mrs Twesten puts her own career interests beyond the interests of everyone else , " says Matthias Miersch , head of the party links in the SPD Group , the editorial network Germany ( RND ) .	-5.0179
Mrs Twesten was elected to Parliament not because of her person as a direct candidate , but via the National List of the Lower Saxon Greens , so the Lower Saxon MEP continues .	-5.0355
The logical consequence would be that it would return its mandate .	-2.2086
Thomas Opermann , head of the SPD Group , laments an ' undemocratic manoeuvre ' .	-2.8202
" The will of the electorate four years ago was clear : People made Stephan Weil the Prime Minister , " says Opermann , who leads the Lower Saxon SPD as the leading candidate in the German election , the RND .	-4.3064
" Now a future CDU MEP 's personal career is falsifying the election result , " said Opermann .	-4.4224
He called for the background to be clarified .	-2.1868
I want to know whether more has been done or whether there have been further commitments from the CDU Lower Saxony .	-3.2669
Support for local core III	-2.8472
Anyone who wants to rebuild his house over the years can soon get support from the country .	-4.3858
Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives STEG urban development informed about this on Wednesday in Empfingen .	-3.9512
At the beginning of the information event , Schindler returned to what has happened so far .	-3.3740
Since 1991 there have been recovery areas in Empingen .	-2.5742
At that time , in the recovery area I from 1991 to 2004 , the country of Baden-Württemberg took over two-thirds of the funding .	-3.9836
In the recovery area II from 2005 to 2016 , the grant still stood at 60 % .	-3.6127
For Schindler , the renovations to date are a " success project " - it is ultimately important to promote internal development as well , and not just to open up new construction areas .	-6.3097
On 4 April , the President of Karlsruhe received information that there will be a renovation area III .	-3.6130
The funding amounts to EUR 833 333 , of which EUR 500 000 would come from the country , the rest of the community receiving .	-3.4865
How does a recovery area arise ?	-2.3268
You will continue to investigate , as Schindler said , where the " truly old " houses are .	-3.9546
It is also important , however , whether there is any interest in restoring the planned area .	-4.4548
If necessary , then the borders could postpone again .	-3.6914
The STEG represented Martin Keller , Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening .	-1.6645
Keller presented the content of the federal state programme " Social City " , in which the refurbishment would be carried out .	-4.6540
At the heart of the programme is the revitalisation of inner cities , the improvement of living and working conditions and the preservation and development of infrastructure .	-4.7092
The measures would be implemented object-related , i.e. per plot .	-3.9061
The recovery area would then be defined as a statute .	-3.2620
The grant period for funding has been in operation since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026 .	-3.4011
The inventory would , however , be carried out before September this year , in which the parties involved in the renovation area will receive a questionnaire for completion .	-5.8205
In November or December , the statutory decision will be adopted as far as possible , so that the rehabilitation can begin next year .	-6.3313
Then Pietzschmann explained that each municipality should carry out the aforementioned preliminary studies .	-10.6544
It is a matter of evaluating and deciding when will be renovated and to what extent .	-4.5904
A refurbishment note will be entered in the land book .	-5.2139
Pietzschmann will come back to receptions and get an idea of the situation , she promised .	-4.5758
Gotzel emphasized that a major success factor for the project was the participation of those involved .	-3.5189
There will therefore be questionnaires that will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled in until the end of the summer holiday .	-4.1224
The yellow questionnaire is the " arch of buildings and land " , which involves , among other things , the construction and the rehabilitation intentions .	-5.2374
In the grey questionnaire , the " Household and Housing Arch " , information on size , division and residents of a housing room can be made .	-5.3631
The blue " operating arch " is only to be filled if commercial premises are operated in the building .	-3.7758
However , it should be noted that Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not simultaneously an application for funding .	-3.6892
Moreover , new construction measures are uneligible .	-2.4534
Schindler also emphasised that the distribution of funds works according to the ' greyhound principle ' - who comes first serves first .	-4.7265
You cannot reserve funds for later on .	-3.3104
Finally , photographs of the project " Village II " were shown to make a renovation " tasty " for the present .	-5.0015
British inventor himself has a microchip to come home and car with a hand movement .	-3.8844
A British inventor is the first in the country equipped with a microchip to open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .	-3.9018
Steven Northam , 33 , had implanted the tiny chip between thumb and pointing finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to make their lives easier with technology by its company BioTeq .	-4.3894
He joined Dr. Geoff Watson , a consultant anaesthetic at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester , Hants , to ensure that the implant procedure is conducted according to medical standards .	-4.0962
The technology resembles a cat and dog implanted microchip and takes only 30 seconds .	-2.2258
The company of Mr Northam also wants to change locks at houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip , all for an additional charge of <unk> 300 per lock .	-4.4505

The White House ’ s advertising costs cost the taxpayer thousands of people thous.	-9.6304
The White House ’ s decision to fly a naval helicopter to South Lawn for an event highlighting American manufacturing last month costs taxpayers up to $ 24,000 , according to the military ’ s data given to the TIME magazine .	-3.8369
The green white Sikorsky VH-3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the core of the event on 17 July in the White House with American construction programs .	-3.5020
President Donald Trump , Vice-President Mike Pence , and White House senior officials took a tour of products from all 50 states .	-2.3740
The helicopter manufactured in Connecticut was issued next to a yacht from Maine , a fire brigade car from Wisconsin and a forklift truck from Mississippi .	-3.5430
The White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on South Lawn , according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One ( HMX-1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .	-18.2146
" I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with a high visibility , " the commander of the HMX-1 wrote on the eve of the event of his manager , the Deputy Marine Commander for Aviation .	-3.9433
The news indicated that the helicopter arrived at South Lawn on July 17 at 7 a.m. for the event at 3 p.m. , and until the lawn was cleaned between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 this evening .	-5.2527
The note adds that if the departure from the White House was to be delayed , a second team would be needed for the return flight by restricting the hours of service .	-4.0369
The original flight crew was helicopter during the event , while the safety staff of the unit remained on the ground during the time .	-3.7693
The records made available by the TIME did not clearly indicate whether a second crew was required .	-3.8625
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes .	-2.3761
Records indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could violate the provision .	-2.3874
" One question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case , " wrote the commander .	-3.1325
" As if you are closed , " the Deputy Commander replied .	-3.0932
The " Made in America " event was described by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act .	-2.8143
But official events also have political tones .	-1.7555
At the event , the president launched a stimulus for the reform of health reform that was underway in the Senate , and he promoted efforts to contain the .	-5.6231
The use of the aircraft known as the Marine One or Air Force One for politically beneficial purposes is hardly a new phenomenon .	-2.8574
Presidents are obliged to use them for the trip .	-2.7260
But requesting their use only for a photo OP is unusual .	-2.9633
Trump carried out an investigation in February when the presidential aircraft carried out in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of reports complaining about the use of the presidential aircraft by his predecessor .	-3.5840
" The White House is enthusiastic about the show " Made in America " - the products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials , " said the Deputy Secretary of the White House , Lindsay Walters .	-14.3830
HMX-1 crews often carry out training flights in the area around Washington and South Lawn to reset US president in the White House with precise centimetre rates .	-4.0028
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , HMX-1 performed 58 training landings in the White House .	-9.9522
The flight for the " Made in America " event counted for the training needs of flight crew for the month , said a civil servant .	-3.8459
Helicopter units flew an additional 11 hours this day for " non-presidential support missions " .	-3.2269
The White House said that taxpayers did not take the burden of any of the other requirements presented at the event .	-2.8855
A spokesman from Sikorsky said that the company was not involved in exhibiting the helicopter on South Lawn . the was in .	-4.0910
HMX-1 does not have a presidential flight budget record , and it is difficult to identify the exact cost of the event .	-3.2833
According to hour tariffs from the US Department of Defense for the 2017 fiscal year , however , the VH-3D DoD reimbursement rate is USD 24,380 per flight .	-3.8741
Recordings of the unit show the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia .	-4.0069
The White House argues that the actual costs of helicopter operation are well below that rate .	-2.1692
'Setting the cost of taxpayers on the basis of estimates for reimbursement rates is highly misleading ' , Walters said .	-4.0908
'These estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds ' .	-2.7788
According to a 2015 RAND study , DoD reimbursement rates do not include staff costs , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and contract conclusion .	-3.6543
At that time , the former White House press spokesperson , Sean Spicer , defended the use of the helicopter for the event .	-12.2421
" The idea is to present things made in America this week , " said Spicer .	-1.9399
" And I know that Sikorsky and the federal state of Connecticut are very proud of their contribution to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not thousands , are dependent on it .	-7.9746
And I think , like most Americans , we are all proud of helicopters and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly .	-2.0386
It is of course appropriate to emphasise this . '	-6.7586
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter when he entered South Lawn for the event , but he was in the driver ’ s seat of a fire brigade car .	-3.9871
In the White House , Trump talked to representatives of Sikorsky and shouted with the media about his own fleet of corporate products .	-2.9316
'I know Sikorsky very well ' , the President said , ' I have three of them ' .	-2.1101

Team Chairman Marius Zay respects the opponent .	-3.3204
" This is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation .	-2.0587
It is precisely on the rear positions that I find the team very good . '	-3.2497
For class and stability at the SV village , imports from the north are mainly carried out .	-4.9818

How America Can Damage the OMV	-2.6985
Really happy , Donald Trump did not work when he signed Wednesday night under the law to tighten sanctions against Russia .	-3.8797
" In his haste to pass the law , " Congress wrapped up a few " unconstitutional rules " , he put it .	-5.3347
The response from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels foamed the US push .	-3.9452
After all , the draft provides for punishing European companies that help Russians build gas pipelines into the EU .	-2.9378
Accordingly , investors from the local OMV have since been concerned , who , together with other European companies , have co-financed the construction of the Russian Baltic management Nord Stream 2 .	-4.9389
The threat scene is huge .	-1.8690
Nevertheless , it is too early to assess the impact , as the official statement of the oil company .	-4.3702
Indeed , Donald Trump himself would have to bring the sanctions to life by executive orders .	-3.1949

Narco 's Square 3 Trailer : Without Pablo Escobar , the Cali Cartel will be placed in the centre of Netflix 's hit series .	-10.4270
Despite the second season of Narcos that reveals Pablo Escobar ’ s killer , the Netflix series is far from over .	-3.2052
The seasons three and four were already confirmed by the streaming service , the first received their first trailer and showed the latest evil weights of the show .	-2.9758
With the third season , the DEA has focused its attention on the world 's richest organisation of drug trafficking : the Cali cartel .	-2.9877
Led by four powerful patents , they operate " like a Fortune 500 company " only with more state bribery and violent actions .	-3.3430
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela ( Damian Alcazar ) is the leader of the cartel , Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , Pacho Herrera ( Alberto Ammann ) commands the Mexican connection , and Chepe Santacruz Londono ( Pepe Rapazote ) is located in New York .	-2.3032
In the newly published trailer , Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña , the type that invites American and Colombian law enforcement authorities to support the war on drugs .	-2.7939

The clock is turned back in urban children ’ s daycare facilities .	-3.7596
On September 1 , the city of Krefeld will take over food supplies in the urban children ’ s day-to-day facilities ( Kitas ) again in its own direction .	-5.9540
For Sonja Pommeranz , Deputy Head of Youth Aid , this is good news : ' We were all very pleased ' .	-3.9308
Cooking continues to be out of the house : a caterer takes this task and delivers fresh cooking .	-4.8244
The city operates in the Krefeld area area of 46 children ’ s daycare facilities , in 44 children get a warm meal at lunch time .	-5.6234
In the last kita-year , 2800 children were tabled and demand is growing steadily .	-4.4887
" Meanwhile not only eat children who are maintained for 45 hours in the kita at lunch " , explains Pommeranz .	-3.8933
'Offer also applies in 35 hours care , when children stay until 2 p.m. '	-4.9609
46 part-time workers have kitchen service from September 1 : they heat the delivered dishes , complement them with salad , raw food and fruit , portion the meal individually , dispense , sink and clean the kitchen .	-6.7781
" Employees are firmly assigned to a kita , " says Pommeranz .	-3.2166
The size - there are two groups as well as seven-group institutions - decides the size of the hour .	-3.9734
" The kitchen helpers belong to the kita team " , says Pommeranz satisfied .	-3.2259
" Thus they are much more involved and it is easier for the Kitalianzeitung to implement educational concepts " .	-4.3293
This is also about healthy nutrition and cooking classes .	-3.2362
" The children should help prepare food " .	-2.1067
The direct connection of the kitchen to the team makes sense .	-10.6551
Also for children .	-2.1234
" They have a known force in the kita , a person who is familiar with them , and not constantly changing people " .	-3.6344
This continuity is important for children .	-1.3158
The cleaning of the kita rooms - and so far also the task of the kitchen staff - will in future be done by special cleaning staff .	-4.9373
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has the most economical charm , in addition to improving the quality of the kitchen performance , which it has proven to be the most economical for the city in terms of cost comparison between self-government and foreign awarding . the press office .	-7.1506
And that , even though 46 part-time forces are recruited .	-3.1432
" But these hours do not matter as much as 750 people in the education sector , " says Sonja Pommeranz .	-4.6341

Men try to rob 13 years of girls	-2.6442
Two young men aged 19 and 23 should have attempted to deprive a 13-year-old girl on Thursday .	-2.7354
According to information from the police , the men raised the 13-year-old , who was with friends on the Kolpingstrasse , at 14.55 p.m. because they wanted to telephone with the girl 's mobile phone .	-5.6924
The 13-year-old , however , rejected the request and continued with her friends .	-9.0637
One of the perpetrators tried to use the mobile phone and the girl ’ s necklace , which failed .	-4.7253
Without prey the duo escaped .	-2.1163
The two young men were later arrested by the police .	-1.7482

GMB concern about investment in the McVite factory in Glasgow	-2.1085
A trade union wants to assure managers of the Biskuit manufacturer McVitie about the long-term commitment to production at their plant in Glasgow .	-3.9095
GMB Scotland said that the company has kept quiet about the future of investments at the Tollcross site .	-13.2512
More than 500 employees work at the plant , which produces hobnobs and rich tea biscuits alongside other products .	-3.4728
McVities owner Pladis said he has invested more than <unk> 5 million in recent years .	-2.7366
He added that employees and trade union representatives would be ' first to experience ' if their activities changed .	-3.4126
In a letter to the branch manager of the company , GMB Scotland McVitie called for ' concerns to be expressed that funding for modernising production lines would not be advanced ' .	-4.4452
GMB senior organizer Drew Duffy , said : " The fact that we cannot gain clarity from the General Site Manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross affects our members profoundly . . , , in , , , . , , , , , , is , , , , , , is , , , , , is , , , . ,	-16.8787
Generations of families have worked here and workers have focused heavily on the local community and Glasgow , an important pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage .	-4.1708
Therefore , from the perspective of jobs , wages , and prosperity , and against the background of Brexit , rising living costs , and chronic production decline , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently requires a prosperous production presence at McVitie .	-14.5334
A spokesman from Pladis said : " The branch manager at Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday , and the company will respond directly to this , as we appreciate the continuous commitment of employees and trade union representatives .	-4.7764
Two months ago , we had a regular meeting with staff and GMB representatives at Tollcross , where some issues were discussed openly .	-2.9068
We discussed with the staff that , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and unsafe economic climate , we are constantly reviewing our business - and this applies to all our divisions and sites - in order to remain competitive .	-4.6007
She added : " In recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our Tollcross site , especially in production lines and operational improvements .	-2.9905
We fully recognise the legacy of Tollcross as a production facility , and if our operations change at the site , the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to experience this . '	-5.2698
Has the PSG Barcelona warned three years ago about Neymar ?	-1.5203
You may regret the interest in Marco Verratti on the La Liga page .	-9.2622
Paris Saint-Germain will not lower in her persecution of Neymar after giving an offer of <unk> 189 million to trigger his release clause , but did she warn Barcelona three years ago before the World Record Objective ?	-14.6552
The sensational approach fueled the transfer window in the summer , because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , returning Paul Pogba to Manchester United in the last season .	-3.8291
After finishing , Neymar becomes the world ’ s most expensive player and the world ’ s highly paid professional athlete , offering wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week .	-4.1850
Barcelona is angry about how Neymar forced his way outside , although a source near the Catalan Board insists that the club has always done its best to take care of him since he arrived in Santos in 2013 .	-4.0714
But was the football world warned three years ago by the PSG president about this prospect ?	-1.8898
When Manchester City announced interest in the signing of Blaise Matuidi in 2014 , Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for any club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PSG .	-3.6258
" I am not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players , we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , " said Al-Khelaifi .	-2.8149
" We respect all clubs .	-0.9024
But if they try to sign one of our players , this will have consequences . '	-3.1619
Barcelona seems to have gone beyond this line , with the Spanish association expressing interest in the PSG midfield player Marco Verratti earlier this summer .	-3.8554
PSG made it clear that it would not allow the International of Italy to leave under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its prices for Neymar .	-3.3476

The car was damaged by property .	-3.7482
The driver of the accommodating car , a Mercedes Benz , had overtaken a lorry and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident .	-3.9210
According to the accident damaged , it may be good that the Mercedes driver had not even noticed the accident .	-4.2742
The police are now asking the incident and the polluter vehicle driver to contact the Commissioner in pride on 05761 / 92060 .	-3.6917
Interview : ' Domspatzen report relieves Papst brother Georg Ratzinger '	-1.9821
The Regensburg Domspatzen report on the abuse cases relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger .	-3.1731
This means author and historian Michael Hesemann .	-1.6072
The final report on the scandal of abuse in the Regensburg Domspatzen continues to generate discussions .	-4.5193
Christian Weisnder , spokesman of the reform movement " We are Church " , declared after publication to the German Press Agency , he expected from former Regensburg Bishop and today 's Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger , the 93-year-old brother of the emerged Pope Benedict XVI .	-4.9522
It would very much serve the image of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger were to express their deep regret at their own omissions or at the time their misjudgment of the events .	-5.1830
The Vatican newspaper " Osservatore Romano " , on the other hand , criticized the fact that " double standards " were measured when reporting violence in domains .	-4.8507
As far as the attacks in Regensburg are concerned , nobody doubts that they are ' disgraceful and shameful acts ' that should be punished and prevented in the future ; striking is the ' degree of medial manipulation ' , according to author Lucetta Scaraffia , historian and member of the national bioethics committee .	-5.2975
" The habit of describing the Catholic Church as a source of all evils is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to consider it normal " , Scaraffia writes .	-4.1304
Also Prince Gloria of Thurn and Taxis said in the interview with the Bavarian Rundfunk : " You love to go to the Church and that is a found food " .	-5.4885
In addition , she pointed out that in her youth ' beats were a very normal educational means ' to deal with cheap children as I was one .	-5.2278
They would find it unfair to apply current standards to previous decades , because the world has changed .	-2.7006
Georg Ratzinger often appeared in the context of the reports on cases of abuse .	-4.0453
Author and historian Michael Hesemann , who , with Ratzinger , wrote the memory band " My brother of the Pope " ( translated into 12 languages ) .	-3.6903
" I must protect Georg Ratzinger , " says Hesemann , " because all this had nothing to do with him , " he valued the results of the final report .	-3.9756
What exactly is the 440-page report presented by Ulrich Weber , a lawyer commissioned by the Bistum Regensburg , to the Enli? . in , , , , , , , , , ,	-9.4953
A total of 547 Regensburg domains were abused sexually between 1945 and the early 1990s " with high plausibility " victims of attacks , 67 dome patents .	-5.4069
The final report refers to Georg Ratzinger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : " To sum up , Domkapellmeister R. used forms of physical and mental violence in many cases .	-4.1094
Especially with high emotionality , punishment for pupils could be more severe .	-4.4316
Nevertheless , unlike many other accusations , it is noticeable that many victims appreciate the general humanity of R. R. and therefore , in many cases , despite violence , even connect positive memories to it . '	-12.0424
In the interview , Hesemann explains why he believes that the final report on the scandal of abuse at the Regensburg Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger relieves .	-4.3714
Mr Hesemann , the 440-page report on ' incidents of the use of violence in the Regensburg Domspatzen ' gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger .	-4.4558
First , many pupils emphasize their " humanity " .	-3.0024
On the other hand , he also appears as a choleric and perfectionist who became handful of the frequent when a domspatz did not perform top performance in musical . . , , , in , , , in , , , in , , , , in , , , , ,	-16.4624
How do you consider this final report to be his biographer ?	-2.5446
Michael Hesemann : If you take the trouble and read the entire 440-page report from the front to the rear , you have to wonder why the name Georg Ratzinger is .	-5.3316
He has just eight pages dedicated to him and is clearly opposed to any suspicion of complicity or co-science in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .	-4.4758
The preschool excesses of violence also took place outside its sphere of effect .	-4.1345
He may be accused of learning too late or not having taken the first suggestions seriously enough .	-4.1553
The Domspatzengymnasium on which he acted was perceived by virtually all respondents as " Redeeming " , " Heaven " and " Better World " .	-5.2393
Thus , the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger also exhibits a very excellent testimony , describes him as " warm-hearted " , " sincere " , " competent " and " understandable " , as a very good teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes , biscuits and bonbons and " always relocated from grapes from children " .	-6.2322
Only a minority complains about its perfectionism and its high emotionality , which has led to eruptions .	-3.8045
Not only did he crack with chairs and threw the key ribbon into the ground , but he also spread out ear-slaughtering boys to the hair or ears too cheeky , he himself admitted years ago , deeply regretted and apologized for it .	-8.0241
However , in order to save honour , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the period in question , the 1960s and 1970s , among parents and teachers .	-4.8569
Do you still know such breeding methods ?	-1.3897
Of course , I think each of us born before 1968 .	-1.6113
I have experienced this in a secular school , a state gymnasium .	-3.0619
Compared to what this report is actually about , namely the appalling sexual abuse and the excesses of violence at pre-school , these are , of course , shortcomings .	-5.5596
One wonders whether it is more familiar with his role as Benedict XVI brother that many media just toppled him .	-5.2618
Many who have never understood him are still diligently working on the Bavarian Pope .	-3.7739
But the truth is : the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect !	-9.0866
Much has been reported in the media on the subject of abuse in the Regensburg Domspatzen .	-5.1057
Will Georg Ratzinger be charged with any kind of involvement or participation in sexual abuse in the final report ?	-3.9467
Michael Hesemann : No .	-1.7548
None of the 67 victims of sexual attacks claims to have entrusted the Domkapellmeister .	-2.3563
Not even parents were inaugurated .	-1.2099
" I have never trusted to talk about it with my father or my mother , " said one person concerned on behalf of the others , " It was all very embarrassing to me " .	-5.8370
The real problem with clarifying sexual abuse was and is that most victims were silent .	-3.4430
If they do not even entrust parents and siblings , then it is certainly not a choral leader who would have been a professional colleague of the perpetrators .	-4.3395
How do the domspatzen pupils assess Ratzinger 's role in cases of abuse ?	-4.2418
Michael Hesemann : An interviewed student put it as follows : " Regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he ( Georg Ratzinger ) would have had timely insights and could have stopped the perpetrator . .	-5.3370
I think it is also absurd to assume that he calculates ... Buying more forcefully or clearer or even more opened than to her parents , boarding managers , trust teachers etc .	-12.4965
That he talks about sex ... unthinkable . '	-2.2244
Thus , the report comes to the very clear conclusion that ' the entry of pupils and / or their surroundings in the run-up to them could not be confirmed within the framework of the investigation ' .	-5.8769
So , as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg Ratzinger must be free from coherence .	-3.5777
Nor can he be accused of not preventing or having brought him to advertisement .	-4.0386
There is therefore no reason to reconcile his good name with these resistant crimes , as unfortunately happened in some cases .	-4.1310
In the media there was much to read about " violence excesses " at the dompatzes of Regensburg .	-5.5273
The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused of in the report ' Wegschauen ' .	-2.7854
Does he have to live with this accusation ?	-1.8959
Michael Hesemann : This is the big problem that everything has been mixed and confused into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg Ratzinger .	-4.4128
Yet that is , in turn , an abuse of the report .	-2.8432
This is clearly separated : between the preschool and the gymnasium of dome patents , between sexual abuse and violence and , let us say , other accusations .	-5.4910
In addition , the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945 , including four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not the chorus of the dome patents .	-4.8235
The whole terrible teaching of churches , the cases in which boys were truly harassed and painted by sadistic teachers and suffered horribly , all occurred at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen , where genuinely scandalous conditions had to prevail .	-6.6061
Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with them , because he got the boys to face when they were already in the Domspatzengymnasium .	-4.4135
On that , as the vast majority of witnesses stress , the theme " preschool " was taboo .	-3.0987
One was only happy to escape her and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even " paradise " conditions .	-3.3966
What was different about the Domspatzengymnasium ?	-2.0308
Michael Hesemann : there was discipline , but it was not sadistic violence .	-3.0617
This is also true of Georg Ratzinger , where the report concludes that ' many victims value the general humanity of R. R. R. , and therefore , in many cases , despite violence , they are even connecting positive memories to it ' .	-5.9880
In any event , the accusation remains that we have looked away .	-5.2755
However , despite all the efforts , the report has only been able to define two periods in which it has been reported about the situation at preschool level .	-5.0959
The first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish himself , and the events at a school where he was not actually working and responsible ( the witness ) wanted to hear nothing , and then only at 1993 .	-6.2192
Georg Ratzinger closed his ears before the conditions ?	-3.2136
Michael Hesemann : No , as early as 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium , which the report even reproduces .	-3.2504
He points out to him that ' the penalty is still applied in primary school ' .	-5.1993
Even in view of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent intervention .	-3.0726
This was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed when criminal punishments were banned in Bavaria for a long time .	-4.6505
Before that , they took place in a legal grey area , as everyone knows .	-2.3893
It was difficult for him to assess where the stakeholders were perhaps exaggerated or dramatized and where the permissible limit was actually exceeded .	-17.2025
Nor can we say that he always looked away .	-2.9547
That is simply not true .	-1.0101
Only in 1980 was the official abolition of schools in Bavaria .	-3.5094
Prime Minister Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today ’ s educational standards to that time .	-3.2934
How do you see that ?	-1.7921
Michael Hesemann : We historians talk about the " fallstrick of anachronism " , that is , the danger of evaluating past by current moral standards .	-4.7580
The Principality is right .	-2.5715
But this does not , of course , apply to sexual abuse , which at all times was disgusting , nor to what was broken in the preschool of resistance and violence on innocent souls of children , which goes far beyond what was usual at the time . . in . , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-13.5352
That is all very terrible and I am glad that it is finally being reworked .	-4.1491
But at the same time I must protect Georg Ratzinger , because all this had nothing to do with him .	-3.0460
His means of disciplining and punishing , i.e. ear slaughter and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .	-4.3298
When physical punishment was then banned , it was strictly observed .	-2.5739
What image of his Regensburg time has Georg Ratzinger reflected in talks with you for the book " My brother of the Pope " ?	-3.4184
Can the issue of criminal sanctions also be raised ?	-4.5614
Michael Hesemann : Well , the book is about the life of his brother Joseph , Pope Benedict ’ s XVI . , tells from his perspective , the domspatzes played only a side role .	-5.0772
Nevertheless , I do not hesitate to say that he had a strict regime there .	-4.0769
But that must be said : without this perfectionism , without demanding absolute discipline , he would hardly have been able to shape a world class institution from the more nationally known Regensburg domspatzes until then , true European cultural ambassadors and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .	-7.1463
With biscuits and bonbons alone , you don 't make a big singer out of ruthless boys and stand before any success in any area , but always discipline , passion and self-overcoming .	-7.7832
What kind of person did you see Georg Ratzinger talking about her book ?	-3.9245
Michael Hesemann : Through the work on the book and beyond , I have really experienced Georg Ratzinger as a wonderful , humorous , deeply believed and heart-good people , who cannot be imagined that he could do anything about a fly .	-6.6092
I regularly get in touch with him , visit him , read it - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of his family .	-4.6115
Those who still do not forgive him that he was once strict with them are therefore clearly in the minority .	-3.3367
Most domains today are grateful to him for enriching their lives and bringing them to the world of music .	-3.6755
And he has always been a good , father-teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but he has also been a lovingly respected person to whom they are still watching today and whom they worship .	-6.8909
I would like to make it quite clear once again that everything that is accused of him is educational methods which were then on the agenda .	-5.3724
We can be glad that we have long overcome this time .	-2.6385
But it is highly unfair to make a man , just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to become a media scapegoat .	-3.0103
The evil intention behind this is all too obvious .	-2.9001
The fact is that the report that has just been published relieves it .	-7.3397
Now it would be a decency to have a 93-year-old man who has earned great merits and would have no knowledge of the domains of Regensburg at last in peace without those outside Bavaria and perhaps even Germany .	-7.4737
