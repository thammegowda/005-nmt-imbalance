Captain Halkett provided an excellent organized defense , while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worral kept on trail all the time .	-4.7873
But the Rangers lacked ideas .	-2.8166
As good as they were sometimes under Gerrard , they fell far short of these standards .	-3.7306

On 2 October 1968 , troops had finished a peaceful demonstration of leftist student groups with weapons , killing the 300 people .	-3.9934
Lopez Obrador has promised to provide financial support to Mexican students on a monthly basis and to open further free public universities .	-4.0324
He said that unemployment and the lack of education left young people in the criminal gangs .	-3.6956
The US should double Artificial Intelligence spending	-3.4424
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence , the US should double its research investments , says Kai-Fu , investor , and AI-rakters who worked for Google , Microsoft , and Apple .	-3.7548
These demands were created after US officials made pronouncements on AI , even though the US lacks a formal AI strategy .	-3.6519
Meanwhile , China presented its plan last year : by 2030 , it wants to be number 1 in the AI innovation sector .	-3.6367
“ doubled spending on AI research would be a good start , given that all other countries lag far behind the US , and a breakthrough in AI research is about to come , ” said Lee .	-4.3574
The doubling of funding could double the chances of achieving the next achievement in the field of artificial intelligence in the US , said Lee CNBC in an interview this week .	-3.2946
Lee , whose book “ AI SuperPower : China , Silicon Valley and the New World Order ( AI superpowers : China , Silicon Valley , and the new world order ) ” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt , is CEO of Sinovation Ventures , a company that has invested in one of the most famous Chinese AI companies , Face + .	-4.2401
In the 1980 ’ s , he worked at the Carnegie Mellon University on a AI system that defeated the highest ranking American Otlight player , and later served as Head at Microsoft Research and President of Google ’ s Chinese branch .	-7.3511
Lee recognized the US government ’ s previous technological competition , such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( US Defense Research Agency ) , and asked when the next one would take place to identify the next visionaries .	-4.5489
“ Researchers in the US often have to work very hard to get government grants , ” Lee said .	-3.1998
“ Not China is responsible for the outflow of high-level scientists , but for companies , ” said Lee .	-3.7073
Facebook , Google , and other technology companies have in recent years hired universities to work on AI .	-3.8103
Lee said that a changed immigration policy could also help the US strengthen its AI efforts .	-2.4431
“ I think Green Cards should be offered automatically PhD students in AI , ” he said .	-2.8860
The Chinese State Council presented its next generation artificial intelligence development plan ( Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan ) in July 2017 .	-2.2460
China ’ s National Natural Science Foundation provides funding for people in academic institutions similar to how the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to US researchers , but the quality of academic work in China is lower , Lee said .	-4.1031
Earlier this year , the United States formed the Ministry of Defence with a Joint Artificial Intelligence Centre , which is to involve industrial and scientific partners , and the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence .	-5.7474
And this month , DART has announced an investment of $ 2 billion in an initiative called “ AI Next . ”	-2.3543
As far as the NSF is concerned , it is currently investing more than $ 100 million per year in AI research .	-2.4752
Meanwhile , the US legislation that wanted to create a national artificial intelligence security commission has been heard for months .	-4.3992
Macedonia is voting in a referendum on whether to change its name .	-2.4781
On Sunday , the people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on whether their name should be changed in the ' Republic of Northern Macedonia ' , a step that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that blocked its accession offers for the European Union and NATO .	-6.2198
Greece , which has a province called Macedonia , insists that its northern neighbour 's name imposes a territorial claim on the Greek territory , and has vetoed the country 's entry to NATO and the EU .	-3.5320
The two governments concluded an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name , but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavonic majority population of Macedonia .	-3.1837
President Gjorge Ivanov said he will not vote in the referendum , and there are doubts as to whether the outcome will create the 50 % hurdle , which is a prerequisite for the referendum ’ s validity .	-5.0699
The question on the voting paper was : ' Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with the adoption of the agreement with Greece ? '	-2.4058
Advocates of the name change , including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev , argue that it is worth continuing to include institutions such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia , one of the countries to emerge from the collapse of Yugoslavia .	-2.8435
“ I came to vote today to vote on the future of the country ; it is a decision for the young people of Macedonia to live freely under the umbrella of the European Union , because that means a life of greater security for all of us , ” said Olivera Georgieva , 79 , in Skopje .	-5.2837
Although not legally binding , enough Members have said that they will follow the outcome of the vote so that it becomes crucial .	-3.7962
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament .	-2.4965
The House Election Committee said at 13 p.m. that there were no reports of irregularities .	-4.5268
But turnout was only 16 % – at the last parliamentary election in 2016 , the figure was 34 % at the same time , and 66 % of registered voters ended voting .	-4.7590
“ I voted for my children – our place is in Europe , ” said Gjose Tanevski , 62 , a voter in the capital Skopje .	-2.8459
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev , his wife Zorica and his son , Dushko , voted in favour of the referendum in Macedonia on the change of the name of the country which would pave the way for joining NATO and the European Union in Strumica , Macedonia , on 30 September 2018 .	-4.1871
Before Parliament in Skopje , Vladimir Kavardarkov , 54 , prepared a small stage and put chairs before the tents set up by those who are boycotting the referendum .	-3.8101
" We are in favour of NATO and the EU , but we want to take up with heads , not by the door of service , " said Kavadarkov .	-4.2131
“ We live in a poor country , but we also have our dignity .	-1.9570
If you do not want to join us as Macedonia , we can turn to others such as China and Russia to join us in Euro-Atlantic integration . ”	-3.7670
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will bring much-needed investments to Macedonia , a country with an unemployment rate of more than 20 % .	-2.3553
“ I believe that a large majority will vote in favour , because more than 80 % of our citizens are for the EU and NATO , ” declared Zaev after his vote .	-3.9517
According to him , the “ yes ” outcome would be a “ affirmation of our future . ”	-3.7593
Last Monday , the Macedonian Institute of Policy Research published the results of a survey : between 30 and 43 % of voters would thus vote – less than necessary .	-2.9494
Another survey conducted by Macedonia 's Telma TV found that 57 percent of respondents will vote on Sunday .	-3.1945
Of those who want to participate , 70 % said that they would vote ‘ yes ’ .	-3.3791
The referendum is only adopted if the turnout is more than 50 % .	-3.5825
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-western government ’ s policy since its inauguration in May last year .	-3.1060
Seit : Sergio Agüero from Manchester City surmounts the entire Brighton-defense on the way to the gate .	-4.8571
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling completed Brighton defense at Manchester City-2 victory on Saturday at Etiha Stadium in Manchester , England .	-2.8843
Aguero made his hits in the 65th minute incredibly simple .	-3.7275
At the beginning of the game sequence , the Argentinean striker in the middle field received a pass .	-4.3886
He commanded three defenders of Brighton to free-play .	-3.8032
Then Agüero was surrounded by three green themes .	-1.2371
He surrounded a defender before he ran several players on the edge of the Brighton prison .	-5.5289
Then he left a passport and stopped dying .	-3.4441
The English striker used his first contact to return the ball to Agüero , who then shot with right – past Brighton-Torenhyeev Ryan in the right side of the gate .	-5.8417
" Aguero has foot problems , " said city manager Pep Guaraniola reporters .	-3.5996
“ We talked about it ; he played 55 , 60 minutes .	-2.4767
That has happened .	-1.1559
Fortunately , he shot a gate at the moment . ”	-2.0348
However , it was Sterling who first led the Sky blues at the Premier League-Duell :	-3.5233
The Gate came in the 29th minute	-2.5403
In the game Aguero the ball was played deep in the territory of Brighton .	-2.1790
with a beautiful steep pass to Leroy Sané along the left side .	-1.6763
Sane made a few touches before he led Sterling to the remote post .	-3.1742
The Sky Blues played the ball forward before it slipped out of the pitch .	-4.2020

Scherzer wants to play corrupt games against Rockies	-4.4196
Since the player 's national player was excluded from the competition , there was not much reason to force another start .	-4.4445
But the hard-fought Scherzer hopes to climb the hill on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies , but only if there are Playoff-implications for the Rockies that have a lead from a game ahead of Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West .	-5.0511
Rockies secured at least one place ahead with a 5-2 victory over the national on Friday evening , but the title win in the first league is still not sure .	-4.7762
" Even if we play for free , we can at least put ourselves in the stuff , because we know that the atmosphere here in Denver with the people and the other team will probably be the best we have to offer this year .	-4.8386
Why should I not want to make a difference ? '	-3.6002
The national have not yet announced a start for Sunday , but are allegedly inclined to let Scherzer throw in such a situation .	-5.0721
Scherzer , who would make his 34th start , gave an uptrip on Thursday and began his normal day of rest .	-5.3941

This is one of the great , great - I run not , but I really run , so I fight everywhere for great candidates , he said .	-3.7804
Trump continued : “ You see this terrible , radical democrat group , you see that it is just now .	-5.7841
And they are determined to regain power with all the necessary means , and do not stop there even from malfeasance and commonalities .	-7.0335
They do not care about who they hurt whom they must pass over to gain power and control , that is what they want , power and control , we will not give them .	-4.8897
“ The Democrats ’ goal is to oppose and block , ” he said .	-2.4072
" And you see this in the last four days , " he said and called the democrats " angry and common , evil and evil " .	-3.2547
" He referred specifically to the democratic senator Dianne Feinstein , a high-level member of the Senate 's Committee on Legal Affairs , and thus raised loud Buhruet from the audience .	-7.4983

The Labour Party is no longer a wide community .	-2.0638
It is intolerant of those who say what they think .	-0.8326
When momentum activists in my local party voted to criticise me , it was hardly a surprise .	-2.5698
Finally , I am the last in a number of Labour MEPs who say that we are not welcome , only because we have said our opinion .	-3.8024
My group colleague Joan Ryan has been treated similarly because she has resolutely opposed anti-Semitism .	-2.9448
In my case , I have been criticised for the motion of censure because I do not agree with Jeremy Corbyn .	-2.2682

The communication for the East Labour in Nottingham meeting on Friday says : ' We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive ' .	-4.2105
Most of my time as a local Labour MEP in eight years , Friday evening 's GC meetings were exactly the same .	-3.6624
Unfortunately , it is not the tone of many meetings today , and the promise of a ' more friendly , gentler ' policy has long been forgotten if it ever began .	-4.1374
It has become increasingly clear that different views in the Labour Party are not tolerated , and any opinion will be judged by whether it is acceptable to party leaders .	-4.5308
This began shortly after Mr Jeremys took office , because my colleagues with whom I had previously thought I would have a similar political attitude were expecting me to make a U-turn and take positions with which I would never otherwise have agreed , whether in terms of national security or the EU internal market .	-7.2761
Whenever I speak publicly – and it does not matter what I say – a tirade of abuse in the social media that calls for selection , denounces the politics of the center , and tells me that I should not be in the Labour Party .	-4.9474
This experience has not only I made .	-3.1993
I do know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues , because the comments that are directed to me tend to be political .	-4.2751
I appreciate the professionalism and determination of my fellow Members who are subjected every day to a flood of sexist or racist abuse , but who are never deterred .	-4.2708
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the level of abuse has normalized .	-2.3134
Jeremy Corbyn asserted last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance .	-2.0413
The reality is that we are no longer the broad church and any motion of censure or amendment of the selection rules will make the party smaller .	-4.5057
Over the last two years , I have received a lot of advice on collecting my neck , not being so vocal , and then I would be “ OK . ”	-5.4934
But for this reason I have not come into politics .	-2.9820
32 years ago , I joined Labour as a student because of the neglect of the Thatcher government , which had led to my classroom literally collapsed , and as a result I tried to promote better public services for those who need it most , whether as a local council or ministers .	-7.4338
I have never hidden my political views , including in the last election .	-2.9229
As far as my political positions were concerned , no one in Nottingham East should have been in any way confused ; the same applies to areas where I disagree with the current leadership .	-4.2582
I would just like to say to those who supported the Friday request that I do not understand why they waste time and energy to remain loyal to me and the Labour Party when the country is heading for a Brexit that damages households , businesses and our public services .	-5.1884
But the only message I have is not about Nottingham , but about my constituents , whether Labour members or not : I am proud to serve you , and I promise you that I will not be holding any threats to withdraw or political opportunities from work , which I believe is the best interest of all of you .	-5.0070

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose : Ayr Unlay at the top	-3.4074
Two late Trios may have distorted the final result somewhat , but there is no doubt that Ayr has deserved to win this wonderful entertaining Tenent 's Premiership Match of the day .	-3.9813
They now run the table as the only non-layer of the ten teams .	-4.3657
In the end , it was due to the outstanding defense of the host , but also to the fact that opportunities were better utilised .	-6.2269
" We were tested so far through our games and we are still unstuck , so I must be happy , " he said .	-3.6753
Robyn Christie of Melrose said : “ Thanks to Ayr , they have made better use of their opportunities . ”	-3.2487
Grant Anderson 's attempt in the 14th minute , compared by Frazier Climo , brought Ayr forward , but a yellow card for Scotland 's captain Rory Hughes , who was given for the game of Warrior , allowed Melrose to speak numbers , and Jason Baggot a non-related attempt to steal .	-6.1531
Climo performed Ayr ’ s lead with a penalty shot before he made a hit directly at the halfway stage , and then made a solo attempt to get him into the 17 : 5 pause guide for Ayr .	-8.8177
Melrose began his second half well , and Patrick Anderson 's attempt to transform Baggot reduced the lag to five points .	-4.6298
After the reboot , Ayr built the lead as a drummer of Climo 's lord Tom McCormick .	-10.5308
Ayr 's current captain , Blair Mackerson , got the yellow card , and again Melden made the rose extra man pay with an unmodified Bruce Colvine attempt at the end of a heavy overhang of pressure .	-6.5682
However , the home page came back , and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card because of a Strike without Climo ball from the penalty limit , MacPherson made a touchdown , the penultimate Ayr back .	-7.6166
Climo converged , as almost after the reboot , after Kyle Rowe David Armstrons Boxkick began and sent the flying ship Gregor Henry per pass to Tryy number five .	-6.3076

Throughout Bolivia , memory of a coastline lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the nineteenth century is still alive - as is the desire to travel back to the Pacific .	-4.7684
These hopes may be at their peak for decades , as Bolivia is waiting for a judgment from the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of deliberations .	-4.3094
" Bolivia has the dynamism , spirit of unity and serenity and , of course , awaits the result with a positive view , " said Roberto Calzadilla , a Bolivian diplomat .	-4.2579
Many Bolivians will follow the judgment of the International Court of Justice on large screens throughout the country , and hope that the tribunal in The Hague will favour Bolivia 's claim that Chile will have to negotiate after decades of restless talks to grant Bolivia a sovereign access to the sea .	-6.1263
For Evo Morales , Bolivia ’ s charismatic president – who faces a controversial re-election struggle next year – it also depends very much on Monday ’ s decision .	-4.1368
“ We are on the verge of regaining access to the Pacific , ” he vowed at the end of August .	-2.8784
But some analysts find it unlikely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia , and believe that even a positive decision on Bolivia will not bring about change .	-4.5092
The Dutch UN body has no authority to award Chilean territory and has established that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks .	-4.1057
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice came about only six months after hearing the final arguments shows that the case was ' not complicated ' , said Paz Zárate , a Chilean expert on international law .	-3.9897
And far from advancing Bolivia ’ s cause , the last four years could have reversed it .	-2.9194
“ The question of access to the sea is being used by the current Bolivian Government for its purposes , ” said Zárate .	-3.2742
Morales ’ aggressive rhetoric has destroyed every remaining Chilean goodwill , proposing .	-2.8424
Bolivia and Chile will resume negotiations at some point , but it will be difficult to continue talks after that .	-2.7914
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962 .	-1.2766
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé , Bolivia ’ s representative in The Hague , rejected the idea that the court had decided unusually quickly .	-4.3337
Monday will offer Bolivia “ an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile , ” and an opportunity to put an end to 139 years of disagreements with varying benefits , ” he said .	-4.3236
Calzadilla also denied that Morales , who continues to be one of Latin America ’ s most popular presidents , uses the issue of sea access politically for his purposes .	-3.7634
“ Bolivia will never give up the right to access the Pacific , ” he added .	-1.2582

North Korea says that nuclear disarmament will not come , unless it can trust the US .	-2.1587
North Korea ’ s foreign minister , Ri Yong Ho , says that his nation will never use its nuclear weapons first if it cannot trust Washington .	-3.4878
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday .	-1.4837
He called on the United States to honour the promises made during a summit of the two rival leaders in Singapore .	-2.7461
His statements come at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to resume diplomatic talks on nuclear disarmament in Singapore three months after the meeting with the North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Il .	-3.5834
Ri says that it is “ a dream , ” that sanctions continue to be imposed and the US ’ s opposition to a statement ending the Korean War will ever bring the North to its knees .	-5.3678
Washington wants to accept the declaration that Pyongyang has taken comprehensive disarmament measures .	-4.7090

John Edward : Language skills that are essential to global citizens	-2.5678
Independent schools in Scotland have a record of academic excellence , which continued in 2018 with outstanding results , including single- and group successes in sports , art , music , and other community ventures .	-6.0651
With over 30,000 students across Scotland , these schools , represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools ( SCIS ) , are anxious to offer their students and parents the best level of service .	-3.3965
Independent schools are designed to prepare students – for further education , also at universities , for their desired careers , and for their role as a citizen of the world .	-5.8946
In the education sector , we have the opportunity to develop and implement a tailored school curriculum , and we note that modern languages are still popular and desirable in schools .	-4.8536
Nelson Mandela once said , “ If you speak to a person in the language he understands , you reach his mind . ”	-3.7389
When you talk to him in his own language , it goes to his heart . ”	-2.9435
This makes an impressive illustration of the fact that we cannot rely on English only if we are to build relationships and trust with people from other countries .	-4.7371
The results of this year show that languages are at the top of the tables with the highest number in independent schools .	-4.2736
68 % of students who have studied foreign languages have reached the “ Higher grade A ” higher class A .	-3.6927
The data collected by the 74 member schools of the SCIS showed that 72 percent of students reached a “ Higher grade A ” in Mandarin , while at the students learning German , French , and Spanish , respectively 72 , 69 , and 63 reached Level A .	-5.6398
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are promoting foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future .	-3.1841
Language subjects rank the same in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere as MINT subjects ( mathematics , information technology , science and technology ) .	-4.0431
A 2014 British Commission survey of employment and qualifications revealed that 17 % of the reasons why employers had difficulty filling jobs are attributable to a lack of language knowledge .	-5.5833
Therefore , language skills are increasingly imperative to prepare young people for their professional future .	-3.4034
These skills are essential in a globalised world , given more promising employment opportunities that require languages .	-4.5839
Regardless of the career someone chooses when he has learned a second language , he will have a real advantage in the future with a lifetime capability such as this .	-4.8544
With the possibility of communicating directly with people from abroad , a multilingual person will automatically be ahead of the competition .	-3.3920
According to a YouGov survey with more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013 , 75 % were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation , and French is the only language spoken with a two-digit percentage , namely 15 % .	-3.9644
That is why the current investment in language teaching is important for today ’ s children .	-3.3451
When children learn to speak several languages – especially those of developing countries – they will later have better opportunities to find meaningful employment in the labour market .	-4.3859
The schools in Scotland differ in their language offerings .	-3.2449
Some schools focus on classical modern languages , while other languages that are most important for Britain in 2020 , such as Mandarin or Japanese , will be taught .	-4.2526
Whatever your child is interested , a number of languages will always be available in independent schools , with teachers specialised in this field .	-4.0007
Independent schools in Scotland want to offer a learning environment that is well prepared for children , and they should be given the necessary tools for their success , whatever the future may be .	-6.1360
In today ’ s global business , languages are undeniably still important for the country ’ s future , and this must also be reflected in education .	-3.1426
Indeed , modern languages should really be regarded as “ international communication capabilities . ”	-2.9686
Independent schools will continue to offer young people in Scotland this choice , diversity and excellence .	-2.4333

It is the first of five scheduled elections next week , and Trump will also visit the Republican states of Tennessee and Mississippi .	-5.8145
While his candidate ’ s endorsement of the Supreme Court remains pending , Trump must mobilize his electorate for the upcoming midterm elections , otherwise it is to be feared that the Republicans will lose the majority in Congress when elected in November .	-5.7690

Trump will certainly respond to the hearings that will take place this week on charges of sexual abuse against his candidate for the Supreme Court , Brett Kavanaugh , whose confirmation in office , which must be carried out by the Senate , has been postponed by at least a week until the end of the FBIT missions .	-6.3665
But the main goal of these electoral events is to mobilize the Republicans facing a critical election in November .	-3.5181
According to Reuters , the goal of Trump ’ s campaign is to mobilize volunteers and supporters with the five elections next week to defend and expand the majority of Republicans in the Senate and the House of Representatives .	-3.8710
“ The majority in Congress is at the top of the president ’ s agenda , so he visits as many states as possible just before the start of the turbulent campaign season , ” said Reuters , a spokesman for the Trump campaign , who does not want to be named .	-5.9435
According to the radio network West Virginia MetroNews , the electoral event that occurs this evening at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania , and attract the attention of the Pittsburgh media .	-5.7757

Ryder Cup 2018 : The team USA is ready to fight to keep the hope of Sunday talks alive .	-4.9166
After three one-sided encounters , four players were probably exactly what the Ryder Cup needed on Saturday afternoon .	-4.2344
The floating pendulum is a freely invented sports concept that players have internalized , especially in competitions like this .	-2.8344
So where would they say the momentum is now ?	-2.0602
“ You had a six-point lead and now there are four , so there is a bit of momentum for us , ” said Jordan Spith , when he left for the day . ”	-4.9627
Europe is , of course , ahead of four points , and twelve more are still to be played .	-5.8218
The Americans , as Spith says , feel a little wind in their sails and there was much encouragement for them , not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas , who played together all day and each have three out of four points .	-5.9473
Spith was superior from the beginning and set a good example .	-3.4631
These chicks became louder when his hand went on , he lost a decisive shot to reach a decision in game 4 after he and Thomas fell 2 points after 2 games .	-9.3470
His delight at putting on the 15th hole with which they won the match was that one thought he still believed in the victory of the Americans .	-5.1276
" You really have to concentrate strongly and worry about your own game , " said Spith .	-5.0211
This is all that remains for each of those players .	-3.3567
18 holes to leave impression .	-0.7284
In the last two days , Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood were the only players with more points than the Spith and Thomas .	-4.2429
Europe 's quaint , but admirable couple is playing aimlessly and doing everything right .	-3.8883
" Moliwood " was the only couple who did not reach a Bogey on Saturday afternoon , but they also avoided the rear nine on Saturday morning , Friday afternoon and Friday morning .	-5.0865
This race and the way in which their energy seems to flow from this crowds of spectators makes them a favourite on Sunday and if the sun passes through Le Golf National , there would be no more popular player who seals a possible European victory than Fleetwood or Molinari .	-8.7129
Probably both at the same time at different holes .	-2.3101
Speaking of a European victory now would be too premature .	-2.2629
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short trial with Sergio Garcia , who was victorious with his partner Alex Noren in the morning .	-3.2789
With a Bogey and two Doubles on the first nine Spaniards and the Swede entered a hole from which they never came out again .	-4.8740
On Sunday there is no one who will help you out of your hole .	-3.5006
Because of the interactions between the mating , given advice , given advice , given advice and the way a strategy can change in the blink , it is very fascinating to observe the Fourballs and Foursomes from close proximity .	-5.8565
Europe has played better than a team so far and has taken on a significant lead in the last day , but this Foursome-concession has also shown that the team USA has the desire to fight what some , especially Stateside , have questioned .	-7.5634
Europe leads 10-6 on the Ryder Cup Final Day	-3.0941
Europe will use a solid advantage over the last day of the Ryder Cup after it came out of the four and four games on Saturday with a 10-6 lead over the United States .	-6.3203
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the group with two victories over a rival Tiger Woods to put their previous record in the Le Golf National on four points .	-5.6410
The European team of Thomas Bjorn , who dominated an American team fighting to secure the trophy , which she lost two years ago in Hazelnine , dominated the moralistic Fourballs , and won the series with 3-1 .	-6.9067
The US offered more resistance in the Vieren and won two games , but they could not digest the deficit .	-2.6025
Jim Furyk 's team needs eight points from the 12 individual games from Sunday to keep the trophy .	-3.2149
Fleetwood is the first European Rookie who wins four points in a row , while he and Molinari , after a sensational weekend called " Molliwood " , are only the second pair , which wins four points from their first four games in the story of the Ryder Cup .	-4.4187
After they destroyed Woods and Patrick Reed in the Fourballs , it was considered certain that they would beat a soiled Woods and American Rookie Bryson Dechameau through an even clearer 5 & 4 .	-6.8936
Woods , who lashed himself through two games on Saturday , occasionally showed brilliant actions , but he has lost 19 of his 29 matches in four times and four times , and seven in a row .	-7.0067
Justin Rose , resting for the morning Fourball , returned to his partner Henrik Stenson in the Foursomes and beat in a 2 & 1 defeat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – place one and three in the world .	-4.6308
At a pleasant , airy day southwest of Paris , however , Europe did not have it in its own way .	-3.3693
The three main winners , Jordan Spith and Justin Thomas , set the American benchmark on Saturday with two points .	-5.5189
They won a brave 2 : 1 victory against the Spaniard Jon Rahm and Ian Pouler in the 4-wheelsack and later returned to fight Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 : 3 in the 4-wheelsack after losing the first two holes .	-6.3340
Only twice in the Ryder Cup story a team returns from a four-point deficit to the singles , although holder Furyk 's page needs only one draw to keep the trophy .	-5.1233
After two days of second order , however , a Sunday counter looks like he would go beyond them .	-5.2801
North Korea says that “ by no means ” there will be unilateral disarmament without trust .	-3.2141
North Korea ’ s foreign minister said to the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions would deepen his distrust of the United States , and that , in no case , the country would unilaterally abandon nuclear weapons under such . , , however , would the United States .	-7.1595
Ri Yong Ho said to the global body ’ s annual general assembly that North Korea took " significant goodwill measures " last year , such as the suspension of nuclear and missile tests , the dismantling of the nuclear test base and the obligation not to spread nuclear and nuclear technology .	-6.1301
" There is no such answer from the USA , " he said .	-3.2949
“ Without any confidence in the US , there will be no confidence in our national security , and in such circumstances there is no way that we can first disarm unilaterally . ”	-3.9267
While Ri revived the known North Korean grievances about Washington ’ s opposition to a “ gradual ” approach to denuclearization , where North Korea would be rewarded with gradual steps , his explanation seemed significant in that it did not reject unilateral denuclearization completely , as Pyongyang did in the past .	-6.1021
Ri drew attention to a joint declaration by Kim Jong-Il and Donald Trump at a first summit between an incumbent US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12 , when Kim committed to working toward “ denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula , ” while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea ’ s security .	-4.6093
North Korea has been seeking a formal end to the Korean War 1950-53 , but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons .	-3.1682
Washington has also resisted calls for a relaxation of tough international sanctions against North Korea .	-2.3610
The US insists on " denuclearization first " and increases the pressure from sanctions to achieve its purpose in a binding way , and even reject the " declaration of the end of war " , said Ri .	-6.1602
" The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a dream of the people who are ignorant of us .	-3.3684
But the problem is that continued sanctions exacerbate our distrust . ”	-2.2136
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump , which the US President emphasized at the United Nations earlier this week .	-3.1473
Instead , the Minister raised three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae over the last five months and added : ' If the party were to be on this issue of denuclearization and not the US , denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have reached such a dead end ' .	-5.0721
However , the tone of Ri 's speech was dramatically different from last year when he reported it to the U.N. , and the General Assembly , targeting the US mainland with North Korea ’ s missiles , was inevitable after “ Mr. Evil President ” Trump called Kim a “ missile man ” on a suicide mission .	-5.9679
This year at the United Nations , Trump , who threatened to “ completely destroy ” North Korea last year , praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm , but he also said that much work still needed to be done , and sanctions must remain until North Korea eliminated denuclearization .	-4.2736
On Wednesday , Trump said that he did not have a timeframe for this , saying : ' It does not matter whether it takes two years , three years , or five months ' .	-3.9670
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken .	-1.6223
However , in the United States Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo said to the UN , the Security Council on Thursday : ' The enforcement of the Security Council 's sanctions must continue vigorously and without a lack of deficiency until we realize the full , final and verified denuclearization ' .	-6.8833
Since 2006 , the Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea in order to prevent the financing of the nuclear and ballistic missile programmes involving Pyongyang .	-3.6722
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then said that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit .	-3.3066
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year , but his last trip was not good .	-2.3498
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress has been made , and only a few hours later , North Korea condemned him to “ meet similar demands . ”	-4.2311
At a meeting with Moon this month , North Korea promised to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the United States takes ' appropriate measures ' .	-5.2847
He said Kim told him that the " related measures " he sought were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore , and steps to normalization relations with Washington .	-4.3092
Harvard students take part in the course to find enough peace .	-2.6497
With a new course this year at Harvard University , all students get more sleep to fight against the growing macho culture of studying the koufeintook " through nights " .	-5.9756
A scientist has found that students at a world leading university are often unsuspecting when it comes to helping themselves , even when it comes to very simple mechanisms .	-4.3461
Charles Czisler , professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women 's Hospital , designed the course he believes to be the first of his kind in the US .	-3.8192
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the impact of lack of sleep on learning .	-3.0037
In the end , a girl came to me and said : " Why is this only now , in my final year , said ?	-4.5977
She said that she never told anyone of the meaning of the sleeping , which surprised me , " he told the Telegraph .	-4.4871
The course , which is being offered for the first time this year , explains to students the basics of how good sleeping habits promote academic and sporting performance and improve their general well-being .	-4.6827
Paul Barreira , professor of Psychiatrie at Harvard Medical School and Managing Director of the University ’ s Health Service , said that the university decided to introduce the course after it found that students had slept extremely little during the week .	-5.7027
The 1 hour course includes a series of interactive tasks .	-2.4762
In a section there is an image of a bedroom where students click on coffee cups , curtains , trainers , and books to be informed about the effects of caffeine and light , and about how sporting performance is affected by lack of sleep and the importance of sleeping time routine .	-5.6562
Another section explains to participants how long lasting sleep can increase the risk of heart attack , stroke , depression , and cancer .	-3.6941
A map of the campus with interactive symbols encourages participants to reflect on their daily life .	-2.2240
We know that it will not change the behavior of students immediately .	-2.0235
" But we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know the health effects of the decision to smoke cigarettes , " Prof. Czisler added .	-4.1853
The culture of pride still exists , he said , and added that modern technology and increasing pressure on students and students make sleeping deprivation a growing problem .	-2.7834
Enough sleep of good quality should be a student 's " secret weapon " to fight stress , exhaustion , and fear , he said - also to not accept sleep deprivation , because sleep takes the brain into starvation mode and makes it constantly hungry .	-5.2913
Raymond Thus , a 19-year-old Californian who studied chemical and physical biology , Professor Czisler helped design the course after visiting one of his classes last year in Harvard .	-3.8715
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to push a Campuswide course .	-3.5052
The next step , he hopes , is to call on all doctoral students to complete a similar study programme before entering the school .	-5.1139
Prof. Czisler recommended the students to set an alert when they should go to bed and when they should wake up , and to be aware of the harmful effects of the " blue light " broadcast by electronic screens and LED lighting , which can bring their circular rhythm out of the run , which leads to problems when they sleep .	-7.2845
Livingston 1-0 Ranger : Mengas Goudal et Gerrads Men	-3.4475
Further upside problems of the Ranners : After a hit by Dolly Menga , in Livingston the 1-to-0 defeat for the unsome team of Steven Gerrard .	-6.6772
The Ibrox team wanted to record their first victory since the 4th : 1-triumph in February in St. Johnstone , but the team of Gary Holt added Gerrard 's to in , and .	-5.8766
Menga had a hit seven minutes prior to the half , and an inspiring rankings didn ’ t look as though she could bring a balance .	-7.5221
While the Rangers now fall back to the sixth place , Livington climb to rank three and are only behind Hibernian because of the Tordifferential .	-5.0251
New difficulties for the Rangers are apparent , as the Calum Spence liner had to be given a head hit after it was hit by a litter object – thrown out of the range of outreach fans .	-9.2234
Gerrard made eight changes to the side that passed to Ayr and moved straight into the semi-finals of the Betvian Cup .	-4.6746
In contrast , Holt raised the same Livi-Elf , who dropped a point last week ’ s hearing , and he should have been enthusiastic about how his well trained team did not leave any room for action to the opponents at any time .	-8.2339
The Rangers were dominated by ball ownership , but Livington had better opportunities .	-5.4582
You should have hit after only two minutes , when Mengas sent first pile Scott Pittman towards Allan McGregor Tor , but the middle field player rolled his big change past the gate .	-6.2255
A deeper Freightur of Keaghan Jacobs then went to captain Craig Halkett , but his defense partner Alan Lithgov could only shoot far in the direction of upright posts .	-5.7833
The Rangers took control , but there seemed to be more hope than unthinking in their own game , the last third .	-5.4158
Alfredo Morelos , after the end of the first quarter of an hour , was clearly of the opinion that he deserved an Elfmeter after he and Steven Lawless had clashed , but Judge Steven Thomson did not follow the appeals of Colombians .	-8.6991
The Ranners only reach two shots in the first half , but the former Ibrox-Torkeeper Liam Kelly was hardly the head of Lassanna Coulibys and the hit of a bissloze Ovi Ejaria .	-7.6656
Even if Livis ’ s opening meeting in the 34th minute may have been contrary to the running , no one can deny that she deserved it for her efforts alone .	-5.6849
Again , the Rangers failed to manage a Jacobean condition .	-3.9812
Scott Arfield didn 't react as Declan Nelson Scott Robinson played the ball , saving the rest and selecting Menga for a simple finish .	-5.3294
Gerrard acted during the break when he exchanged cannibaly against Ryan Kent and the change immediately affected the game when the wing player played Morelos , but the impressive Kelly moved from his line to block .	-6.5392
But Livingston repeatedly drew guests to play exactly the kind of games they like , with Lithgov and Halkett wearing long balls after long balls .	-4.3828
Holts ’ team could have expanded their leadership in the final stage , but McGregor was well positioned to deny Jacobs , before Lithgov was away from the corner .	-9.1345
The Ranger representative Glenn Middleton had another delayed claim to a penalty , because he promised his with Jacobs , but again he saw Thomson deranged .	-6.5153
Almunach : The inventor of the violin counter	-3.1208
And now a page from our almanac after “ Sunday morning ” : 30 September 1882 , that was more than 136 years ago ... The day on which the future physicist John Wilhelm , called Hans , Geiger was born in Germany .	-4.3256
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity , an invention that finally brought the device known as Geiger meters .	-3.3134
The Geiger counter has since also become a mainstream of science , as in the 1950s , " Bells of Coronado " , the seemingly unlikely cowboy scientist Roy Rogers and Dale Evans :	-4.5669
Man : " What about everything in the world is that ? '	-2.6697
Rogers : “ It is a Geiger counter used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium .	-1.6783
If you set up these headphones , you can actually hear the effects of the atoms released from radioactivity into the minerals . ”	-3.6252
Evans : ‘ Just say , now it is weening but it ’ !	-6.5459
Hans Geiger died in 1945 , only a few days before his 63th birthday .	-1.7332
But the invention that bears its name will continue to be used .	-2.6613
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “ see ” malign cells .	-2.0227
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “ see ” and kill malign cells .	-2.5706
vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malign cells as part of treatment .	-2.6845
The procedure includes the extraction of immune cells of a patient , modification of these in the laboratory .	-4.0467
You can then see a protein that is common to many types of cancer and then injected again .	-3.0432
A study impfstoff shows promising results for patients with a number of cancers .	-3.4392
A woman treated with the vaccine , who helped to recognize rogue cells , saw their ovary cancer disappear for more than 18 months .	-4.7550
The method is to extract immune cells from a patient to change them in the laboratory , so that a protein called HER2 is “ visible ” that occurs in many types of cancer , and then re-injected the cells .	-5.3397
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda , Maryland , said : " Our findings point to us having a very promising vaccine . "	-2.4724
HER2 “ promotes the growth of various types of cancer ” , including breast , eggs , lung and intestinal cancer , Prof. Berzofsky declared .	-3.8629
A similar approach to taking patients from immune cells and teaching them how to attack cancer cells has worked in treating a kind of leukaemia .	-3.8552

" As often I speak with a white person and she says , " How can you like Trump , he is a racist ? "	-3.5454
Well , if I were concerned about racism , I would have been out of America long ago , " he said .	-3.5307
The Saturday-Night-Live Show began with a sketch in which Hollywood Star Matt Damon made her sexually compelling about Brett Kavanugh 's statement in front of the Senate Justice Committee concerning Christine Blasey Ford 's allegations that Kavanaugh had .	-7.0121
Although it was not broadcast , the film material was shared by West ’ s Burleitz by the comedian Chris Rock in the Social Media .	-5.2640
It is unclear whether Rock has tried to mock West with the contribution .	-2.4968
West too had complained to the audience that he had had had trouble behind the stage because of his headgear .	-3.7914
" They harassed me behind the stage .	-1.5139
You said , ' Don 't go out with the hat ' .	-3.1646
You have annoyed me !	-1.3484
And then they say that I am in a given place , " he said , according to the Washington Examiner .	-2.7252
West continued : " Want to see the sunken place ? " and said that he would " attract my superman cloak , because that means that you can 't tell me what I want to do , you want the world ? , , and , , and , , , and , , , , ,	-7.9951

But Talkmmasterin Karen Hunter twined that West simply " is what he is , and that is absolutely wonderful " .	-4.4834
“ But I will not reward anyone ( by buying his music or clothing or supporting his art ) , which I believe he is adopting and distributing an ideology that is harmful to my community . ”	-4.2258

According to the information published , the private addresses and telephone numbers of US Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and US Senator Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch , both from Utah , were reported .	-5.3414
The information appeared online on Thursday , posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing about the accusations of sexual misconduct against the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh .	-4.0923
The data of the three senators were published shortly after the survey of Kavanaugh .	-1.6234
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with Waters 's office and published the information of an employee of Waters .	-4.7203
“ This unjustified accusation is completely wrong and an absolute lie , ” says Waters .	-4.2876
“ The employee of my employees – whose identity , personal information , personal data , and security were compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false claims – was in no way responsible for the fact that this information was read .	-4.8143
This groundless claim is completely wrong and an absolute lie .	-3.4790
Waters 's statement quickly led online to criticism , including the former White House secretary of the White House Ari Fleischer .	-5.9975
“ The fact that the matter is denied is extremely annoying , ” he wrote .	-3.5135
“ This suggests that it is inappropriate as a member of Congress .	-3.0761
If someone is accused of having done something , he must not be evil .	-2.7484
They must not be bored .	-2.9050
They must not question the motives of the plaintiff .	-1.9600
They must be quiet and left . ”	-2.0194
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters ’ response with the Democrats ’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh , accused of offending them during the Thursday hearing .	-4.9118
Likewise , Omar Navarro , a Republican candidate who ran near the sedentary river in the midterm elections , expressed his thoughts on Twitter .	-4.3805
“ Big , if true , ” he got married .	-3.7283
In her statement , Waters said that her office " informed the competent authorities and law enforcement authorities about the fraudulent claims .	-3.4712
“ We will ensure that the perpetrators are apprehended and their actions , which have a destructive and dangerous impact on my employees , continue to be held accountable . ”	-4.4863
Review by " Johnny English - You live only triple " - badly filled parody with Rowan Atkinson .	-3.8093
It is a tradition to search for hints in every new film with a British tendency to Brexit , and this seems to be applicable to this revival of the Johnny English Action-Comedy-Spomp , which began in 2003 with Johnny English and was launched again in 2011 with " Johnny English Reborn " .	-8.7889
Is the ironic self-sation of the abyss the nation ’ s new export opportunity ?	-4.7116
In any case , for the second time , the gloomish , gummifaceless and incompetent Johnny English has obtained the license to break things up again .	-10.3020
He is , of course , the stupid secret agent who , despite his bizarre claims to Smoothie-Glamour , got a bit of clouseau , a knight Mr. Bean and a punch from this guy , and who has contributed a single note to the leitmelodie of the fire brigade car at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London .	-8.5611
It is also based on the traveller and international , mysterious Atakinson , who once played a part in the now-forgotten Barclays TV show , is always in chaos .	-6.6433
There are one or two beautiful moments in this latest Johnny England combination .	-4.0271
I loved Johnny English , who approaches a helicopter in a medieval armor and beats the main rotor briefly against his helmet .	-4.5805
Atkinson 's talent for body humor is to be seen , but the humor feels rather weak and strange superfluous , especially since the " serious " footage like 007 and Mission Impossible self-confidently offer comedy as ingredient .	-4.8600
The humor feels rather like being directed to children rather than adults , and for me the crazy misadventures of Johnny English are not so inventive and focused as Atkinson Mr. answering films .	-6.0876
The perennial premise is that Britain is in great difficulty .	-2.2963
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the highly secret British network of spies and revealed the identity of all British agents on the ground , to the horror of the service agent – a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon .	-3.9915
Emma Thompson does her best with this quasi-Teresa-May character , but there is not much in the script to work with .	-5.2391
Their intelligence advisers inform them that , as each individual active spy has been compromised , she has to pick someone out of the retirement .	-5.4290
And this means that the awesome Johnny English itself , which is currently employed as a schoolmaster in an noble institution , but gives unsurpassed lessons about how to operate as a Undercover agent : some nice gags here , while English offers a school of rock academy on espionage .	-7.9079
English is returned to Whitehall for an emergency war and reunited with his former long-suffering Kumpel Bough , again played by Ben Miller .	-4.1567
Bough is now a married man who meets a submarine commander , an overtired , burschic role in which Vicki Pepperdine is not fully applicable .	-5.5851
So , the Batman and Robin the Chaos of Her Majesty 's Secret Service are back in action and meet on Olga Kurylenka 's beautiful wife Fatale Ophelia Bulletova .	-4.0901
Meanwhile , the Prime Minister is dangerously attacking the charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain ’ s computer problems : the dark Jason Volta , played by Jake Lacy .	-4.0411
English and Bough begin their odyssey of the colorful Highjinks : as a waiter they ignited a French Flash restaurant ; they create chaos by smuggling on board Voltas luxury yachts ; and English triggers pure anarchy when he tries to familiarise himself with a virtual reality headset with the interior of Voltas house .	-8.3955
For this last sequence , all registers have certainly been drawn , but they are so gracious and left out , the whole thing is reminiscent of children 's .	-7.0140
That is , strictly speaking .	-5.9302
And as with the other Johnny England movies , I could not fail to think : can the British film industry , Rowson , not give a role that really does justice to its talent ?	-6.5405
Labour denies having developed a plan for Britain for a four-day week , for which five days will be paid .	-5.3026
Jeremy Corbyn ’ s Labour Party is testing a radical plan , with Britons working only four days a week , but paid for five .	-4.4522
According to reports , the party wants heads of companies to pass on the savings made by the artificial intelligence revolution ( AI ) to workers by giving them an extra day .	-4.2346
Staff would enjoy a three-day weekend - but still receive the same amount of money .	-4.7180
Sources said that the idea would ' fit ' with the party 's economic agenda and plan to overturn it in favour of workers .	-4.6450
The trade union congress has approved the changeover to a four-day week as an opportunity for workers to use the changing economy .	-4.9332
A high-level Labour source said the Sunday Times : a policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year .	-3.1736
A four-day week is an objective that matches the party ’ s approach to restoring economic balance for workers and the party ’ s general industrial strategy , but that goal will not be achievable overnight .	-5.2133
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea , as the Green Party promised a four-day working week during its election campaign in 2017 . , , , , , , , , , ,	-3.5305
However , this advance is currently not supported by the whole Labour Party .	-3.8439
A Labour spokesman said : " A four-day week is not a party policy and is not intended by the party " .	-2.7349
Last week ’ s Labour Party Party Party Party Party Party Party Party Party Party Party Party Party Party Secretary John McDonnell took advantage of his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy .	-3.2884
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to regain the power of ' faceless directors ' and ' profiteers ' in utilities .	-3.1465
The plans of the Shadow Chancellor also mean that the current shareholders of water companies may not get their full share , because a Labour Government could make " deductions " due to alleged misconduct .	-6.4660
He also confirmed plans to put workers into business management and to create inclusive ownership funds to allocate 10 % of private-sector equity to employees receiving annual dividends of up to <unk> 500 .	-5.4754
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk in “ 60 minutes ” about whether FBITs ’ anti-Kavanaugh might change their minds .	-4.2129
On the basis of an ongoing FBI investigation into allegations of Judge Brett Kavanaugh , the final vote on the Supreme Court ’ s appointment was postponed by at least a week , and the question is raised as to whether the results of the FBI ’ s investigation might lead to the suspension of support for Kavanaugh .	-6.7248
In a Sunday interview , Scott Peley , a correspondent of “ 60 minutes , ” Republican Senators John Kennedy , and Lindsey Graham , questioned whether the FBI ’ s investigative findings could persuade them to change their minds .	-5.6048
Kennedy appeared more open than his South Carolina colleague .	-1.0772
“ Anyway , ” Kennedy said .	-1.4377
" I said at the beginning of the hearing that I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh .	-1.8330
I called him after it happened after that claim came out , I said : ' Have you done it ? '	-4.3284
He was determined , targeted , clear ' .	-2.9271
Graham 's voice , however , seemed to be cast in stone .	-2.2211
" I have an opinion on board Kavanaugh and it would need a bomb attack , " he said .	-3.3015
“ Dr Ford , I do not know what has happened , but I know that board strongly disputed the charge , ” Graham added with a reference to Christine Blasey Ford .	-4.5162
" None of them they called could confirm it .	-2.8480
It is 36 years ago .	-1.2287
I see nothing new that changes . '	-2.0411
" What is the Global Cities Festival and has ensured that poverty is reduced ? "	-2.5314
This Saturday , the Global Cities Festival takes place in New York , an annual music event with an impressive selection of stars and an equally impressive mission to end poverty in the world .	-3.8918
This year ’ s seventh Global Cities Festival will bring tens of thousands of people together at the Great Lawn in Central Park to experience not only stars like Janet Jackson , Cardi B , and Shawn Mendes , but also to draw attention to the real goal of the event : to end extreme poverty by 2030 .	-4.3332
Global Citizen Festival , which took place in 2012 , is an extension of Global Poverty Projects , an international interest group aimed at combating poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it .	-4.0542
In order to receive a free ticket for the event , the concert visitors had a whole series of tasks or " actions " , such as volunteering , an email to a leader in the world , a telephone call or another useful way of increasing the goal of combating poverty and raising awareness of it .	-6.7659
But how successful has Global Cities been with 12 remaining years to achieve its goal ?	-2.4567
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert , a real opportunity to convince people to call for action , or simply another case of what is called ' ClickActivism ' - people who feel that signing an online petition or an online application , or by doing so , sending a Tweet as if they make a real difference ?	-6.8967
Global Citizen says that , since 2011 , it has recorded more than 19 million “ actions ” by its supporters pushing for a variety of different goals .	-4.5340
It is said that these actions have motivated world leaders to make financial and political commitments worth more than $ 37 billion , which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion by 2030 .	-3.4204
In early 2018 , the Group made 390 bets and announcements from its actions , of which at least $ 10 billion has already been paid out or financed .	-4.2965
The group estimates that the funds allocated thus far had a direct impact on almost 649 million people around the world .	-3.7617
One of the most important commitments is The Power of Nutrition , a UK-based partnership of investors and executive organizations committed to “ helping children to develop their full potential . ” The organization has promised to help Rwanda , at $ 35 million , stop malnutrition in the country after Global Citizenship received more than 4,700 tweets .	-6.5573
“ With support from the British Government , the donor , other state governments , and global citizenship as you can make the social injustice of malnutrition one day history , ” The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman announced the crowd in a live concert in London in April 2018 .	-5.1065
The group also said that , after more than 5,000 actions in the UK aimed at improving maternal and child nutrition , the government will achieve the funding of the ' Power of Nutrition ' project for 5 million women and children with dietary interventions .	-4.9064
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on their website , “ Why do you think that we can end extreme poverty ? ”	-2.6133
Global citizens responded : it will be a long and difficult path - sometimes we will fall and fail .	-3.0330
Like the great civil law and anti-apartheid movements before us , we will succeed , because we are more powerful together .	-2.8385
The stars Janet Jackson , Weegd , Shawn Mendes , Cardi B and Janelle Monáe will be present at this year ’ s New York event , hosted by Abe Lee ra-Furness and Hugh Jackman .	-6.1394
US could use the navy to build a “ blockade ” to hinder Russian energy exports – Interior Minister .	-4.8801
Washington can use its navy , if necessary , to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets , including in the Middle East , US Interior Minister Ryan Zike is quoted by Washington Examiner .	-3.9584
Zike argued that Russia ’ s engagement in Syria – particularly in activities at the invitation of the legitimate government – was a pretext for exploring new energy markets .	-3.7820
“ I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate energy , just as they do in Eastern Europe , the southern part of Europe , ” he said .	-2.8559
And according to the officials , there are ways and means to circumvent them .	-3.2653
" The United States has this ability to use our navy to ensure that maritime routes are open , and if necessary to block , in order to ensure that their energy does not come onto the market , " he said .	-4.8596
Zinke spoke to participants in an event of Consumer Energy Alliance , a non-profit organization that calls itself the “ voice of energy consumers ” in the US .	-3.1963
He compared Washington ’ s approaches to Russia and Iran , and found that they are indeed the same .	-2.8427
" The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less about using and replacing fuels , " he said , while he called Russia a " one-trick honor " with an economy dependent on fossil fuels .	-4.6627
The opinions come when the Trump administration was on the mission to boost exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe and to replace Russia , which is a far more favourable option for European consumers .	-4.8292
Trump members of the Trump administration – including US President Donald Trump himself – are therefore trying to move Germany toward a halt to the “ inadequate ” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project that , according to Trump , would make Berlin “ captured ” in Moscow .	-4.6153
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $ 11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline , which is supposed to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres , is a purely economic project .	-3.5417
The Kremlin argues that Washington ’ s opposition to the project is simply driven for economic reasons , and is an example of unfair competition .	-3.4904
“ I believe we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument to exert pressure , and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers , ” said Russian energy minister Aleksandr Novak , after a meeting with US energy minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September .	-3.4908
The US ’ s stance has provoked a backlash from Germany , confirming its commitment to the project .	-3.3469
Germany ’ s leading industrial organization , the Federal Association of German Industries ( BDI ) , has called on the US to refrain from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow .	-3.4172
" I have a big problem when a third state enters our energy supply , " said the Federal Association of German Industry ( BDI ) , Dieter Kempf , after a meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin .	-3.5483

During a Council meeting in Holyoke , Massachusetts , Warren confirmed that she would consider running .	-2.2787
" It is time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government , and that includes a woman at the top , " she said , according to The Hill .	-2.3191
After 6 November , I will look seriously at the presidential candidate .	-2.3620
President Donald Trump was charged with hearings during the Rauthausen and said that he is heading ' this country in the wrong direction ' .	-6.1373
" I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy , " she said .	-1.7209
Warren did not mince his mouth in criticizing Trump and his Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh .	-2.9928
Warren said in a Tweet on Friday : ' Of course we need a FBI investigation before we vote ' .	-3.1307
However , a survey published on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren ’ s own voters do not believe that it should run in 2020 .	-3.1432
According to a poll conducted by Suffolk University Political Research Center / Boston Globe , 58 percent of the " likely " vote of authority , voters said that the Senator should not run .	-6.0412
Thirty-two percent supported such a run .	-1.8474
The survey showed more support for a race of the former Governor Deval Patrick , with 38 percent for a potential run and 48 percent against it .	-3.4179
Other high-profile democrats that are being discussed with regard to a possible candidacy in 2020 are former Vice-President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders .	-5.2057
The Associated Press reported that Biden would officially decide until January .	-2.4737
Sarah Palin cited Track Palin ’ s PTSD for Donald Trump ’ s campaign	-2.6741

Palin called his arrest “ the elephant in the room , ” and said about her son and other veterans : “ They come back a bit differently , coming back harder , asking whether the work of their fellow soldiers and the air force and all other members of the military is respected for the country . ”	-5.7888

18 states D. C. support the challenge of a new asylum policy	-1.5470
18 states and Washington , D.C. support a legal challenge to a new US policy that denies asylum to the victims fleeing gang or domestic violence .	-2.9983
According to NBC News , representatives from the 18 states and the district in Washington on Friday submitted an Amicus Curiae ( Friend of the Court ) to support an asylum seeker in the contest .	-4.0204
The full name of the plaintiff in the legal dispute of Grace against sessions submitted by the American Civil Liberties Union against the federal law in August is unknown .	-3.7484
She said that her partner " and his violent sons of band members " had abused them , but on 20 July US officials refused to apply for asylum .	-3.5670
She was arrested in Texas .	-0.9248
The state lawyers supporting Grace called El Salvador , Honduras and Guatemala , which comprise a large number of asylum seekers in the United States , as nations struggling with serious problems involving gangs and domestic violence .	-5.2808
The US ’ s new asylum policy reversed a decision by the Board of Appeals for Immigrants from 2014 that undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence can apply for asylum .	-4.5773
The Justice Minister of the District of Columbia Karl Racine said in an opinion on Friday that the new law ignores decades of national , federal and international law .	-2.6862
The Amicus Curiae states that , according to federal law , all applications for asylum must be assessed according to the circumstances of the respective complaint and such action violates this principle .	-4.9939
lawyers continued to argue in the paper that policies refusing entry to immigrants are damaging the US economy , because it is more likely that these immigrants will become entrepreneurs and “ do necessary work . ”	-5.6803
Attorney General Jeff sessions instructed immigrant magistrates in June to no longer grant asylum to people fleeing domestic or gang exile .	-4.2001
“ Asylum belongs to those who have to leave their country for persecution on the grounds of race , religion , nationality or affiliation to a particular social group or because of political opinion , ” said sessions in his statement on the law of 11 June .	-5.3764
Asylum was never intended to alleviate all the problems , even the serious people facing every day in the world .	-3.7037

Hundreds of people were injured and the hospitals that were devastated by the earthquake of magnitude 7.5 were completely overcrowded .	-3.3241

US ambassador accuses China of “ bullying ” with “ propaganda advertising . ”	-2.8590
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page display in a US daily on the mutual benefit of US China trade , the US ambassador to China published in Beijing to use the American press for propaganda .	-6.6919
Last Wednesday , US President Donald Trump referred to China Daily 's pay in the Des Moines Register - the state with Iowa 's most sold newspaper - after accusing China of interfering in the US Congress elections of 6 November , which China denies .	-6.1166
US officials claim to Reuters that Trump ’ s charge of interfering with the US election in Beijing is a new phase in an escalating Washington campaign to put pressure on China .	-3.2909
While it is normal for foreign states to turn on ads to promote trade , Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an escalating trade war with multiple rounds of tariffs on imports .	-3.1874
In an early phase of trade war , China ’ s retaliation tariffs should be met by Chinese and US experts , with exporters in US states like Iowa , where many supporters of Trump ’ s Republican Party live .	-4.7476
Terry Branstad , United States Ambassador to China and former Governor of Iowa , a major exporter of agricultural products to China , said that Beijing hurt American workers , farmers , and businesses .	-4.0800
China , Branstad wrote in a letter in the Des Moines Register on Sunday , “ is now firmly using propaganda in our own free press .	-4.8816
“ By spreading propaganda as a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register , China ’ s government takes advantage of the estimated American tradition of freedom of expression and press freedom , ” wrote Branstad .	-4.4610
" By contrast , you will find only limited voices in the newspaper stand in Beijing ’ s streets , and you will not see any real refusion of different opinions that the Chinese people might have on China ’ s disturbing economic development , given that the media are firmly under the control of the Chinese Communist Party , " he wrote .	-7.1032
He added that " one of China 's most prominent newspapers opposed the offer for publication , " although he did not say which newspaper .	-4.4047
The Republicans compared the Cavanath debacle of Midtermm elections , warned analysts	-4.2789
Many of the top Republicans defended Brett Kavanaugh , a nominee for the Supreme Court , even though he was accused of sexual assault , while analysts warn that they will see a retaliation in the upcoming elections , especially women .	-6.3422
The emotions were high , most Republicans have already said they want to vote for him .	-2.9399
These things cannot be attributed , said Grant Reeher , Professor of Political Science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University , on Saturday in an article published by The Hill .	-3.4933
Reeher said , he doubt that the last-minute support of Jeff Flake ( Republican Member for the Arizona State ) would be enough for FBI investigation to reconcile anger .	-6.3137
“ Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow and not in November , ” said Karine Jean-Pierre , Senior Citizen , and National spokeswoman for the progressive group MovOn on Friday , as reported by a Washington newspaper .	-4.4657
On Friday morning , the protesters sang : “ November is coming ! ” while demonstrating in the Senate ’ s hall , when the Republicans who control the Committee of Justice decided to continue with Kavanath ’ s nomination despite what Dr Christine Blasey Ford said , Mic .	-6.1865
“ The democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be immeasurable , ” said Stu Rothenberg , an impartial political analyst , the journalists .	-3.1819
“ People say that it is quite advanced , that is true .	-3.1323
But the figure could be higher , especially in pre-urban voters and younger voters , 18-to-29 , who may not suffer the president , but often do not vote . ”	-5.9715
Already before Ford ’ s public statement in which she expressed her accusations of sexual violence against the Supreme Court candidate , analysts indicated that a backlash could follow if Republicans bid .	-4.8354
“ For GOP , this has become a raging chaos , ” said Michael Steele , former chairman of the Republican National Committee , at the beginning of last week , according to NBC News .	-4.1482
“ It is not just about the election of the committee or the final election , or whether Kavanaugh is placed on the replacement bank , it is about how the Republicans have handled this and how they have treated it , ” said Guy Cecil , director of the priorities of the United States , a group that helps the Democrats to elect the news station .	-7.5531
But Americans are divided about what Ford and Kavanaugh have said .	-2.7434
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of the questioned Ford testimony definitely or probably believed , while 35 percent indicate that they definitely believed or probably cavanaugh .	-4.2153
Moreover , 38 % said that they thought Kavanaugh was probably or definitely lied during his statement , while only 30 % said the same about Ford .	-3.6365
On the initiative of Flake , the FBI is currently investigating the accusations of Ford and at least one more accuser , Deborah Ramirez , reported The Guardian .	-4.1172
Ford said last week before the Senate Justice Committee under oath that Kavanaugh had attacked her drunk at the age of 17 .	-3.0150
Ramirez accused the highest court of judges , while studying at Yale in the 1980s , at a party in front of her .	-6.0809

The only priest of the Church of England , who received a Victoria-cross during World War I , was celebrated 100 years later in his home city .	-4.3406
Lieutenant Colonel and Reverend Bernard Vann earned the award on September 29 , 1918 at the attack in Bellenglise and Lehaucourt .	-3.5433
However , he was killed four days later by a sniper in the car and did not know that he won the highest British military award .	-4.5874
A monument was unveiled by his two grandchildren on Saturday at a parade in Rushden , Northamtonshire .	-3.3221
One of his grandchildren , Michael Vann , said that it was “ incredibly symbolic ” that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather 's heroic achievements .	-3.9067
According to the London Gazette , in September 1918 , Colonel Vann conducted his battalion via the channel of Saint-Quentin “ in very dense fog and under heavy attack by fieldpieces and machine guns . ”	-7.4710
Later , he moved up to the firing line , leading the line forward with the “ biggest Galanterie ” before he moved one field gun and pushed three times the departure .	-8.2557
Lieutenant General Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4 , 1918 – just under a month before the end of the war .	-3.4014
Michael Vann , 72 , said the actions of his grandfather were " something that I know could never do justice to , something that truly instils humility " .	-4.0092
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also brought down a wreath after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band .	-4.1958
Michael Vann said he felt “ very honoured to attend the parade ” and added : “ The bravery of a real hero is reflected in the support he gets from many people . ”	-3.7997
MMA fans stayed awake all night to see Bellator 206 , instead got Peppa Pig .	-3.0348
Imagine , you 've stayed awake all night to see the entire Bellator 206-event just to see the main event .	-6.4395
The San Jose plan had 13 battles , including six main battles and was shown live in the night in the UK on Channel 5 .	-4.1715
At 6 o 'clock in the morning , just then as Gegard Moussasi and Rory MacDonald were prepared to confront each other , viewers in the United Kingdom were able to see how media coverage on Peppa Pig was switched .	-7.9700
Some were unprinted after they were awake until the early hours , especially for the fight .	-4.6227
A fan on Twitter described the change to the children 's box as " some sick joke " .	-4.8818
" It is a state rule that at 6 o 'clock in the morning these contents were not suitable , so they had to change to children 's programmes , " said Dave Schwartz , Bellator Senior Vice President of Marketing and Communication , when asked for the transfer .	-5.3257
" Peppa the pip , " yes . "	-1.7376
Bellator Managing Director Scott Coker said that they will work on their planning in the future to include British viewers .	-5.8013
" If I think about the repetition , we will somehow get it up , " he said .	-2.9523
" But it is 6 a.m. on a Sunday there and we will only be able to fix it on Sunday of our time , Monday of their time .	-3.9820
But we are working on it .	-1.6409
Believe me , when it was turned off , a lot was written and the contents were not friendly .	-3.4874
We tried to fix it , we thought it would be a technical error .	-1.4209
But it was not , it was a problem for the government .	-2.0167
I can promise you that it will not happen next time .	-1.5373
We will reduce it to five rather than six fights - as we normally do - and we have tried to outdo the fans and have simply gone over .	-4.6689
It is an adverse situation . '	-1.7774
Desert Island Discs : Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality .	-2.9158
The Olympic diver Tom Daley says that he grew up with the feeling that he had lost all due to his sexuality - but that gave him the motivation to be a success .	-4.4336
The 24-year-old said that he was only aware at secondary school that “ not everyone is like me . ”	-3.4531
In the first edition of Desert Island Discs at Radio 4 , Lauren Laverne said he spoke publicly about the rights of homosexuals to give others “ hope . ”	-4.1039
He also said that victory at the Olympic Games after the birth of his first child would have become less important to him .	-2.5410
The regular presenter of the show , Kristiy Young , has taken off for several months due to an illness .	-5.3559
Daley appeared in Lavernes ’ first program , saying that he felt “ less worth ” than the others as a growth , because “ it was not accepted by society to stand on men and women . ”	-4.9841
He said : “ To this day , these feelings of the Weniger Wert and otherness gave me the strength and strength , I needed you to be successful . , ” , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-5.5000
He wanted to prove that he was “ something , ” he meant to disappoint no one when he got away from his sexual orientation .	-4.8920
The two-time bronze medal winner has become a high-profile LGBT activist and used his appearance at this year 's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more countries to criminalise homosexuality .	-3.9440
He said he was saying that he was fortunate enough to live openly and without consequences , and because he wanted to give others ' hope ' .	-4.6001
Three times the world champion said that he fell in love with a man , the US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black , whom he met in 2013 , which he was very surprised about .	-4.5499
Daley married the Oscar winner , who is 20 years older than him , last year , but the age difference was never a problem .	-4.2210
“ If so much is done at such a young age , ” he took part in the Olympic Games for the first time at 14 years , three years later his father died of cancer – he said it was hard to find someone at the same age who had lived similar highs and lows .	-7.2406
The couple was in June parents of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley , and Daley said his " full perspective " had changed .	-4.3272
“ Last year , everything turned to me to win a gold medal , ” he said .	-2.2892
" But know what is more important than Olympic gold .	-2.4693
My gold medal is Robbie . ”	-1.3552
His son bears the name of his father , Robert , who died in 2011 after a cancer diagnosis for only 40 years .	-3.7523
Daley said that his father did not accept that he would die , and one of the last things he had asked was whether they had their tickets for London 2012 - because he wanted to be in the first row .	-3.1399
“ I could not tell him : <unk> You will not experience sitting in the first row , Dad <unk> , he said .	-3.9620
“ I kept his hand when his breathing was suspended .	-12.2675

The informal Mickelson sat on the Ryder Cup-Saturday in the Bank .	-5.3499
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup-game , but he must dramatically improve his shape so that it won 't be a sad milestone .	-4.5129
Mickelson , who played for the 12th time at the event that takes place every two years , was put on the bank by Captain Jim Furyk for the Fourballs and Foursomes on Saturday .	-4.1536
Instead , as is so often the case for the US , the five-fold Major Winner shared his day between Anfire and practice rounds on the golf course , hoping to overcome his depth .	-7.4034
Even at the height of his career , the 48-year-old driver is never the most straightforward driver and is not suitable for the narrow Le Golf National Square , where the long Rough regularly punishes false .	-5.2540
And as if the square wasn ’ t challenging enough , in the ninth match on Sunday , Mickelson meets the British Open Champion Francesco Molinari , who won all four matches this week together with the newcomer Tommy Fleetwood .	-5.5371
If the Americans lost four points at the start of the 12 individual games and got a hot start , Mickelson ’ s match could be absolutely crucial .	-5.5885
Furyk expressed his confidence in his man ; what left him other .	-4.4787
" He fully understood the role he had today , gave me a Klamt on his back and put his arm around me and said that he would be ready tomorrow , " said Furyk .	-3.8976
“ He has great self-confidence .	-2.4348
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has done so much for these teams in the past , and this week .	-2.2817
I probably would not have thought he was playing two games .	-2.5254
I wanted more , but this is the way in which we had to get it done .	-5.6736
He wants to be out there , just like everyone else .	-1.9750
So far , Nick Faldo keeps the record of most of the matches played at the Ryder Cup , which will break Micon on Sunday .	-7.1411
This could mark the end of an Ryder Cup career that never really stuck to the heights of his personal record .	-4.6837
Mickelson played 18 times , 20 times lost and 7 times a tie .	-4.7800
" He is funny , he is sarcastic , funny , he loves to talk people , and he is a great guy he can have in the team room , " he explained .	-3.2783
I think the younger players had fun this week to compete with him , that was a nice look . ”	-6.4562
It offers much more than just the game . ”	-1.3969
The European captain , Thomas Bjorn , knows that a major lead will soon disappear .	-3.2432
Thomas Bjorn , the European captain , knows from experience that a great advance in the individual games of the last day can quickly become an uncomfortable spectacle .	-4.6771
The Dane debut was in Valderama in 1997 , where a team trained by Seve Ballesteros had a lead of five points towards the Americans , but only barely reached the finishing line and won 13 <unk> with an immense lead of 14 <unk> .	-6.5334
" One remembers that one was in Valderama ; we had a great lead in Brookline , where we lost .	-6.7403
The story will show me and all in this team that it is not over .	-2.9456
You will be absolutely bored tomorrow .	-1.8825
Get out and make the right things .	-2.5297
It is only by displaying the points on the table .	-4.0347
Our goal is to win this Cup , and we focus on that .	-3.2576
I have always said that I firmly believe in the 12 players in our team , but we are dealing with a strong opponent , the best players in the world . ”	-2.7345
Again , Björn added : " I would never be over again .	-6.0143
Tomorrow is also a day .	-1.5213
Tomorrow personal performances are coming , and that is another thing .	-3.1220
It ’ s great to be out there with a partner when things are going well , but if you ’ re out there alone , your golf players will be tested on the whole .	-7.4650
This is the message you need to convey to the players : get the best out of it tomorrow .	-4.6416
Now you get over to your partner and you have to make full use of it . ”	-5.4447
In contrast to Björn , the opposing player Jim Furyk will seek to make his players better on one hand than they do as partners , with the exception of Jordan Spith and Justin Thomas , who took three out of four points .	-6.6515
Furyk himself experienced such a sensational turn in the final day , when he was part of the Brookline winning team , now he is one of the losers after the European team finished the “ miracle of Mediclose . ”	-6.3161
" I remember every worthy word , " he said how Ben Crenshaw , the captain of 1999 , had gathered his players on the way to the last day .	-4.8954
We have 12 important games tomorrow , but you want to start as soon as possible , as you saw in Brookline , in Medinear .	-5.0329
Once a dynamic of its own has evolved , it is exerting great pressure on the medium matches .	-6.8786
We have built up our layout accordingly and got the guys out as we felt , you know we are trying to create something special tomorrow . ”	-6.2972
Thomas , together with Paul Casey , Justin Rose , Jon Rahm , Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter , the other European on the top in the ranking , should lead the counterstrike against Rory McIlroy in the top game .	-5.6113
I set up this group of guys in this order because I think it covers the whole way , " said Bjorn about his individual selection .	-3.5371
Renewed postponement of the timetable for Germany ’ s new ship	-3.3381
The German Navy ’ s latest atrocity should have been put in service in 2014 to replace long-winded Cold War warships , with reports of faulty systems and escalating costs , but it will now take at least until next year .	-7.8040
The commissioning of the “ Rhineland Pfalz ” , the flagship of the brand new retail retail retail of Baden-Württemberg ’ s class , has now been postponed to the first half of 2019 , the newspaper “ Time ” referring to a military speaker .	-6.2353
The Navy should have started vessels in 2014 , but the ambitious project was burdened by serious problems following the first delivery .	-4.7042
The four ships in 2007 were replaced by the Marine sellers of the Baden-Württemberg Württemberg class .	-8.3771
It is assumed that they have a powerful cannon , a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles , as well as some steam technologies , such as reduced radar , infrared and acoustic signatures .	-5.6415
Another important advantage is longer service intervals : the latest frigates should be used for up to two years without running the home port .	-4.9596
However , the ultra-modern warships that Germany is supposed to allow for an overseas power projection will already be obsolete if they are finally put in service , as the weekly newspaper “ Time ” notes .	-7.0283
The ill-fated F125-Fregat made headlines last year , when the German navy officially refused to take the ship into operation and returned it to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg .	-4.8518
This was the first time that the Navy returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery .	-3.3553
Little was known about the reasons for the return of ships ; German media mentioned a series of critical “ software and hardware defects ” that would make the ship useless in combat missions .	-5.2657
Software defects were particularly important because the ships of the Baden-Württemberg Baden-Württemberg Baden-Württemberg class were operated by a crew of about 120 seafarers - only half of the crew were employed on the older spouses of the Bremen class .	-6.7993
It also turned out that the ship is overweight , limiting its performance and making future upgrades more difficult for the Navy .	-5.8868
It is assumed that the 7.0-tonne " Rhineland Palatinate " is twice as difficult as ships of the same class used by the Germans during World War II .	-3.4499
In addition to defective hardware , the price tag of the entire project - including crew training - is also discussed .	-4.5048
Instead of the original estimated EUR 2.2 billion , the cost now seems to have reached a staggering figure of EUR 3.1 billion ( around $ 3.6 billion ) .	-4.3025
The problems with the latest spouses are particularly important in the light of recent warnings that Germany ’ s sailor is slipping away .	-5.5771
Earlier this year , Hans-Peter Bartels , Chairman of the German Parliament ’ s Defence Committee , stated that the fleet of war actually “ runs out the ships that can be used . ”	-5.6644
The official said that the problem has grown smoothly over time , as old ships have been left out of service without there being any substitute for it .	-5.9697
He complained that none of the spouses of Baden-Württemberg were served by the navy .	-5.2926
The National Trust covers the secret life of bats .	-2.1889
New research on a farm in the Highlands of Scotland tries to find out how bats use the landscape for food search .	-4.1348
It is hoped that it will gain new insights into the behaviour of unique flying mammalian animals , which can provide guidance for future action to protect animals .	-6.5025
The study by scientists of the National Trust for Scotland will follow common and soprano pistols as well as brown longhorns and Daubenton bats in the Inverewe Gardens in West Ross .	-5.9328
Special reception equipment are placed at main points of the accommodation to watch bats throughout the season .	-4.4842
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys with handheld detectors .	-3.1562
An expert sound analysis of all the recordings determine the frequency of bat calls and assign the calls to the species .	-6.2900
The habitat map to be drawn and the report accompanying it should give a detailed overview of the behaviour .	-5.2466
Rob Dewar , National Trust for Scotland ( NTS ) , hopes to find out what areas of life are most important for the bats and how they are used by the species .	-3.9215
This information will help to identify the benefits of life space management , such as Wiesenbildung and how forests are best maintained for bats and other related species .	-5.3703
For the bats in Scotland and the whole of Britain , there has been a sharp decline in the last hundred years .	-5.0534
They are threatened by construction works that affect their sleeping places and the loss of habitat .	-2.8227
There is also a risk to wind farms and lighting , as well as fly loops and some chemical treatments of building materials .	-6.4596
bats are not blind .	-2.3271
When it comes to hunting at night , the ears are more useful than their eyes .	-4.9190
They use a sophisticated echo tracking technology to locate bugs and obstacles in their flight path .	-4.0377
The NTS , which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings , 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country , takes the bats very seriously .	-3.6661
There are ten trained experts who regularly conduct surveys , inspect sleeping places and sometimes also perform rescues .	-3.8767
The organization has even set up Scotland ’ s first and only dedicated battalion camp in the county of Greece in Dumfries and Galloway , where eight of the ten Scottish bats are based .	-6.1306
According to Manager David Thompson , the property is an ideal habitat for them :	-2.2456
“ Here in Threave we have a great area for bats . ”	-2.8972
“ We have the old buildings , many old trees and the whole good habitat .	-2.2279
But there are still a lot of unknown about bats and the work we do here and elsewhere helps us to understand better what they need to live . ”	-3.5850
He stresses that it is important to check in buildings before maintenance work whether bats are there , killing up to 400 female and , a local population may be .	-6.2811
bats are protected ; it is forbidden to kill , harass or interrupt them and destroy their sleeping places .	-3.5416
Elisabeth Ferrell , a Scottish member of the Bat Conservation Trust , has encouraged the public to help .	-1.6202
She said : “ We still have much to learn about our bats , and for many of our species we simply do not know how their populations are . ”	-2.7211
Ronaldo claims rape as a lawyer sue the German magazine .	-3.4532
Cristiano Ronaldo has had rape claims against him as " fake news " and claims that people " want to promote themselves " by using his name .	-3.1705
His lawyers will sue the German news magazine “ Der Spiegel ” , which published the allegations .	-2.1779
He was accused of having raped an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel hotel hotel in Las Vegas in 2009 . , , and .	-9.2286
He was supposed to pay her $ 375,000 to keep quiet about the incident , The Spiegel reported on Friday .	-4.9169
Hours after the allegations were reported , Ronaldo , 33 in an instant live video to his 142 million followers , reported the reports as “ fake news . ”	-4.0417
No , no , no , no .	-0.8701
What they say today , Fake News , ” said the five-time balloon D 'Or winner in the camera .	-2.5057
“ You want to apply for yourself by using my name .	-1.9892
“ That is normal .	-1.4245
They want to draw attention to themselves when they say my name , but it is part of the job .	-2.6875
I am a happy person , and everything is good , ” the player added smiling .	-2.7866
Ronaldo ’ s lawyers have filed a lawsuit against the magazine “ Der Spiegel ” for claims ; according to Reuters , you referred to “ an inadmissible reporting of suspicions in the area of privacy . ”	-5.2858
Norbert Christian Schertz said that the player will demand damages for “ immaterial damage in the amount of the severity of the violation , which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years . ”	-5.9063
In June 2009 , the alleged incident was reported in a suite of Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas .	-4.8971
According to records submitted to the District Court of Clark County in the U.S. state of Nevada , Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player ’ s room where he raped them in a nightclub .	-5.9025
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to the knees after the alleged incident , saying that he was “ 99 % ” a “ good guy ” left in the lurch by the “ one percent ” .	-4.8119
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex , but it was agreed .	-2.3399
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and made photos of her injuries in a hospital , but later agreed to an extra-judicial agreement because she had " fear of retribution " and worried about " being publicly humiliated " .	-5.4607
The 34-year-old says that she is now trying to declare the agreement invalid because it remains traumatized by the supposed incident .	-4.0792
Ronaldo was about to change to Real Madrid by Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack and this summer switched to the Italian giant Juve with a 100-million Euro deal .	-5.4045
Brexit : Britain would always regret losing automakers	-1.6576
“ The United Kingdom would regret it in life if it lost its position as the world ’ s leading car manufacturer after Brexit , ” said Minister of Economy Greg Clark .	-4.1288
He added that it was " worrying " that Toyota UK announced to the BBC that they would temporarily cease production at their plant in Burnaston , near Derby , if British businesses left the EU without a deal .	-4.4166
“ We need an agreement , ” said Clark .	-1.2714
Japan ’ s car manufacturer said that the impact of delays at borders in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs .	-4.8907
The plant in Burnaston , produced by the brands Auris and Avensis for Toyota , produced almost 150,000 cars last year , of which 90 % were exported to the rest of the European Union .	-3.1530
“ If Britain leaves the EU at the end of March without an agreement , I believe that our plant will end up with production stops , ” said Marlin Cooke , CEO of Toyota in Burnaston .	-4.7052
Other British car manufacturers have expressed concerns about leaving the EU without agreement on the modalities of cross-border trade , including Honda , BMW and Jaguar Land Rover .	-3.2564
For example , BMW has already announced that it will finish its work in Oxford after Brexit for a month .	-3.0045
The most important concerns relate to what car manufacturers are saying about the supply chain ’ s risks in the event of a “ no deal Brexit . ”	-4.1534
The production facilities of Toyota are based on needs-based manufacturing , that is , the parts are delivered every 37 minutes from UK and EU suppliers for special products .	-5.0183
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without an agreement , there may be delays on the border , which , according to industry specifications , may lead to supply shortages and partial shortages .	-4.3410
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day of the stock in his plant in Derbyshire , the company said , and so production would be stopped .	-3.7386
Mr Clark said , Theresa May ’ s Chequers plan for future relations with the EU was “ closely calibrated to avoid such border controls . ”	-3.0658
We need to have a deal , we want the best deal that not only allows us to succeed , we also want to seize this opportunity , ” he said to the BBC Radio 4 programme Today .	-6.9380
“ The reference not only to Toyota , but also to other manufacturers , is that we must be able to continue with what has become a very successful series of supply chains . ”	-4.2028
However , Toyota did not provide information on how long the production freeze might last , but warned that the increase in costs could , in the long term , suffer the competitiveness of the plant and eventually lose jobs .	-6.9817
Peter Tsouvalaris , trade union representative and for 24 years in Burnaston said that union members are increasingly concerned : “ My experience is that once they have been cut , jobs are lost forever . ”	-5.3561
One speaker said : ' We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU ' .	-3.7332
Trump ’ s rose-stone meeting could shift again , says the White House	-4.1442
Donald Trump ’ s high-class meeting with the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “ postponed another week , ” as the battle for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh continues , read the White House on Sunday .	-5.6248
Rosenstein oversaw the work of the Special Advisor Robert Mueller , who examined Russian interventions in the elections , connections between Trump and Russia , and the possible obstruction of the president ’ s judiciary .	-4.1832
Whether Trump will or will not fire the Deputy Prosecutor , and thus endanger Müller ’ s independence , Washington has sent a lot of gossip for months .	-4.6316
Earlier this month , the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed wearing a cable to record talks with Trump and make it possible to remove the president from the 25th Constitution addition .	-3.9128
Rosenstein rejected an opinion .	-1.3228
But last Monday he came to the White House , while there were reports that he was about to resign .	-3.3722
Instead , a meeting with Trump was announced for Thursday at the United Nations in New York .	-2.2844
Trump said he would prefer not to shoot Rosenstein , but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a clash with Senate Justice Committee hearing , in Kavanaugh and one of the women , Dr. Christine Blasey Ford , who accused him of sexual misbehavior .	-4.4661
On Friday , Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into claims against Kavanaugh and continued to delay a full Senate vote .	-4.5856
Donald Trump ’ s press spokesperson Sarah Sanders was on Fox News on Sunday .	-2.0518
When asked about the Rose Stone meeting , she said : ' A date for this has not yet been set , it could be this week , I could see that I went back another week , given all the other things that go before the Supreme Court .	-6.9021
But we will see , and I always keep the press informed . '	-3.2205
Some reporters would challenge this claim : Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September .	-2.0877
The guest Chris Wallace asked why .	-0.9819
Sanders said that the lack of briefings was not due to an aversion to television reporters , who were like self-directed , but she also said : ' I will not oppose being in the gallery ' .	-6.2472
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase .	-2.2881
" The President presents more questions and answers than any President before him , " she said and added , without giving evidence , " We have looked at these figures . "	-5.4368
briefing is still going to take place , Sanders said , but the press should have the opportunity to put the questions directly to the President of the United States , if that is infinitely better than to talk to her .	-5.0530
We are trying to do much of that and you have seen how we have done this in recent weeks , and it will replace a press debate if you can talk to the President of the United States itself . ”	-4.6071
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or takes part in public meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries .	-2.4128
Press conferences with one person are rare .	-1.6294
In New York , the president perhaps demonstrated this week why he made a free-running and sometimes bizarre appearance before assembled reporters .	-4.4301
Brexit ’ s Health Minister ’ s Letter to EU Workers in the NHS Scotland	-3.8178
The Secretary of Health has written EU staff in Scotland ’ s NHS to the country ’ s gratitude and the wish that they will remain after Brexit . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , etc .	-4.3027
The Scottish MEP Jane Freeman wrote her letter less than six months before Britain left the EU .	-3.0785
The Scottish Government has agreed to accept the costs of the agreed status appeals for EU citizens working in its decentralized public service .	-4.0639
In her letter , Mrs Freeman wrote : “ During the summer , negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on withdrawal continued , heading towards expected decisions in the autumn .	-4.5281
But the British Government has also intensified preparations for a possible no-deal scenario .	-2.7237
I know that this must be a very disturbing time for all of you .	-2.2466
That is why I wanted to repeat now how much I would appreciate the contribution of every employee , regardless of their nationality .	-4.1526

Foreign buyers will be charged a higher tax rate when buying real estate in Britain - the additional money will be used for the homeless , says Theresa May today .	-4.7326
This step is seen as an attempt to neutralise Jeremy Corbyn ’ s success , attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and to pursue high incomes .	-4.2813
The stamp fee is levied on people and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom , and the additional money will help the government to combat homelessness .	-4.7141

The club currently occupies the third place in the league and has three points behind the top .	-5.7022
He moved to the stadium of Light this summer , after returning St Mirren to the first Scottish league last season .	-4.1626

The former manager of Alloa Athletic says that he had no fear of participating in the footsteps of these established managers in such a big club .	-5.1671
" The success for me is currently defined by the question " Can I bring this association back to the Premier League ? "	-2.4447
With its structure and facilities , this club undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League , ” he said .	-2.5474
" To create it is not an easy task , but I would probably see myself as successful only if I can bring the club back there . "	-5.6887
Ross is only three years in his management career , after a time as co-coach at Dumbarton and a 15-month spell for Hearts ' Coaching Personal .	-2.8260
He then helped Alloa recover from the relegation to the third class , and arrested St. Mirren from the brink of relegation in the following season as master title .	-5.8946
Ross also says that during his career at Clyde , Hartlepool , Falkirk , St Mirren and Hamilton Academial he never felt as comfortable as now .	-4.6944

The summer heatwave increased revenue for Britain ’ s embattled pubs , but increased pressure on the restaurant chains .	-4.2167
Pub- and bar-groups received a sales plus of 2.7 percent in July - but the income in restaurants sankenm 4.8 percent , so the figures .	-6.4186
Peter Martin , the Corporate Consulting ( CGA ) , who compiled the figures , said : " sustained sunshine and England for longer than expected participation in the World Cup , meant that July followed a similar pattern as last month of June , when the Pub visits rose by 2.8 % , only the restaurants were more affected .	-8.0329
The fall in the catering sector by 1.8 % in June was exacerbated in July .	-3.8910
Most of the pubs and bars dominated by drinks , with Like-for-Like numbers rising more than the restaurants fell .	-5.3722

The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the greatest factors when it comes to selling in the off-house market .	-4.8542
It is not surprising that the restaurant groups continue to be under pressure , although a fall in sales of 4.8 percent over the previous year will be particularly painful , in addition to the ongoing cost pressure .	-7.7594

Milk pump advertising , in which mothers are compared to cows , led to controversial online discussions .	-3.7548
A dairy pump company has caused controversial online discussions due to an ad comparing nursing mothers with melk-cows .	-5.3284
On the occasion of the launch of the allegedly " world 's first silent and portable milk pump " , the consumer electronics company Elvie published an ironic advertising inspired by music videos to show which freedoms are offered by this new pump .	-5.7256
Four real mothers dance in a hayloft in the middle of cows to a number with the following lyrics : " Yes , I melt me , but you do not see a tail " and " If you have not noticed that it is not a Euter , it 's my breasts " .	-6.5440
The slogan goes on : " pump off , pump off , I feed babies , pump off , pump off , pump off , I melt my ladies . "	-4.1980
However , the advertisement published on the company 's Facebook page provided online for controversy .	-3.4404
With 77,000 calls and hundreds of comments the video has received mixed reactions from viewers , many of whom say that it highlights the " horror " of the dairy industry .	-4.1115
" It is a very bad decision to advertise this product with cows " .	-3.5689
As we must also become pregnant and give birth to produce milk , except that their babies are taken away within a few days after birth , " wrote a person .	-4.0852
The Elvie milk pump fits inconspicuously into a Still-H ( Elvie / Mother ) .	-3.5976
Another commented : " understandably traumatic for mother and baby .	-2.9133
But why should we not use them to promote a milk pump for mothers who can keep their babies ?	-3.1879
Someone else added : " That is an outsider 's statement . "	-4.6633
Others defended advertising , including a woman who confessed that she found the song “ original ” .	-4.3462
I think that is a great idea .	-1.2504
I would have got one if I had met yet .	-3.0948
I felt like a cow because of the pumps .	-4.5434
The ad is a bit crazy , but I took it as what it was .	-2.4990
This is a genital product , " wrote a person .	-2.3529
Another commented : " This is a funny advertising for mothers who pump off ( often at their jobs or toilets ) and feel like " cows " .	-3.4587
This is not an advertisement that praises or evaluates the milk industry ' .	-3.2481
At the end of the video , the group of women reveals that they have all danced in their BHs with the subtle pumps .	-4.3472
The concept of the campaign is based on the recognition that many women who pump milk say they feel like cows .	-2.7084
The Elvie Pump , however , is completely silent , has no wires or hoses and is fitted calmly into a Still-H , giving women the freedom to move , keep their babies and even go out at pumps .	-6.8707
Ana Balarin , partner and ECD commented to Mother : " The Elvie-Prize is such a revolutionary product that has earned a bold and provocative market launch .	-5.0769
By drawing a parallel between the expression of women and dairy cows , we wanted to focus on breast pumps and all its challenges while , in an entertaining and comparable manner , demonstrating the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring .	-4.3407

Hundreds of migrant children quietly went into a camp on the Texas border .	-2.8239
The number of children imprisoned with a migrant background increased , though monthly crossings remained relatively unchanged , partly because the Trump administration ’ s hard rhetoric and policies made it more difficult to find sponsors for children .	-4.8767
Traditionally , most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves , and fear that they risk being expelled when they are committed to a child .	-4.8738
The risk increased in June , when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their budgets would have to make fingerprints and that the data would be passed on to the immigration authorities .	-3.6392
Last week , Matthew Albence , a senior official within the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Authority , signed in front of Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to support unaccompanied minors .	-3.5013
The Agency later confirmed that 70 % of those arrested had no previous criminal records .	-2.1457
" Almost 80 % of people who are either sponsors or budget members of sponsors are illegal here in the country , and a large proportion of them are criminal aliens .	-3.3438
" We keep track of these people , " said Albence .	-3.5391
In an effort to speed up applications for children , officials introduced new rules that some of them require to appear in court within a month of their imprisonment , and not after 60 days of what was the previous standard , according to the people of accommodation .	-7.1508
Many will not appear personally , but via a video telephone conference to call for legal status at an immigration agent .	-5.4469
Those who do not qualify for discharge are quickly deported .	-3.1882
The longer children remain imprisoned , the more likely it is that they are scared or depressed , which can lead to violent outbreaks or attempted escape .	-4.3545
Advocates said that these concerns are raised in a larger institution like Tornillo , where signs of fighting a child are more likely to be overlooked due to their size .	-5.0385
They added that the move of children into the city of tent without having enough time to prepare them emotionally or adopt themselves by friends could worsen a trauma that many are already struggling with .	-5.0534
Syria calls on US , French , and Turkish “ occupying forces ” to withdraw immediately .	-1.8780
Foreign Minister Walid al-Mouvery also called on Syrian refugees to return home before the UN General Assembly , even though the war in the country has been going on for eight years .	-4.1150
Moule , who is also Deputy Prime Minister , said that , under the pretext of combating terrorism , foreign forces are illegally on Syrian soil , and “ they will deal with it accordingly . ”	-6.1347
“ You must withdraw unconditionally immediately , ” he said to the Assembly .	-2.6776
Moulant claimed that the “ war on terror is almost over in Syria . ” More than 360,000 people have died in the country since 2011 , and millions more have been driven out of their homes .	-5.6841
He said that Damascus will continue to fight “ this holy battle until we have freed all Syrian territories ” from both terrorist groups and “ any illegal foreign presence forces . ”	-3.0979
The US has roughly 2,000 soldiers in Syria ; they are mainly training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad .	-5.8285
France employs more than 1,000 floor soldiers in the war-torn country .	-3.1569
On the question of refugees , Mouth said that the conditions for return were in order , and he accused “ some Western countries of irrational fears ” that caused refugees to stay away .	-5.6306
“ We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate their return , ” says Moulvery .	-4.3246
“ They politicize a strictly humanitarian question . ”	-2.6913
The US and the European Union drew attention to the fact that reconstruction aid for Syria could only be provided if a political agreement between Assad and the opposition were reached at an end to the war .	-5.3206
UN diplomats said that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib could advance political talks .	-4.9429
The Russian-Turkish deal prevented a large-scale attack by Russia ’ s supported Syrian troops on the province where three million people live .	-4.3193
But Moulé emphasized that the deal is “ clear time limits . ” He hopes that the military operation will be directed against jihadists , including fighters from the Nusra Front associated with Al Qaeda , who will “ disappear . . , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-8.6376

Now Maurice sued the couple for compensation for the dismissal , demanding compensation of $ 350 per day for the six-month full-time employment for which she had originally been suspended , albeit without a contract .	-6.7382

She said that her father , who had previously worked as a BBC cameraman , was inspired to write a children ’ s book by a small toy bear , would have remained optimistic if his work had been rejected , and she added that the 60th anniversary of the book publication after his death last year was “ bittersü<unk> ” .	-5.6388

FBI missions have begun , and Brett Kavanath ’ s future is at stake .	-3.7294
“ I thought that if we could actually get something like what he asked for - an investigation that is time and scope limited - we could perhaps achieve a bit of unity , ” Mr Flake said on Saturday and added that he was afraid that the committee falls “ apart amidst a deeply rooted party political deadlock . ”	-7.7075
Why did Mr Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to be established ?	-1.4202
Their restraint is simply due to the timing .	-1.5621

Pyongyang has not been made public .	-2.6469

Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953 .	-2.3727
Most are fleeing from China , which has the longest border with North Korea , which is easier to cross than the strictly guarded demilitarised zone between North and South Korea .	-3.5765
China sees outsiders as illegal migrants , not refugees , and often forcibly returns them .	-2.7822
Relations between the North and the South , which are formally still in war , have improved considerably in recent months .	-3.3427
Earlier this month , the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang on talks about the stalled nuclear disarmament negotiations .	-2.8548

The leader of the democratic minority group , Nancy Pelosi , called Brett Kavanaugh , the candidate for a seat at the Supreme Court “ hysterisch ” , and said that he was unable to serve the Supreme Court in temper .	-5.4820
Pelosi made the comments at an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival at Austin , Texas .	-2.8891
“ I could not think other than that if a woman had ever behave like this , they would have called it “ hysterical ” , Pelosi said about her response to Kavanath ’ s statement before the Senate ’ s verdict on Thursday .	-6.1324
Kavanaugh disproved the claims that he had attacked Dr. sexually , Christine Blasey Ford , when they were both young people .	-4.1670
During his opening speech , Kavanaugh was very emotional , sometimes he shouted almost and fought with tears when he talked about his family and his high school years .	-2.9098
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in committee and called the accusations against him a “ bizarre and coordinated call murder campaign ” organised by liberals who are angry that Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election .	-4.6314
Pelosi said that she believed that Kavanath ’ s statement proved that he could not serve before the Supreme Court because he showed that he was prejudiced against democrats .	-5.2497
“ I believe that he himself disqualifying with such statements and the way in which he can be influenced by the Clinton and Democrats , ” she said .	-5.0825
When asked whether , in the event of his confirmation and a democratic majority in the House , she would seek an impeachment procedure against Kavanaugh , Pelosi hesitated .	-4.1839
“ I want to say the following : if he says the truth to neither Congress nor the FBI , he is not only unsuitable for the High Court service , but also for the service to the court at which he is currently engaged , ” Pelosi said .	-6.6420
Kavanaugh is currently a district judge in D.C. Appeal Court .	-3.8624
Pelosi added that she , as a democrat , was concerned about possible Kavanallowing sentences against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. , as he stands for conservative justice .	-5.3509
In his closing remarks , Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would overturn certain decisions of the Supreme Court .	-4.3320
“ It is not the time for a hysterical , prejudiced person to go to the court and expect us to say , “ Is this not wonderful , ” said Pelosi .	-5.1682
And women must support it .	-2.2384
It is a veritable heckling speech , months and years full of anger , and it cannot get rid of it without crying .	-3.9975
" We cry when we get angry , " Mrs Steinem said to me 45 years later .	-2.7332
" I do not think that this is unusual , or ? "	-1.9900
She continued : “ I once helped a woman , in the executive , who told me that she was crying when she was angry , but she developed a technique in which she always started to cry when she was angry and started to cry , to the person with whom she spoke said : “ You may think that I am sad because I am crying .	-7.4102
I am angry ' .	-1.9280
And then she just went on .	-3.4659
And I thought that was brilliant . ”	-1.4570
tears are allowed as valve for anger because they are basically misunderstood .	-2.7706
One of my strongest memories of an early job in an office dominated by men , in which I once weaned with indescribable anger , was that I am being wrapped up by an older woman , an intellectual manager before which I was always scared - who dragged me into a staircase .	-7.3425

In 1987 , he was known that Mr. Hart had an extramarital affair on board a boat called “ Monkey Business ” , but he was out of the race .	-5.4151
“ It was not a well-conceived decision , ” she told me with a laughter of 30 years later .	-3.4494
" There were already seven other candidates in the race , and the last thing they needed was another .	-2.0557
Someone called it " Snow White and the seven Dwarves " .	-2.2390
Because the campaign was already underway for a long time , it was delayed by raising funds , and so she swore that she would not participate in the race unless she collected $ 2 million .	-5.8859
It was a lost battle .	-1.6452
She noted that some of her supporters who gave $ 1,000 to men would give her just $ 250 .	-2.9018
“ Think that , I get forward lorberries ? ” she was wonderful .	-5.0047
When she delivered her speech and announced that she would not launch a formal campaign , she was so overwhelmed by emotions - gratitude for the people who had supported her , frustration over the system that made it so difficult to collect money and raise voters rather than delegate , and anger about sexism - that she was stifled .	-4.8693

How the trade war between China and the US might be beneficial to Beijing	-3.2202
The opening salves of the US-China trade war have been deafening , and an end to the conflict is not in sight . A divide between the two countries can be beneficial in Beijing , experts say .	-5.1957
US President Donald Trump launched the first warning early this year by taxing important Chinese exports , such as solar panels , steel , and aluminum .	-3.3434
The introduction of new tariffs on imported Chinese products worth $ 200 billion ( GBP 150 billion ) this week has led to a dramatic escalation of the situation .	-2.6046
Beijing has revanched itself every time in the form of material benefits , and most recently , tariffs of five to ten percent on US goods worth $ 60 billion .	-6.5178
China answers every blow from the US with a response , and it is unlikely that the world ’ s second-largest economy will fall in the near future .	-4.4399
Putting Washington in charge means yielding to the demands that it publicly bow to the United States would be far too embarrassing for Xi Jinping , the president of China .	-6.2108
But if Beijing uses its opportunities correctly , the trade war with the US can have a positive long-term impact on China by reducing the mutual dependencies of the two economies , say experts .	-5.0875
“ The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create the conditions for economic turbulence in one of the two countries is much more dangerous than observers had previously assumed , ” said Abigail Grace , a scientific collaborator at the Center for New American Security , a think tank focusing on Asia .	-4.4559
