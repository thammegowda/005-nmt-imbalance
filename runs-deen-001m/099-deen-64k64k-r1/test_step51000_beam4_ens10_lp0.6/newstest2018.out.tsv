Munich in 1856 : Four maps that change your view of the city	-4.7630
An immersive conversation with young people .	-4.3954
A Gruftkapelle , which is now being dug for the S-Bahn tunnel .	-6.3085
Smallgärtner manages the former farmers ’ cause .	-3.3327
The oldest official card of Munich encourages exciting stories to days .	-2.3886
It is annoying if maps are not up to date .	-2.4330
This is known to everyone who had to get straight because the auto-Navi set a green meadow instead of a bypass .	-6.2653
The historical maps of the digital Bayern-Atlas , an offer of the geo-portal than Bavaria of the state government , are anything but topical - but this is precisely why they are very revealing .	-6.8495
Especially if you compare it with current online cards .	-3.0662
Then it becomes clear how cities and communities in the area of the Munich Merkur area have changed since the 19th century .	-4.6713
The digital Bayern-Atlas is a patchwork that you don 't see as such .	-5.1082
The main beneficiaries of the survey were incorporated for cities and municipalities of more detailed maps , so-called ' initial positions ' .	-8.3656
This was born between 1810 and 1864 , according to the Bavarian surveying administration , and was the first surveying of Bavaria .	-6.4390
Your principal : Napoleon .	-1.6205
The French army leader occupied Bavaria with Austria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War .	-3.3053
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned the topographical inclusion of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .	-4.7382
Even though the French troops finally abandoned with the peace of Lunéville , 9 February 1801 , they were today 's neighbours who created the idea of a comprehensive Bayern-card .	-5.6728
Max IV , who supported the project further , founded the " Topographical Bureau " - and thus the Bavarian survey management .	-7.6877
The position sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and can be found on the web site of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek .	-5.0210
The comparison in the past / Today is the most impressive example of the state capital .	-4.5072
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .	-3.5233
An example of this is underspending , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856 .	-4.2278
Sendling was admitted 21 years after the creation of the card , in 1877 , as the Munich district .	-4.4397
Today , Untersendling is located in the middle of the city .	-3.5018
The houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along the current Plinganserstra<unk>e , which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878 , a leader of the Bavarian peasant rebellion against Austria in 1705 .	-6.0065
Where the West Park is today , you can see nothing as a field - at first glance : a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears in zoom in a smaller map : hand-numbered pieces from the so-called " Urhönung " from which the base tax was derived .	-9.2054
Small plots no longer occupy farmers there - but small horts of the " Land in Sun " plant .	-4.7297
A large green area is situated north of Lower Saxony .	-8.3896
The Theresienwiese , since 1810 setting of the Oktoberfest , was in fact still a meadow - not a concrete rage in the 19th century .	-3.9217
On the other hand , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine .	-2.1892
In the position sheet the road names " am Gasteig " or " Auf den Lüzen " are not only published in the area of the current district of Au-Haidhausen .	-8.5471
Yes , here on the Auerfeldt road people were once locked up with madness .	-4.4218
The Munich Kreis-Irnantal ( Munich ) was founded there in 1858 / 59 .	-5.3377
From 1872 Dr. Bernhard von Gudenen directed the institution - the psychiatrist who was brought to the death of King Ludwig II .	-5.4314
" He was progressive for his time , and concluded , for example , the purchases of the so-called Irn .	-5.1668
In addition , he has forbidden the staff to use violence against the occupants , " says Hermann Wilhelm , head of Museum Haidhausen , who has worked for an exhibition with the institution .	-6.1817
There was first room for 280 patients , and later it was extended to 500 seats .	-4.8059
At some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the County Without Valley in hair 1905 .	-6.5268
Since 2006 , the Isar Ampel-Kliniker München-Ost , one of Germany ’ s largest Psychiatriums , is located there .	-5.5473
At the site of the former Auer Institution , young people in the Munich Salesianum meet .	-5.9119
The order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth home with training companies .	-3.4231
West is the football pitch of TSV München Ost , east residential houses from the 1980s .	-4.2942
The children 's house " Casa Don Bosco " was built in 2015 , with an architectural reference to the origin of the mystery that was destroyed during the Second World War in bomb attacks .	-5.9348
The Marienplatz square was listed as " main square " in 1856 , the " Kaufinger Gasse " was named .	-5.6712
A decisive change brought World War II also in the heart of Munich .	-3.4641
The Allied bombs in December 1944 put plenty of holes in the city centre .	-3.2283
A great remained until today - at the Marienhof .	-3.7941
The English Institute , small business buildings and a Middle Ages Gruftkapelle once stood at the Marienhof , where the preparatory work took place these days and on 5 April 2017 the Spatenticks for the second S-Bahn ( city rail ) station .	-9.2573
With the slider you can compare the old Munich Card with the aerial image of today - and fill up the hole at the Marienhof .	-4.3744
Citizens ' Rights Group publishes travel warning for Missouri	-2.5737
The National Association for the Promotion of Colorful has issued a warning for coloured people travelling to Missouri due to discriminatory policies and the racist attacks of the state .	-4.2608
" The NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri , which is due to enter into force by 28 August 2017 , calls on African-American passengers , visitors , and Missouri to pay particular attention to travel by the state and exercise extreme caution , as a number of dubious , racially-based incidents have recently occurred and are recorded throughout the state , " says the Group 's opinion .	-7.9360
A recently adopted law by Missouri , which makes it more difficult for people to gain discrimination claims , as well as the law enforcement authorities of the state that disproportionately targets minorities , led the group to issue travel warning , said NAACP .	-6.5599
" You have violations of civil rights that happen to people .	-2.9054
They are stopped because of their colour , they are beaten or killed , " said the president of the Missouri NAACP , Rod Chapel , the Kansas City Star .	-3.0829
" We hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not yet heard . "	-2.8955
It is the first such warning that the organization issued for a state in the US .	-3.1242
The group quoted incidents such as racist offense against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .	-2.8303
Sanders died in dubious circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no petrol and was taken into custody by the Missouri police without being accused of a crime during his trip .	-5.8067
The Council also draws attention to a recent report by the office of the Chief Prosecutor of Missouri , which shows that black drivers in the state are encouraged 75 % more frequently than white .	-5.7616
" The recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and employees about what might happen in Missouri , " said Chapel .	-3.3497
" People must be prepared to bring in cash or let the relatives know that they travel through the state . "	-4.6312
In 2015 , Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes , according to the latest figures from the FBI ’ s hate criminal program , which classify the state as the country ’ s 16th rank in relation to the number of such violations .	-6.3183
Travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination .	-2.6947
Before that , the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states passed immigration laws requiring local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for violations of immigration , which the ACLU believes will contribute to further racial profiling .	-5.6042
Travel warnings are usually issued by the foreign ministry to other countries , but recently , interest groups have used the measure in response to specific laws and trends within the US .	-4.2666
Secular Projekt	-5.5151
The Fischbacher Weinassauna project is a success project and will continue next year .	-4.4582
The CDU-Federal Councillor Peter Wei<unk> and Kordula Kovac have had an image on site .	-6.6484
At the rights court of the Schwendemann family , representatives of the Fischbacher CDU placeassociation met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two Members .	-5.6914
Markus Schwendemann initially provided insights into his company , which manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , supplies 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and houses holiday guests in five apartments .	-4.9424
For him the " black forest milk " is the alternative marketing route for the milk of his cows , so Schwendemann .	-4.5978
The guests ' table is exclusively regional .	-4.3623
Since he is also the chairman of the BLHV in Fischbach , he called the Weidische project " fundamentally important " .	-6.8714
I cannot be profitable on such steep areas .	-1.9564
The area of the green area for a lot of work , much needs to be dealt with by the motor sense .	-7.4784
" We have to fight here with the conditions and the topography , " emphasized Schwendemann .	-4.3665
In 2003 he took over his parental farm and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if he did not run a biosafety .	-5.4348
For mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear that " The Commune has recognized the importance of the project Wei<unk> and is glad about the leading organisation " .	-7.6347
At the cost of EUR 3 000 to EUR 4 000 per hectare , farmers would have to be supported .	-4.1678
It is hoped that this will allow the land to be sown for a while .	-5.3841
" The greatest treasure we have are the people who work in agriculture and are concerned about how to bring their business forward , " the mayor stressed .	-5.5528
Farmers are often criticised for promoting it .	-3.2259
In 2013 , a total of 25 plots of 11 participants were fence through the promotion of wicker .	-6.0388
The area of openness is thus 40 hectares , which must not be forest up to at least 2023 .	-4.3760
Of the total cost of EUR 71 500 , half were supported by a Leader , and a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fischbach .	-5.4258
Farmers therefore remained EUR 12 610 , which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of silent activity .	-5.6673
" The great advantage is longevity of fences , " explained Schwendemann .	-2.5420
Kordula Kovac stressed : " You do a good job without farmers and rural women don 't do it " .	-4.9622
Peter Wei<unk> also stated : " Best food is produced here " .	-4.0042
The Environment Care Directive ( LPR ) Baden-Wuerttemberg allows state support for willow acid .	-4.9133
The aim is to keep the black forest open .	-2.3028
The precondition is the existence of a support framework defined by the LPR .	-5.4792
Moreover , the containment area must not be a drag on ( the slope is more than 35 % ) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation .	-6.5105
The Fischer bacher Weisauna project in 2018 is currently running the request of eight participants with 24 plots , who want to build under 16 km of fence .	-6.8917
The area of transparency is 35 hectares and costs are more than EUR 112 000 .	-3.6542
Is nothing more sacred ?	-0.9883
Now , Trump ’ s White House is adopting the Statue of Liberty . :	-4.3331
The surest sign of regime change is when they begin to attack statues .	-4.8636
Americans value this as much as any other - hence the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein on the Bay of Baghdad in 2003 .	-4.8626
Stephen Miller , one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime , surely knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN about the president ’ s proposals for drastic curtailment of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty .	-4.4973
To remain fair , Miller did not attack the statue itself .	-2.2801
A Horde of boat owners and Liberty-Imitors would have triumphed if he had done so .	-4.2889
But he took on their significance , and in particular the importance that was attributed to her when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to his base .	-5.9272
As Miller Acosta commented : " I don 't want to go into a whole thing about history here , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that the world is enlightened .	-5.1292
The poem you refer to , which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . "	-3.1372
Miller is factually correct , but as he himself put it , it is not really about history .	-3.3670
It is about the contemporary resonance of the eloquent words of Lazarus , the only one in which a state not only invites any old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : " Your dead , your poor , / your afflicted masses who yearn to breathe freely , / the miserable waste of your rich coasts . "	-6.7054
There was never a time when the " wretched waste " was better seen on our screens .	-3.4736
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome to Trump ’ s US .	-3.4878
This conflict about the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural conflict : it is indeed a conflict about America ’ s importance .	-3.7959
Lazarus - and their friends who sought to put their words on the ground after their death - knew very well that they had a highly political act .	-5.1415
The sculpture should show the connections between French and American Republicanism by representing female embodiment of freedom in a playful classical image .	-5.4201
Lazarus changed this meaning : In her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she got a voice .	-2.7944
And she gives herself a very different name : mother of exile .	-3.4731
The combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism .	-2.7533
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , the people of the right wing wanted to change it for a long time .	-3.2283
The great clamour Rush Limmath , a kind of John the Baptist for coming from Trump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is not an agreeable one , but rather an early neo-conservative that puts the American flame into the afterworld : " Lady Liberty is moving forward .	-6.1896
It is supposed to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .	-1.6644
The torch should not have paved the way to the United States . '	-3.1275
It is quite unusual that this was something that happened in Limburg .	-8.2132
The significance of the statue is absolutely a question of the position of perception .	-3.0320
The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see it as seen by the exhausted , miserable but hopeful people after long and often terrible trips on the decks of ships .	-4.3632
It is really about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and improving their lives .	-4.0015
Her statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they must hear .	-2.9442
And that , of course , is not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to recognize .	-2.9908
Their torch is intended to ignite not the path , but the hatred that is its only source of power .	-3.3619
World Championship 2017 : Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team	-2.9901
Eilat Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots were part of the team of Britain .	-3.6937
The performance director of the United Kingdom ’ s track record , Neil Black , says that the 16-member Scottish quota will make a massive contribution to the team at the World Cup .	-5.5194
A record number of Scottish athletes were selected for London in 2017 , starting on Friday .	-2.5790
Black believes that ' something special is developing in Scotland ' and the UK ' s track record must learn from it .	-4.3600
" We welcome it , and we try to understand it , and we will continue it until we find out , " said Black .	-2.6514
" I am talking to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think that it has something to do with what they have done .	-3.3800
Scottish athletes think that what they have done is something to do .	-3.0491
British athletics : It has something to do with what they have done .	-2.5080
And also with the type on the street corner .	-2.2237
Whatever the combination of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant ' .	-1.6352
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal players , including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 track , while Eilat Doyle was elected by the team to captain .	-6.1330
" Eilat is fairly modest .	-1.4881
Her captain 's speech was incredible , " says Black .	-2.5397
" A number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and very motivated .	-3.6161
The passion and real feeling that Eilat brought in quite naturally were great . "	-5.3916
The Commonwealth silver medal winner who will compete with the 400-metre hurdles at their fifth World Championships says that it is " incredible " that 16 Scots are in the British team .	-5.0169
Scotland ’ s best total number of athletes in the World Cup has been seven in 1983 and 2015 .	-3.5719
The Muir medium-haul runner is following this path and has established five British and two European records last year .	-4.7274
It will participate in the 1,500 m and 5000 m races .	-4.2285
Chris O 'Hare , who runs 1500 m , is another Scot to observe after a great season that included the victory of the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games .	-5.0274
Doyle remembers her first World Championships when the only other Scot was in Team Lee McConnell .	-3.9218
The team athlete says that she is " enormously proud " of the fact that many of her compatriots will not only be part of the team , but will sometimes also be involved in medals and finals .	-6.3661
" The special thing about being a team captain is that she was elected by the other members of the team , so it was a great honour anyway , but to know that my team colleagues voted for me and voted for me , makes it a very special thing for me , " she added .	-5.7541
" Obviously I am very proud of all the Scots who belong to the team .	-1.8373
It only shows how far we have come .	-1.5837
And they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to climb on Podien .	-2.7173
As regards my speech as a captain ?	-2.1979
Yes , I think she went well .	-1.3351
I have just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation because we have a home championship .	-4.5573
It is therefore really important to rely on this support and to benefit from our being back in the Olympic Stadium .	-4.9119
I get a second chance to go out and compete there and it will be just such a great atmosphere out there ' .	-3.6412
Block critics about Facebook : Don ’ t worry about public office if you can ’ t tolerate stoking voters .	-5.1351
Our country ’ s father knew something of a bad press .	-3.0248
Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long for newspapers to beat him for everything , from domestic politics to its political principles .	-3.3384
He was surely intrigued by criticism .	-3.4567
But he did not silence his critics .	-0.7695
For in 1783 , Washington said : ' Freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and silent , we , like sheep , are going to fight for battle ' . , , , , , and , , , , , , , ,	-5.9753
This brings me to Maryland , Governor Larry Hogan , who must work to be more like Washington .	-1.9923
Hogans staff blocked and deleted at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page .	-3.6048
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for that reason earlier this week .	-2.5917
The baton of the governor dismissed the complaint as frid , and the online commentary was full of a backlash with " Na , and ? " .	-3.3063
" It is just Facebook , " said many people .	-1.5929
But it is important .	-0.8500
And it is especially important if it is a type like Hogan .	-2.5688
This is a Republican governor in a overwhelmingly democratic state that is remarkably popular .	-2.0878
He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation .	-2.6514
Hogan is not a reactionary hothead .	-0.7911
He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles . , , and , , is , , , , , , , , , , , , and .	-5.0706
He was also very adept at using Facebook as a primary tool to connect with his constituents and play his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side .	-5.4257
That is why the blocking of people who come on the side of the governor - who is a public forum that is called officially and is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous by employees paid with public tax dollars .	-6.6166
In an interview with The Washington Post , Hogans spokesperson Amelia Chase defended the governor ’ s actions and argued that blocking comments is nothing more than a facilitator .	-5.3581
But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people who ride the stick online .	-4.7526
The post spoke to some of the real people blocked by Hogan .	-2.0041
And these are only real people who talk to their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur , and a priest , not trolls .	-3.5546
They all said that their comments were respectful , thoughtful and not profound .	-1.8195
The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith .	-2.6697
lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie , MP . , was not hateful , but she asked about hate crimes .	-2.9413
" I commented politely that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other current news , " she wrote in the comments section of The Post .	-3.5286
" I do not appreciate this idea when a number of people take a position on the same subject , then some people do not regard it as a so-called collective operation and do not recognise it as a large group of citizens affected " .	-7.3634
What the governor ’ s employees call a “ concentrated spam attack , ” others would probably call it “ welfare . ”	-6.2957
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or delete a negative comment .	-3.0246
It is much cleaner than in the past if we had done the same thing that staff were sent to collect and burn newspapers containing critical newspaper articles or to arrest and silence demonstrators .	-5.2143
But that is exactly what is happening digitally .	-2.2650
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for insulting Facebook and other social media .	-2.8426
President Trump is sued by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .	-4.9483
One of the first milestones on this issue fell last week in Virginia .	-2.0600
The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County violated the First Amendment , according to US magistrates James C. Cacheris in Alexandria , when they expelled a voter from their Facebook page .	-4.9507
And in Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin ( R ) also received a visit from the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter .	-3.3388
That should not be so difficult .	-1.8325
At the time of Washington , the time of affordable postage had a similar effect to the Internet .	-3.3913
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800 , and anonymous writers suggested his leadership .	-1.6063
And even then , Washington had anonymous trolls .	-1.2767
The people who used pseudonyms such as " Jury " , " Valerius " , " Belisarius " and " Portius " wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington decisions .	-5.8170
Petitions that criticized his position on the Amity Treaty , trade , and shipping with the United Kingdom were overwhelming , according to the historical documents collected by the George Washington Project 's online papers .	-4.4928
But he did not silence it .	-1.0652
Freedom of speech , difference of opinion and discourse belong to the basis of our nation .	-2.9200
And true leadership means accepting that .	-1.9425
Ronan Rafferty hopes home comfort in the Renaissance Club	-2.1509

Gary Orr , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50th birthday earlier this year , returns to the action on his home floor .	-3.6714
This event will be its first Scottish appearance since Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .	-1.1997
" It always means a bit more when you play at home , " said Orr , the man from Helensburgh .	-3.4077
" You want to make it good , but you also feel this extra pressure .	-2.5965
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .	-1.8896
I am glad about how things have gone . '	-3.4905

Less lung cancer killed by passive smoking	-4.6592
Over the past two decades , fewer and fewer people have died because of passive smoking of lung cancer .	-2.2677
Scientists at the University Hospital of Hamburg-Eppendorf ( UKE ) come to this end in a study .	-4.2295
" According to our estimates , 167 lung cancer cases are attributable to passive smoking per year , " says director Heiko Becher .	-3.5051
In comparison , he drew up his own study on the subject of 1994 .	-3.1835
At that time , there were 400 lung cancer cases in Germany due to passive smoking every year . , , and , , , , , , , , etc , and , , , and . , ,	-6.4499

Domestic connections prove to be very complex	-2.8512
The construction works in the Villingen Stra<unk>e are in full swing and " are somewhat in time " , according to the head of the Bauhaus Fred Heinze .	-6.4010
In the area of domestic connections , the situation is more complicated than expected , as there is a lot of talk going on underground , which is not recorded in plans .	-7.7544
The traffic , which keeps on obstructing construction works , is a major problem for the construction company Stumpp .	-6.4046

Security Minister Wiredu said in October 2016 that he should establish an extra-judicial mechanism for settling historical human rights violations .	-3.8180

" Most injuries occurred a long time ago .	-1.9173
Some were in 90-year-olds and early 2000-years .	-2.7828
The point is that we have committed ourselves to tackling these violations , but there are processes that have to be passed , " he said .	-3.8267
Then Wiredu withdrew when he spoke to TIME in Jakarta on 5 June and said that he had no plans to set up a complaints mechanism in Papua .	-3.5885
Instead , ' everything is regulated by law ' , he said .	-2.0301
Wiredu , accused the UN of ' crimes against humanity ' , which claimed more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor ’ s bloody independence response from 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been resolved , including the Paniai case .	-5.2085
Families of the Paniai victims resisted such claims with furious disbelief .	-3.5763

settled villagers protested in front of the company 's location office .	-4.8679
The police said that the villagers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warning shots .	-2.4295
But locals say that the mobile brigade ( Indonesian paramilitary police ) began to shoot and killed .	-2.4444
" We were so in panic , we fear that there will be revenge , " said Dominggu Badii , who was living near the hospital and witness how the injured was quickly hospitalised , according to the TIME .	-6.0597
" I hid myself two days in my house " .	-2.3245
The Deiyai Parliament has called on the officers to be held accountable and to withdraw the police ’ s mobile brigade .	-4.7494
Paniai has always been a disgrace to the Indonesian Government .	-3.5125
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the discontent of the tribal tribes of Mee , Moni , Dani and Damal , who live in the green highlands of Papua .	-5.2059
Many joined the Free Papua Movement , the rebel army claiming to defend the rights of Papua by encouraging sporadic attacks and kidnappings by Indonesian soldiers .	-4.0477
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai , including Taslimit Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya .	-3.6631
In response to this , thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and arbitrarily detained in recent years , on the pretext of ' safeguarding national sovereignty ' .	-3.3064
Some never appear again .	-1.5737
Among the people of Papua , Paniai is known as a " tragic , forgotten place " .	-3.2097
Poverty strengthens discontent .	-0.9641
The bit of rice sold in Enarati is too expensive for locals .	-3.5461
Bread is just as out of reach .	-2.6990
The people here are building everything they eat : first and foremost Nota and fruit and leaf vegetables .	-4.7336
Agriculture is the task of women who can each process four or five fields of sweet potato .	-3.6565
They keep the majority of the family harvest while the rest is sold on the local market .	-3.3282
Ten pieces of Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees ( 75 cents ) .	-1.7141
Over time , economic inequalities have grown between indigenous Papua and the new migrants , who have reached greater numbers since the opening of new routes to Nabire Airport .	-4.3614
The few jobs in the region typically go to better-educated and prosperous migrants .	-3.2715
Papua rarely has capital or the skills needed to make its own businesses competitive .	-3.3648
" The young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money " , says John Gobai , Chairman of the tribal council of Paniai .	-3.3475
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua .	-1.7531
Furthermore , restrictions on reporting by international media remain tense .	-2.6568
At the beginning of the year , French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported for lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua , although they were given rare permission to film . , and , , , , , , and ,	-5.0279
According to Phelps Kine , Deputy Asian Director of Human Rights Watch , Jokowis ’ s campaign to lift the restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development has not been realized .	-4.7477
" There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report on Indonesia 's most intransigent provinces of Papua and West Papua : visa refusal and a black list , " he said in a statement .	-4.0015
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely confined to the immediate neighbors of Papuas .	-3.4027
In March , six Pacific states - Tonga , Nauru , Palau , Tuvalu , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate the ' various and widespread infringements ' in Papua , including Paniai shooting .	-4.0447
The same countries have historically supported OPM .	-1.4697
The speaker of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Arrmantha Nasir , rebuked the accusations of the group and told journalists in Jakarta : " There is still a democratic system in Indonesia , and there are free media , so it is difficult to cover up the evidence of human rights incidents .

The local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .	-2.4053
When an official delegation from the Netherlands , led by the Human Rights Ambassador Kees Van Baar , Jayapura , visited Jayapura on 4 May , local residents broke their silence and urged him to ' We want freedom ' , in accordance with a source who also took part in the meeting but wants to remain anonymous .	-5.7669
Indonesia will have another presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua will probably not vote for Jokowi again .	-2.8238
" Jokowi is a man who has good intentions , but is surrounded by the people who are involved in Paniai shots , " said Gobai , the Chairman of the tribal council .	-4.8481
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people , apart from the constant threat of a predatory military , are living in poor educational and health services .	-3.2318
Gobai says that the Paniai people , like other Papua , consider their voice for Jokowi as a " fault " that it must repay .	-3.7359
" They do not need money , they just want justice , " he says .	-1.8853
Despite threats and intimidation , families of the Paniai firing resulted in a last symbolic act of Troy : the corpse of a victim was buried on a site exactly opposite the police and the military station .	-6.3379
They know that they may never have justice , but at least do not forget those responsible for their crimes .	-4.6783

Fire capture the “ Tory ” skyscrapers of Dubai for the second time .	-3.8726
A fire took place on Friday in one of the world ’ s highest residential towers in Dubai and forced hundreds of residents to flee from the 337 meter high 79-storey building .	-4.3033
It is the second fire that , in just two years ' time , feeds through the tower that was accidentally called the gate tower ( torch tower ) .	-5.9213
The building was evacuated , injuries were not reported and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .	-2.3957
" We slept and we stood up at the fire alarm and at the cries of people .	-4.5444
We walked down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor " , told a resident who named his name as George angab , Reuters .	-5.9484
Dubai 's civil protection authorities said that the fire-fighting units at 4 p.m. local time ( 0.00 am GMT ) deleted the fire and cooling the building .	-5.7744
The government said that it is working on providing accommodation for those affected .	-2.9643
The incident may raise questions about the safety of materials used in outside areas of high-rise buildings around the world .	-4.3794
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage came from the fairing , the outfitting to decoration or insulation .	-5.2401

We need a change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historical contests , " said Hagerty .	-3.2480

More than 1 out of 5 US passengers carry prohibited items on the plane , find a poll	-4.4740
A survey carried out by airline passengers revealed that more than 20 percent deliberately or unknowingly forbidden objects were confiscated from the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 % who entered the aircraft while they accidentally wore prohibited knives or other objects with blades .	-7.3330
Less than 1 % claimed that they had belatedly discovered that they had mistakenly traveled with guns , ammunition , or explosives .	-3.6496
The survey of more than 1,000 people - carried out by a jet charter service , Stratos Jet Charters Inc . - also noted that younger travellers tend to disregard the rules .	-4.9998
Of the respondents who admitted that they knowingly tried to fly with something that was banned by TSA , 19.7 % Millennials , compared to less than 15 % who were members of Generation X .	-4.7907
The most common items deliberately passing TSA agents were food and liquids .	-3.0156
More than 3 percent said that they had knowingly worn blades through safety control , while 2.2 % of female respondents and 3.7 % of male respondents also confirmed that they had deliberately brought prohibited drugs into the aircraft .	-6.3745
The company said that travellers throughout the country asked to find out how many accidental contraband goods had caused by airport security and how many would have deliberately done it .	-5.8800
It is no surprise that those who are the most vulnerable to contraband , whether knowingly or unknowingly , are the ones who fly most frequently .	-6.5447
However , the company points out that the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing .	-2.7093
People are often unsure what liquids they can take with them or how much of them .	-3.7624
So it is no surprise that the largest amount of the prohibited liquids confiscated by TSA is .	-4.7520
For a time , the people who TSA could see books as contraband .	-3.4118

Elon Musk doesn ’ t care : tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancelled Order	-4.0319
Elon Musk electrosomessa likes to announce the huge number of preliminary orders for his new Tesla Model 3 .	-5.2558
In so far , he has ruled that part of the customer has already withdrawn their non-binding reservation .	-5.5606
In addition to the ever triumphant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced another , less brilliant figure for the first time in the announcement of the recent quarterly balance sheet : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 .	-6.9078
In recent months , Musk has often advertised more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car , which is currently starting to be delivered .	-5.2403
Now Musk admits that 63,000 of them have already been withdrawn .	-4.2506
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations .	-2.8297
In case of cancellation , Teklan will pay the 1,000 euros ( in the US $ 1000 and in the United Kingdom <unk> 1000 ) " reservation deposit " completely .	-7.4908
Currently 455,000 such reservations have been made , muslim approved in a telephone conference with analysts .	-4.6165
However , the Tesla CEO does not believe that the cancellation of about twelve percent of all orders could become a problem .	-4.7201
His argument : the challenge of ambitious growth targets is not demand , but production .	-3.0757
Last year Teklan supplied 84,000 vehicles .	-2.2428
2018 will be - all models taken together - 500,000 ; 2020 will be a million .	-3.9702
The demand for this is obviously there .	-2.4122
According to Musk , there are currently 1800 reservations per day .	-2.3094
If you order a " Model 3 " today , you may expect delivery in the second half of 2018 at the earliest - if Tesla manages to drive its brand new production roads that have never been tested in practice without major interruptions of maximum capacity .	-7.2969
Many experts doubt that this is possible .	-1.3745
If , however , there are greater delays , the non-binding nature of the reservation may become a problem for Tesla .	-5.8994
After all , the company cannot prevent unhappy customers from escaping in droves .	-4.4455
EPA-CEO Pruitt withdraws from the Obama Era rules for reducing emissions .	-4.7563
One day after he was sued by 15 states , Scott Pruitt , the head of the Environmental Protection Agency , took his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules to reduce emissions of smog caused air pollution .	-4.1591
Pruitt presented the change when his agency turned out to be more reactive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administrations .	-4.7533
He did not mention the complaint that had been raised against his previous post in a federal court of occupation .	-4.2701
It is a deadline imposed on states on 1 October to meet the standards of 2015 on ground ozone .	-4.4163
Pruitt announced in June that he will delay compliance by a year to give his authority more time , study the plan , and avoid interfering in local decisions or impeding economic growth .	-3.7311
Pruitt , who was a reliable opponent of stricter environmental legislation long before he was appointed by President Donald Trump ’ s Prosecutor of Oklahoma .	-4.0669
Since his arrival in Washington , Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations that the chemical industry and fossil-fuel industry are resisting .	-3.0487
The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the latest legal setback for Pruitt ’ s regulatory rollback agenda .	-1.9443
Last month , a federal court in Washington decided that the EPO administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration that committed oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leakage .	-4.3103
In an opinion published on Wednesday evening , Pruitt proposed that its backtracking in ozone standards simply reinforce the EPA 's willingness to cooperate with states through the complex process of complying with new standards in time .	-6.0457
" Among previous administrations , the EPO has often failed to meet the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be indicted by activist groups and others , and in an agreement set the date for implementation , " said Pruitt , who sued the EPO more than a dozen times in his previous job .	-6.1021
" We do not believe in judicial regulation and we take deadlines seriously .	-3.0979
We also take seriously the law and the authority that exists . '	-2.3766
Nevertheless , the opinion of the EPO said that Pruitt will at some point use its ' power for delay and all other legally available powers ' to ensure that the rules are ' based on a solid policy and the best available information ' .	-5.1694
Congressional Republicans are pushing for a more comprehensive recast of the ozone rules .	-3.3711
A bill approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .	-2.0569
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate .	-1.6197
The New York Attorney General Eric Cuterman , who led the coalition of states that had sued the EPA this week , said that the group intended to maintain legal pressure .	-4.3221
" The reversal of the EPO - according to our complaints - is an important benefit for health and safety from these 6.7 million New Yorkern and the more than 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog which is flooding into their communities , " said Schneerman .	-6.4782
New York joined California , Connecticut , Delaware , Illinois , Iowa , Maine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Pennsylvania , Rhode Island , Vermont , and Washington , and the District of Columbia .	-2.0993
Soil ozone occurs when pollutants from cars , power stations , oil refineries , chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight .	-2.8646
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems for sensitive groups of people and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year .	-2.5773
Public health officials and environmentalists cheered about Pruitt ’ s surprising change of course .	-3.9924
" It is disturbing how much pressure it takes to take this sensible step from the person responsible for protecting the air we breathe , " said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity .	-3.9080
" We must continue to fight against the Trump administration ’ s ideological crusade to turn to polluters and their particular interests . "	-3.3731

The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village made the friends and patrons of Tumlingen their concern .	-5.2075
Walter Martini stresses : " It is a unique village gem " .	-2.2274
In 1267 St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in the Württischen UrCustombuch : Count Hermann von Sulz sold " the mountain with the adjoining parish church to Tumlingen and the Vogei " at Magister Eberhard of Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver .	-5.9460
The text of the document on the Tumlingen Berg , apart from the former parish church , also belonged to a stately farm , which belonged to the church or the right of patronage , and not the other way round .	-6.8624
So people lived there too .	-2.9721
As indicated in the description of the Upper Office of Freuddensstadt of 1858 , next to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf , which are now visible in the image of Tumlingen , the " mountain " of the third , the stately settlement nucleus of the village .	-6.8161
Old maps from the time around 1600 underpin this historical situation .	-3.3894

There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower .	-2.4425
The greater the two zerbarst on Christmas 1673 .	-3.7590
The new bells were then lifted for the first time in 1692 , but later in World War II in 1942 .	-5.1708
In the 30-year war ( 1616 to 1648 ) the window windows were taken and the bells were stolen .	-4.6285
The roof was quiet .	-2.7327
In 1796 French troops stationed near the church .	-2.2694
They broke out the chanels and church chairs and used them as firewood .	-1.9480
The remains of the church threatened to topple 1809 .	-3.1749
Until 1869 , the Tumlingen Hilarius-cemetery also served as the last resting place for the dead from horns .	-4.9590
In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Hilarian Church ceased .	-3.6924
Only the church tower could be standing .	-3.6664
In 1834 , a storm split the church tower and half crashed .	-3.3651
To prevent an accident , the tower was abandoned .	-3.1160

Association wants to have the approval of wind bikes checked .	-5.0613
" Boisheim fend off " sees no legal condition for construction and has therefore approached the LandCouncil .	-4.9616
The club " Boisheim fend off " asked Landrat Andreas Coenen ( CDU ) to withdraw his authorization for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boehheim region .	-6.4359
It should be unlawful .	-2.6919
The club argues that at the time of its approval on 30 December 2016 , no wind turbines could have been approved in the Boeishheim region , since at the time in Viersen there was only a wind turbines zone at the borders of Schwalmtal .	-6.2903
Within this concentration zone , the building and operation of wind power plants is basically possible , but at the same time the concentration zone also prevents wind power use from being used for the rest of the city .	-5.9691
These zones are meant to prevent a " sealing " of the landscape .	-4.3169
Although the city of Viersen had decided a second wind concentration zone in the Boeishheim town a few days earlier by changing the irrigation plan - the district government of Düsseldorf had not approved it because of a form error .	-7.9261
" Due to the lack of planning legal condition , the granting of approval is still illegal and therefore also withdrawn , " said Christoph Erens , chairman of " Boisheim himself " .	-6.3794
Current state of affairs : before the summer break , the town council decided again to establish the wind concentration zone in the Boeisheim ’ s town ; approval by the district government is pending .	-8.6395
Comment : " This makes it legally impossible to grant permission for the construction of wind turbine planning installations " .	-6.6398
The circle confirms the entrance of the invitation .	-1.8972
" The corresponding letters have been received at the Viersen Circle since last week , " said a speaker .	-5.0097
It is taking the floor to look again at the matter .	-4.3759
However , they are not expected to bring the process to a halt .	-4.3446
With a view to ongoing procedures at the administrative court , the county did not want to comment on the content of the arguments of the association " Boisheim ward himself " on Thursday .	-7.1310
NEW Re , a subsidiary of NEW , is planning to build four 200 metres high wind wheels on an area at the Boeisheim ’ s town .	-8.9407
As early as last year , the company in which the city of Viersen is directly involved , had already concluded lease earnings with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares estate .	-6.3695
With the creation of four wind turbines , the electricity demand of around 11 400 households is expected to be met - roughly one fifth of the electricity demand of all four new households .	-6.0738
NEW Re wants to invest around EUR 20 million .	-1.8887
Last summer , Viersen City Council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind power plants at the Linnick wind farm in Aachen , as well as to participate in a wind power plant in the Usubach Pallenberg district of Heinsberg .	-5.8719

Trump relied on leaked transcription of telephone calls to Mexico , under pressure from the settlement of the border wall .	-4.8155
The Washington Post published the transcription of telephone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia .	-3.0259
On January 27 , Trump , in a phone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto , called to stop publicly saying that he would not pay for a planned border wall .	-3.4088
The US President has condemned him because he publicly denounced the wall , and he said to him : ' You cannot say that to the press . '	-6.1772
Trump began his presidential campaign by promising to build a wall at the southern border of the US , and swore to let Mexico pay for the project .	-3.5765
In the aftermath of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull , he also published and issued a tense exchange .	-4.0758
Mr. Trump said Mr. Turnbull that trade for the US would take on refugees fleeing to Australia , " ridiculous " , " mies " and " stupid " , and that the existence of the trade that the Obama administration gave him would look like a " depp " after he proposed a ban on the resettlement of refugees to the US .	-7.6139

Moores Ford-Massages : activists are returning to racist Lynchat as a call for justice .	-4.5288
A 1948-er Ford Mercury traveled through a group of viewers in rural Monroe , Georgia , and corrupted the Ford Bridge of Moore .	-3.5227
Before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver to reach the bridge , a group of white men emerged with guns to block his path .	-3.3545
The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man in a needle-strike suit - took a long train on his cigars and looked looked at by the windshield .	-5.2785
The occupants were constantly gasping in fear .	-4.4979
" We want this n ---- r Roger ! " brylte the man .	-3.0639
" Get him out of the car ! "	-1.8726
Busy the silence when a young black man was pulled apart from the front-passenger seat .	-3.9990
Fortunately , this terrible scene , which was played on July 22 , is just a sequel .	-3.7283
But when a noose is thrown around the neck of " Roger " , almost all in the audience met very real sigh .	-5.1942
Since 2005 , civil rights activists have returned to Moore 's Ford Bridge to look up the night , in which two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by Ku Klux Klan in 1946 .	-4.7105
No one has ever been charged with the killings .	-2.0980
" It is truly incredible that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our communities , although we know who they are , " said Tyroni Brooks , who helps organize the post .	-5.4710
" It is a filthiness on a history , but it is a burden on our souls . "	-2.9596
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Congressman of the State of Georgia and a life long civil rights activist .	-4.4573
For him , the juxtaposition serves as a dramatic call for action and is an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected .	-4.5979
" We want prosecution , we want ending , we want to cure , we want reconciliation , but first we need justice , " he said .	-3.6950
" We cannot heal and achieve reconciliation until we receive justice . "	-2.7196
A medical practitioner puts a blanket on the body one of the victims of the Moore-Ford-Lynchene on July 27 , 1946 .	-4.8320
According to the NBC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the Lynchprocess .	-4.1918
But no one has ever been indicted .	-2.1083
Although suspects have been at liberty for decades , civil rights campaigners say that the dual motivation for the Lynch-actions throughout the city has always been known : politics and sex .	-5.9713
In April 1946 , a Supreme Court ruling allowed the black citizens in Georgia to vote for the first time in the summer election campaign .	-3.9216
At roughly the same time as the election , according to the FBI , Roger Malcom ’ s black farm owned a white property , Barnett Hester , stood down during a battle , supposedly for a woman .	-6.8064
Brooks said that the rumor was in the city that Hester had slept with Malcoms Dorothy and that the baby she bore was not born from her husband .	-4.4199
On July 25 , 1946 , Loy Harrison , a prominent white landowner , paid $ 600 to bail out Malcom , the FBI .	-3.1963
He was accompanied by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey to prison .	-2.4269
But when they moved away from prison and the Moore 's Ford Bridge approached , a Lynchmob surrounded the car .	-4.6251
" As it turns out , it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murders " , this includes a FBI report .	-3.9764
" It is also obvious that there was a plot between state and local prosecution , which was not only involved in the murders , drew up evidence and robbed the identity of witnesses " .	-5.4903
As a result , much of his life was lost .	-9.5470
" It was an election rights massacre , " he said .	-2.3549
" They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : " If you register and when you vote , you will do so here . "	-4.1207
For almost a decade , Cassandra Greene has led the annual relocation of Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murders .	-4.1782
Her presentation is impressive , exciting , and rooted in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe that he no longer exists in America .	-6.2595
It is difficult to look and even more difficult to look away , but Greenspan said that this is the point .	-3.8047
" We do not want to talk about the hen , because we are then confronted with their rudeness in all of us , " she said .	-5.0337
" But I cannot build a relationship with you if you do not want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have gone through " .	-3.3732
The samples for this year 's production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - pushed into a room and listened to when Greenspan started a well recorded overview of the piece .	-5.9522
Wade Marbaugh is Greenes Co-director here .	-2.2988
He has been playing the role of the chief member for years , but he said that the role will never be easier .	-3.3701
" I feel dirty because I am not so , " said Marbaugh .	-1.5270
" But I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return to these times . "	-2.8037
On the other side of the room , the actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona , who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester , tried their lines .	-3.5217
The piece begins with Malcom , the Hester touching and bleeding him , angry that he has slept with his wife .	-5.5477
" I said , n --- he , disappearing of my property ! "	-4.4711
Rascona replied the fire .	-2.9522
There is a break .	-1.5012
And then everyone ( at least all the black actors ) breaks out in laughter .	-3.3938
Greene laughs the loudest .	-1.5105
" What ? , " asked Rascona .	-2.2384
It is alarming and confused .	-1.2074
Was I too harsh ?	-1.6950
" No " , says Greene , still kissing .	-2.3260
" I simply do not think that white people were then ' n --- he ' said . , , and , , , and , , , , and . , , and , , and , , , ,	-7.1284
" But " one of the other black actors quipped .	-3.6956
" You just have to hit the hard ' R. ' .	-1.9988
And that is where energy moves in the room , a feeling of comradeship replaces the discomfort .	-4.2502
Everyone is concerned to get this right , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four people killed .	-3.4699
The scene starts again .	-1.1637
This time , when Rascona says the N word , he says it strongly and forcefully .	-4.3621
Absolutely no one laughs .	-1.2859
This repetition ends violent and rapid .	-2.4163
There are cries , shots and then silence .	-1.2282
A woman dressed with a dress of mourning is about the bodies of the actor and performs a Billie Holidays praising " Strange Fruit " .	-7.6085
Their voice breaks with every second word .	-1.8935
About a hundred meters behind it a group of about four dozen viewers reads sweat and tears out of the eyes .	-4.6135
The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white .	-2.5736
A couple came from Ithaca , New York to see the performance , many just come down the street .	-3.3325
They lived in the moisture of Georgias for almost eight hours , when Brooks led her on a pilgrimage to the Malcoms and Dorseys tombs .	-8.3637
Up to this point , the murders have remained an anecdotes , but now , when you stand on the same country where the Lynch-murders took place , the air feels ghost .	-5.7668
When the last notes of the song end , Greene invites you to come closer and inspect the corpse .	-4.2534
Children howling at their heads , register fake blood and the quiet body and whisper to each other .	-4.4667
" They are not really dead , " a young boy pops up as if he wanted to remember .	-3.4011
After a few minutes , Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it is over .	-3.7009
The actors cast the napkin away and wipe out their tears .	-3.8462
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh , the man in the suit that played the clan member .	-2.6145
Nick Rasona hugs two of his companions and then breaks down in their arms , the emotional burden of performance finally breaks with him .	-4.6358
" It is okay " , whispering one of the women .	-1.8592
" We know that this is not in your heart .	-1.7080
You did so for one reason ' .	-2.1064
Later , the audience joined the actors for dinner .	-3.7796
At a table , a white pair from Atlanta sang about the relation with a black pair she just met .	-5.3277
Denise Dulinski fought to find words that have left a feeling of performance .	-3.5445
" It is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... from people who look like you and do that because they look like you , " she said .	-3.7465
" What this really does with me makes me believe that the hen is still continuing , " she added , " today is called the only police union . "	-7.3769
In the same room , Tyroni Brooks Hof keeps on his table , eating and recalling civil rights .	-4.2753
He said he had already started to plan the performance next year .	-2.9814
" Reposition is in a way inspiring , because it describes the horror of what we have endured , but it is also a moment of learning , " he said .	-4.6371
" It is like we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again .	-3.4932
Those who do not study their own history , who do not know their own history , are condemned to repeat it . '	-3.8365
" The Mother of God " celebrated the Wagerians in Bayreuth .	-4.7976
In the fourth part of Richard Wagner ’ s monumental work , director Frank Castorf is also setting off a colourful frivolous production of gigantic , six-storied scenery .	-7.0505
The platform ( designed by Aleksandar Denic ) can display a shoddy street corner with Wall and Dönerbude in Berlin , a " plastic and elaste " logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange .	-6.3042
Before that , there will be an open Mercedes classic car , where the Rheinkillers pose as Rockergirls , or alternatively an Isetta .	-5.5499
The oilless barrels remind us of Castorfs 's theme - money , power and greed - which is inspired by his " ring " staging .	-5.2799
The three Rhine killers - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel , Wietaine Lehkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize as well as in the " gold Rhine " .	-4.8697

It is celebrated by artists such as Foster , Milling , Vinke and Janowski , who are modest and whose hands are .	-7.7737
There is great applause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time , given the great heat back in casual clothes .	-6.3054
The appearance of Frank Castorf and his team was awaited with excitement .	-3.5245
In 2013 , if he had to go through a hushed pipe concert , there were five years later great celebrations , in which the isolated " bush " took place .	-8.4164
The festival director Katharina Wagner should have been pleased about this .	-4.4606
" It is noticeable that the audience has grown together with the " Ring " in a way , " she had told shortly before the performance of the dpa .	-5.5933
The audience did not only make a form of peace with Castororf , but it was also an understanding of the view .	-5.2497
I prefer a positive balance .	-2.6230

CEPOL 's decision to delay the smog rule following complaints	-2.9924
The US Environmental Protection Agency has taken a decision to delay the Obama administration ’ s regulation that obliges states to contain smog-generating emissions , one day after 15 countries sued the Agency for its move .	-6.9598
On Wednesday , CEPOL announced the decision to promote the so-called ' ozone regulations for 2015 ' , and said that it will show the Agency 's commitment to cooperate with states .	-5.1634
" We believe in dialogue with and in responding to our state partners , " said EPA-CEO Scott Pruitt in a statement .	-3.1546
In June , Pruitt announced the intention of the EPA to measure ozone regulations - in which some of the country 's emissions of pollutants are to be measured in order to determine where cuts must be made to meet stricter air quality standards - to delay one year until October 2018 .	-6.2532
A group of 15 largely democratic states , along with the Colombia district , filed a lawsuit on Tuesday and said that the effort is illegal .	-3.6979
President Donald Trump ’ s administration has tried to reduce a broad range of environmental requirements imposed by former President Barack Obama , as part of a broader agenda that Trump claims to boost economic growth .	-4.2862
The effort , however , has triggered the setback of the Democrats and nature conservation groups , which worry about the effects of greater emissions on public health .	-5.4183

Town council wants a Community area	-3.7681
In the end , the decision was clear : in the case of two votes , the local council decided to set up a Community area in future housing for the elderly .	-5.2790
Before the discussion , there is an important information : The purchase agreement for the missing property is signed , says Mayor Bernhard Tjaden .	-5.8002
Although it will still take time for the area of community ownership that belongs to the previous parish , there is now no obstacle to planning for the project from a private investor to stering .	-8.6468
There is a discussion on a Community area for that .	-3.1582
One of the two investors who are still on the boat has offered to meet the community .	-3.7633
On the ground floor it would provide a living area - around 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a surface area of 70 square meters for a special price .	-5.3903
The administration and the majority of the local council propose that such a Community area should not be provided as a meeting point only for the inhabitants of the seniary residential area , but openly into the community .	-7.4920
As an example , the word from the " Strickcafé " went round .	-3.9272
The decision made last autumn by the provision of funds for the current budget is also dented by means of funding .	-5.7634
The building is located in the recovery area .	-2.2075
The creation of a Community area , according to Tjaden , would be eligible for funding at 60 % .	-4.9165
The proposal for a resolution provides a signal to the investor that , in this respect , he does not want to throw a stick between his legs , stating that both the saddle and the surrounding area - as well as the Pultroof - would be able to reduce the amount of grapes and make the construction more economical .	-8.7566
No need , it is not only Wilfried Somer who thinks this addition is .	-4.9159
If ' s help : unanimity happens to the board .	-3.9084
It is not so easy to do with the Community area .	-3.7259
Daniela reputation refers to the many own buildings with which we do not really move forward , for which we are now opposed in the common space from the window , she says : ' I am doing myself hard with it ' .	-8.4725
Yvonne Staiger is very much in favour of the Community area , but totally opposed to local participation .	-5.2966
It sees this as a covert subsidy to already the benefit or even external investors .	-5.4845
This is not the case , because if you buy the area you do not give a grant , but rather get a real value value that can be marketed in the doubt , the counter-speech is .	-9.7678
Stavre 's request to split up the proposal for a resolution is supported by three .	-5.6955
So there are two opposing votes in the original programme , which Stefan Haller so summed up : ' If we take the decision in this way , we will be making a huge step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure ' .	-6.5211

Walk to Stern in the Harz	-2.1802
In the Harz the first " Star Trail " is to be established throughout Germany .	-4.8392
This is the planning of the association Sternenwaited Sankt Andreasberg .	-4.9684
There is a solar route in Göttingen since 2003 .	-4.7223
A " Star-Trail " responds to the need for information from many visitors to Harvard , it was said .	-5.2520
It combines nature , science , movement and sporting performance .	-2.5916
The members want to create panels along the planned route and inform them about stars and constellations .	-4.3172
In a first phase until 2018 , the Association is planning " installations that can be easily reached in five to six places " in Oberharz .	-5.9973
Take a look at St. Andreasberg , Braunlage , Hoheg<unk> and Sieber .	-5.2925
The information on the panels should be supplemented by Internet .	-3.4489
This is why a good mobile network access has a role to play in the selection process .	-4.4802
Free accessibility is also a criterion .	-2.7279
Later on the Startracks Zug will be extended by train .	-4.7937
" On the Starscape the viewer will learn a lot of interesting facts , for example about the physics of each star , " explained the association .	-6.1772
They also learned why stars would have different colors or why a star would have more light than another , even though it was far further away .	-5.3066
They also discuss the star in which a selected star is found and when it is best to see it .	-6.1644
The association has been operating the highest observatory in northern Germany since 2014 in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg .	-4.4374
According to the Federal Office for Nature Protection , the location in the middle of the Harz National Park is among the six darkest regions in Germany .	-4.5556
Often , the Milky Way , and even the Andromedus galaxy , are clearly visible from there . , , and .	-7.0492
Since 2003 , on the initiative of the PlanetSolar Foundation in Göttingen , there is something similar to the planned constellation of stars .	-6.3050
Starting in front of Gebhards Hotel in the Goetheallee , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planetary path leads up to the Hainberg mountain and the observatory - as well as a " outer " site in Diedramen ( community of equals ) with the planet Sedna .	-7.7581
The steles with the individual planets - including the orbit of the dwarf planet - are situated at the distance and scale of one to two billion .	-6.2953
The earth thus shrinks to a bullet of 6.5 millimetres in diameter , while the sun , which is 75 meters away , measures 70 centimetres .	-5.5308
The entire distance from the planet 's path is four kilometers long .	-4.1029

I would like to come down to light weight .	-2.4289
And he must move towards light weight [ 135 <unk> ] and then we fight .	-3.9622

Fortiunas Hoffmann : " Triple-chain works better "	-4.6568
Andre Hoffmann hopes after 2 : 2 for the season against Braunschweig that the optimisation of the resistance formation in Aue points .	-4.8899
Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the first season , with the result , would not have been the two opposite ones at the 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .	-5.7332
" The two opposite parties were too much , and we have to be more careful in Aue , " says the defensive player of Fortuna Düsseldorf .	-4.7139
In the Erzgebirge , the three chain will also be further optimized .	-4.8091
And a gate after a skirmish does not want to capture the Fortunes anymore .	-4.0165
" For the future it will be the case that no one , next to Michael ( Rensing ) , is taking the line . "	-5.6824
Hoffmann is convinced that even after the experience in preparing the three chain , his team gets better than with the four star chain .	-7.7333
" Still I do not know how we will act in Aue , " says his trainer Friedhelm Funkel , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , " because we have on the semi-positions in Kazan Ayhan and Niko Peelmann players that can build well " , said Hoffmann .	-6.8501
" It is necessary , but that we improve our performance and don 't make so many mistakes . "	-8.7588
Naturally , Hoffmann also moves to Aue to win the game .	-3.0372
" But whether you can speak of a failed start after a draw does not know .	-4.8828
The performance could be okay , " said Hoffmann .	-3.4533
" But if we can stand at four points on Sunday and concentrate on the trophy , we will certainly be able to speak of a proper seasonal arrangement . "	-6.4358
His trainer didn 't want to know about that .	-3.4134
" I judged the start to the season only after six to eight days of play , " said Friedhelm Funkel , who does not want to speak of an advantage over Aue , just because the game of Saxony had to be interrupted prematurely due to an unweather .	-6.7440
" Now they can start the season almost with a home game , " said Funkel and Hoffmann believe that players from Aue might even be a little better , because they don 't have a serious and complete game like Fortuna against a raised favorite in the bone .	-7.3431
" But they don 't know as 100 % where they stand today , " says the Home Defense of the Fortuna .	-4.2911
Although guests from the Rhineland will be able to go to the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Aue .	-7.1957
" That we turn them off just because we have the right to come under the first six is stupid , " says Funkel , whose balance is very positive in the event of a defeat against Aue from nine games .	-6.6847
" There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga that you have to beat from the start " , explains Fortuna headcoach .	-6.3410
'To make such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant ' .	-2.2769
And so , Funkel doesn 't want to experience his players on Sunday .	-4.4996
New results of Swedish asylum age testing published	-2.7476
The recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , which have been subjected to a new method of medical evaluation of their age , show that more than 80 % of those tested are older than 18 years , but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .	-4.7961
The Swedish Food and Drug Administration ( Rättsmedicinalverket ) started carrying out the tests last year .	-4.7008
They should make the assessment of age more accurate during the asylum process , after the Swedish migration agency ( migration abut ) was criticized for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were minors .	-6.7002
To date , migration metrics have sent 6.880 cases to test , and the Forbes Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2.481 tests from mid-March to July 31 , 2017 .	-5.8603
Eighty percent ( 2002 ) were assessed as 18 or older , while in another 25 cases , the Forbes Medicine Agency judged that the person was " possibly 18 years or older " .	-4.8233
In 432 cases , the conclusion was that the person is " possibly under 18 years old " .	-2.7360
The tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .	-3.1104
According to Johan Göransson of the Forrest Medicine Agency , the results have been constant over the past few months .	-3.9439
" We see no big difference in the statistics of the past few months , the numbers are fairly constant , " he said the Local magazine .	-4.1973
The high proportion of cases in which the person was judged over 18 does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has lied about his age .	-3.7854
In May , the agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases which " suggest that the person being examined is 18 years or older " .	-4.7398
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results , it found that in 243 of these cases , the person had openly said that it was going to be 18 years old this year .	-4.2506
The method of medical age assessment , in which X-ray images of wisdom teeth and MRTs are carried out by knee joints , which are then analysed by dentists and radiologists , has also been criticized in some areas .	-6.8226
One of the sceptics is Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute , whose work includes the assessment of the biological maturity of humans to see whether they went through puberty sooner or later .	-5.4444
" I had reason to think about it , and I do not believe that the type of measurement should be used .	-2.7476
To judge biological age this way is very uncertain .	-3.4855
If we cannot say it safely , we should not pretend we could , " he told the newspaper metro .	-4.2931
However , Göransson of the Forrest Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests : " In general , you can say that the risk of misjudging a child as an adult is low .	-5.5626
The greatest risk is when the person is under 18 , in this case it is about 10 % . '	-4.7578
Fully in the Plan	-1.5708
The works on the three bridges of the road 108 between Lauterbach and Schramerg are well on the way . , , , and , , , , , , , , , etc .	-7.6563
On Wednesday a seven tons of heavy concrete part was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach .	-2.8698
" We are very good in the time , it is running super " , says Reinhold Leichtig , director of the department of street and traffic at the government headquarters Freiburg .	-6.7230
In April the works began at the same time on all three bridges in need of restoration between Schramerg and Lauterbach .	-3.7434
The end of the project is scheduled for October and it is easy to ensure that the timetable is adhered to .	-4.6440
The first bridge , coming from Schramerg , leads over the Trombach .	-3.0735
It is a vaulted arch made of concrete that has a red sandstone covering 4,80 meters .	-6.0210

The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach has now received a 1,30 meter wide and seven tons of so-called bridal cap on the north side on Wednesday morning .	-5.8004
This is an attachment that is also used as an operating way .	-4.4627
On Friday , the southern part of the bridge will be used with a 2.20 meter wide bridge .	-5.1199
The pedestrian path is to be followed by this . , , and , and . , and , , and , , , and .	-7.4529
The particular thing is that these are finished parts , a patent of the Schrammer company Didzwo .	-3.8588
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge cover .	-2.1180
The discovery of lines through the structure in Lauterbach requires special sensitivity .	-5.9138
Because there is also a glass fiber cable to which many companies are connected .	-3.9938
The local people were informed of the project in advance of the work by hand papers .	-4.6551
In addition , fish and cancer were first identified .	-3.4040
For the bridges between the building building building building building and the building 's opening gate towards Schrammberg , the traffic is partly regulated by a traffic light .	-7.2443
For the construction work on the bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach the road is completely closed in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels " Tannenhof " and " Seven Linden " .	-5.2015
The cost of the three bridges is EUR 700 000 .	-2.2900
The whole thing is financed by the country .	-2.6824
AfD in Geroldstein : Bunter protest at German potato salad .	-1.2080
It is not so often the case that parties pull together together , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( AfD ) , what else is difficult to reconcile .	-5.0702
The CDU , SPD , Greens , FDP , FWG , the left , represented in the Kreistag Vulcaneifel belong to a broad alliance that shows a peaceful flag on that day , because the AfD invites the " big campaign " in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle Rondell .	-9.0118
And known names start - like Alice Weidel , who together with Alexander Gauland forms the top duo for the federal election on 24 September , and the deputy chairman Beatrix of Storch .	-5.7320
But those who are already hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the AfD artists , but to demonstrate .	-5.0072
The motto " The Eifel remains colorful " .	-1.7062
Originally , the City Funnick was planned under the motto " All on a table " at the Brunnenplatz , but now it takes place at the parking lot below the Rondells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the Stadthalle .	-7.4445
A colourful picture that offers itself .	-4.3820
And what Christa Kareli , chairman of the Forum A World and one of the leading organizers , is really pleased : " Toll , as many people have gathered here " .	-4.9278
There is music and a lot of food , including a " primordial potato salad that could also eat the AfD without any problems " , says the woman who brought it with him .	-5.0927
The police have requested a lot of officials to Gerolstein , and they are mainly present at the railway station , which is only a few metres away from the sites .	-7.6135
How did the AfD actually come to Gerolstein ?	-1.7666
Mario Hompes of the AfD Volcano Band reports that he has tried to make such an event and got the addition .	-6.9413
The 45 year-old from Gönnersdorf initially asked in Daun , but got a cancellation because there is not enough parking space because of the already built Laurentiuszki .	-8.2268
Now the Rondell , Hompes is pleased that " we can have such a nice event here " .	-2.9064
In view of the event at Rondellvorplatz he says : " This is the good right of people , main thing , it remains peaceful " .	-4.0345
This is also true : at 20 p.m. on the Rondellvorplatz a band for entertainment , a number of speakers in the city hall , including the Rhine pfälzische AfD chair Uwe Junge .	-8.1825
In the hall there are about 200 listeners waiting for the front-runner to speak for the federal election , Alice Weidel , and the deputy Federal President Beatrix of Storch .	-6.4926
What is clear is the police presence , but so far the officials have had a quiet evening .	-3.7668
The AfD event lasts a little more than an hour , the guests on the front desk have a longer breath , but there is also a scheduled stop after 21 pm .	-7.7479
The police can leave - no special events .	-3.0625

Despite his comments , the IAEA Congress voted to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report from the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia .	-3.2607
" I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , " said IAEA President Coe to the reporters .	-3.2395

Coe said that he was also ' pleased ' about Russia accepting the criteria for its reintroduction .	-3.0279
" I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been made , but Congress supports the recommendations of the task force that this is not the moment to reinstate Russia , " said Coe .	-3.3851
" We must do everything in the next few months to normalize this situation .	-3.0487
The guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate clean athletes from the tainted system , " he added .	-2.3393

That was what the House of Lords shared on Thursday .	-4.1774
Traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the Roskilde Cathedral Church .	-3.4164
The sculptor Bj<unk>rn N<unk>rgaard already produced a sarcophagus for the two .	-1.5542
The queen was in agreement with her husband 's decision , and the communication continued .	-4.1483
Where Prince Henrik is buried is still unclear .	-1.8957
But he does not intend to be included in his French homeland .	-3.3576
Prince Henrik had never made a secret of the fact that he was not happy with his title .	-2.4933
After his wife Margrethe grew up in 1972 , he would like to become king .	-4.2790
In 2016 , he retired , also setting off the title of " Prince William " .	-6.8720
Since Henrik did not get the title and function he wanted in Denmark , he does not regard himself as equal to his wife - even after death , Lene Balleby , the chief minister of the Danish royal house .	-6.2857
Where the last resting place of the 83-year will ultimately be unclear .	-3.1589
But he does not intend to be included in his French homeland , but in Denmark .	-3.7572
He likes the country for which he has worked for over the last 50 years . , , , , , , , , , ,	-2.5789
Margrethe was born in London in 1965 .	-3.8243

In a autobiography , Henrik said about the first years in Denmark : " Few months after my arrival everything I did was criticized .	-3.6507
My Danish was volatile , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk socks instead of knitting , Citro<unk>n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .	-3.3115
Even for the gauloises I used to smoke instead of Virgin tobacco and who had a reputation in this country to be the brand of social critical intellectuals , I could not hope for indulgence .	-5.3403

Prime Minister Weil ’ s Reelection	-3.5415
CDU and FDP versus potential majority in Lower Saxony	-2.1904
Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) , after the loss of the red-green majority in government , is in favour of a rapid re-election of the country , but he does not want to resign .	-6.4261
Because on Friday the resolution of Parliament was called for .	-3.8057
Previously , Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) ’ s government plunged a Green MEP from her country ’ s parliamentary group into a serious crisis .	-5.8667
Five months before the official election date , the red-green coalition in Hanover thus lost its narrow single-vote majority in Parliament to the CDU and FDP opposition .	-3.4215
The Green Members of Elke Tweest have established their step with the non-nomination for the election in 2018 in their constituency in Rotenburg ( Wümme ) .	-5.2944
" I see my political future in the CDU , " she declared on Friday in Hanover .	-2.3097
CDU-Group leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend his group to accept them .	-4.0792
The CDU and FDP would thus have 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Landtag , the SPD , and the Greens ’ 68 seats .	-3.4149
So far , the relationship has been reversed .	-2.0428
The new land day is regularly elected on 14 January next year .	-3.8642
Thümler said that the red-green national government must now decide whether it can govern without a majority in this situation .	-3.7153
However , Stephan Weil considers it essential that the land day decides its self-resolution as soon as possible .	-5.7691
The CDU Group is expected to decide on further action on Tuesday .	-2.7830
The state constitution also provides for the possibility that the land day deprives the Prime Minister of confidence and elects a successor .	-4.2725
" Our Constitution offers several options .	-1.7564
These possibilities must be checked legally , " said Thümler .	-2.4811
'You will calmly discuss all questions when they are legally considered ' .	-5.4171
Thümler called Tweest step " but something curious " .	-3.3298
The politician himself stressed : " I am not a traitor .	-1.7495
I feel very good ' .	-1.1361
She called herself a supporter of black and green .	-2.2447
The Greens called for the breakaway MEPs to return their country mandate .	-2.7444
" Of course , we assume that she returns with immediate effect her country mandate , which she received via the green list , " the president of the country , Meta Janss-Kucz , and Stefan Körner .	-8.9800
The Green Group Chairman Anja Piel said : ' We regret Elke Tweest 's decision extremely ' .	-4.4515
You have deliberately decided not to hold a debate in the group .	-3.0041
" Even against the background that there were no differences in content , we cannot understand this step . "	-4.6797
SPD Chancellor Martin Schulz condemns the passage of the Niedersachsen Green MEP , Elke Twergen , to the CDU as a betrayal .	-5.6330
" The behaviour of the former Green Members of Lower Saxony is not only a betrayal of the voters , but also a betrayal of the Red Green , " wrote the German Social Democrats ’ Chief on Facebook on Friday .	-5.8440
He supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) to allow the country day to be re-elected quickly .	-4.7506
Exit Tweest costs Red Green in Lower Saxony the majority .	-2.9503
" In her wounded vanity and in her frustration her personal interests before the welfare of the country " , the Secretary General of the Socialist Party , Hubertus Heil , criticized her . , , , and .	-7.3271
" It is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony is participating in this dirty intrigue and trying to capitalize on it " .	-4.6612
Lower Saxony ’ s leader , Björn Thümler , wants to recommend that Elke Tweest join the CDU .	-5.7363
The CEO of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Oppermann , accused Twente of falsifying the result of the 2013 election in a personal career .	-6.1377

Agriculture Minister in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from toxic eivers , Mr Schmidt ?	-3.7642
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs .	-0.8862
How could the scandal happen ?	-1.3736
How can consumers protect themselves .	-1.0311
Christian Agricultural Minister Schmidt ( CSU ) is in the interview with the editorial network Germany ( RND ) .	-4.2440
Mr Schmidt , how can the consumer protect himself from poisoned eggs ?	-2.0427
I can only encourage all consumers to take a close look at the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp pressure .	-4.0445
On the Consumer Protection portal www.Food Wartungs.de the federal states provide the latest information about the egg stocks concerned .	-6.8725
The affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .	-2.8950
Even if , in accordance with everything we know at present , health risks are practically excluded .	-3.8619
Does Aldi now take over the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the Enlightenment is not really perceived by the Minister of Agriculture ?	-6.4645
Food monitoring is the responsibility of the federal states .	-2.6260
Nevertheless , my house has opened up immediately and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since it became known that Germany is suffering .	-6.7058
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers .	-2.0720
Trade , like the manufacturers , must ensure that the products sold are marketable and safe for health .	-5.4199
If the residue limit of 0.0005mg / kg is exceeded for eggs , they are not transportable .	-5.0800
However , contaminated eggs can be sold and consumed .	-2.9288
This time it is not businesses that are to blame .	-3.2112
Is production and consumer sitting on the same boat ?	-2.3040
As we know , production is not directly to blame .	-3.5934
Instead , they must face economic damage due to alleged illegal practices by service companies .	-3.9361
As always , there are too few inspectors in the worst case .	-3.1044
Is it just a matter of personnel or competence ?	-3.6931
It was the official controls which revealed the situation .	-4.6624
The truth is , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 % ruled out .	-2.9255
It is precisely for this reason that a consistent investigation of such events and the transfer to the public prosecutor is crucial in cases where criminal offences can be found .	-6.2177
I have already made it clear on several occasions that I expect full information from the competent authorities .	-3.7210
Is regular alarm in food scandals really necessary ?	-2.7298
Consumers have the right to obtain only safe and transportable food .	-2.5551
If an insect not approved is used in the food industry , consumers are right to be outraged .	-4.3235
The prudent means means means that manufacturers , dealers and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely unnecessary .	-5.2624
In principle , it must be clear that the illegal use of insecticides Fipronil in the attitude of animals with no life , is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately .	-6.5287
Work on this must be carried out consistently and with high pressure at all levels .	-3.2634
I expect all the competent authorities to speed up and complete the matter .	-4.2129
The impact of football ’ s financial rules on whether to move to Paris	-4.1193
The rules aimed at preventing unrestricted expenditure from European football clubs will not disrupt the world record transfer from Spain ’ s Barcelona to the Paris-Germain district .	-6.1904
Some of the consequences will come from UEFA in Paris , Saint-Germain , because the leadership organisation that monitors the European game has the power to ban teams from entering the prestigious Least tournament .	-7.3455
Financial Fair lay rules , which were set up by UEFA in 2011 , mean that at some point PSG has to prove that the Nemar transfer was financed without much loss .	-6.0268
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( $ 262 million ) to buy Brazilian people out of its treaty , and Nemar is receiving a salary that will amount to $ 10 million a year .	-5.2941
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neyts move to France .	-2.4731
PSIG can certainly make the money loose to sign up Nemar and bring him into a galaxy of other stars , given the financing of the team by the high-energy sectarian family of Qatar .	-7.7901
Clubs may spend a lot of money on acquiring players , but they have to deal with legitimate revenue sources that allow them to take the Break Point in their business related to football .	-7.5611
FFP was designed by Michel Platini at his election as UEFA president in 2007 .	-2.7108
The former French player believed that clubs that had incurred enormous debts in their pursuit of success were effectively cheating and risked ruin when banks or owners withdrew their support .	-5.9767
In 2011 , FFP shifted from concentrating on the clubs ' debt to monitoring their losses .	-3.3444
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovivich used in Chelsea in 2003 – bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand – should become a more severe issue .	-4.4117
During the current three-year FFP pre-disposition period running until 2018 , clubs may suffer losses of EUR 30 million .	-3.3997
And , although platinum fell into disfavor by the presidency in 2015 , his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to campaign to deter excessive spending .	-5.3908
" Of course , FFP is not dead and we will certainly strengthen the rules for the future , " said Andrea Traverso , who is responsible for FFP in UEFA , to The Associated Press last week .	-5.8425
Although the PSD paid the Nemar buy-out clause in a lump sum , it may distribute the amount of the invoice for the duration of its contract .	-5.1844
Nemar has signed a five-year contract so that the transfer costs for the next five years can be estimated at EUR 44.4 million in the annual accounts .	-5.2170
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 , together with Abu Dhabi , owned by Manchester City , hit the most serious sanctions .	-3.4250
The PSG received a fine of € 60 million ( then $ 82 million ) , which was later reduced to € 20 million - and it was ordered that the team members for the 2014 / 15 season 's Champions League remain limited to 21 players instead of the normal 25 players .	-6.4505
UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to overwhelm their financial supervision by inflating their revenues by companies associated with the owners of a club .	-5.2818
While a catapulted company could sponsor PSN if the value of sponsorship exceeds the standard market rates , UEFA would not qualify this as a legitimate income .	-5.7369
That was what happened in 2014 , when UEFA decided that the value of sponsorship of the PSA was bloated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .	-3.0823
It has been reported that some of the PSG payments could come to Nemar on payments from the Organizing Committee of the World Cup 2022 in Qatar .	-4.5402
But SPG and Qatar 2022 denied that Neyts will become World Cup ambassadors and that such a maneuver could easily be found for UEFA regulators .	-5.7841
The current sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to every attempt to circumvent the rules .	-4.1548
UEFA did not have a preparatory discussion with PSG on Nehr 's transfer , told the people who are familiar with the situation on Thursday .	-5.8973
They spoke with The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation .	-3.6068
The latest reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 , with a turnover of EUR 542.4 million , has achieved a profit of more than EUR 10 million .	-5.2646
The accounts for the last fiscal year must be published .	-2.9889
SPG expects Neyts arrival to be a blessing for sponsorship deals , merchandising and shopping .	-6.6252
The association assumes that sales will increase by at least 30 percent after the signing .	-3.2337
The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players , and it tried to prevent Neyts move by claiming that PSD would violate the FFP .	-5.5878
" It is a clear case of " financial doping " with the club and the state " , said the President of the La League , Javier Tebas , the Spanish daily , AS with regard to Qatar 's ultimate ownership of PSIG .	-4.3318
Arsenal-Manager Arsene Wenger , whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon , shares the reservations of La League against a state that finances a club .	-3.4061
" It is the consequence of ownership and this has completely changed the whole landscape of football over the last 15 years , " said Wenger on Thursday .	-3.7325
" Once a country has an association , everything is possible .	-2.4221
It will be very difficult to respect financial fair play because there can be different ways or different interests when a country has such a major player to represent a country . '	-4.4276
Swiss is looking for a new Schoggilieferant	-3.8620
In recent years , Chocolat Frey has produced the chocolate for Swiss .	-4.4580
Now there is a possible end to the sweet cooperation : the airline redefines the order .	-4.8570
Swiss-Sprecherin Meike Fuhlrott confirmed on request from the News Agency sda an appropriate report from the newspaper " North-West Switzerland " of Friday .	-4.9953
According to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .	-2.3753
The products would be inspected every two to three years and subjected to quality control .	-3.2246
" With the current supplier Chocolat Frey we are very satisfied , " the speaker said .	-2.6491
About 17 million small colveted plaggates spread to 14 grams per year the cabin crews to the passengers before landing .	-7.3625
The Swiss did not want to provide information about the costs .	-3.0702
Industry insiders estimate the volume of orders according to the " North-West Switzerland " of 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Migro daughter generates annual sales of around 1 billion Swiss francs .	-6.3311
But what is more important is the advertising effect : it is a prestigious job for a Schoggieher maker .	-5.1750
The Swiss will not reveal how many applicants there are in the new tender .	-4.6000
But only Swiss manufacturers can come into question .	-3.1233
According to the newspaper report , Chocolat Frey wants to renew the Treaty beyond the spring of 2018 .	-3.7343
For the sda the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion .	-2.2928
Swiss chocolate bars have been distributing on board their flights since 2006 .	-2.4320
Before the Swiss signed a contract with the Migros daughter , Barry Callebaut had delivered chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hug .	-4.0667
The possibility of placing the logo led Swiss two and a half years ago to start working with Chocolat Frey .	-3.5797
The airline cooperates with various Swiss chocolate producers .	-2.3650
On long-haul flights , First Class customers are spoiled with treats from the fashionist Sprüngli , in Business Class naschen passengers Schoggi from Lindt and in Economy Class Schoggi by Chocolat Frey .	-6.2357

Nostalgia goes into the niche " Wet Hot American Summer " and " Comrade Detective " .	-2.6348
This repetition of history is nostalgic at the same time for the glorious days of characters of the 80 ’ s , for the 90-year Grunge-era ( when the voracious David Wain and Michael Showold went the sketch omödie ' The State ' for MTV ) , and for himself - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , such as Elizabeth Banks , Amy Poudler and Paul Rudd went to major things .	-7.5867
As a cultural artifact , it is also a parody and embodiment of our Facebook capable era of permanent memories .	-3.9572
But as a franchise it feels like time was short .	-2.7198
" First Day of Camp " worked surprisingly well , not only because of its absurd humor ( it contained an original story for a speech can vegetables that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .	-4.5902
By focusing on the core of the walk - actors of middle age play horny children who will grow up - they managed to win back the last part of the joke .	-7.6807
" Ten Years Lateer " , with his adults now playing adults , is less emotionally rooted and his motto is more watering , including a reef on the stalactites of the 90s like " The Hand That Rocks the Cradle " ( " The Hand that ) . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , etc .	-8.6048

The amiable Coop ( Mr. Showold ) , now novelist , has not forgotten Katie ( Marguerite Moreau ) .	-2.9136
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost his virginity .	-1.4373
And there is another crazy plot involving Ronald Reagan ( also Mr. Showold ) , which is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a successful impression of Michael Ian Black ) .	-4.3258
As always , the excursion is the best part of the franchise .	-2.0380
It ’ s especially fun to see Mr. Rudd , who is always young , who shows Matt Dillon ’ s Underlimbart of " Singles " , whose former Big Man on-Camp Andy feels like an old boy .	-9.3432
It is the moments of random madness that could fuel this franchise like a kind of repetitive " Seven Up ! " series until he reaches what I suppose to be his logical conclusion : " Wet Hot American Summer : Twentty Years Later " , whose last scene will show the band how to visit the film premiere of " Wet Hot American Summer " .	-5.1331
" Comrade Detective " on Amazon now recalls a different kind of nostalgia : the revival of the Cold War of " The Americans " , the film " Atomic Blonde " and even " GLOW " with its East-West battle iconography .	-3.9628
The comedy with Rhys Thomas as director , created by Brian Gates and Alessandro Tanaka , indicates that he is a TV series found : a Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two officers as friends , two officers from Bucharest who fight for truth , atheism , and the path of Marxism / Leninism .	-5.9963
The main roles are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Cornelius Ulici , whose dialogs are synchronized by Channing Tatum ( also an executive producer ) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English .	-5.3393
It is a brilliant idea .	-1.6052
But it is not much more than an idea .	-1.4886
There are some nice gags to credit ( the police spend time watching television shots , as Americans may do with football ) .	-5.2870
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate , Nick Offerman , MahersShambhala Ali and Chlo<unk> Sevigny - provides a decent game ' Find the Votes out ' .	-3.7520
But " Comrade Detective " is so committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a killer who has a Reagan-mask is involved - that it often plays like a single one .	-4.1157
In six long episodes , it moves , and the comedy is not fast or frequent .	-4.2910

The police have dealt a blow to the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg .	-3.0296
On Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest Chapel , in Rottweil , Konstanz , Esslingen and Stuttgart , as the Public Prosecutor Konstanz said on Friday .	-3.8544
15 authorities were arrested at the age of 25 to 77 and arrest arrest arrest warrants for them .	-4.3248
Moreover , officials ensured larger quantities of marijuana and cocaine , guns , and hundreds of thousands of euros .	-4.7903
Two people were arrested in the case of similar raids in Italy .	-3.2383
German arrest warrants were issued against the two suspects .	-1.8617
The two are therefore presumably extradited to Germany .	-3.0421
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action .	-2.5517
In total , more than 300 police officers were in operation .	-2.8014
The members of the mafia are accused of organised crime , of violence , of murder and of robbery and blackmail .	-5.9106
Since the summer of 2016 , the Public Prosecutor 's Office is investigating Konstanz against organised drug trafficking in southern Germany .	-3.8754
Between the public prosecutor held in Konstanz and Palermo there was a constant exchange and investigators from Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily .	-4.1798
So on Wednesday morning the big bet was accompanied by four officials from Palermo .	-4.5312
In particular , Italian citizens with close links to the Italian mafia were targeted at the investigations .	-5.7923
Also an incident on May 27 in Hüfingen , where in the morning several shots were fired in a restaurant , is likely to go to the account of the bonds .	-6.0353
It complains of large gaps in the immigrant register .	-4.8765
" Data of citizens who should not be present " : according to a report , the German Foreign Minister has severe shortcomings .	-7.4966
This amounts to some serious error in asylum procedures .	-4.0677
According to a media report , the envoy for the German Government 's refugee management has drawn attention to large gaps in the immigrant central register .	-4.4898
In the case of asylum procedures and expulsions ' , defects in the data registered there could lead to some serious errors ' , warned in an analysis submitted by the ' Süddeutsche Zeitung ' .	-7.4446
According to the register , ten million people with foreign nationality are covered , including some 5.7 million from non-EU countries .	-4.5202
The data is therefore managed by around 600 foreign authorities in Germany .	-3.3331
Because the data had not been properly maintained , the quality of the data has not been good in parts so far .	-5.0434
In individual cases , data of 1921 had been found , ' of people who have long since ceased to live or of citizens who have become German citizens and who should no longer appear in the register ' .	-5.9692
" Flawed data input can considerably slow return processes , " the report continues .	-4.6421
Moreover , statistics on people liable to travel abroad cover EU citizens who do not have to travel out .	-5.4905
However , such false associations " led to a distorted debate about the handling of foreigners , " so it is in analysis .	-7.3635
Meanwhile , the Federal Government appears to have begun sending refugee families with 16 year-old children back to Italy when they have arrived .	-4.3784
This emerges from an internal paper by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees ( BAMF ) , reports the " New Osnabrück Zeitung " .	-4.1003
The paper thus states that the BAMF is conducting such procedures ' with regard to families with children - with the exception of infants and micro-children - back to Italy since 1 June 2017 ' .	-6.0803
Since the end of 2014 , this has been practically impossible , as the newspaper pointed out , the difficult situation on the ground .	-4.5688
After the Dublin agreement , refugees from the EU state are responsible for reaching them first .	-3.9520
If a migrant continues to travel to another EU country , that state may return him to the country of entry .	-3.6667
For reasons , the office now reads : " Meanwhile , the reception capacity for families with underage children in Italy has increased significantly . "	-5.8835
Italy has provided guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families .	-2.3038
Even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECHR ) regards these commitments as sufficient .	-2.3249
Other EU countries would also send refugees back there under the Dublin Agreement .	-2.7625
The domestic speaker of the left-wing group in the Bundestag , Ulla Jelpke , criticised this decision : ' Families with children are threatened with conditions of human acceptance and a threat to children 's welfare because of the shortcomings in the Italian asylum system . '	-6.1463
The Best Second Results	-2.8328
In total , 220 litres of blood from people living in Oberreichenbach already provided blood donation to other people .	-4.7453
At least of the 12 citizens who were honoured on Friday .	-2.9314
Most of them were Jürgen Greule , who , with his 100 donations , now shared 50 litres of blood .	-6.1164
Traditionally , the parish attends the local council to pay tribute to the numerous willingness to donate blood .	-7.1135
" It is brilliant as our body is designed for this and we pay respect to the donors who make their blood available to strangers , for that reason unselfish " , Mayor Karlheinz Kistner emphasized .	-6.3055
" A single source of blood helps several people " , explained by the heads of the German Red Cross ( DRC ) , Holger Maitenbacher , for the Serbs are being divided into their components .	-6.7413
Three people could benefit from a blood donation .	-3.6117
At the same time Maienbacher reported about the actions taken in Oberreichenbach in spring .	-5.0732
" This year we achieved the second best result with 114 donors , " said the DRK Executive Director .	-4.1362
Obviously , the change to the theater house a few years ago led to higher attendance .	-3.8147
Thomas Bocktadt , Susanne Reichle , Sandra Schöck , Thomas Reichle , and Meta Umbeer were already among the multiple donors and awarded 50 blood donations .	-6.5931
Semi-so many Herbert Mair and Dorotheee Rixinger , while Tamara Pflrommer , Petra Schleeh , Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter ten times per 500 millilitres of their life juice .	-3.6896
The Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25 %	-0.8361
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged , as weak economic growth and weakening inflation have dampened speculation by an increase .	-4.1921
The Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain " sluggish " when it embedded interest rates on family incomes in the midst of increased pressure .	-4.1058
Bank policy makers ( MPC ) voted 6 to 2 to hold interest rates to 0.25 % , with fewer members growing this month , as weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase .	-4.5263
In its quarterly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth projections to 1.7 % for 2017 , and to 1.6 % for 2018 , warning that pressure on household incomes would continue , with inflation expected to rise to just 3 % in the autumn .	-3.9332
But they signaled that in the next few years , interest-rate hikes would be needed to rein in Brexit ’ s fueled inflation , and they said that borrowing costs might have to rise more than expected in financial markets .	-4.5593
Members also voted to withdraw part of the Mammut juni package , which was issued a year ago after Brexit .	-4.0986
It will call for time for the funding plan to provide cheaper funding for banks from February next , although it has been said that it is now expected to provide GBP 15 billion more within the framework of this system - at GBP 115 billion .	-6.2340
minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : " In the central forecast of the MPC , gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak in the short term , as the pressure on real incomes of households continues to put pressure on consumption . "	-6.8056
On interest rates , they repeated that ' a certain tightening of monetary policy ' would be needed to cool inflation and a ' somewhat larger ' scale than the markets expect .	-5.6502
The markets are currently forecasting the first rise in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .	-2.5706
However , the Bank stressed that increases would be " gradual " and " limited " .	-2.6812
The Bank ’ s revised growth forecasts for this and next year are compared to the 1.9 % forecast forecast in May and 1.7 % .	-3.9376
It has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .	-2.1689
The pound fell after these news against the dollar and the euro .	-2.9005
The pound fell by 0.5 % to $ 1.31 and fell by 0.4 % to $ 1.11 .	-2.6484
The decision not to change comes after the recent disappointing growth figures have dampened rising expectations of an increase in interest rates and GDP increased from 0.2 % in the second quarter to 0.3 % in the previous three months .	-5.2357
Growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will easily recover after the Bank ended the year .	-4.6071
The recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and minor wage increases , because the tightening becomes worse first , before it gets better .	-5.5268
She added that monetary policy cannot ' prevent ' the loss of income in the next few years , but she added that wages will recover significantly ' at the end of their three-year forecast .	-5.4760
The economy will also be strengthened by rising demand for British goods , owing to the weak pound , which will compensate for some of the lower consumer spending .	-3.7792
The decision comes one year after the reduction of interest rates to 0.25 % last August after the shocking EU vote , which caused the pound to fall .	-3.4773
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years to complete prices and the economy .	-2.8410
Before the Bank ’ s last judgment on interest rates , the call for an increase in interest rates had risen , as inflation increased pressure on heavily constrained households , with three policymakers demanding a rise to 0.5 % in July .	-6.0063
Last month , inflation fell from 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % , although the Bank said that was expected and that it would attract it back in the coming months .	-4.7064
The Bank said that the excess of 2 % relative to its target is " wholly " to the weak pound .	-4.8484
Andrew Montlake , director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers , said : " In view of the recent fall in the swap rate , the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again , because creditors are clamouring for business and want to end the year in a positive way .	-5.5422
The market looks particularly good for those in which the existing deals are going to expire and end the new mortgages , and many with duty-free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . '	-5.4367
NHS ( National Health Service ) is supposed to prescribe a controversial HIV drug of 10,000 people .	-3.1002
Patients will be given access to " transformative " HIV prevention treatment since September after a High Court fight against the funding of the drug in the NHS .	-5.1127
NHS England announced that a pre-sexual pre-exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 % , is now provided by the health service with an initial three-year study for 10,000 people .	-5.9134
He agreed to finance the process after the Court of Appeal confirmed last year 's Supreme Court ruling that the NHS had the power to pay for the EP despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it .	-4.9957
The action announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS Englischer boss Simon Stevens as ' important new intervention ' , while the National AIDS Trust ( NAT ) called this a ' decisive moment ' .	-4.5613
Sexual health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to allow people to register , and further clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 .	-4.0228
Preexposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .	-2.7089
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in cases of infection risk .	-2.6623
Taking PrEP before intercourse means that there are just enough drugs in a person 's body to prevent HIV infection .	-3.3181
Such medicines can be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse .	-3.2836
Those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men , transsexual and people with HIV-positive partners who have not been treated successfully .	-3.6833
In clinics , suitable participants are identified who agree with the study , including men , women , transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment .	-4.2830
People who live in England and are registered with a general doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local sexual clinic .	-4.3190
<unk> 10 million and NHS England signed a contract to deliver the medicines this week after international competitive procurement .	-4.2718
The study is intended to assess the full potential of PrEP by gathering clinical evidence , which is targeted , recorded and implemented on a large scale .	-4.4049
Stevens said : " This major new intervention should complement and surpass the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .	-3.3150
It is another milestone in more than three decades of ongoing progress in addressing one of humanity ’ s greatest health challenges . ”	-4.0896
Gold Deborah , Chief Executive at NAT ( National AIDS Trust ) , said : " This is a decisive moment in the fight against HIV .	-3.5790
PrEP , if targeted at needy and vulnerable people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic .	-4.1507
From September to September , people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to a negotiation with a partner , leading to an improvement of many lives .	-5.3014
We warmly welcome this announcement . '	-1.5295
Ian Green , chairman of the Terrence Higgins Trust , said : " The priority must now be to ensure that the study is carried out quickly across the country and that no one with a risk to HIV is left behind .	-4.9497
Now that the PrEP test medicine has been obtained , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 people infected with HIV . '	-4.7433
Sharon Hoogson , Shadow Health Minister , said : " The start of the EP process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and slow government implementation .	-4.5128
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection .	-2.9233
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP .	-1.9366
It is now important that this study be carried out as soon as possible throughout the country in order to protect people infected with HIV and that it will help to bring about a step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society ' .	-5.4031
Living great life : loft and clever designer tricks have transformed these little Earls Court apartment into a generous home .	-4.3379
Joanne Leigh , a former banker with a passion for real estate , fell from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earl 's Court apartment in 2014 .	-3.7903
It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne did not pack and sell her bags .	-3.3999
" Before I lived with my Ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room , " says Joanne .	-3.1791
" I was looking for something comparable to my price .	-1.8263
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings .	-2.5124
I fell in love with them and made an offer this day . '	-2.3461
Since the first visit the 1,000 square large apartment has been completely outdated .	-4.2358
Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add closet space and a mezzanine to make the most of the spacious ceiling .	-5.5384
" I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .	-1.9109
That was my request ' , she says .	-1.6184
To this end , they commissioned Erfan Azadi ’ s architectural and design studio Duck & Shed from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne .	-4.5956
The ceiling was not large enough to put two rooms on top of each other , so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand .	-4.3530
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the preset .	-1.6312
" The steel mill is rather complicated , " he explains .	-2.3334
" We had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked on top of each other without us having to bend .	-4.8732
It was not just a matter of building a simple platform , but of building steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function up or down . '	-5.4763
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two spaces on top of each other - with much more drama .	-3.4818
For the mezzanine , a classical copper light window of retrouvius goes down over the glamorous living area .	-5.6738
Locked gold furniture , silver accents and vintage nights Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program .	-3.4331
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .	-2.2741
A short corridor is mirrored at both ends to allow it to work longer .	-3.4400
In the kitchen the mirror feels like a window into another room .	-3.4654
At the entrance , mirrored units provide space for all the cutlery and glasses of Joanne .	-4.2721
Because of the perception of a more glamorous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .	-4.1258
There is nothing new about this .	-6.1387
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door .	-2.7805
" A bit of engineering art went into , " explains Erfan of the reinforced , furrified MDF door .	-3.1029
" It is counterweight so that when you push the door forward it will be very easy . "	-6.3954
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Joanne could gain an additional 16 m <unk> , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .	-3.6701
" At the end of the day you will sell the base area - or how your property is appreciated " , says Erfan .	-3.3366
" In a sedimentary form , a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the ground size " .	-4.7911
Here they have succeeded in increasing the floor space while at the same time using high-quality materials that give the space its luxurious advantage .	-6.0789
" The materials are the things you touch and that therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home , " says Erfan .	-3.6254
" You don 't fall in the electrical sockets in the walls .	-3.3239
These are important , but they do not play with your heart ' .	-2.3162
It shows that a flat can be transformed by good design and increased square meter numbers from a little standard to something quite amazing .	-5.7154
Indeed , like Joanne , you might decide not to leave them .	-2.7867
Brothers struggle for a $ 500 million real estate empire	-3.1743
Two brothers find themselves four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty , in a dispute over one of the largest real-estate empire , Vicorias worth more than $ 500 million .	-5.1309
Former director of the ' Carlton-Football-Club ' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak , just three doors away from his recent brother Paul , who brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets are to be shared .	-5.2251
Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp debate about separation is taking place in the Supreme Court .	-3.9392
Together with her mother Anna , the brothers have 38 real estate worth more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family bought a store in Smith Street , Collingwood .	-4.2056
There the Westco Jeans family founded and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores .	-2.6698
It was sold for USD 85 million in 1999 .	-0.9705
This money has been invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lutis now comprises offices in the city centre , the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller , as well as shopping centres in the suburbs .	-4.7243
After an agreement with her deceased father , Colin - described by Paul as the " main operator and the dominant person " in the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of his corporate wealth and Paul about a third .	-5.2372
One court act says that this means that Colin owns $ 316 million worth of property and Paul worth $ 176 million .	-4.1032
The distribution of real estate and cash has proven to be a problem for Paul .	-6.4608
" The circuits suggested by Colin have left him with what I thought was the best objects , " he wrote in a first Affidavit in 2015 .	-5.3840
Last Friday , following several failed mediation , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place .	-2.0001
The brothers are now also fighting for control over the existing business - of which Colin , as Paul claims , has ruled him out .	-4.5342
Colin argues that this is not true , but accuses Paul of managing some possessions incompetent .	-3.0618
In an early Affidavit submitted by Colin , he says he hopes to settle the dispute .	-3.4758
" My Italian legacy says that the family is the main priority , " he wrote .	-2.2741
The costs increase in the case , with hundreds of sides of Affidovis , e-mails and reports from companies , including Deloitte , Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer , and leading lawyers , including Allan Myers , QC , and law firms held by both sides .	-5.0112
Ms De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants , who operated milk bars and delicatessen delicacies from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970s .	-4.6458
They used the security to buy the Collingwood-moorings in which Colin opened the first jeans slats of the family .	-5.4933
Colin says that he began there when he was " in my last years of high school when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) . "	-3.4297
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass on their property with due respect to their sons .	-3.5039
" Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to go to court " , wrote them .	-2.8827
Two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lutis-Group , with Colin claiming that Mark was paying $ 10 million when leaving the company and Luke 26 million .	-3.8775
Both Luke and Mark , Paul says , " the conditions of their financial separation have become bitter " .	-3.9617
Colin took a very long lead , though he was a former AFL member of the board and , after a biography in 2015 by Eddie McGuire , he was the best friend of television stars .	-6.3319
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers .	-1.1557
Only Colin replied by SMS to say " I really cannot say much " because the case is before the courts .	-3.4497
" It is very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and to drag our family name through the courts , " he wrote .	-2.8765
In mid-2016 , Colin wrote to the court that he tried to meet his brother ’ s demands .	-2.3922
" Our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end in our current dispute , " he said and added that he " still hope for a solution " .	-3.1874
On Friday , that hope seemed to be over .	-2.2479
" Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future , " wrote Colin .	-2.1134
Trump ’ s new chief of staff is planning to limit the president ’ s media ratings .	-2.4108
Others tried it and failed .	-1.4815
Maybe John F. Kelly can do it .	-2.4836
If so , he will be the first .	-0.8941
Politico reports that the White House ’ s new chief of staff is planning to limit the flow of information to President Trump , including news media reports , in the hope of keeping the boss on a more equitable course .	-4.3494
Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey :	-1.7870
" When John F. Kelly , the White House ’ s new chief of staff , met with senior staff on his first working day , he presented a major problem in President Donald Trump ’ s White House that he wanted to repair : poor information coming into the hands of the president .	-5.3123
Kelly told employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he received good information . "	-3.8310
Kelly ’ s diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media integrity .	-2.4633
President Trump ’ s relationship with television dates back decades – and now that he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong .	-3.4151
" If candidate Trump was angry about unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of places to convince , " said former electoral adviser Sam Nunberg in February to Politico .	-5.8377
Politocos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that " the key to keeping Trump ’ s Twitter habit under control , according to six former campaign officials , is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise . "	-6.2392
Okay .	-1.3392
But the idea that Trump ’ s Twitter habit has ever been “ under control ” is ridiculous .	-2.1773
Perhaps these campaign officials know something that we do not know to others - that without their intervention , Trump ’ s tweets would have contained even more fuel .	-4.9346
We will probably never know anything about the tweets that Trump has not sent .	-2.4049
If his staff managed to keep angry from him several times , their efforts paid off .	-5.4383
But no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump from causing controversy .	-2.6492
Part of the problem is that people in a White House composed of competing parties are constantly trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that might promote their views from the world .	-4.0468
Politico - preoccupied with this history - reported in May the preference of advisers to provide dubious information to the President for strategic reasons .	-4.7633
This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher :	-2.0775
" Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press cuts , especially those with damaging leaks , and that he is focusing on finding out where they come from .	-4.5780
That is exactly what happened at the end of February , when someone accidentally gave the President a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com , the website of the Internet provocateurs Charles C. Johnson , accused the deputy chief of Katie Walsh of being " the source behind a pile of leaks " in the White House .	-5.4218
Although Johnson has been banished from Twitter permanently for harassment , or that he has not offered any concrete evidence , or that he has been making false accusations in the past and has revoked them .	-6.2194
Trump read the article and began to ask staff about Walsh . '	-3.6918
Goldsmith added that the former chief of staff , Reince Priusbus , and the Secretary General of the White House , Rob Porter , " tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork that Trump receives " .	-3.7375
How did this work ?	-1.7433
Kelly tries to do the same three months later .	-1.5505
Perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager as Priusus , but Trump is still his impulsive self , and his advisers are still seeking influence .	-2.9055
These immovable factors make Kelly ’ s mission extremely difficult .	-3.9710
Most sought criminals get Europol 's post office	-3.5713
As the address is unknown , the public will be asked for and hoped for help .	-5.8472
The police across Europe this summer ( virtual ) are sending postcards to dangerous criminals on the road .	-4.3044
Since the addresses of the requested serious criminals are by definition not known , information from the population is hoped for and asked .	-7.0002
Europol reported on Friday about the action following the winter ' EU Most Wanted ' -dvercalendar .	-3.1073
Experience would have shown that many refugees are hiding from vacation destinations , it was said by Europol .	-4.5635
21 cards have been put together for war criminals from 21 EU countries .	-3.8561
Since 2016 there is the site www.eumostwanted , more than 2.5 million times this was considered .	-4.9157
36 of the online papers have so far been arrested , at least 11 of them on the grounds of reference to the publication on the website .	-5.6013
Travelers are negotiating a ditch and returning to the ' millionaires ' series .	-4.3194
Some of the West Midlands ’ s wealthiest homeowners are back in war with some determined travelers who negotiated a ditch drawn up by the community to reclaim a field in front of their mansions .	-6.3921
The travellers have their 20 caravans in a field outside a wealthy street of Solihull part called the " Millionärms series " .	-4.9612
They brought horses , babies and an army of transporters before they were thrown out in May , but without being deterred by a rupture thrown out by the Council in order to prevent their incursions .	-8.0291
The Tactical Group found a gap in defense installations and pushed its vehicles through a section that remained unstopped to find a way .	-5.1015
There are angry inhabitants who attacked the Council of Solihull who said that it is ' useless to deal with the problem ' .	-5.3947
An anonymous resident said : " They are pulled there on Monday evening after they were transferred by Bentley Heath , where they threw stones on the passer-by .	-5.3816
The Council must be forced into action with shame because it was useless to deal with the problem .	-4.2214
The travellers were there in May , moved forward and are now back .	-2.5385
More came yesterday evening , probably more today . '	-2.0603
She added : " The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with this by holding long instructions to protect its parks .	-2.6377
I live on Streetbrook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my community tax if the Council cannot even stop it . '	-3.3684
A neighbour who did not want to be called , said : ' It is ridiculous , we have just seen the last round of these travellers just to be plundered by another round .	-4.3439
The figures have increased this time and you have even seen a horse in the park . '	-4.0772
One speaker of the Council of Solihull said : ' We are aware of an unauthorized camp in the country beyond the streetsbbrook Road and are working with the police of Solihull , and we take the necessary legal steps to move forward as soon as possible .	-9.1366
To support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible report anti-social or criminal police behaviour by calling 101 .	-3.6254
This helps to create an image of the situation in which the Court will have to consider when we are presenting our case . '	-4.5426
From Birkenhof forest hotel Luise	-2.6710
From the former Hotel Birkenhof is the Waldhotel Luise .	-3.1076
The house at the gates of Freudstadt is being renovated and will be reopened on 1 March next year .	-5.1305
This is good news for the city .	-1.6690
After all , with the closure of Hotel Birkenhof by the then ambience Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014 , around 30 000 overnight stays were lost each year and also income from the tourist tax .	-6.2544
In the autumn of 2014 , with the dramatic increase in numbers of refugees coming to the district , the hotel building was offered to the Board of Governors as a collective accommodation , creating controversial discussions .	-6.6250
The city prevented asylum seekers from being accommodated by the establishment of a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .	-4.7679
The decision was not undisputed in the local council at that time .	-3.4600
But above all , the hotkertown of Oberbürgermeister Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and spoke to the House of serious interest at that time . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-8.6497
He should be right .	-0.8663
Luisenhotel group with manager Birgit Scherer , based in Bad Bergzaern , purchased the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it again a house of the three-star Plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise .	-6.0635
The group has four houses with the happy object .	-2.8757
Two of them in Bad Bergzaber and one in Bad Herralba .	-2.4721
You are called Hotel Luise , Luisenpark , Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise .	-1.9885
The former Hotel Birkenhof has been in front of the entrance for a long time now , and when you enter the house , it will be clear what major renovations will be carried out .	-6.4318
The floors were ground , some of them were dismantled , old bathtubs removed from the rooms .	-5.3187
The entire hotel building is a single building .	-1.9306
There is still much to be done by March .	-1.8097
" It 's really a nice hotel " , says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper .	-3.3941
Everything should be renewed in the Schwarzwald style .	-2.0865
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers , the entrance is transformed and new windows are installed .	-4.5588
Everything should be " beautiful close to the citizen " later , as Thomas Scherer put it .	-5.2443
" We want to make a piece of jewellery " .	-2.5824
The hotel features a swimming pool , spa and meeting room .	-3.2042
The room was clean and comfortable .	-6.7383
The Waldhotel Luise , with its 60 rooms , wants to expand , explains Scherer .	-4.8067
Both individual tourists , groups or businesspeople should feel at home in the hotel .	-4.3745
He had talks with OB Julian Oswald and tourist director Michael Krause already , says Scherer .	-2.9150
The views of the city are equal to those of the hotel group .	-4.4693
'We are on the same line ' .	-2.1477
Thomas Scherer does not want to specify exactly what investment is required .	-4.2855
Just under a million euros , he expects .	-3.1772
The outdoor facilities are also taken on the front man , which is already clearly visible .	-6.1341
A large terrace is created in an inner courtyard , which will be accessible by the restaurant , which is public .	-4.2578
Thomas Scherer is optimistic : " Freuddenstadt is a good market " .	-2.6232
Russia affair : US Special Counsel applies Grand Jury	-3.5680
In the Russia affair for US President Donald Trump , Robert Mueller , a special envoy , is alleged to have appointed a so-called Grand Jury after a report .	-4.8764
In recent weeks , the panel took up the work , wrote the " Wall Street Journal " , referring to people familiar with the matter .	-5.8591
The newspaper valued the step as a sign that Mueller had extended and intensified his investigation .	-3.8839
The CNN channel reported that there are already first subpoenas of the body related to a meeting between Trump ’ s eldest son and a Russian lawyer .	-3.1698
US intelligence agencies have long been accusing the Kremlin of engaging specifically in the 2016 presidential election campaign .	-2.4477
Mueller investigates whether there were agreements between Trump ’ s campaign team and Moscow .	-2.8024
The investigation is intended to focus on several men who acted in the election campaign as Republican advisers .	-4.1717
According to reports , Mueller also looked at more and more Trump ’ s private and business environment .	-2.5894
The Washington Post wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Counsel has brought Trump personally to the centre and is criticising whether the president may have obstructed justice in the course of the affair .	-6.8216
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine this evidence in possible criminal cases and to decide whether to charge it .	-5.2049
Grand Jury are therefore also called indicators .	-3.4704
They are turned on too often when there are larger and controversial cases .	-3.7075
The procedure is always conducted behind closed doors .	-2.0909
The board can also be turned on by the public prosecutor to load people for interrogation under oath .	-4.1936
According to CNN , subpoenas have already been issued , dealing with the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer .	-4.2288
People who were involved in the meeting were asked to make a statement , it was stated in the report .	-3.9860
They should also provide documents .	-1.4177
In addition to Trump Jr. , Trump ’ s advisers and son-in-law , Jared Kushner , as well as his campaign leader Paul Manafort , were part of the conversation .	-4.3895
Legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that setting up that Mueller would not be intimidated in his work and that he would act quickly if necessary .	-4.3733
But it doesn 't necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the charge charge .	-5.9179
Nevertheless , the establishment of the body is the beginning of a new phase in the investigation and a new reason for concern for President Trump .	-3.7684
In the midst of the new revelations , on Thursday evening , the President used a speech in West Virginia to portray the Russia affair as a campaign by his political opponents .	-3.6621
" The Russia story is a complete invention , " said Trump .	-2.7681
The subject gives Democrats a chance to ' feel good because they have nothing else to talk about ' .	-4.3901
His special adviser Ty Cobb explained in an opinion that he knew nothing about setting up a Grand Jury .	-3.1600
But they usually work in secret , he emphasized .	-3.1876
The White House is in favour of any measures that have accelerated the work of the special committee in a ' fair ' way .	-3.7690
The former FBI CEO James Comey said three times that it would not be determined against the president .	-4.7575
There is no reason to believe that something has changed about this , and the statement continued .	-5.8211
But he was only deployed after Trump fired Comey .	-2.4407
Because of this rabble-rout , accusations against Trump were made that he wanted to hamper the judiciary .	-6.7858
Comey told a Senate committee in June that Trump asked him to stop investigations against then-national security adviser Michael Flynn .	-3.7040
The President is under great pressure for the investigation .	-2.5760
Following the presentation of US media , the White House collected material against the special committee and its employees .	-4.1901
This triggered speculation about whether Trump would dismiss Mueller .	-2.6968
Unlike an independent congressional special counsel , such as in the Watergate affair surrounding later President Richard Nixon , Mueller has a position in which , theoretically , he could be fired by the Ministry of Justice at the request of the president .	-5.6374
Several senators from both parties want to prevent such a move .	-2.2805
Two groups of Republican and Democratic Senators presented legislative proposals on Thursday that would no longer make the special committee so easy to dismiss .	-5.4292
Antarctica : Mount Gigantischer Eisberg in Antarctica	-4.1913
In the West Antarctic , a giant iceberg of Berlin 's almost seven fold size has been resolved by the Trimfeis .	-6.6069
The Bremerhaven Alfredo Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday included this .	-3.9571
The excess of a trillion tons of heavy and 5800 square kilometers in size now north , and probably will take two or three years until it has melted .	-6.0152
It is one of the biggest ice giants that researchers have registered over the past three decades , at 175 kilometres in length and a width of up to 50 kilometres .	-4.4011
He does not pose a threat to people .	-2.7982
The extent to which climate change has played a role in stopping the iceberg is unclear according to research information .	-4.8125
Overall , however , there has been a series of unusual collapses in the region for some 30 years , writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice ( NSIDC ) in a factual background .	-5.3456
Many researchers believe that this can be linked to global warming .	-2.4551
The now broken Koloss has been part of the Larsen C-Schelfei .	-4.8319
Shellfeis swims on the sea and is fed by large glaciers .	-3.3992
It is therefore constantly growing into the sea and breaking regularly .	-4.9400
The Larsen C-Schelfeis located south of South America at the tip of the Antarctic peninsula .	-4.4280
To the north of this schema was the equilibrium of growth and demolition a few years ago disrupted .	-5.0926
A complete Scheme is broken down there , AWI-researcher Daniela Jansen writes .	-5.3605
There is much to say that even the Larsen C-Schelfei is in danger , because the front edges have never been so far removed as they are at present . , , and , are , , and , , , , , , , , ,	-9.0235
In addition , the ice plate is under tension and can unravel if a piece is aborted at a key point .	-5.4901
The melting of Schelfeis and iceberg does not increase sea levels , as they swim on the water and cast ice as much water as it does after melting itself .	-6.9313
However , the loss of the Scheme means that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before .	-5.3133
This may increase sea levels , but only slightly , writes the British research project on the observation of the Antarctic ( Midas ) .	-4.6641
According to AWI , the Larsen C-Schelfei is the fourth largest Antarctic dither , with almost 50 000 square kilometres .	-4.9674
On the way from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge of the free ocean about 200 meters .	-5.0179
There it breaks regularly .	-1.9137
" Although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change , the ice shield is now in a more dangerous position , " said Martin O 'Leay of the British Swansea University .	-4.6880
" This is the longest retreat since the records began , " he also confirmed .	-3.3721
Scientists are controversial about whether the Larsen C-Schelfei will now grow again or go back in the long term and possibly together , his colleague Adrian Luckman said and added : ' Our models say that it will be less stable ' .	-5.7346
But this development will last decades .	-2.2410
Although these researchers do not trace the impact of this giant iceberg on climate change , many ice clips of the Antarctic Peninsula have collapsed in recent decades .	-6.0152
This long Antarctica pike stretches towards South America .	-3.5582
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey , the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s .	-2.7570
The rise in temperature has contributed to the decline .	-1.7933
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed around three degrees over the past 50 years , and is one of the areas where the temperature is the fastest .	-5.1152
The CDU wants personnel building tariffs	-5.1166
Because it is becoming more and more difficult to fill vacant positions , the CDU is calling for the employer ’ s association to be made more attractive .	-4.8568
Only shortly before the summer recess , the day of the district has left 41 new posts in the administration .	-6.1868
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann .	-3.1672
Now , 17 trainees have completed their first working day .	-3.3562
The courses at the circle are obviously very much sought .	-4.6974
There have been around 620 applications for the seats given this year .	-4.7785
Nevertheless , the circle still lacks staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks .	-3.7359
Currently , there are still 50 vacant positions in the Mettmann Circle .	-4.2469
Doctors and engineers , as well as forces of general administration , are called for .	-4.8072
The CDU , together with the FDP and the UWG , wants to take the initiative in the middle of the day and to confront the shortage of skilled labour in administration .	-6.5762
According to the wishes of the parties , the administration shall prepare ' a concept for the recruitment and human resources development ' .	-6.0255
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs for professionals , but to counter the shortage of candidates for the future , it is to say .	-5.3246
The overall concept should be oriented internally and externally , show concrete measures for cross-entrants and include a training offensive , call for the CDU , FDP and UWG .	-4.6305
That sounds like a good approach .	-2.3392
Because the circle is dealing with staffing problems that were not previously known .	-5.4176
Other cities recruit good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .	-1.9275
We are talking about a genuine ' competition for public employers ' .	-2.7549
In addition , there are a large number of employees who are out of service due to illness or age .	-5.4836
So it is high time to act so that no more jobs remain vacant .	-4.1390
But Klaus-Dieter Volkes , Chairman of the CDU , goes further than the joint motion .	-4.0367
He recently caused a poor surprise in the middle of the day , when he publicly called into question staffing costs and stunned the other parties .	-7.6708
People want to see a review of all the opportunities that allow local employers to leave .	-5.5150
" If we do not come to a satisfactory solution in the short term , the management of circles with trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the metropolitan cities - should aspire to a coronation , " people say .	-7.3259
In doing so , the CDU is trying to pay more for employees and civil servants than the public service tariff system actually provides for .	-6.0064
The salaries are currently strictly prescribed , increases or more money are only available if you change to a higher level based on professional years .	-6.5621
But the task of the circle has grown more and more in recent years .	-2.9363
Only a few weeks ago , new premises had to be set up , in which employees took care of the provisions of the new law on prostitution .	-4.8588
Not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers , Landrat Thomas Hendele and KreisDirector Martin Richter have a problem : they have too few staff .	-5.4550
Italy is exacerbating the tone for NGO ’ s Migrants	-5.1400
Italy has warned NGOs working to rescue migrants in the Mediterranean that they must not continue this unless they abide by new rules for their operations .	-4.5032
" If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue to work , " Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with the Turin daily newspaper La Stampa .	-3.2433
Minnitis 's warning came a day after the Italian authorities had seized a boat from the German relief organisation ' Youth Save ' because their team had effectively cooperated with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration .	-4.7514
The relief organization , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to comment on detailed accusations by the Italian Public Prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio .	-5.6490
" For us , saving human life remains our top priority , so we are very sorry that we cannot currently operate in the search and rescue zone , " said the organization in an opinion on the social media .	-4.4784
" We can only judge all the allegations that are being made at the moment once we have collected all the information and can judge the situation . "	-5.2257
The Italian authorities had monitored the boat of ' Youth Retet ' , Iuventa , since October .	-3.0599
It is suspected that his crew will take rubber boat migrants on board , which are delivered directly by human traffickers , and that the smugglers can leave behind to use the ships again .	-7.1971
At least such a meeting allegedly took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the Public Prosecutor 's file , the content of which was published by Italian media .	-4.1344
The occupation is suspected of ignoring the authority of the Italian coast guard , the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other reason .	-3.4877
Under the code of conduct , boats like Iuventa must , above all , have an Italian police officer who monitors their activities .	-3.6327
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue missions have so far agreed to abide by the code : Save the Children , MODAS from Malta and pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain .	-3.4997
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable , as they would not bring about ' major changes or obstacles ' of their rescue operations .	-4.6948
Among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel Laureate Organization is Doctors Without Borders ( MSF ) .	-2.0700
Minniti has now said that the number of migrants arriving in Italy following the rescue measures has fallen sharply in recent weeks , suggesting that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast guard and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit .	-4.5958
" In the last few days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , " the Minister said .	-2.5623
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad , Niger , and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of reaching Europe .	-3.1002
Trials and Tri.	-2.3208
Nine mountain bikers , the " Berlin Outpost " and two guest drivers met in Wachtenheim in the North pfalz to enjoy Trials and sights for four days .	-6.5860
Three friendly guides were available for this purpose .	-2.2781
Accommodation in the Wachau Valley turned out to be a good starting point for the tours .	-2.4843
Wachau castle and wine festival was a welcome extra .	-2.8422
The first tour led to Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim during hot summer temperatures along the vineyards .	-3.0621
Then there were vantage points , partly on towers , from which one could look far beyond the Pfalzer forest and the outlands .	-7.1719
In between , there were longer growths , for which long trials were buried .	-5.2339
On the second day Bad Dürkheim went to Saline and to the Volksfest sausage market .	-4.9722
Yet another viewpoint , connected by " float " Trials and moderate moderate rise .	-4.6788
On the last two days there was a lot of climb .	-4.2510
Caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and refuges brought welcome breaks .	-3.3933
In Bad Dürkheim therapeutic brine for bikers in the open-air steam bath .	-4.3934
New Zealand has also been controlled .	-4.2910
After 173 kilometers and almost 4500 metres of altitude , the group had met the Pfälzer Forest from its best side - sport and cultural .	-4.1871
Console rather than Green - Bundesliga equips itself for e-sports .	-4.8197
Are the sports stars ahead of computer consoles , instead of being overridden by wind and weather over the pitch pitch pitch pitch ?	-7.0056
Fact is : E-Sport has long since become a serious industry , a lucrative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high spikes .	-4.2551
The first Bundesliga leaders have also recognized this , which is becoming increasingly involved in this area .	-5.7908
At the beginning of 2015 , VfL Wolfsburg , later the FC Schalke 04 and last but not least the VfB Stuttgart , who founded an e-sports department in mid-July and accepted two pros for the game FIFA 17 .	-8.4362
" We hope to inspire new young target groups for VfB " , says Jochen Röttgermann .	-4.1518
He is sure that there are many clubs on this turn .	-5.2970
Next weekend , FIFA World Football Association will organise the first " Interactive Club World Cup " in London , where gamers from different clubs compete against each other .	-4.7052
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven qualified .	-2.8763
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sport .	-1.8653
The former coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises a virtual football player agency .	-2.2667
" Real football must focus in particular on the 14 to 30 years of age , that young people will continue to go to the stadium in the future , " says the 51-year-old .	-7.2676
And : The clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian ones .	-2.8371
With prominent e-sportsmen under contract , you could be present on these markets much more online than just once a year to send the Bundesligamanswasse to Asia .	-6.0867
What is this all about ?	-2.2113
In e-sport , computer games such as " League Of Legends " , " Dota 2 " , " Counterparty " or even football simulation will be challenged at competitive level .	-5.8079
For a long time , as in normal sport , leagues have established in which the pros compete against each other .	-4.9707
And in the 2022 Asian games , e-sport is already part of the official programme .	-3.0479
But is it a real sport ?	-2.8451
For many , the imagination needs to be used safely .	-3.7657
Ingo Fromalicious also dealt with the question for a long time .	-3.8587
For the professor at the German School of Sports in Cologne , e-sport is a sport because it is competitive and displays many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in classical sport - for example , increased heart frequencies , stress reactions , hormonal changes .	-6.0120
It also requires cognitive skills , a technical and tactical understanding , and a fast response capability .	-3.6724
Professional gamers should not only train at the console , but also train their bodies and watch food .	-3.1203
" The fit player is a good player . "	-1.7632
There are also problems , however : ' doping is becoming more and more a topic ' .	-4.1342
Controls were hard to work on online games , and the scene lacked the structures of classic sport .	-4.8544
On the positive side , the scientist highlights the high integrative effect of e-sports .	-4.3805
Players are on the international stage , like a large global family , there are no intercultural barriers .	-4.4283
A study by Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software ( BIU ) suggests that e-sport is growing rapidly .	-5.3109
In 2016 , Germany implemented EUR 50 million , mainly through advertising , sponsorship , and big tournaments .	-3.9027
Sales will be at 130 million in three years .	-3.0304
This is hardly the case with the almost EUR 2.4 billion allocated to football matches .	-6.3603
However , e-sport " is no longer far from other established sports such as handball , basketball or ice hockey " , writes the Deloitte consultant .	-4.6347
Many countries have gone further internationally .	-6.2688
Major markets are Asia and the USA , where ex-basketball players Shaquille O<unk>Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez participate in the US team NRG eSports .	-3.0035
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSport-Tbetting provider Unirn .	-4.4191
There is also something happening in Europe .	-2.4557
In a Norwegian school , e-sport was introduced as a school subject , says Froevil .	-3.7251
In the Netherlands and France , the first football club , according to the Dutt , is now obliged to set up an e-sports department .	-5.3208
" In the European comparison , Germany is lagging behind , " states VfB board Röttgermann .	-5.1351
It is only in nostalgia that we are falling into line with the old times that we are today . , , and , , , and , ,	-6.7621
It is about preserving the tradition of the association , but at the same time adapting the company to the modern market .	-3.5633
" We live in a digitalised world , " says Dutt .	-3.7701
" It is not possible to insist that everything remains as it always was in football . "	-6.4500

Michelle Carter condemned for the texts that Conrad Roy called for suicide .	-3.6165
A Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend by text and calls for suicide .	-3.9405
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars , and five years have been suspended at probation .	-3.2129
Carter was convicted in June of negligent killing by Conrad Roy , who died on July 13 , 2014 .	-2.7482
The father of Roy said at the hearing on Thursday : " My family is awful .	-3.4926
My son was my best friend . '	-1.2948
Carter was allowed to remain free to appeal .	-2.1434
She was faced with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both they and Mr Roy suffered from mental illness .	-4.3479
Trapped in red trousers and a cream-coloured blouse , Carter stood in his eyes with tears , with folded hands and down eyes when sentenced .	-4.8569
" Her actions killed Conrad Roy , " the lawyer told the court .	-2.4182
" They ended his life to make their own better .	-2.8779
She did not take any responsibility ' , she said .	-2.7392
" She has not shown remorse " .	-2.1084
But , Carters ’ lawyer said that it is a ' terrible circumstance that she deeply regret ' .	-5.5340
But Judge Lawrence Moniz said that he did not discover that their " age or maturity , or even their mental illness , have a significant impact on their actions " .	-3.7072
A prosecutor read a statement by Roy Roy Roy Roy Roy Roy that said that there was " no day on which I did not witness the loss of my beloved son .	-4.8995
I would like him to be proud of me and to be there for his sisters , despite all the pain that we will carry with us for eternity , " he says .	-7.4752
Roy , said she would be " persecuted " by the realization that she would never take part in the wedding of her brother or be an aunt for his children .	-4.7949
" Not having this only person with whom I have been together every day since my birth is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , " she said .	-4.0420
The case seems to set a legal precedent , as there is no Massachusetts law that makes it a crime to ask others to commit suicide .	-3.4706
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in 2014 by a carbon monoxide cutter in a vehicle .	-3.6552
The case attracted national attention after Carter ’ s text releases revealed that he had encouraged him to end his life .	-4.2125
" hang on , jumping from a building , draw yourself , I do not know there are many ways , " she said in several news that she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on holiday with his family .	-5.4896
In the eyes of his suicide she wrote : " You must do it , Conrad " and " Everything you need to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy . "	-4.0363
Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention by the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from the case through any press .	-2.9496
The case has divided legal opinion .	-1.9563
One of the few defending Carter was Amanda Knox , who was sentenced in 2007 for murder of her British female worker in Italy before she was released two years ago .	-5.2280
Mrs Knox , 30 years old , made a comment in Los Angeles Times : ' Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not prison ' .	-2.8304

That Joshua Kim allowed me to run up as a captain at the Audi Cup is no accident .	-3.2213
The FC Bayern has a great season for the Confed-Cup-winner - extra motivation does not detract .	-7.6031
Something was different in his place in the cabin , which saw Joshua Kimme immediately , even if the additional piece of clothing was very , very small .	-4.9782
But , as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup , of course , he was not allowed to see Philipp Lahm and also no Manuel Neuer , he turned the binding he had allocated to him to the arm .	-7.6417
" The trainer did not announce it , " the Confed-Cup-winner then told after his first assignment as a Bayern-Captain .	-6.4131
Well , the cap could have run better than at the 0 : 2 against the SSC Naples .	-2.8017
But the coach ’ s character could also interpret Kim so .	-5.4121
In addition to the eight years old Arturo Vida , the C-Elf had been chosen as the champions of the youth , the debutants and the professionals who had just been out of the holiday , but he had chosen .	-13.3601
After all , you prefer to distribute sugar to those who want to keep you happy .	-5.8522
Those who have chosen to take the legacy of Lahm can only use a small extra motivation .	-5.3732
Kimme confirmed : " This is what you would like to take on responsibility as a player . "	-4.6682
The 22-year-old was flying over the field on Wednesday .	-3.2578
Right behind , that is now his position , the white connective in the arm did the rest .	-4.2017
And at all , Kim worked in this start-up formation like the one who can take the helm in the best hands .	-6.8209
He gave instructions , tried to direct the unplayed force .	-3.7917
He had a look at everything , while many others were busy with it .	-4.9424
In the end , Renato Sanses had a reputation for being one of the world 's best football players .	-13.3760
The room was clean and comfortable .	-6.2298
Süle ran alongside Kimme , Rudy before the defense , both agile sovereign .	-3.3290
The Naming Napoli storm often hit hard , and Süle also tried to succeed in the establishment of the game .	-9.0833
His colleague , Mr Rudy , admitted that the result was ' not as much as we hoped for ' .	-4.2839
But he also showed a good performance at the debut .	-2.5951
Relocation , Tempowechosel : " I got it for this style " .	-5.7498
The way the uncharacteristic world is still for the new entrants was followed by the match .	-8.8549
For example , Rudy gave not one or two interviews in the catacombs , but determined six or seven interviews .	-3.0352
Kim decided to leave after a few tight statements in the back of his new fellow players .	-5.9769
There he heard an interesting sentence from Süle : " What is going on here I noticed now .	-5.5391
With Bavaria you just have to win every game " .	-3.3810
After all , he must no longer contribute to the new .	-4.2966
Alabama motivates FB-ladies .	-2.9410
David Alabama believes in the success of our <unk>FB-Ladies .	-2.9017
Austria ’ s famous footballer reported on Twitter just before the game and wanted the <unk>FB-Ladies well .	-5.7277
The Bavarian Legionary is , after all , a members of the Board of Governors of <unk>FB-Kapitalanin Schnaderbeck and feiert with our Ladys .	-8.5992
The Tweet of the Austrian football player of the year and Champions League winner should be a special cast of motivation .	-4.2853
Our ladies might also need the famous Bayern-Dusel .	-4.0058
Businesses satisfied with Rhineland Palatinate Minister : Economy praises Wisconsin 's Tempo	-5.2288
The relationship between the country and the regional economy was often settled , when Eveline Lemke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economics from Rhineland-Palatinate .	-5.7928
This is evident after more than a year in which the new Minister for Economic Affairs Volker Wissing ( FDP ) is in office .	-3.7222
Chambers and businesses in the region speak of a change in economic policy at T V question - and at the same time charge the old minister .	-5.6397
Frank Natus , Chairman of the Association of Trierer Companies ( VTU ) , says : " Wissing responds to the wishes of the economy , which Lemke has all blocked " .	-5.0247
Natus sees the biggest U-turn in infrastructure policy : the intersection of motorway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country 's list of priorities .	-4.9280
Even this year the ministry hopes for a planning mechanism , with the construction law expected to be in 2021 .	-6.4955
The Western Confederation of Trier is also a part of the country ’ s plans , which is in the urgent need of the Federal Road Map .	-6.8013
The aim is to take the course into operation in December 2020 , according to ministerial pressure from Cornelia HolMs .	-6.2068
Natus sees this as a sign to support regional but internationally competing companies .	-3.8316
The Chamber of Commerce ( IHK ) Trier , as indicated by Wissing , seeks a Rheinland-Pfalz label at the wine to increase sales in supermarkets and stop the trend of German wine exports that have been dropping for ten years .	-5.9804
In addition , Wissing has an open ear for people who want to create their own company , praising the Chamber of Commerce .	-4.1789
The Treetenhaus Trier sees an additional incentive for young apprentices in the new Master Prize , says Matthias Schwabbach .	-5.9894
In the meantime , a prize of EUR 1000 is available for the master exam and EUR 2500 if graduates become independent within ten years of master education .	-6.3079
However , the house employment list for the country remains a long one .	-3.9765
When road construction is planned , it is easy to create facts , but at the same time it lacks the necessary staff , says Jan Gloauer , chief manager of the IHK Trier .	-7.4174
Of 56 new engineers who want to employ Wisconsin at national mobility , up to now 29 are occupied .	-6.3484
IHK is calling for more contracts to be given to external offices .	-3.8558
In this regard , CDU-Group Tutze Christian Baldauf points to calculations by the Court of Auditors , investing the country in 2017 and 2018 more than EUR 20 million less in the preservation of national roads than proposed .	-6.7590
Frank Natus also expects a concept of the country to remedy the shortage of skilled labour in the region .	-4.3411
I should also like to commend the extension of broadband to date in the country .	-4.3232
In 2016 , regional companies had evaluated net supply only with the Note 3.4 in an IHK survey .	-3.8563
They complained about breaking Internet connections and breaking down .	-2.7629
Former Minister of Economics , Eveline Lemke , on the other hand , is now out of politics and is still in the Supervisory Board of the Pro Wind wind wind wind company .	-6.1025
The Green Group left Lemke in April to become President of a private college in Karlsruhe , where , after four months of disagreements , they already settled again .	-4.5302
Audi is supposed to change 85,000 diesel vehicles - automakers are facing a backlash .	-3.0490
One day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer to upgrade the software to more than 350,000 vehicles .	-2.8179
The BMW chairman said that the company believes that ' there are smarter options than driving restrictions ' , and referred to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - to ban or limit diesel vehicles .	-6.1003
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .	-2.2326
None of the companies described the undertakings as a call-back .	-2.7599
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules on carbon dioxide emissions .	-3.0185
But nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma .	-2.5767
The costs for car manufacturers to install systems for neutralization of diesel vehicles are also increasing , making it difficult to keep cars competitive .	-5.8922
The German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also charged with whipping up the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem .	-3.9486
Companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen ’ s mistakes , which have enabled the use of what are known as ‘ cut ’ devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the rules when a car has been tested but which are returning in normal driving conditions .	-7.9461
In the United States , several Volkswagen employees were charged , while others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic .	-2.6473
Last month , the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in engine development in Germany .	-3.1270
The former manager , Zacchio Giovanni Pamio , is Italians and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be tried in the United States .	-3.4322
At the beginning of this year , Audi was included in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen , after accusing the Audi authorities of having installed a system to circumvent the emissions regulations in Europe , and a question that concentrated on the United States was expanded .	-5.1828
The inclusion of Audi in the study could put a heavy burden on Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to Volkswagen ’ s profits .	-4.3187
This message has the kiss on Saturday at the Isar .	-3.3945
The city wants to protect the Isar .	-2.0072
In order for the visitors of the Isar to join , there will be a big bang in Munich tomorrow Saturday , which has a special message .	-6.4628
Anyone who moves to the Isar again on Saturday will see a big floss between Flaucher and Reichenbach bridge .	-5.3231
And that is not a bad thing , with the tourists of the Isar .	-4.1567
Special the Bauhaus referat wants to clear up .	-4.6138
On the flop you will see a big info transparent .	-3.7178
It shows a mountain of rubbish .	-1.2608
The start of a public campaign to appeal to the visitors of the Isar .	-2.8589
The motto " True Love is ... " is to sharpen understanding for the Isaac as a protective wild .	-4.5052
Last summer , the floss over the Isar and also this year , there are other actions and measures to achieve a prudent and environmentally conscious behaviour .	-7.0091
Mordillos Knollennasen and the Laughter against the suffering	-4.7084
At the time , Mordillo was one of the most widely published cartoon drawings , the Knollennasen of his are his .	-6.1229
Even with 85 the Argentinean still paints and works on a film .	-3.9096
His message : laughter , ' because there is too much suffering in the world ' .	-2.1185
Guillermo Mordillo was born on August 4 , 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .	-1.9883
In the first years as an artist , he beat himself , among other things , as an draughtsman for greeting cards - which frustrated him .	-5.4542
" The happiest day in my professional life was the day when my job lost , " he once said .	-2.9652
After stations in Lima , New York , and Paris he succeeded in the end of the 1960s : by publishing his cartoons in " Paris Match " and then also in the " star " and other leading magazines around the world .	-4.9470
Even in China , Mordillo found many fans .	-2.5747
The artist has always been inspired by cities .	-3.0001
Large , rounded Mordillo-figures died in drawings with the leaning tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .	-4.6391
In the early morning he is still at the drawing table today , working almost ten hours a day .	-4.6296
On calendars , puzzles , books for children and adults , t-shirts , funny animals and watches , his drolly figures continue to spread around the world .	-6.7420
For six years he has also been working on a cartoons and a TV series with his figures .	-4.0403
The main person in the movie " Crazy Island " is a Girscourge - Mordillos most popular animal in his drawings - who has one thousand innings as a counterpart .	-5.7318
For the first time , his characters speak in the 3D movie , which will be released in 2019 .	-4.7989
" I don 't know exactly what they will say , it 's strange for me " , says Mordillo .	-2.0736
The script is not written by him .	-1.6829
For this reason , he is relying on the TV series , which , like its original drawings , is produced without ambiguity .	-5.5967
Provence Lavender threatened by climate change	-2.1002
It has become a symbol of Provence in the south of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .	-2.7139
Lavender is in decline due to the conditions of drought and the disease causing insects , causing great headaches for scientists and farmers trying to find solutions .	-5.5176
Eric Chaisse , expert of agricultural research institute CRIEEPPAM in Provence , said : " The lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years , which caused much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn .	-6.0694
This has implications for the lifetime of lavender .	-2.6673
There is also a small diameter , a microbacterial which transfers dwarf ciades , and in very dry weather there are many of them . '	-6.6200
And there is much at stake .	-1.4550
Lavender oil does not only attract tourists , but also for perfume and cosmetics .	-4.2978
Eric Chaisse said : " Instead of having very long herbal seeds with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under-developed and either missing or weakened .	-4.0125
So we have less essential oil parts . '	-2.6805
The solutions that are considered include better water distribution and a slowdown in soil evaporation , but also the spray of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water , and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drying .	-6.9522
The town of Geisa in Rhön is celebrating its 1200-year anniversary .	-2.7792
The festival takes place this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival .	-3.4447
Krämer , guilds , traders , vagants and a county knecht camp are to be experienced in the city centre at these days .	-7.8287
The murder of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico	-1.7325
The staff of the weekly Ridoce usually meet on Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting the latest state chaos through organised crime , corrupt officials , and never-ending drug wars .	-5.3817
But on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .	-2.4066
They were told that it is important to change their routines .	-1.7355
Two senior journalists are discussing what feels safer : they are supposed to take their children into office with the goal of an attack with grenades in 2009 or leave them at home .	-5.2745
Security experts have written three words on a topboard on the front of the room : opponents , neutrale , allies .	-2.7152
They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary , perceptions and bellness .	-4.2380
There are drug traffickers , politicians , businesspeople , journalists suspected of standing on the government ’ s pay list or cartels , a catalogue of criminals making the chaos of Mexico dangerous .	-4.0660
There is no respite from violence , and while the bodies are accumulating throughout the country , there are more and more journalists involved : at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012 , 589 are committed to attacks and threats under federal protection , and so far there have been at least seven deaths in seven states this year .	-6.4415
Among the latter is her editor and her inspiration from Rioade , the co-founder Javier Valez Cardenas .	-4.0420
" The greatest mistake is to live and be a journalist in Mexico , " Valez wrote in one of his many books about violence related to drugs .	-3.2303
In the 1930s , Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez , wearing t-shirts showing his smiling face with glasses or his typical pantamahhat .	-6.9664
The workshop takes place less than two months after its death , and the reporters discuss their divided topics , the trauma , their nightmares , sleeplessness , paranoia .	-2.6136
Although a special Federal Bar Association was set up in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists , according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists , it only opened two criminal proceedings .	-5.0310
As with most thousands of murders linked to drug trafficking and organised crime each year , journalists ’ murderers are rarely brought to justice .	-3.9437
They are still insisting on treating the violence of Sinaloa , although they are fragile and even though the terrain is now more treacherous .	-5.3510
Without information on the killers , without justice , the meeting to discuss security has little benefit , says Ibarra .	-2.7545
" It is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , " he says .	-1.3170
" As long as we do not know why , we all mistrust . "	-3.2148
In the morning of May 15 , Valdez left the office of the Rioía newspaper in the state capital of Culican .	-5.1271
He was forced to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men , forcing and shot 12 times , probably because of the name of the newspaper , which was translated with " " .	-8.8336
The protection went away in his car and damaged it nearby .	-4.1091
Valdez was 50 years old .	-1.8320
He left a woman and two adult children .	-1.0606
Rumours tend to fly around freely in Culican .	-3.1222
But there is virtually nothing to talk about the Valdez .	-3.4084
Since Guam ’ s arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January , Sinaloa has become one of the country ’ s bloodiest battlefields , as rival factions are fighting here to fill the vacuum .	-3.4003
There is nothing that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot in the street or that the cemetery is full of ornate two-story mausoleums for drug barons , larger than many homes for the living .	-6.7346
Forget for a minute that there is a ' rest ' situation if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States .	-4.2899
Nevertheless , and despite the fact that Valez was aware of the dangers of his work , Ismail Bojorquez ( 60 ) , a co-founder and director of Riohoe , has broken the blame for not protecting his friend .	-6.1290
He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder .	-2.0717
First of all , in February , there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez , a leader of one of the rival cartel groups in the war with Guzmans ’ sons .	-4.2122
This release may have angered the sons , suspected gang members bought each copy of the output as soon as it was delivered to newspaper .	-3.7455
The second mistake was not to force Valez to leave the country for its own security following the confiscation of another newspaper that published the same story .	-3.9829
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .	-2.7046
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there .	-2.4345
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to establish Riohoe and sold $ 50 in investments .	-6.2314
In Sinaloa , " it was impossible to run journalism without encountering the drug problem , " said Bojorquez .	-2.8105
Over time , the newspaper deserved a reputation for courageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising took on .	-4.8326
Reporters loved being able to publish hard studies without fear of censorship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to treat .	-4.5246
Eight years after the founding of Rioade , she received the prestigious " Maria-Moors-Cabot Award " for her reporting to Latin America .	-4.2012
In the same year , Valez won the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for its courage in pursuing the Mexican drug history wherever it led .	-4.0243
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid .	-1.1073
" I want to continue to live , " he said at the time of the CPJ award .	-2.4025
drug trafficking in Sinaloa " is a way of life , " he said last October in an interview at Rompido TV .	-3.9373
" You have to take over the task that suits you as a journalist - either that or you play the fool .	-4.4352
I don 't want to be asked : " What did you do with so many dead ... why did you not say what was going on ? "	-4.0983
The Riobus team miss Valez , the fun bird who was able to flood like a dockworker , the friend who was generous with hugs and was a teacher who knew how to survive .	-6.2300
They trust in his routine .	-2.5493
He would always wear his hat .	-1.8717
He would always go to El Guayabo , the bar opposite the office , and always sit on the same table .	-3.8284
Now they ask : Was his love to routine his depravity ?	-3.7109
His death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how they can best do their work and stay alive .	-3.6352
" You don 't like it when you deal with your women , their children , their clean shops , their secret takeoff and runways " to move drugs .	-5.6824
" These things were not allowed , " said Bojorquez .	-2.0048
The result , even in the best times , is a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation .	-2.2996
Trust his own instincts .	-2.4379
If it is wrong , go away .	-3.6833
The anger is , the editor of Rioade Andres Villarroal said , that " smell is a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing happened with Javier . "	-5.7204
The old rules , as he and others say , no longer apply in Sinaloa - just as they are in Tamaulipas , Veracruz , Guerrero and other states , where a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes , weak institutions , and corrupt government officials are at home .	-3.8851
The landscape is constantly changing .	-1.3126
In the space where Rioase staff met for security training , there were suddenly no mobile phones allowed .	-7.0458
Outside , two police sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 <unk> C ) in the shadow of a tree .	-3.0537
They were commissioned by the National Government to protect the Rioja offices in a four storey building in a mid-range area of Culican .	-6.2577
Half in jest , some of the reporters asked whether these officers are among the 50 % of the police officers who the governor himself described as untrusted .	-5.4610
It is months since the reporters went into the mountains , where drug gangs are effectively under control .	-3.8444
For this week ’ s edition , Rioade has written on three main stories .	-4.9643
There was the murder of the brother of former boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa .	-2.5247
They also had an Exposé to government spending , which concentrated on the governor ’ s home town .	-4.1311
And there was a group carrying out a kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culican , one block from the Public Prosecutor 's office .	-3.6034
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened , so caution was required when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favourite local of drug dealers and authorities .	-4.0027
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belonged to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party ( PRI ) , which held all political levels almost throughout the century .	-4.1704
Recently , several PRI governors were accused of corruption for high quality cases .	-2.6401
Villarroal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this place , including one in which a son of " El Chapo " Guzman escaped a military attack .	-3.7077
Just a few months earlier , readers would have seen Valez ’ s column as the most informed source of kidnapping .	-4.4883
" In the past we would have known what happened , " said Villarroal , 46 , with the nickname " El Flaco " because of his body stature slim .	-4.8637
" Now all channels of communication with our sources have broken . "	-1.9834
The office of Valdez has been converted to the storage room for characters and labels protesting against the killings of journalists , because the workers have become something they never expected : activists on behalf of the press .	-6.7676
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few characters and went to a demonstration next morning for another journalist to the Public Prosecutor 's office .	-3.5094
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valez was killed in the western state of Michoacán .	-3.1866
A burned body has been discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests , that it is .	-2.1263
Throughout the country , journalists have become more vocal by writing in organized protests " SOS Press " in walking paths and buildings .	-3.8567
On that day , the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and is trying to gain international support for justice in the case of Valdez .	-4.4347
At a meeting with Sinaloa Governor on the day after the assassination of Valez , Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and bringing them around because they told the truth .	-4.0216
She has since asked for her to be reassessed by the government because she is concerned that her anger has breached her objectivity .	-4.3951
Valez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were " surrounded " by organized crime , government officials involved , and an equally valid society .	-4.2926
In his last book , " Narco Journalism " , he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs , but also ordered by politicians and security forces who were under a ceiling with organised crime .	-4.8688
Last year , the media watchdog group " Articulo 19 " allocated more than half of the attacks on police journalists and officials .	-3.4592
" In Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth , " said Ramirez .	-2.4112
Obviously , the murders have a deterrent effect .	-2.2320
No one forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago .	-3.2420
Your body was found together with a note allegedly signed by the Zebas cartel : " Here I am due to my reports . "	-3.8938
A computer keyboard and headphones were located next to their separated head .	-2.3096
Some branches have chosen to close , like the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua , after the assassination of the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March .	-3.2541
Others continue , as did El Manana of Nuevo Laredo after the assassination of her director in 2004 .	-3.5464
In 2010 , the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the front page entitled " What do you want from us ? "	-5.6020
Some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country .	-2.4974
It is a painful decision .	-0.7944
It is difficult to find work in exile and they are still watching the roads and looking for dangers .	-2.9947
And sometimes they are being driven , as the photographer Ruben Espinosa , who was murdered three months after the flight from Veracruz in 2015 with four women in an apartment in Mexico City .	-4.3061
For those who are lagging behind and who continue working , it is a daily dance with risky decisions .	-3.2062
Ibarra , who once wanted to be a poet , admits that the drug trade is frightening him .	-2.9176
" Mexico goes to hell , so I became a reporter , " he said .	-2.8240
At midnight on last Friday , when the last issue had already ended , the editors of Ridoce sat on the sidewalk before the office and drank beer when all their phones started to sums up .	-6.2561
A series of gunshots with gang rivals and security forces near the Mazatlan bath had left 19 confirmed dead .	-4.2194
The war continued to escalate , as promised by a number of cartels in the region .	-3.0414
From the edge of the brooch you have published the latest news on the Rioife website on mobile phones .	-6.1552
The title page had to be changed the next day .	-1.6561
Sirens Howlen near - another shooting in the area .	-4.3456
Bojorquez took a look at the policemen who held guards to see if they were ready .	-3.8643
If they were afraid , they did not show it .	-3.2530
Among the vast portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for the whole Sinaloa , Rioke ’ s employees followed his tracks .	-6.6201
" As you can only think about closing it , " said Bojorquez , " if the same day on which Javier was murdered , the trainee asked me to send her to the press to report " .	-6.5434
Dinosaurs used camouflage to escape its enemies .	-2.0268
At first sight it looks like a statue , albeit a frightening one .	-2.5428
Now researchers have found that the first insights of the incredible Nashorns of a Canadian mountain worker have been received so well that experts described it as " Mona Lisa the dinosaur " .	-5.3406
It was so good that they even discovered that his foppy skin was of reddish brown - and they said she had something of a " restless past " .	-4.3043
The report in the magazine " Current Biology " called him " the best-preserved dinosaur who has ever been found , and one of the best dinosaur puzzles in the world " .	-5.7908
The fossil is a newly discovered type of Nodosaur that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .	-3.8486
His incredibly good state of affairs has stunned researchers who described it as ' really remarkable ' .	-4.1169
According to reports in National Geographic , the patched herbivorous is the most preserved fossil of his kind .	-4.3005
It was found by Shawn Funk when he grub up at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta , Canada , on March 21 , 2011 .	-3.9891
He met something that seemed misplaced by the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely at it .	-4.8276
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyler Museum of Paleontology .	-3.5964
They spent the next six years discovering the wild animal within the 2.100 kg ( 1.100 kg ) of heavy earth-holes .	-5.4960
After all this hard work , the final result is ready to be revealed .	-2.2210
" If you only flash a little with your eyes , you might almost believe that it has slept , " said the main author Caleb Brown , scientist in the Royal Tyrrell Museum , where the creature is to be seen .	-5.4119
" It will enter into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaur expressionism - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaur career . , , , , , , ,	-5.4468
Researchers have found that , although it is covered with an armament and is similar to a changing tank , it is likely to be threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs .	-5.3826
The heavily armored dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators and used a shielding technique known as counter-coating , which is also used by many modern animals .	-5.5809
This would have made it possible to feel better in his surroundings and escape his enemies , say experts , suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs .	-6.4670
The 110 million years old creature from the Nodosaurier family made the first headlines in May and is now in the Royal Tyler Museum of Paleontology .	-4.8877
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markmitli after the museum engineer Mark Mitchell , one of a team who spent more than 7,000 hours exploring it carefully .	-4.6556
The astonishing conservation of the example allowed Dr Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armor on his body .	-4.2380
They discovered the contour activity , a common defense method in the animal kingdom , meaning that the top of the creature was darker than its bottom .	-3.9497
Although the contour arrangement is common , the results are surprising , as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of today 's animals .	-4.6396
It suggests that the dinosaur was driven by enough pressure by flesh fressed dinosaur that evolution favored confrontation as a means of survival .	-4.7455
But most contemporary animals that use the contortion - think of deer , zebras or shingles - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey , which signals that this Nodosaur was facing a real battle for survival .	-6.9349
" Strong predatory behaviour on a massive , highly entrenched dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaur animals of Cretace-style have been , " said Brown .	-4.9296
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was redbrown .	-2.5803
Scientists continue to examine the animal with references to his life , including his conservative intestinal content , to find out what it had eaten as his last meal .	-4.6117
They believe that the dinosaur , when he died , was driven into a river and into the sea , where he fell on his back to the seabed .	-4.9604
At that time , Alberta was as warm as southern florida today , and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland than they are today .	-3.3711
" This Nodosaurar is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with a frozen skin , but it also remains in three dimensions and maintains the original shape of the animal , " said Brown .	-6.2509
" The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as in the early Cretace.	-3.5130
You don 't need to use a lot of fantasy to reconstruct it , but if you just leave a little with your eyes , you might almost believe that he is in sleep . "	-9.0420
The Cretaceous era was a time when huge theropods , carnivorous dinosaur life , standing on two legs , crossed the earth .	-5.6952
Although the king of them , the Tyrande Rex , lived millions of years after Borealopelta , the on-board dinosaur was driven by some of his sorrowful ancestors .	-4.2839
This includes Accanhosus , a 38 foot ( 11.5 m ) long six tons of heavy monsters .	-4.4426
Scientists , whose latest findings appear in Current Biology magazine , believe that Borealopelta was sunk by the sea after death and was mummified in the mud .	-4.5796
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he grub on March 21 , 2011 at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta , Canada .	-4.0733
According to the museum it is the best-preserved dinosaur of the world , including skin and armor , and is completely from the Schnauze to the hip .	-3.8674
Creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,300 kg ) .	-3.4414
It contained two 20-inch long tips from his shoulders .	-2.8820
The researchers believe that the corunded herbive by Western Canada was swollen until a submerged river flooded it into the open sea .	-6.7328
But the submarine burial of the dinosaur kept its armor in exquisite detail .	-3.0693
The fossilized remains of this special example are preserved so well that the skin remains are still covered by bumpy tanks along the dinosaurs .	-5.9442
As Michael Greshko has written for National Geographic , such a level of conservation is as rare as a gain in the lottery .	-3.2944
The more I see it , the more confusing it becomes .	-1.5099
Hidden remnants of the skin are still covered by the holdouts of tanks that wear the animal ’ s skull .	-6.1955
His front leg is on his side , his five fingers are stretched upwards .	-3.5644
I can count the shots on his sole ' .	-1.7771
In the storm : Mass carambolage on A8 : Many injuries	-5.4988
Good accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : Knapp 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carambolage .	-3.3105
There are many injuries , miles of congestion , and Gaffer .	-3.8511
On the A8 motorway Stuttgart-Munich , about 20 people were injured in a mass carambolage on Thursday afternoon .	-3.7151
According to the first data from the police , between Adelzhausen and Odlzhausen ( district of Aichach-Friedberg ) during a thunderstorm of less than 30 vehicles , including most probably also trucks , inland waterway .	-9.4463
The exact number of casualties was initially not reported .	-4.0345
It is easy to medium-level injuries , a police speaker said .	-4.7932
There was a great deal of provision in rescue vehicles at the point of the accident .	-5.4507
The A8 was completely closed to Munich .	-1.8089
In the direction of Munich , a nearly ten kilometers long RAL emerged .	-5.7572
As a AZ-reporter reports , there was also massive disability on the opposite track - through numerous gaffer .	-5.8883
The fire brigade noted the characteristics of the vehicle drivers , who are now facing fragile penalties .	-6.0343
Shortly after 6 : 45 there was a second accident on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and Dasing .	-3.7695
A collision between a car transport operator and a passenger car had occurred .	-4.8918
A safety helicopter was on the way to the point of the accident .	-3.3183
Deutsche Bahn : Group tests ' comfort check-in '	-1.5754
It is a moment that almost everyone has already experienced : you are sitting in the train and sleeping .	-5.7002
Or you are deeper in his work and has just a brilliant idea .	-4.2109
And then : pufff .	-1.2278
Come and wake up the artist or tear the passenger out of the workflow .	-6.0250
Card control .	-1.5742
But the times of interruptions are over soon .	-3.7473
The Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the chaotic ticket control .	-5.3070
You can just confirm by mobile that you take your seat and thereby depreciate your ticket .	-5.2227
A test operation is currently running on two tracks .	-3.2058
" If the offer is accepted , we will extend it .	-4.4677
It will probably be available at the beginning of next year on many other long-distance transport routes in Germany , " said a railway spokesman .	-5.1751
" Comfort check-in " is the ticket devaluation without Schaffner .	-6.5589
To be able to use them , however , you have to meet some requirements : you need a smartphone or a tablet .	-5.0562
And you must have booked an online ticket - which is what most passengers already do .	-4.6134
It is also necessary to purchase it via the App of the railway that DB Navigator purchased , which is the most convenient way to book .	-7.5156
And last but not least , you need a seat reservation .	-2.4534
The fact is that ' comfort check-in ' works in such a way that you get to the train , call your ticket under ' My Tickets ' .	-7.4098
A button for electronic evaluation will appear in the test customers .	-4.7104
The train crews get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the seat of booked Y .	-5.3612
If the train companion is placed in place Y on the ticket control , he knows that there is a passenger with an already dived online ticket .	-6.8625
So you can continue to sleep , continue working , keep quiet .	-3.7636
The " check-in " has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which is to be used for passengers .	-5.5755
" If you want to travel easily without ticket control through our train crew , you can check in the DB navigator .	-5.8421
This allows passengers to personalize their travel time on the train , " says Michael Peterson , Marketing Board of DB long-distance transport .	-3.5920
Second Plus : " And our employees have more time than they are today to respond to individual customer needs " .	-4.8379
Anyone who travels along the train will know that , in addition to delays and passing trains , the ticket controls are one of the biggest obstacles .	-7.0601
Because often you have yourself , but in any case one of the passengers does not have all the documents you need to upgrade online tickets .	-6.5189
Either the credit card or identity card or otherwise a document to be presented is missing .	-4.3653
The result is endless discussions between train crews and passengers , resulting in a bad atmosphere in the Abode or greater area and delays in the control of their own tickets and ultimately taking the time for the Schaffner to take on other issues .	-7.6125
Only a small number of test customers can still use the new service .	-2.2915
And that also only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-food .	-3.6946
Other train numbers on the same route are not yet unlocked .	-3.7629
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question : " Whose Streets ? "	-2.6739
On 9 August 2014 , Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core .	-1.9734
Only one day after it was arrived in New York City , the people of St. Louis were sitting on the bed of an Airbnb apartment they hired and scrolled through Facebook on their phone .	-5.0391
She stumbled over a post from someone from the High School .	-1.6645
" The police have just killed an 18-year-old child and it is still on the street , " said .	-3.8665
Realize , since nobody else posted the information on their feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .	-2.7304
A user with the handle <unk> TheePharoah was constantly retweeted at their timeline .	-3.6452
Rapp from the area of St. Louis was involved in beating the death of Michael Brown , an unarmed black 18-year-olds killed by a white policeman in Ferguson , Mo .	-4.3506
He posted an image of browns lifeless body stretched out on the street and would remain there for four hours .	-4.9546
" This is quite wild " , Ferrell thought about himself .	-5.4144
But death was nothing new for them and their community .	-1.8250
She dropped her mobile phone to return to tweets about people on the Canfield Drive later in the evening .	-2.9348
There were photos of the police band and people who shouted , and of a man who claimed to be Browns father who bore a sign with the inscription : " Ferguson 's police have just killed my unarmed son ! "	-4.4794
They observed a live feed , where a policeman stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a belly-dog .	-3.2967
In another video , she said , another police officer left his gun and shouted : " I 'll kill you ... animals all . "	-2.8672
" This is not customary " , Ferrell recalled her statement .	-3.3403
" This is not the kind of murder to which we have become accustomed and which we can call typical . "	-4.0471
At this moment I felt shaking frost .	-3.2012
I was angry and crying ' .	-1.7650
She booked a return flight and went home the next day .	-2.2966
After landing at 23 o 'clock , she picked her 6-year-old daughter from her father 's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson next morning .	-4.5892
What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the theme of a new documentary film , " Whose Streets ? " , in cinemas from the 11th .	-4.2774
It is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resilience that exists from the point of view of the people who live in the community and filled the streets to demand answers .	-4.0593
When Ferrell drove to Ferguson with her daughter , wearing a flower dress and fitting crown , the two had a conversation that they had “ about the black experience and the black state ” .	-6.9236
" You remember how I taught you when black people must fight for what they believe ? " they remembered what they said .	-2.8242
" We are now going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that was not right .	-3.1452
I could not take her with her , " said Ferrell later .	-3.1180
" What happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .	-3.1120
It must be aware of it and it must be seen and raised in it .	-4.1376
It must be well developed , not only activism and organisation , but also the different classes of black experience and the black constitution , and what we must do to become free to free ourselves .	-3.9986
Although I am fortunate to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience blatant racism , she is no different from the next black female child .	-4.6423
I have the feeling that I would be doing her a bad job of keeping them away from it . '	-4.2977
The first station , when they arrived in Ferguson , was on South Florida Road , a site facing the police authority that became a camp when the activists waited for the possible non-charge of officer Darren Wilson .	-6.6510
That is where Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch .	-5.3126
They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators .	-2.5768
Slowly a new kind of activism started to take root in Ferrell .	-3.7228
" My activism changed completely after 9 August , " she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri . Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and concentrated on eating justice and health inequalities in black communities .	-4.6326
" I had no experience in organizing .	-1.6343
It all happened ' .	-3.2194
Weeks later , Ferrell met one of the co-directors of the film during an evening demonstration Sabah Folayan .	-3.1090
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alado-Farrar wanted only " document " what happened .	-3.7909
A question came in Ferrell 's sense : " Do you want to document or try to find a story that you can exploit ? "	-4.6130
This skepticism was fed by countless cases of people , often White – in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience .	-3.0966
As Folayan recently stated in an interview : " We had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson did not center their votes and we wanted to do it differently . "	-4.5828
Folayan had already collaborated with the then co-director Damon Davis , an artist from the field known for his activism around death camp inmates .	-4.7480
His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project , along with six other locals , followed the team of " Whose Streets ? " in the years after Brown 's shooting .	-5.5703
" This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us .	-2.2575
" That was the main thing for me , how these people are represented , because that is how I will be represented . "	-4.9113
The aim was not to focus on Ferrari 's experience - to show that the movement " is not a messiah leader , but a community that comes together , " said Folayan - it proved to be the most open participant in the film .	-4.4703
As a result , documents of " Whose Streets ? " surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrari 's life show how she loves and marries her wife .	-3.7848
" I felt like naked , " said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time .	-1.9538
" But I understood that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the glorification of black people . "	-3.7018
In addition , Ferrell ’ s story repeats the role of the black gay women in the broader Black-Lives Matters movement .	-4.3703
Two of the three founders of the movement who , after the killing of the black teenagers Trayby Martin in 2012 , coined the film " BlacklivsMatters " in social media , identify themselves as gay .	-5.3838
" Black , gay women in managerial positions have taken the overall movement , " said Ferrell , " and so we are constantly fighting on different fronts .	-5.2159
Black , gay women must bear the brunt of everything . "	-2.1266
Folayan agreed to notice that " the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women " .	-2.7692
However , it insists that " this is not an affirmative type of action " , where Ferrell was selected as the heart of the film due to its identity .	-4.8631
" She was the person who refuted this energy , " she said .	-2.3610
" It is no coincidence , although she was on the front line , because a life on these crossings is so much at stake as a black woman .	-4.4945
You can feel your energy through the screen " .	-1.9940
The news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared , but the racial connections between the community and the police continue .	-3.9205
Ferrell is on probation for 2 <unk> years because of the blocking of a motorway at a demonstration .	-3.1322
It describes the cultural atmosphere of the area that it calls its home : " A Chaos " .	-4.5541
However , she ignores a song and feels committed to this memory since she went to the streets three years ago in Ferguson .	-5.2778
" It is our duty to fight for our freedom .	-0.9162
It is our duty to win .	-0.8235
We must love and support each other .	-1.1238
We have nothing to lose except our chains . '	-1.9351
From " dream " to " megamania " : TV readers discuss bit gallery .	-3.1966
The bit gallery moves people even though it has not been built for a long time .	-3.7986
But the idea of a shopping centre at the southern end of the pedestrian zone is dividing the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .	-4.2385
Kalt lets the topic hardly one .	-4.0527
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page " Volksfreunde Bitburg " .	-3.3265
While some say to the bit gallery : " That would be a dream " ( Anja Becker ) or " That would be a real class " ( Nicole Schasten ) , comes from the other side : " Do no man " ( Siggi Betzen ) or quite simply : " Great Depression ! " ( Lars Scholz ) .	-6.6873
While supporters insist that a gallery attracts more customers , which also benefits the rest of the business , the opponents fear that the pedestrian area will be wiped out .	-7.1054
In addition , the gallery is planned precisely on the site where the farm market hall stands , where 13 direct distributors offer their products .	-5.0636
This will end when construction begins .	-3.7234
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Beda square with the possibility of sitting outside .	-4.2782
Simone Zimmer : " For many years we have been purchasing almost weekly in the farm hall .	-4.6858
Mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the women in farming are always very happy .	-4.6335
We also discovered the butchery .	-2.8748
We would like to see this offer maintained even during and especially after the construction of the gallery .	-4.2257
In other cities , that is the case .	-2.5734
Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . "	-3.0442
Gerd Densing : " Whether you are a direct trader in a market hall in the gallery comes to the height of the rent .	-5.1534
However , this should not be very low in the new project . '	-4.8450
Eva Kilic : " What shopping arcades in Bitburg ?	-1.9662
Whether clothes , shoes , chemist or supermarkets , I find this superfluous .	-4.2453
There is enough of this in our city .	-2.8673
You can see how many shops are empty - some have been empty for months and years .	-3.9366
Since there is not even a proper weekly market here , it is all the more important that at least we maintain the market hall .	-4.7001
After all , the goods offered there are fresh and mostly offered directly by the producer and are also affordable .	-4.9806
As you can see , shop shops in a shopping center are only rented by larger companies , because the rental prices there are often not sustainable for retailers .	-6.6954
Sadly , special deals are almost non-existent and what remains of them will probably disappear . '	-5.4244
Wolf Fandel : " A shopping mall with a market hall does not fit me .	-2.6262
And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg .	-1.9586
First of all , where is the farm market hall supposed to be during the construction period ?	-5.6044
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in duration , if the bit gallery actually comes at some point .	-3.6130
Or does the ghost bit gallery already manage to distribute all shops from Bitburg ? "	-4.9454
George Marquet : " This simply will not work .	-1.8114
And there is no need for a shopping center that is empty .	-3.3877
I think it would have been better to promote a real farm market rather than this gallery .	-3.1274
But for a farm market hall , thanks to the insane many - I think - unnecessary construction projects in Bitburg no longer occupy a place .	-5.7048
If the farm market hall is broken , a little culture will disappear . '	-3.8835
A fitting similarity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings ’ s DNA .	-2.1634
In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which are almost unnoticeable - hanging on cables from the ceiling .	-4.1397
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heath Dewey-Hagborg of Wang-Tubes and haircuts , which were sent to her by Chelsea Manning .	-4.0436
Manning sent the excerpts from the prison Fort Leavenworth , where the former intelligence analyst buried a 35-year-old prison sentence after being published as secret diplomatic messages about the WikiLeaks website .	-5.3898
The new exhibition , opened on August 2nd , is called A Bechomig Resemblanke .	-4.7500
It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg , whose discipline merged its expertise into technology , computer science , and art , and Manning , a translator and a groundbreaking dissident , whose condemnation was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in office .	-6.1931
Deepy-Hagborg , through the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted by Manning , created from 30 portraits of how anyone could look with these genomic data , has a sharp , though somewhat intellectual commentary not only on the malleability of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also on identity .	-6.3758
Manning , born as Bradley Edward , but has already spoken openly about identification as a woman since her puberty , was convicted in 2013 for 20 charges , including six offences against the spy law , computer fraud and theft .	-5.2136
Her image was suppressed by the prison , so much that there was only one photograph - a green , black and white Selfei , in which Manning obviously sits on a driving seat and carries a platinblonde wig - to which she was associated .	-8.0738
In 2015 , Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of their 2012-project ' Stranger Visions ' .	-3.9050
In it , the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts like cigarette dumb and chewing gum , by extracting DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people might look .	-5.4001
That was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine .	-2.2756
" They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , " said Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition .	-3.6224
And she could not be visited at this time and she could not be photographed , so you took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .	-3.9959
The artist and her imprisoned Muse became unequal friends of the letters , who exchanged several letters over two years .	-5.6279
They even created a Comic of Shoili Kanngo illustrated , " Compressed Images " , which foresaw a future in which President Chelseas would convert judgment and would be able to view the exhibition personally .	-6.7521
Indeed , just a few days after the book was published , Obama ’ s release of Mannings after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome way of meeting .	-4.0122
There is also now something low and Starkes at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Trump is waging a war against informants from the government camp and on Transgender troops to find new , tweetable ways to further dismantle the rigid divisions that he should actually repair .	-7.5576
When Deepy-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said that " things happen for a particular reason " .	-2.6988
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Manning called for her oversized signature ( the " i " in her family name is marked with a heart ) an end to " automatic fragmentation , whose basis was gender , race , sexuality , and culture " .	-4.9634
On the opposite wall , their mitochondrial DNA sequence - one thousand of Cs and probes written in pencil .	-5.3273
Deepy-Hagborg hoped to show how astonishingly similar , at least biological , we are all .	-4.1216
" What people hopefully will take with them is that our genome does not care about who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are , " said Dewey-Hagborg , whose video work of 2007 , Dashius Memories , is also to be seen .	-5.5992
" DNA data can tell so many different stories , so these 30 stories are . "	-2.5463
The last part of the exhibition , which is kept in its own room , is a page from the above-mentioned comic novel .	-4.7610
She shows how she appears with a free phone from the disciplinary boards of the United States such as King-Kong .	-5.0427
" When you cast your speech , you won " , it means .	-4.8267
" So never keep your mouth " .	-3.3127
" It came directly from a letter she wrote to me , " said the artist who greet Philadelphia .	-4.1676
" I still get some goose bumps when I talk about it . "	-3.6317
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition personally - as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if it should do it , it will be welcomed in the middle of the space by the masks , by their own genomic simulations , which merge like hordes of protesters .	-5.8714
This was also targeted , as everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 " 2 , Mannings Stater ) , where their genetic haplogforces were written with pencil .	-5.6981
" In the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , " said Dewey-Hagborg of the portraits .	-2.3958
" I wanted it to feel like a mass movement formed with Chelsea , like the movement that was also behind its liberation . "	-4.0489
Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee at Oxford for killing .	-2.7698
A nation-wide human hunt is underway by a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at the University of Oxford who are sought as suspects after a man had been killed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago .	-6.3150
On Monday , Wyndham Lathem ( 42 ) and Andrew Warren ( 56 ) issued arrest warrants for murder for their alleged involvement in the death of Trent H. James Cornell-Duraneau , as the files of Cook County ’ s court show .	-4.7981
The documents say that Cornel-Duraneau , 26 , passed away after several casts .	-2.9554
A joint warning system published by the police authority of Chicago states that the body was discovered on 27 July .	-3.4092
Officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .	-2.4030
Cornell-Duraneau was still declared dead at the place of events , and detectives investigate the charges as murder , while the police actively seek for the two suspects , said officials .	-6.7001
Lathem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007 .	-2.4667
Alan K. Cubbbage , vice president for university relations , said in an email statement that Lathem has now been detained and excluded from entering the campus of Northwestern University .	-5.2116
" This is now a criminal matter investigated by the competent authorities , and Northwestern University is cooperating in this investigation , " said Cutfather .	-5.1413
Warren is Senior Measurement Assistant at Oxford University .	-1.8952
A University spokesman and the Somerville College said in an email statement that ' we are in contact with the British police and are prepared to help the US investigating authorities in every way possible ' .	-4.7244
The statement added that Warren ’ s colleagues were shocked and wanted him to be .	-3.5584
Chief Communications Officer of the police force of Chicago , Anthony Guglielmi , said he strongly urges the suspects to stand up to the authorities .	-3.7044
" The police have an idea of their whereabouts , and our efforts to locate them are intensifying , " said Guglilmi .	-3.1179
Guglilmi said that local , regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects .	-1.9830
Guglilmi said that the police received a call from the Grand-Lamza-building building building manager who had just received a puzzling tip saying that something happened in apartment 1008 .	-7.0739
The police described the scene as very cruel .	-0.9259
Guglilmi said it was unclear whether the incident also took place on 27 July .	-2.7799
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building .	-1.8492
" We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship , " said Guglilmi .	-1.8927
The management team at Grand Plaza issued a statement to the residents : " The police are currently working on the timeline and the background of the victim and explores a variety of motives , including a possible home incident . "	-4.6315
" We will complete the WADA-timetable in the near future " - the Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko .	-3.7306
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that it will not take long to implement the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) for the restoration of the Russian anti-doping agency ( RUDA ) .	-3.4150
" At a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road map , RUSADA has been given the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD ( UK Anti-Doping ) .	-3.6363
The WADA timetable has been updated in this regard , " said Mutko on Thursday .	-2.1331
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA ’ s roadmap to respect the code describing the criteria for replacing RUSADA and published recently on the organization ’ s website .	-4.8633
According to Mutko , he has nothing to worry about Russia .	-2.4787
" Everything was announced , everything will be implemented .	-1.9778
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and the WADA in the near future , " he added .	-1.6924
However , one of the criteria mentioned in the list states that Russian anti-doping agents must publicly accept the reported results of the study approved by the WADA by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren as alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport .	-5.2449
As far as the matter is concerned , Mutko said : " We are conducting the investigation because our anti-doping system has admitted a mistake .	-4.4756
All the measures have been implemented .	-1.4801
But there were no government programs , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . '	-3.5353
Mutkos words were consistent with those of Vitaly Smirnov , the head of the independent Russian anti-doping commission .	-3.4647
In talks with the Russian port at the beginning of the day , Smirnov reported problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organisations , then added : " We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .	-5.1147
Nobody wants to unconditionally accept this report , " added Smirnov .	-3.3419
RUSADA was excluded from the implementation of checks on doping in Russia in November 2015 as a result of the doping scandal .	-4.0329
However , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping ( UKAD ) .	-2.6153
After a visit to Moscow ’ s headquarters in July WADA-Director-General Olivier Niggli explained that RUSADA is moving in the right direction to be restored .	-4.7867
Algi is no longer selling eggs for now .	-4.3477
This was shared by the company groups .	-2.8356
It was a precautionary measure that could continue to run out of any health hazard , as stated in the communication .	-6.0843
From now on only eggs will be delivered to Alsace , which have been proven to have been tested negatively on fibrous antiwelding agents .	-6.3728
Thus Aldi wanted to create clarity and transparency among its customers .	-3.9797

Amy errett wanted to measure happiness with your e-commerce setup , but the polls didn 't work .	-5.4091
Answers were often vague , unhelpful , or - even worse - fraudulent .	-2.9683
And even if you promised anonymity , some workers did not believe the process .	-2.4212
" There was simply never consistency and objectivity , " said errett , who runs the 75-breaker San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Society Madison Reed .	-4.4429
She has called people from outside for help .	-1.9758
A new breed of Human Resources startups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel .	-3.0751
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring staff management , it allows companies to conduct surveys , target specific groups and demographic groups , offer anonymity and complaints hotlines , and in some cases allows whistleblowers to bypass the C-suite managers and directly contact the Board of Directors .	-6.4825
" You now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit for tracking their health , but where is the fitbit for your company ? " said Jim Barnett , co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start Glint , whose software analysis tools are used by companies to measure commitment .	-5.7790
Curtt said that she got a better insight into what your employees think and feel Glint in the three years .	-4.1875
In addition to the Snap-surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a company heat map , showing at a glance which units have most complaints and which executives have low approval results - so that you can re-drill for why .	-7.3390
Companies come to understand that they have to stay at the top of the workplace culture , so that you do not become the next translator involved in scandals since a former employee published a blog post describing an environment of harassment in which those who have spoken were punished .	-5.9202
For start-ups like Glint , this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity .	-2.2926
Global governance , regulation , and compliance could have more than $ 118.7 billion in 2020 , according to the financial website Let 's talk payments .	-3.8252
Denver , Colorado , start-up convercent , which helps companies prevent and recognize bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year discredited in the midst of the Uber .	-4.5961
Conversion has nearly 600 clients , including Airbnb , Microsoft and Tesla .	-2.2265
Uber has recently registered as a client .	-1.6012
As Glint , Conversion allows companies to send customized " pulse " surveys , collect confidential responses in real time and view the heat types of your problem areas .	-4.0524
It also provides an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behaviour .	-3.4723
And if the chief executive is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .	-2.8999
" The court of public opinion has captured the regulators , " said Patrick Quinlan , the founder and director of Conversion .	-4.0139
When a company is found that its employees are poorly treated or unethical , it can experience costly consequences through consumer nutrition , employee turnover , and complaints , Quinlan said .	-5.7191
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations , has converted for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have a simple opportunity to reach their corporate headquarters .	-5.4890
Previously , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .	-3.7934
It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience , James Vitrano , Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel , who said there was no good way to track employee complaints .	-4.2543
Now that the company uses Conversion , problems previously hidden by executives in offices in cities or states , such as discrimination , harassment or dishonest practices , can be identified and addressed more quickly .	-5.2613
" I can get closer to this holistic 360-degree view of employment , " said Vitrano , who leads the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday .	-3.6099
" And we protect our shareholders from employment disputes . "	-3.1986
Companies began to take more seriously the ethics , values , and staff management in 2002 , after the accounting company Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations by the Enron scandal , said Quinlan .	-4.1659
But it took until the " Social Media came to their right " that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry going online .	-4.1158
" Before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , " he said .	-1.9238
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service and charge companies with recurring fees for using their products .	-4.7689
It is a business model and an opportunity that finds the agreement of Venture Capital investors , who have supported both startups .	-3.5391
Conversion received $ 10 million in funding in February from firms like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital , raising all capital to $ 47 million .	-3.5938
Glitzer secured $ 10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners , bringing his total funding to $ 60 million .	-3.2531
These investments are hardly surprising , given the interconnected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .	-3.5484
There is a growing area of research that shows that today ’ s employees expect more from their jobs than they have done so far .	-4.9550
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley , high salaries and interesting projects are only operations .	-2.7801
The staff want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .	-3.6541
" If people are happy to be in a company that is listening to their voices , and that the work you do is worthwhile , they feel more committed to making this company successful , " said Nina McQueen , Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience with LinkedIn , who uses both Conversation and Glint .	-6.0193
Investors gain returns when their portfolio companies run well , and companies run well when employees are committed and committed .	-4.7373
If third party analytical tools promise to increase commitment and commitment to employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .	-4.3825
Data on employee management according to experts in the workplace culture is important .	-4.1363
But the data is useless if the managers of a company do not take action .	-3.3291
In fact , when a company asks for your feedback , it can be expected that change is on the way .	-4.0894
And if change does not come quickly enough , or not at all , it can breed disappointments and discourage employees .	-3.9272
" If you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be prepared to have 4,000 talks , " said Russell Raath , President of Consulting at Kotter International Business Management Company , which has seen companies that rely too much on data collection .	-4.7256
" For if you don 't follow people will ask , " Have you heard me really ?	-3.9394
Are you concerned about this ?	-2.0242
And who you do not care why should I ? '	-2.4226
Madison Reed , who is now conducting monthly employee surveys , was able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported about Glint , so errett .	-3.4341
And after receiving feedback from frustrated employees , it was able to reorganize several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems .	-6.8321
At Ruby Tuesday , the company is getting new insights about its employees , and it hopes that in the long run , this will lead to a better union of workers in an industry known for high sales .	-6.5652
" If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , " said Vitrano .	-2.0706
" And if you lose people , you also lose customers .	-1.9594
And if you lose customers , you will lose companies .	-2.1195
The NCAA abolishes the two-day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins	-2.9762
It starts at 23 o 'clock when a lot of UCLA-Football players are on one side of the team 's new training fields on the campus .	-5.5153
Some have pulled out their jerseys and show their back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .	-4.6669
For a good part of the team , these idle minutes are a lunch break .	-2.3801
Players who are enrolled in summer schools will return to their final examinations after the three hours of practice before returning to the Water Football Center next morning at 6 : .	-6.0268
" This is a real Tretymill for the guys next three days , " said Bruins-Trainer Jim Mora just before Monday became Tuesday .	-4.9624
The NCAA eliminates two day exercises to ease the load of the player and has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .	-4.3686
Therefore , the first three training sessions of the UCLA should start at 19 : 15 in order to meet the player ’ s already-completed schedule .	-6.5380
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins postponed the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mora 's six days in Westwood practical exercises .	-5.2261
They are expected to undergo 18 exercises during the course of August , 20 before formal preparations for their start at Texas A & M in September .	-6.3003
Mora said that he supported the NCAA rule change , even if they add another point to the player ’ s multiple routes .	-5.6649
" We put this enormous burden on them three or four days , and it is very challenging , " said Mora .	-2.4445
" And they have simply pushed it through , they are still spinning , they are great people .	-4.3049
I think that as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will really be great ' .	-3.6114
The UCLA will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished , which , given the clear lines of its fields , will not be an easy task , given the adjacent parking space and the adjacent Luskin Center , a hotel of high class that has already been advertised with footballs , which will be a protective net behind a torpfel .	-8.7829
Bruins-Smakers should occupy the hotel this weekend , but Mora acknowledged that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .	-5.1607
" We will use our security , " said Mora .	-2.6930
" This is a real problem , and it is not far-fetched to think that the people there hire a room and then prepare to draw up an exercise .	-4.7522
If you have the video tape of an exercise , it is a pretty good business .	-3.2570
But we have security forces there and we have security forces at parking 8 .	-2.3942
We will do the best we can with what we have .	-2.2806
I am not so worried about that .	-3.4585
We have a plan . '	-1.1801
Facebook wants to intensify Tatsache scrutiny in the fight against fake news .	-4.2658
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with fake news to third parties and then show their results under the original post , said the world 's largest online social network on Thursday , one of its efforts to combat so-called fake news .	-5.3563
The company said in an opinion on its website that it will begin to use updated machine learning methods to identify potential false notifications and to send them to factor-testers who may see results from the original article .	-6.8712
Facebook was criticized as one of the main sources of so-called fake news , many of which believe that they also influenced the 2016 US presidential election .	-3.8305
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with French voters inundated with false stories in the run-up to the May presidential election , and Germany supports a plan to punish social media networks if they cannot quickly eliminate hateful posts , as they did before the elections there in September . the , , and , will , , and , , will , , , , , , and , and , , , , , ,	-9.1431
On Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new Fact-Review will be launched in the US , France , the Netherlands , and Germany .	-3.8898
" In addition to the knowledge which stories are being challenged by third-party parties , people want more context to make informed choices about what they read and share , " said Sara Su , product manager for Facebook news in a blog .	-4.9315
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature of the " related article " and work on other changes to its news feed to reduce false messages .	-3.4004
Creation of a comic novel : A castle in the history of England	-1.9530
In his recent past , the little Scotney Castle was seen in a Squeeze-Music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970-er and 1980-years .	-5.1816
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history of his cosy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes , a former gallican man with a taste for historical documents .	-6.0897
" I think it is so beautiful to look at the manuscript of someone who has been dead for 300 years , " he says good-bye .	-4.2008
" What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hands . "	-2.3344
'A Castle in England ' spans the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in ney Scots.Every story was illustrated by another emerging British artist - Isaac Leniewicz , Briony May Smith , William Exley , Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg .	-4.9620
It is not the first book of Rhodes , based on an archive : he wrote 2014 ' Dead Men 's Teth and Other Stories ' , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he unexpectedly found emotional .	-3.4636
" I have only responded to the downward pressure on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700-year who worked for the Jacobins , " he says .	-4.2893
" This is his thumb pressure !	-3.0399
And letters always smell into smoke , because at that time you burned a fire because of the light .	-4.3153
For someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he were there .	-3.9885
Oh , I love archives ! "	-1.0694
For someone who is so struck with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council of England and lived in a castle almost four months ( " To be honest , I have my welcome grub a little overrated " ) , this seems all too beautiful to be true .	-5.7590
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian " new " castle , passing through the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle , such as the embattled Hyères on the walls and the bottles that had been in the ditch for centuries .	-5.9359
He travelled through the area and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape guards , gardeners and sometimes also with the artists working in the illustrations of his book .	-5.2286
Then , at night he drank " Whiskey and began to write " .	-2.0397
The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown , as the National Trust was only given full access in 2006 when the last heir , Elizabeth Huskey , died .	-4.7032
When Rhodes met a decade later , employees began to look after the archive he described as " hundreds of years in which aristocrats said " Oh , it is on the attic " .	-5.1777
diaries , letters from the period of English Empire , maps that represent who had what : " One could think that land conflicts would be boring " , says Rhodes , " but there was a birch to fight the two families .	-5.1812
boys , let everything go its way ! "	-3.0657
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive into English history on a wider basis , including ' The Labourer ' , following a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the farmlift of 1381 .	-5.6108
" There is a recording of a rebellion that took place in the castle in 1380 , in this book entitled " Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex " , says Rhodes .	-4.9782
" The peasant rebellion began in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start .	-2.6902
Perhaps the two are linked ? '	-2.3762
Other stories are deeply rooted in the history of the castle - such as ' The Priest ' , which tells the story of the Jesuit preacher who , for seven years , the Darrell family hid during the English Reformation .	-5.3604
Or ' The Smuggler ' , which depicts the contraband Arthur Darrell from the 18th century who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coffin was uncovered ) .	-5.2724
The Darrells are the Rhodes ' favorite family of Scotney : " Men seemed to be pretty Gauner , repeatedly making debt and spending money on things they could not afford .	-4.6646
Other generations of Darrell men resolved their debt crises by killing wealthy old women - I imagine them as a pile of well-meaning boys , with a talent to advertise peas . "	-5.7528
After the end of his tenure in the castle , Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences .	-4.3764
He spent two weeks in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Eläbelmäki , the site of a sanctuary dating back to the early 20th century , which has been called back by nature since then .	-7.7787
But Scotney has a special place for him .	-2.1192
" I was sad to go again , " he says .	-0.9634
It was like : " Oh , now I have to deal with the damn life " .	-3.8091
Campaign started : Over 300 years old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf hidden .	-4.2459
With the covering of the 301 year-old Marienkapelle in Rheöndorf , Bad Honnef launched its campaign to introduce a new roof brand ( 24th of Thursday ) on Friday .	-5.4438
Until Thursday , Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and the slogan secret .	-2.7739
At the end of August there should be a festival on the island of GrafenWerth as the highlight of the campaign .	-3.6320
" Very nice for us .	-2.0187
Or ? " , ask the macher of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rhöndorf Chapel .	-4.1311
" We don 't really think this ( of course ! ) , " write it on their website , which was opened yesterday .	-4.6480
" But we use this measure to gain your attention .	-1.4599
And to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .	-2.1985
In fact , we firmly believe that as a bath Honnefer , we know the beauty and attractiveness of our city . "	-5.4275
The action is about more than " just " a logo and a slogan , it continues .	-4.0036
" It is necessary to formulate a single promise , one that gives the city a distinctive unique selling feature . "	-6.0148
After all , they compete with other communities .	-2.7188
The city of Bad Honnef can cost a middle five-digit amount its new roof brand and campaign .	-5.0283
Military reforms in Turkey - Erdo<unk>an ’ s Fear of the Army	-1.8686
Every year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( YAAS ) advises in Ankara on retirement and promotion in the Official Corps .	-4.6934
That is also the case this week .	-2.6111
At first glance a normal operation .	-1.7939
But nothing routine with the Turkish armed forces is a year after the coup attempt .	-3.1255
The sitting was no longer held in the general council building , as before , but in the Prime Minister 's office .	-4.0442
Under the Presidency of the Heads of Government , the five Deputy Prime Ministers , as well as the ministers for defence , home affairs , justice and external affairs , have also participated in the discussions .	-6.7672
The number of civilians in the former Yugoslavia was higher .	-4.5778
The government is taking the reins in the military .	-2.4510
The Chief of Staff of Hulusi Akar remains in office , but the commanders of the army , the airforce , and the Navy were deposed .	-5.1599
Since the failed coup , Erdo<unk>an has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals .	-2.3410
More than 10,000 troops were removed from the army 's ranks - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the exile reporter Fethullah Gülen , whom Erdogan sees as the mastermaster of the coup attempt .	-6.4134
There have been negotiations on 486 people directly involved in the coup attempt since this week in Ankara .	-4.1623
On the day after the coup , Erdo<unk>an had called the crash attempt a " God-gift " because he gave him the opportunity to " clean the armed forces completely " .	-6.0510
But has Erdogan really got the army under control ?	-1.7729
At the end of February , the newspaper " Hürriyet " published an article entitled " Calm im Military Headquarters " .	-3.4875
In general , there are concerns about the increasing " Islamicisation " of the army , which manifest itself , among other things , in the lifting of the headscarf ban on soldaters , wrote the newspaper .	-5.2324
In any case , large-scale cleansing of the army and the security forces continues .	-4.5589
By decree in mid-July , Erdo<unk>an had another 7395 public servant , including 2303 police officers and 546 soldiers .	-4.2871
It seemed that Erdogan tamed the military .	-2.9973
They used to be the real masters of the country .	-2.6079
Three times , they acted as guards of the secular authorities , calling for their .	-4.8067
Following its election victory in 2002 , Erdogan pushed the military power back step by step , not least by invoking the European Union ’ s reform guidelines .	-4.9181
Former officers say that Erdogan is deliberately pushing for the Islamicisation of the armed forces .	-2.9078
In the magazine " Vocal Europe " , a name unnamed officer who , after the coup attempt , was afraid of persecution abroad asylum , the Turkish army was looking for " full extremists and Salafi " in a few years ' time .	-5.9574
If that were the case , such a development would not leave NATO cold .	-3.6696
At any rate , there are doubts about the Turkish army 's readiness for deployment following the cleansing .	-4.6485
Leaders and operational capabilities are " weakened , " say NATO diplomats .	-2.6951
Washington changes the Green Card rules	-2.0716
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the Green Card rules , said President Donald Trump , quoted by the media .	-2.1772
It proposes reducing legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stricter rules for obtaining visas for temporary work permits and restrictions on family-oriented visas .	-4.4191
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the president .	-1.8827
The bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .	-1.6871
" This law will reduce poverty , raise wages , save billions of dollars for taxpayers , and will do so by changing the way in which Green Cards are issued to citizens from other countries . "	-3.7975
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .	-1.7017
This new application project will benefit the candidates who speak English who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , " said Trump , quoted by the American media .	-4.4630
Staff were very friendly and helpful .	-4.4514
Over the past few months , the racing steed staff had been working on the future .	-8.4622
Until the end of the year , it is planned to be built at the ramshacks of the tourist railway .	-7.4023
In order to secure the future of the Rennsteige crew , according to the Ministry of Transport , construction will begin this year .	-7.0157
" With the decision to continue to order and repair the route Ilmenau-Rennes , the country has committed itself to this link , which is particularly important for tourism , " declared Minister of Transport Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt .	-7.3967
He put the costs of repairing the track at around EUR 2.5 million .	-2.9114
Of that sum , the country holds 75 % .	-2.9202
The treaty on which the shuttle is to be ordered by the country in future will be finally voted , expil declared .	-5.8065
The Ministry and the Südthüringen Railway as operator are already agreed on the technical details .	-3.9939
" Thus the road map , the vehicles used and the quality standards negotiated " , said Sühl .	-3.5963
The planned contract between the Ministry and the Railway Company will be closed for a period of eleven years .	-3.4994
The race run shuttle should be ordered regularily on December 2017 .	-4.2029
The route shuttle is a popular rail link between Ilmenau and Rennsteig by tourists .	-5.7642
Over the past few months , a pilot operation has tested whether the track is used by many people to order it again in the future .	-6.2940
The track is also unusual in parts .	-3.7404
The rise of sex robots is real and we should be concerned about it .	-2.3048
Just when you thought that it can ’ t be even more crazy in 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots comes to light .	-6.0132
Yes , in fact .	-1.3321
Sex-robots are now a big thing .	-3.3504
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics ( FRA ) recently published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years .	-2.6915
According to Noel Sharkey , emerging professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR , we must begin to take their rise seriously .	-3.7429
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the chest and the type of fingernail .	-3.1579
" People are making fun about them , but businesses are doing a lot of it , and we will see them even more frequently , " said Mr Sharkey when he published his new report .	-5.5892
Modern sex pups have evolved from their inflatable partners into robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence .	-3.5439
The user can also " adapt " his robot according to his convictions , choosing everything from the eye color of the robot to the shape of the chest warts to the type or color of his fingernails .	-4.7980
But it will be even more disturbing , as many robots have the " personalities " that would make a step-forward woman look progressive .	-5.0990
Modern sex pups have become robots with a silicone skin .	-2.1167
For example , the RealBotix robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find attractive , such as timidity .	-5.2830
And then there is the Roxxx Gold Sex-Robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as " Frigid Farrah " , which gives the impression of chastity and " Wild Wendy " with a " adventurous " personality .	-6.4929
" Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is perfectly adapted to your personality " , darkens the website of True Companion .	-4.9681
So she likes what you like , and she doesn ’ t like what you don ’ t like , etc .	-3.4816
In the course of the day , it also has its moods - just like real people !	-5.3392
It can be tired of being fixed to conversation or it can be " in mood " !	-2.9419
There are many worrying aspects of this rise of sex fighters - not least because they are replacing genuine human relationships - but the inferior female qualities , allusions to rape when one moves to Frigid ( that is , odious ) Farrah , worry one most .	-7.3598
On his website True Companion Roxxx compared with a vibrator but for men .	-3.7606
" If women ( sic ) can have a vibrator , why can men not have Roxxxy ? " is it on the site .	-8.3664
However , these sex robots are not just a fetish or just a different toy .	-5.0127
Their origin and their increasing refinement point to something of the dark and the lower in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition .	-5.5778
Most men will of course not keep sex robots , and while the FRR keeps up its growing popularity , they will remain on the margins of consumer culture for the time being .	-6.1738
But what seeps out from the periphery may be very instructive with regard to the spirit of the time we live in .	-3.6751
And many people are not strange or offensive until the free market gives them permission to do so .	-2.5365
There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots will emerge at a time when women ’ s rights are under threat worldwide , where there is a president in the White House who has dreamed of having sexually assaulted women .	-6.5442
The most important aspect of the TV-series ' The Handmaid 's Tale ' ( ' The Report of the Magd ' ) is not the graphic images , the curved bodies and the faded eyes , but how realistic this vision looks .	-6.1207
The Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap .	-2.9338
The aim behind these sex robots is to produce a physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as possible ( albeit with porn proportions ) .	-4.7510
Their builders want them to feel human , to imitate the movement of a real body .	-2.2881
But , when it comes to their " personalities " , the robots are not real women .	-3.3345
They cannot be separated from their pet or simply leave .	-3.7398
They have no mediation or background history , nothing that indicates independence or anything that could disrupt the imagination of total subjugation .	-4.4572
In other words , they are devout slaves .	-2.1001

Trump ’ s Great Performance ?	-1.8323
It makes Mitt Romney the embodiment of common sense .	-2.0709
It has become the Trump era ’ s binary wisdom that the political divisions that have polarised the US electorate have also divided small size families .	-4.1913
Around Christmas and Harvest , there were plenty of advice in the US about how to deal with the horror of Trump ’ s favorite relatives .	-4.0329
We are all supposed to be tough to drop our filter bubbles .	-4.0940
Less noticed has been Trump ’ s power to bring families together .	-2.0352
I mention this because my cousin , a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with Republicans in our family , visited me this week in New York .	-3.6563
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .	-1.7921
With Trump in the White House , anyone she knows , including the Republican kin , with whom she fought for decades for politics , is suddenly and very strange on the same side .	-4.6720
It is certainly a good thing about the dining table , but it is in another context that I note that this also carries significant risks .	-6.3529
The left has been strengthened by Trump , but the looming effect of his presidency has the power to shift us all to the right .	-3.7818
When we talk of ' Normalization ' and Trump , we refer to the appalling possibility that one day his boosters will no longer discredit us .	-5.6049
But there is an even more terrifying long-term scenario in which Trump normalizes right-wing Republicans , who suddenly seem to be an embodiment of rationality compared to its standards .	-5.0703
Today I find myself caught by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney ’ s original version of the car roof – the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew what his tax statement was about ) – both of which are in fact a very mild crime compared to Trump .	-7.3155
If Trump goes , the next Republican candidate must be spiritual only to qualify for immeasurable improvement .	-3.4764
When my cousin was in the city , we brought our children to the Central Park carousel , the largest of the New York City 's Karemma , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don 't need a caffeine .	-5.6959
The horses are huge , the Fiberglash designs on the central cylinder - all the clowns are crispy and the animals are dispersed to watch their own shoulders with fear - extremely dark and the music that makes them strange .	-7.2305
As many clichés of a city disappoint : the views of high buildings become old , the Skylines become too familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city does not live up to the dream .	-4.4436
Fifty years later , and I am still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is in fact not a Swiss Cottage - the theme award Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a large roundabout in North London .	-5.7789
However , Central Park-Scarllell is still a strange magical experience , as there are two two-year , 11-year-old , and two women in the 40-year years who have a great time .	-8.1653
If I could have evaluated the carousel , I would have given it the full number of points , but fortunately nobody asked for it .	-4.0582
On the other hand , this week in a department store , I was forced to evaluate my " experience " with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could get through my credit card .	-3.9041
In the cafe on the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to apply the evaluation with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the shop table .	-5.0678
This not only results in a slowdown in what should actually be a neutral exchange , but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality to a situation where no need is .	-5.5934
The poor woman at the department store was exclamating , while I was tired of learning to get my credit card with five stars .	-5.1740
Oscar Pistorius , with breast pain , moved from prison to hospital .	-2.9658
For the second time , Pistorius has left the prison for a visit to hospital .	-2.6133
Last year , he was brought to hospital for the treatment of cuts at his wrists , which he , according to the prison authorities , suffered after one case in his cell .	-5.7213
Pistorius was convicted against a first death judgment for murder by prosecutors .	-4.2739
He killed Stefenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine 's Day 2013 by shooting them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria .	-5.3304
Pistorius claimed that he considered his girlfriend to be a nocturnal invaders who hid in the cabin .	-5.0847
The prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six-year prison sentence of Pistorius , from which they say that it is too lenient .	-4.3994
The National Law Enforcement Office said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the appeal could be heard this year .	-3.9014
Pistorius risks increasing his sentence to 15 years if prosecutors are successful .	-3.0966
There is no death penalty in South Africa .	-0.7778
When Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg	-1.7265
As the last of the Blumberger schools , the Viertlässler were released out of tipps and Eppenhofen in the holidays and in secondary schools .	-7.2384
Three of those carrying out the discharge are going to go to school in the future , four to the secondary school .	-6.9228
On Tuesday evening , head of the school , Angelika Sitte welcomed parents and representatives of the public at the Bientaal in Epfenhofen .	-5.1491
As a symbol of the school release , the 29 students of the four classes , led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder , chose a young eagle who grows up in the chicken yard but is then released into freedom .	-5.6212
In addition , the cheerfully Schar performed a musical called " Der Adler im Pohhof auf " .	-5.0856
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg , leaving it out of his chickens .	-2.8407
Instead of a chicken chicken , a small eagle came out .	-3.4194
But hope to make him a chicken broke away , the eagle spread his wings on a high mountain and decanted .	-5.1990
After that , the classes showed a chicken dance three and four in the recording of Yvonne Frank .	-4.1243
The chicks danced with the young smile that wore cylinders to bet .	-4.4633
The eagle stands for integration , said head of school , Angelika Sitte .	-2.8633
The kitten is different from the other kittens .	-3.9537
But he will never be like a chicken .	-2.7431
His provision is to be free .	-2.1921
She wanted every four-year-old boy to feel accepted in his new school .	-4.4303
Following this , I would like to thank my fellow Members , the former head of school Michael Müller , who constantly jumps to school shortages and the parents .	-6.8621
The chick time is over now , explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher .	-3.2997
She only leaves her students very reluctant after two years of teaching , because it was a really great time .	-5.2333
Finally , they have been able to rely on the four-legged friend .	-4.9284
Finally , all students performed a song of summer time and holiday time .	-3.4860
The children enjoyed it .	-3.6153
Eight first men are already registered for the new school year .	-4.0757
Two Bulgarians were arrested in Greece for illegal camping .	-2.8337
Two Bulgarians were imprisoned for illegal campings in Greece , with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted on television .	-3.7704
On the morning of 1 August , a group of illegally staying people was arrested in Sithonia by the police , including the two Bulgarians .	-3.5836
On the same day , they were released while an inquiry is under way .	-3.4162
The Foreign Ministry reported bTV that the Bulgarians were released later .	-2.0275
The Greek authorities have tightened up control of free campings and impose considerable fines on anyone who is found to remain in a place that is not intended for this purpose .	-6.1560
The controls will continue throughout the season .	-2.2021
The ministry said that the court could impose a fine .	-2.3639
Software Update for Diesel Vehicles : What those affected need to know now .	-2.8944
How exactly does the software update take place ?	-1.5349
Do diesel drivers need to take part in the action ?	-2.7163
The most important questions and answers to the overview .	-2.6579
At the Diesel Summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the Volkswagen Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars .	-3.1985
They are intended to improve the exhaust behaviour of cars in the emission classes of Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 .	-4.5788
Euro 4 diesel or worse are excluded .	-1.7913
Anja Smetanin of the ACE Auto Club Europa gives opinions :	-4.4145
Is the new action mandatory ?	-1.4220
No , the negotiated software updates are voluntary .	-1.2586
" The mandatory updates previously only apply to the vehicles that have software for the shooting " , says Anja Smetanin .	-5.4886
Their retrofitting was arranged by the lorry Federal Office ( KBA ) .	-5.4955
How and when will customers be informed about updates ?	-2.0940
Producers have announced that they will be implemented quickly over the next few months , but they have not yet stated a precise date .	-5.2458
Daimler has announced that it must notify each party concerned .	-4.4272
If an inspection is due anyway , that will be done within its framework .	-3.0338
How long should the overall upgrade be ?	-2.7091
'Hard to say ' says Smetanin .	-2.5616
This depends on manufacturers ' commitment and on political pressure .	-3.1586
" For we have seen that car manufacturers have not yet acted voluntarily on the environment . "	-4.7174
How long should the update take ?	-1.2564
The conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .	-3.2694
It can be more time-consuming to get an appointment .	-3.5410
What are drivers who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the Volkswagen Group ?	-2.6076
The ACE teaches you to wait .	-2.7148
It is probable that foreign producers would follow suit , says Smetanin .	-3.9818
Will a massive price drop in Euro 4 cars now be threatened ?	-3.7655
The ACE fear that .	-1.9699
But it is precisely in the regions where there are risks of banning travel .	-4.9260
In rural areas , there has been no loss of value for older diesel .	-3.4496
The ACE instructs you to wait for a sale .	-3.7476
LL Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award	-2.3848
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington .	-1.3916
The first prize under President Trump promises to be political .	-2.5730
One of the winners does not want to come - out of protest .	-2.3558
LL Cool J ( 49 ) gets one of the coveted awards of the renowned Kennedy Center in Rapp .	-4.4104
As the cultural establishment announced on Thursday , singer Gloria Estefan ( 59 ) , Lionel Richie ( 68 ) and Carmen de Lavellade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Lear ( 95 ) are among the singers .	-4.9389
The awards are awarded at the beginning of December .	-6.2231
Traditionally , US President Donald Trump will host a reception and attend the ceremony together with his wife , Melania .	-3.2877
The winner of the prestigious Lear with progressive TV series has therefore already announced that they will not participate in the Gala .	-5.9659
He said to the New York Times : ' This presidency has decided to completely disregard the arts and human rights - even to deprive them of the resources - and that burdens me ' .	-5.7631
The 59-year-old Estefan stressed that she will use the conversation with Trump to make her point of view .	-3.6226
The Kennedy Center , named after former president John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital .	-1.9083
Meryl Streep , Aretha Franklin , Robert De Niro , George Lucas , Tom Hanks and Sting were among the former laureates .	-4.0023
We make the City worth Life	-3.1403
Roland Wacker , Haslach ’ s city builder , will retire next year .	-3.4223
The place is already advertised - suitable candidates are , however , rare .	-3.0506
For 31 years Wacker has been a city builder .	-2.8045
And the work still gives him great fun as he communicates in the press .	-4.8199
He reports varied , but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor .	-3.3478
At the same time , he is surprised that no application so far meets the requirement profile .	-3.7793
The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the next possible time .	-3.6559
This means that , in accordance with the regular periods of notice , there is still enough time for processing .	-6.6782
Since Haslach acts as a sub building law authority for the administrative community , the Applicant has to provide the relevant accounts .	-6.9028
This function certainly wants to keep the city .	-2.9119
If they can no longer fill them , the citizens would have to go to the meeting until the city of Offenburg .	-6.4957
But proximity to the city and to the city itself is important , says Wacker , who reports of a good business climate and good mood between government and citizens .	-6.6024
In more than 30 years in office , some important projects have accumulated , which Wacker has a proud look back on .	-6.4276
" We make the city worth living , " he is assured about the construction office and his staff .	-4.6916
In the future , however , varied projects will also be on the agenda : the transformation of the former Huklan realm and the Niederhofenparkplatz are about to be initiated .	-7.2675
The Kinzigbrücke between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed , and the stadium reconstruction is still a topic .	-3.8276
The latter alone will cost around EUR 1.5 million , ' if we do ' , Wacker estimates .	-8.8543
" All in all , great tasks await my successor .	-2.9761
The work here is fun . "	-1.9594
The design is there for a lot of space for a city builder .	-5.4420
With Haslach ’ s own building yard and garden garden , a lot of flexibility can be handled .	-6.9579
" You can move a lot " , says Wacker , and the design of the green areas is often mentioned by citizens and visitors .	-5.6650
As the old town is classified as an ensemble , it is important to have " an eye for what fits in " when new buildings are approved , the departing town builder emphasizes .	-6.1423
At any rate , the city builder has a high responsibility .	-3.7486
He is the owner , " at the end everything runs through my table " .	-4.3275
He can count on many years of consulting and coordination : Markus Neumaier ( construction ) has been there for ten years , Manfred Schöner ( mining ) has been in charge for 15 years .	-6.8699
Also , that his successor remains long , Wacker hopes : " We are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stick with the job " .	-5.9914
For continuity is important not only for a good business climate , but also for the further development of the city .	-3.9728
According to information from the town of Haslach , Roland Wacker should be able to offer architecture as a graduate engineer or Bachelor of Professional Studies , and have good technical knowledge in the areas of building law and construction .	-8.3616
The Municipal Building Office is responsible for building and building planning , basic employment , management of city properties , Municipal office with building and town garden , as well as for building and building rights , including monument protection .	-11.8543
Bicycles thrown on wires : Southern carriageway closed .	-4.7429
According to the police , the unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway track in the Ledel Street ( B116 ) to the lines .	-5.7291
They were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .	-3.2906
Investigators are two male males and have been looking for them since night hours .	-4.9670
A rose-tinted scooter and bicycle scooter were observed near the location .	-4.9824
" This goes well beyond a Lausanne crowd , " said Christoph Pocsch to APA .	-6.3272
The person or the perpetrator would have put himself at great risk and also put rail transport at risk .	-4.8562
In addition to the damage to the train and the facility , the minutes of delay and the cost of rail replacement transport , the railway customers could also reach the perpetrators .	-7.9456
Overall , the speaker said that a ' substantial ' sum should be expected .	-3.8248
The damage had been rectified on Friday afternoon , and rail traffic on the southern railway route could not be sustained without disabilities .	-7.4887
Nearly ten passenger trains were on Friday morning , two of them concerned long-distance transport .	-4.1618
freight trains did not fall , but they were late .	-2.4559
According to <unk>BB-spokesman Christoph Posch , around 200 meters of overhead lines had to be replaced .	-5.2175
Isolators and masts were also damaged .	-2.2527
Red meat , dairy products , and chocolate could help to relieve IBD ( inflammatory intestinal disease )	-3.8689
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system .	-2.0501
But a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet rich in meat based proteins and dairy products could ease the symptoms of patients with inflammatory intestinal diseases .	-3.0188
The incurable state , which affects around 1.3 million in the United States and 300,000 in the United Kingdom , causes stomach contractions and vesicles , recurring or bloody diarrhoea , weight loss and extreme fatigue .	-5.0695
While those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan helps develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine .	-3.8535
The senior researcher , Dr. Marco Colonna , stated that immunocells in the intestine are patrolling to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in the food do not penetrate the body .	-5.4873
Cells capable of triggering inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue .	-4.1033
If the balance tends too far towards inflammation , it may result in inflammatory intestinal disease .	-4.9789
In experiments , it was found that a form of tolerance supported immune cell occurs in mice , which carry a certain bacterium in their bowles .	-5.9698
And the bacterium requires tryptophan - a building block of proteins - to cause the cell 's appearance .	-3.8263
Professor Colonna said : " We have established a link between a type of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal antibiotic , and the development of a population of cells promoting tolerance .	-6.1161
The more Tryptophan had the mice in their diet , the more they had from these immune cells " .	-2.3889
He proposed that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promote tolerant , less inflammatory intestinal milieus , if the same system also applies to humans .	-6.0192
The Postdoctoral Dr Luisa Cervantes carefully examined a kind of immuncell that encourages tolerance when she found that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which was separate , had not .	-6.7262
They believed that the difference was with the microbial intestinal phenomenon of the mice - the community of bacteria , viruses and fungi that usually live in the gastrointestinal tract .	-4.6514
The weaves of the mice were DNA sequenced and six types of bacteria were found in mice with immune cells , but without them missing from mice .	-5.6699
Supporters were raised in a sterile environment , so that they lacked a microvirus and did not develop this kind of immune cells , and they received the L. reuteri and immune cells .	-6.7878
In order to understand how the bacteria were operating on the immune system , researchers made L. reuteri grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated by mice .	-6.5476
Immunity cells evolved into the tolerant cells that feed them . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-3.7985
When the active component from the liquid was cleaned , it proved to be a by-product of the Tryptophan-Metabolism known as Indol-3 lactic acid .	-3.7898
If researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of the mice , the number of such cells increased by about 50 % , but if the ooptophan levels were halved , the number of cells fell by half .	-4.6381
Dr. Cervantes declared that people have the same tolerant cells as mice , and that most of us L. reuodite in our gastrointestinal tract .	-11.0747
It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in humans with inflammatory disease .	-5.0427
She said : " The development of these cells is probably something we would like to promote , as these cells are directed at inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine .	-4.3323
Potentially high ripptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri may lead to an expansion of this population . "	-4.4897
Jose Mousrinho believes that Manchester United has committed a ' genius ' with Nemanja Matic .	-2.5742
At Manchester United , Matic signed a " genius " with Nemanja , Jose Mousrinho believes after the middle field player had his debut on Wednesday evening against Samorrhia .	-4.4111
Chelsea ’ s 40 million pound signature began with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid begins on Tuesday , striking in the holding role when people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marched as they like .	-5.2519
However , Matic was excluded from the blues ’ s preparatory tour and managed only 45 minutes , which Mourinho admitted that he had to improve before the start of Premier League season .	-5.2692
" He needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football " , said Mourinho .	-2.2000
" We will help him to be ready sooner than later . "	-2.0787
In addition to Matic , Victor Lindelof and Romelau Lukku started at the Aviva-Staion , when Mourinho formed his start XI for the start of the season .	-5.9655
The Independent revealed this week that Mousrinho had three further commitments , but he insisted that the club had already done a " fantastic work " to fulfill three of his four priority commitments .	-4.8602
" To get three of four , for which I thank the association , " he added .	-3.1059
" I will be happier if they get four out of four for me , but they have taken a lot of trouble . "	-4.6763
Boeing " Der Dreamliner in the Sky	-3.5358
Boeing , the US aircraft manufacturer , has painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner in the .	-2.9031
The pilots flew from Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington , but the drawing began in Marquette in U.S. State Michigan and moved in the form of a Dreamliner over the US , which is several thousand kilometers .	-4.6820
The action lasted 18 hours and one minute .	-2.1538
On the radar screens was the form of a Dreamliner .	-2.8123
This was an endurance test for new engines .	-2.7793
Boeing had already made such advertising earlier .	-2.8779
So the number " 787 " and the Boeing logo was painted into the sky .	-3.0733
New scandal for Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem .	-2.8591
As the wind turns out , when Sigmar Gabriel was a SPD leader , socialist prime minister always looked to Berlin with some concern before the elections .	-5.1519
If there is no disturbance from the party center , just no headwinds from the federal government , then the main desire of the fighters was .	-8.2819
Since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has changed fundamentally .	-2.0017
Since then , the staff from the Willy-Brandt-Haus have been watching with growing horror the events in the province ’ s province , which is ruled by the SPD .	-7.1507
What Schulz got from there since the beginning of the year would not have been described with headwinds .	-3.6673

After the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal Gazette sees a general signal against coalitions of the SPD and the Greens .	-4.4508
" This shows once again : Rot-Grün simply cannot run reliably " , said CDU-Secretary-General Peter Tauber at the editorial agency Germany ( RND ) .	-5.1013
Prime Minister Stephan Weil ’ s government has plunged Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .	-5.8057
Five months before the election , his red-green coalition lost its single-vote majority to the CDU and FDP opposition .	-2.4921
The Green Federal Managing Director Michael Kellner has asked Elde Tweest to return his mandate to the breakaway Lower Green MEP .	-6.9807
The opposition to the CDU means a clear distortion of the will to vote .	-4.3833
Elke Tweest must return her mandate immediately , " said the Federal Trade Manager and campaign leader of the Greens to the German editorial network ( RND ) .	-5.4424
" All this must not be true " , says a Socialist electoral opponent , when the new message of the crash reaches the party headquarters on Friday morning .	-8.6998
Stephan Weil , the Socialist Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , is here after the Green MEP Elke Tweest took over to the CDU without his own majority in government .	-6.9806
It is the provisional culmination of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD national associations .	-4.0414

It was then - and it was all made much worse .	-5.3712
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the Taumeln , which Düsseldorf-Präsident smoothly reversed the party .	-5.7434
In the weeks after that , the comrades were painstakingly raphing up again .	-5.4734
Then , when they had just taken on new courage , the G20 summit in Hamburg came .	-3.5742
And with him came the next shot .	-1.5244
Mayor Olaf Scholz , the last strong Socialist leader , lost his Nimbus at that weekend because he sat in the Elbphilharmonie while his city burned .	-4.9918
And because , in crisis communication , he made almost everything wrong that can be done wrong .	-5.2207
Since then , Scholz has fought for his political survival .	-1.3531
Now , then , is Stephan Weil .	-3.2830
The German Prime Minister has been critical for some time because of the Volkswagen affair and his role in the Supervisory Board .	-5.9277
No poll numbers were added .	-2.8405
Nevertheless , or perhaps precisely for that reason , because in the past few weeks , it has been increasingly trying to put the accent on the board .	-7.7312
The ambition of the former Mayor of Hanover to develop his power in Berlin was also unknown to comrades in the surroundings of Martin Schulz .	-5.8547
They granted him because they promised a stabilization of the party by virtue .	-3.3028
Now the exact opposite could happen .	-2.3956
Because , in fact , the Greens are not at fault with the party-political clash .	-5.8860
Schulz is not .	-2.2479
For the time being , the comrades are trying to keep their own ranks closed .	-3.4102
Their anger is directed at the Greens , and here , in particular , on the breakaway Member of Parliament , Tweest .	-5.6350
" It is intolerable and detrimental to democracy , as Mrs Tweest puts her own career interests above everyone else 's interests , " says Matthias Miersch , head of the party 's left in the SPD federal parliamentary group , the editorial network Germany ( RND ) .	-6.9597
Mrs Tweest was elected to Parliament not because of her person as a direct candidate , but through the list of Green people in Lower Saxony , according to the Lower Saxony MEP .	-8.1863
The logical consequence would be to give them back their mandate .	-2.8333
Thomas Opperman , head of the SPD parliamentary group , complains of a " undemocratic manoeuvre " .	-3.8987
" The popular will four years ago was clear : People made Stephan Weil the Prime Minister , " said Oppermann , who led the German Social Democrats as the leading candidate for the federal election , the RND .	-6.3622
" Now the personal career of a future CDU member distorts the election result , " said Oppermann .	-4.6064
He called for the background to be clarified .	-2.6053
I want to know whether there has been more or there have been further assurances from the CDU in Lower Saxony .	-3.4785
Aid to the Middle Ages III	-4.0389
Those who wish to renew their house over the years can soon get support from the country .	-5.7759
Albert Schindler and three representatives of the city on Wednesday in the rich city .	-4.9199
At the beginning of the information event , Schindler once again gave a review of what happened .	-3.9425
From 1991 there were in Alarms recovery areas .	-6.5693
At that time , in the recovery area I from 1991 to 2004 , the country of Baden-Wuerttemberg acquired another two-thirds of the total funding .	-5.0387
In the II recovery area from 2005 to 2016 , the grant still stands at 60 % .	-3.6371
For Schindler the renovations so far are a " success project " - it is also important to promote internal development and not only to open up new construction areas .	-5.8790
On April 4 , the President of the Government of Karlsruhe received information that there will be a sanitation area III .	-4.7105
The total funding came to 833 333 euros , of which 500 000 euros came from the land , the rest of the community of the rich .	-4.4663
What is the origin of a regeneration area ? , , etc or , , , and , , , etc , , and , , and . ,	-8.3868
One will continue to study , as Schindler pointed out , where the " really old " houses are .	-4.9690
But it also has a role to play if there is any interest in repairing the area in question .	-5.9252
If necessary , the territorial borders could then be shifted again .	-3.6443
STEC represented on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel .	-2.3466
Keller presented the contents of the Bund-Land program " Social City " , in which the renovations would then be carried out .	-6.4172
The core of the programme is the revitalization of inner cities , improving living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding infrastructure .	-4.9030
The measures would be based on object , i.e. per land .	-4.6317
The regeneration area would then be defined as the Statute .	-4.2653
The funding period has been under way since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026 .	-3.2320
However , until September of this year , we shall have to take stock of the situation in which the participants in the recovery area receive a questionnaire for filling out .	-8.1986
In November or December , the decision to adopt the Statute is to be adopted so that the renovations can begin next year .	-6.6747
Pietzschmann then explained that each municipality must carry out the aforementioned preliminary investigation .	-3.8717
It is a question of assessing the shortcomings in urban construction and deciding when to be renovated and to what extent .	-5.6667
A reconstruction statement will be added to the property description .	-6.0243
Pietzschmann himself will come again to the prayers of the people and make an image of the situation , promised them .	-5.5166
Gotzel emphasized that a key success factor for the project was the participation of the participants .	-4.1652
There will therefore be questionnaires that will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be completed by the end of the summer holidays .	-4.4670
The yellow questionnaire is the " statement of buildings and property " , which deals with building conditions and recovery plans .	-5.7106
In the grey questionnaire , the " budgetary and housing sheet " , information can be given on the size , distribution and residents of a living room .	-5.5300
The blue " arc " is only used if the premises are operated .	-4.8830
Please note that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding .	-4.6775
Moreover , new construction measures are not eligible .	-2.8453
Schindler also stressed that the distribution of funding according to the " WindhoundPrincip " works - who comes first , first serve .	-5.9194
You can 't reserve funds for later on .	-4.9752
In conclusion , photos of the " Altstadt II " project were presented to make the present a " palatable " refurbishment .	-7.5985
British inventors set themselves a micro-chip for moving home and car .	-4.1217
A British inventor is the first in the country equipped with a microchip to open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a single swipe .	-5.2327
Northam , 33 , had implanted the tiny chip between thumb and pointer and now offers the service to companies and individuals who want to make their lives easier with technology by his company BioTeq .	-5.4483
He has joined Dr. Geoff Watson , a consultant consultant consultant consultant at Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester , Hants , to ensure that the implant is performed according to medical standards .	-4.6413
The technology resembles a cat and dog implanted microchip and lasts only 30 seconds .	-2.2159
The Northam company would also like to change the castles on houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip , all for an additional charge of <unk> 300 per castle .	-4.7185
The married father of one has now installed both at home and at his BMW Z4 technology , which starts when his hand is at the wheel .	-3.8084
White House advertising costs cost the taxpayer thousands	-1.9886
The White House ’ s decision to fly a naval helicopter to South Lawn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month will cost taxpayers up to $ 24,000 , according to the military ’ s statements to the TIM magazine .	-5.2600
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on 17 July in the White House with American construction programs .	-3.9453
President Donald Trump , Vice President Mike Pence , and senior White House officials made a tour through products from all 50 countries .	-3.5857
In addition to a Maine Yacht , a Wisconsin fire brigade and a Mississippi fork truck , the Lockheed Helicopters are available in Connecticut .	-10.7169
The White House Military Office required the presence of the helicopter in a questionable order or FROAGO , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on South Lawn , according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One ( HX-1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .	-5.6458
" I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , " wrote the commander of the HMI 1 on the eve of the event his superior , the deputy naval commander for aviation .	-4.8977
The news showed that the helicopter arrived at South Lawn at 3 o 'clock on 17 July and stayed until the pitch was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 this evening .	-5.4243
The note adds that if the departure from the White House was to be delayed , a second team would be needed to return by restricting the hours of service .	-5.4493
The original crew was at the helicopter during the event , while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the period .	-5.0820
The TIM did not clearly indicate whether a second flight crew was required .	-4.8300
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes .	-2.5287
Data sets indicate that HX-1 asked whether the event could violate the provision .	-5.1048
" One question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case , " the commander wrote .	-3.7427
" Kling , as if you were closed , " the Deputy Commander replied .	-4.5132
The " Made in America " event was called by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act .	-2.9128
But official events also have political overtones .	-0.9916
At the event , the President promoted the reform of the health reform that was underway in the Senate , and he promoted efforts to curb the rules of government .	-6.1846
The use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One is hardly a new phenomenon for politically advantageous purposes .	-3.0014
Presidents are obliged to use them for the journey .	-2.4056
But asking for their use only for a photo surgical is unusual .	-4.3024
Trump conducted an investigation in February , when the presidential plane ran a taxi service in Melbourne , Florida , against the backdrop of his first campaign rally in Melbourne , Florida , and his Twitter account is full of news complaining about the presidential aircraft ’ s use by his predecessor .	-5.5739
" The White House is thrilled by the " Made in America " show , which shows products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials , " said the assistant secretary of the White House , Lindsay Walters .	-4.7709
HX-1 crews often carry out training flights in the area around Washington and South Lawn to sell the US president in the White House with specific millimetre rates .	-6.4671
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , in the White House , he conducted 58 exercises .	-4.6563
The flight for the " Made in America " event counted during the training requirement of the flight crew for the month , a civil servant said .	-4.0521
Helicopter units additionally flew 11 hours this day for non-presidential support missions .	-2.3207
The White House said that taxpayers took over the burden of none of the other requirements presented at the event .	-2.9509
A spokesman of Sikorsky said that the company was not involved in broadcasting the helicopter at South Lawn .	-3.3775
HX-1 does not have a budget record for presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .	-4.5777
According to weekly tariffs of the US Defense Ministry for the financial year 2017 , the VH-3D DoD refund rate is $ 24.380 per flight hour .	-5.1718
In the United States Army , Air Facility was the first aircraft to operate in the United States .	-10.1805
The White House argues that the actual costs of operating the helicopter are far below this rate .	-2.7131
'Putting the cost to taxpayers on the basis of estimates for reimbursement is highly misleading , ' said Walters .	-4.2674
" These estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds . "	-3.3071
According to a RAND study carried out in 2015 , the DoD refunds do not include personnel costs , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and contract conclusion .	-5.1216
At that time , the former White House press spokesman , Sean Spicer , defended the helicopter for the event .	-3.3915
" The idea is to present things that are produced in America this week , " said Spicer .	-2.5164
" And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of their contribution to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not thousands , are dependent on it .	-3.2701
And I think that , like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicopters and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly .	-2.5707
It is , of course , appropriate to stress this ' .	-2.7671
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter when he took his tour of South Lawn for the event , but he placed himself in the driver seat of a fire brigade car .	-5.4948
In the White House , Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and talked to the media about his own fleet of company products .	-2.9150
" I know Sikorsky very well , " the President said , " I have three of them . "	-2.4097

The TC Blue-Weiss Neuss will join the Table Third Suchsdorfer SV from 11 a.m. in Kiel tomorrow .	-6.8216

Team leader Marius Zay certainly has respect for his opponent .	-3.8877

However , he should be present in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandehe , Niels Lootsma ( both Netherlands ) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina .	-5.1462
After his two victories last Sunday against the club at the Alster , Máré Valdkuz could also join the team again .	-5.9389
It is not enough for the 18-year-olds of Hungary , who were the number one junior world ranking in January 2016 , someone from the trainee town around Marius Zay fills up the cadres .	-7.3155
How America Can Protect OMV	-1.4374
Donald Trump really did not work when he signed Wednesday night ’ s signature of the law to tighten sanctions against Russia .	-4.3831
" In his haste to pass the law , " the congress has packed a few " unconstitutional rules " , he examined .	-5.0384
The response from Moscow was as strong as expected , and even Brussels was ashamed of the US advance .	-3.7998
After all , the proposal provides for punishing European companies that help Russians to build gas pipelines into the EU .	-3.3852
Since then , investors have been alarmed by the OMV , which , together with other European companies , has co-funded the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea pipeline Nord Stream 2 .	-6.3411
The threat scenario is huge .	-2.5214
Nevertheless , it is too early for an assessment of the consequences , so the oil company ’ s official statement .	-4.6744
Indeed , Donald Trump himself would have to bring the sanctions to life by means of an executive order .	-3.9090
Twelve weapons stand for his election .	-2.7735
" The press " looked at which the group could defend and which could really hurt it .	-4.5593
Narcos Squadron 3 Trailer : Without Pablo Escobar the Cali Cartel will be placed in the hit series of Netflix .	-3.3610
Despite the second season of Narcos revealed Pablo Escobar Killer , the series of Netflix is far from over .	-3.2549
The relay three and four have already been confirmed by the streaming service , the first received their first trailer and showed the latest bad guys of the show .	-3.9721
With the third season , the DEA drew attention to the richest organization of the world 's drug trade : the Cali-Kartell .	-4.3000
Led by four powerful godfathers , they operate " like a Fortune 500 company " only with more government bribes and violent actions .	-3.4905
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela ( Damian Alcazar ) is the leader of the cartel , Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , Pacho Herrera ( Alberto Ammann ) commands the Mexican connection , and Chepe Santacruz Londono ( Pepe Rapazote ) is located in New York .	-4.0419

Roll backwards : The city introduces 46 kitchen aids .	-3.2299
The city is once again organizing the Kita lunch table .	-3.7520
With permanent contact partners for the children and an assignment to the team .	-3.3262
The clock is turned back in the city ’ s nurseries .	-3.1778
On September 1 , the city of Krefeld takes over the food supply in the urban children 's day facilities ( Kitas ) again at its own .	-6.6728
That is good news for Sonja Pommeranz , Deputy Director at the Department of Youth Aid , ' We were all very pleased ' .	-5.1845
If you want to cook outside the house , a caterer will take over this task and deliver freshly cooled pots .	-7.7512
The city operates in the Krefeld area 46 nurseries , in 44 the children receive a warm meal at midday .	-5.0631
At the last Kitaja-access point were 2800 children at the tables , and the need is growing steadily .	-6.6055
" In the meantime , not only children who are cared for 45 hours a week eat at the Kita for lunch " , says Pommeranz .	-6.3406
" The offer also applies in the 35-hour care if children stay until 14 : 00 . "	-5.6057
As of September 1 , 46 part-time workers have kitchen service : heat the meals that are served , complement the salad , raw food and fruit , cook the meal individually , give away food , rinse and purify the kitchen .	-10.3432
" The employees are definitely associated with a Kita " , says Pommeranz .	-4.9174
The size - there are two groups as well as seven groups - determines the amount of time spent .	-4.4828
" The kitchen teachers now belong to the Kita team " says Pommeranz satisfied .	-4.2732
" So they are much more involved and it is easier to implement educational concepts for the kit " .	-4.2378
This is also about healthy nutrition and cooking lessons .	-3.5223
" The children should help prepare meals " .	-3.1983
The direct connection of the kitchen power to the team makes sense .	-3.1571
Also for children .	-1.9887
" They have a known force in the Kita , a person who is familiar to them , and not constantly changing people " .	-2.7548
This continuity is important for children .	-1.6912
The cleaning of the kita rooms - up to now also the task of the kitchen staff - will be done by special cleaning staff .	-5.2176
In addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen performance , this variant - the separation of cleaning and service - also has the charm that it has proven to be the most economical for the city in terms of cost between its own government and foreign assignment , in other words from the press office .	-8.9274
And that , although 46 part-time workers are re-employed .	-4.2577
" But these hours are not so much in weight for some 750 people in the education sector , " says Sonja Pommeranz .	-5.5186
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN	-2.3439
Elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .	-2.2596
Nicholas Haysom , President-in-Office of the United Nations mission , said that hundreds of women will stand in the provinces in Council elections ; three women stand for the role of Vice-President and more than 30 % of newly registered voters .	-3.9671

Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate fully and are involved in all parts of the electoral process .	-2.7817
Afghan elections for the provincial council and presidential elections will take place on 5 April .	-1.8659
The Taliban have issued threats to an electoral process that coincides with the transition from international combat to a consultative role .	-3.2992
This year , for the first time , the elections will peacefully be handed over to power by a democratically elected government .	-2.8222
Hayek said that a strong role for women will strengthen Afghanistan ’ s democratic success .	-2.6416
The Afghan independent electoral commission reports that 1.2 million women are registered by a total of 3.6 million voters .	-2.0189

Men trying to shoot 13-year-old girls	-2.2944
Two young men aged 19 and 23 are expected to have tried on Thursday to rob a 13-year-old girl .	-4.1357
According to information from the police , the men used the 13-year-old who was with friends at the Kolpingstra<unk>e to speak at 14.55 pm because they wanted to make phone calls with the girl 's mobile phone .	-7.5770
The 13-year-old refused the request and went on with her friends .	-3.3159
After that , one of the perpetrators tried to use the cell phone and the necklace of the girl , which was a mistake .	-7.3349
Without prey , the duo fled .	-1.8326

GMB concern about investment in the McVitie factory in Glasgow	-2.8400
A trade union would like to ensure that managers of the sponge manufacturer McVitie have a long-term commitment to production at their plant in Glasgow .	-4.8085
GMB Scotland said that the company had fallen over the future of investment at the Tolcross-Standt .	-5.1232
More than 500 employees work in the plant , producing not only Hobochs and Rich Tea biscuits , but also other products .	-5.0122
McVities ’ owner Pladis said he has invested more than <unk> 5 million in recent years .	-3.3768
He added that workers and trade union representatives would be " first experienced " if their activities changed .	-3.3755
In a letter to the subsidiary subsidiary of the company , GMB Scotland McVitie asked ' to express concern that funding for the modernisation of production lines is not being pushed forward ' .	-6.4156
GMB-senior organizer Drew Duffy said : " The fact that we cannot gain clarity from the General Suite Manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of rabies cross affects our members deeply .	-4.7331
Generations of families have worked here , and the workforce has focused heavily on the local community and the Glasgow region , an important pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social deprivation .	-4.4361
Therefore , from the point of view of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the backdrop of Brexit , rising living costs and chronic production decline , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a thriving production presence in McVitie .	-5.4220
A spokesperson of Pladis said : " The Filialleiter on Tolcross received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday , and the company will react directly to it , as we appreciate the constant commitment of employees and trade union representatives .	-6.9700
Two months ago , we had a regular meeting with staff and GMB representatives at Tolcross , where some questions were discussed openly .	-4.3457
We discussed with our employees that , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , we are constantly reviewing our businesses - and this applies to all our business areas and sites - in order to remain competitive .	-5.8499
She added : " In recent years we have invested more than <unk> 5 million in our toll cross location , especially in production lines and operational improvements .	-3.7296
We fully recognise the heritage of Tolcross as a production facility , and if our operations change at the site , employees and trade union representatives will be the first to know this . '	-6.3616
Did the PSE Barcelona warned against Neyts three years ago ?	-4.1820
The site of La League may regret its interest in Marco Verratti .	-2.0606
Paris Saint-Germain will not relax in its persecution of Neyts after submitting an offer of <unk> 189 million to trigger its release clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago before the World Record ?	-5.8859
The sensational approach fueled the summer transfer window , because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record for more than double the previous brand , with Paul Pogba returning for GBP 89 million to Manchester United last season .	-4.3647
At the end of the day , Neyts will become the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athlete in the world .	-5.8463
Barcelona is furious about the way in which Nemar has forced his way outside , although a source near the Catalan Board of Directors insists that the club has always done its best to take care of it since its arrival in Santos in 2013 .	-6.0780
But was the football world warned three years ago by the PSG president of this prospect ?	-2.7185
When Manchester City declared an interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014 , Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strong warning for any club that wanted to sign one of the best players from PSG .	-4.7345
" I am not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players , then we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact their players , " said Al-Khelaifi .	-3.3813
" We respect all clubs .	-0.7365
But if they try to sign one of our players , that will have consequences . '	-3.6221
Barcelona seems to have exceeded this line , with the Spanish association expressing interest in the PSG midfielder Marco Verratti at the beginning of this summer .	-4.1768
PSD made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for the Neyts .	-5.7429

Material damage was caused by the car .	-3.8183
The driver of the car in front of us , a Mercedes Benz , had overtaken a lorry and continued his journey without dealing with the road accident .	-4.8226
It may be good , according to the accident accident accident accident accident accident accident accident accident accident accident accident accident accident accident accident accident accident accident accident accident accident accident accident accident accident accident accident accident accident accident accident accident accident accident accident accident accident accident accident accident accident accident accident accident accident accident accident accident accident accident accident accident accident accident accident accident accident accident accident accident accident accident .	-6.0605

Interview : " Domspain report relieves Papst brother Georg Ratzinger "	-4.2259
The Regensburg Domspain report on the cases of abuse relieves Papst Brother Georg Ratzinger .	-4.9813
This is what author and historian Michael Hesemann says .	-2.8696
The final report on the abuse scandal in the Regensburg Domspatz continues to hold discussions .	-3.9274
Christian Weisscher , Speaker of the Reform Movement " We are Church " , declared after publication to the German Press Agency , he expects the former Regensburg Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , as well as the Cathedral Master Georg Ratzinger , the 93-year-old brother of the emerged Pope Benedict XVI . , an apology .	-5.7679
It would greatly serve the prestige of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger were to express their deep regret at their own omissions or at the time of their misassessment of what happened .	-5.5918
On the other hand , the Vatican Chief Osservatore Romano criticised the fact that , in reporting violence on the Domspatz , a double standard is being applied .	-8.1436
As far as the interventions in Regensburg are concerned , no one doubts that it is a ' shameful and shameful act ' that would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; however , if the ' degree of verbal manipulation ' , the author Lucetta Scaraffia , the historian and member of the national bioethics committee .	-7.3782
" The habit of calling the Catholic Church a source of all ills is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to consider it normal " , says Scaraffia .	-4.4348
Also Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis said in the interview with the Bayerischer Rundfunk : " You 'll get away with the church and that 's a late arrival " .	-7.9699
She also pointed out that in her youth ' hit a very normal education ' was to be done with naughty children , as I was .	-6.5829
It would be unfair to apply today ’ s standards to previous decades , because the world has changed .	-3.0603
In connection with the reports of abuse cases , papst brother Georg Ratzinger also often appeared .	-4.6300
Quite wrongly , author and historian Michael Hesemann , who translates the book " My brother of the Pope " ( written in 12 languages ) with Ratzinger .	-4.3923
" I have to protect Georg Ratzinger , " says Hesemann , " because all this had nothing to do with him " , he assesses the results of the final report .	-4.0153
What exactly is the 440-page report presented by Ulrich Weber , who was commissioned by the diocese of Regensburg with the Enlightenment lawyer ?	-4.0993
In total 547 Regensburg Domspatten were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s " with great plausibility " victims of attacks , 67 Domspatten .	-4.9279
The final report states Georg Ratzinger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : " In short , it is possible to note that Domkapellmeister R. in many cases used physical and psychological violence .	-6.3929
Especially with high emotionality , punishment could also be tougher for students .	-3.5252
Despite this , contrary to many other accused , many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and , in many cases , even combine positive memories with him , despite violence .	-6.7593
In the interview , Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal in the Regensburg Domspatz Georg Ratzinger agrees to relieve him .	-8.0321
Mr Hesemann , the 440-page report on the " incidents of violent practice on protected relics in Regensburg 's Domspatz " gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger .	-6.7435
On the one hand , many students express their " humanity " .	-2.9333
On the other hand , he also appears as a cholera and perfectionist , who has often been experienced when Domsputz musically did not bring top performance .	-8.4754
How do you consider his biographer to be this final report ?	-3.3964
Michael Hesemann : If you take the trouble to read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is there .	-6.6378
He has just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly free of any suspicion of complicity or cooperation in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .	-4.6143
The excessive violence at the pre-school also occurred outside its sphere of influence .	-3.8358
At best , he can be accused of learning this too late or having not taken the first suggestion seriously enough .	-6.1189
The high school of Domspzengyium , on which he worked , was perceived by virtually all respondents as " redemption " , " sky " and " better world " .	-7.1494
Thus , the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger also perform a very excellent record , described him as " warm " , " popular " , " sincere " , " competent " and " sympathetic " , as an extremely good-tired teacher who regularly provided the boys with cakes , biscuits and sweets and " always wrapped up by children 's grapes " .	-8.4331
Only a minority complain about his perfectionism and his high emotionality , which has led to the breaking of the system .	-6.7552
Not only did he hit the floor with chairs and threw the key ring on the floor , but he also raised ear grinded and too naughty boys at his hair or ears , he himself admitted years ago , deeply regretted and apologised for it .	-9.8383
To his credit , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the time in question , the 1960s and 1970s , with parents as well as teachers .	-5.3653
Do you know such breeding methods ?	-3.0161
Of course , I think of all of us who were born before 1968 .	-2.6723
I have also seen this in a secular school , a state school .	-3.8918
Compared to what this report is actually about , namely the appalling sexual abuse and excessive violence at pre-school , that is , of course , trivial .	-5.4397
One wonders whether it is not more associated with his popularity and his role than brother of Benedict XVI .	-5.7085
After all , many who have never understood him are still diligently working on the Pope .	-5.0287
The truth , however , is that the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect .	-4.2480
In the media , a great deal has been said about abuse in the case of . , , and , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-5.2629
Is Georg Ratzinger also charged with any involvement in the final report with regard to sexual abuse ?	-3.9259
Michael Hegemony : No clearly .	-4.3774
Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claims to have entrusted themselves to the Domkapellmeister . , , , , , , , , , , , , and . ,	-4.8050
Not even the parents were introduced .	-1.8746
" I have never dared to talk about it with my father or my mother , " said an injured on behalf of the others , " It was all very embarrassing to me .	-5.7862
The real problem in educating sexual abuse has been , and is , that most victims are silent of shame .	-4.9557
If they do not even trust parents and siblings , it is certainly not a leader who would have been a member of the perpetrator in his professional life .	-7.4956
How do the Domspatung pupil Ratzingers assess their role in cases of abuse ?	-5.9260
Michael Hesemann : As a student put it , " concerning sexual abuse ... I see no case in which he ( Georg Ratzinger ) would have had evidence in time and could have stopped the person responsible .	-8.0892
I think it is really absurd to think that he has opened himself ... more urgently and more clearly or more clearly , than with her parents , internals , teachers of trust etc .	-9.9816
That one talks with him about sex ... - unthinkable " .	-3.2803
The report thus comes to the very clear conclusion : ' The fact that the students and / or their surroundings entrusted to him in advance could not be confirmed within the framework of the study ' .	-6.4031
So , as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg Ratzinger is free of any co-knowledge .	-3.6258
In this way , he cannot be accused of not having prevented him or brought him to display .	-6.0373
There is therefore no reason to link his good name to these vile crimes , as has unfortunately happened in some cases .	-3.5732
In the media there was much to read about " excessive violence " in the Regensburg Cathedral .	-4.7618
Georg Ratzinger , former manager of the Domkapellmeister , is accused of ' Weglook ' in the report .	-6.1290
Does he have to live with this reproach ?	-1.9659
Michael Hesemann : This is the big problem that everything in the coverage has been mixed up and separated into a huge mélange of sexual abuse and excessive violence and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg Ratzinger .	-5.6759
But that is precisely what this report is once again being misused .	-4.6862
There is a clear distinction here : between the preschool and the gymnasium of Domspatten , between sexual abuse and excessive violence and , let us say , other accusations .	-6.3505
The report also deals with incidents from the time since 1945 , including four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not a leader of the Domspatten .	-5.3299
The whole awful teaching of caning , the cases of veritable bullying and maligning among sadistic teachers , all occurred at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen , where truly scandalous conditions had to prevail .	-6.5602
But with them Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with , for he got the boys to face only when they were already on the Domspzengyhigh school .	-5.8493
On that , as most of the witnesses emphasize , was the subject of " pre-school " tab .	-4.7590
You were only happy to escape and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even " paradise-like states " .	-4.3228
What was different on the Domspzengymnasium ?	-4.3087
Michael Hegerson : There was discipline , but there was no sadistic violence .	-4.7277
And that also applies to Georg Ratzinger , who concluded that ' many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases , despite violence , even combine positive memories with him ' .	-5.8254
At most , the accusation of having turned a blind eye remains .	-4.4249
However , despite all the efforts , the report has only been able to define two periods of time in which it has been reported about pre-school conditions .	-5.6473
The first time in 1970 / 71 , when he started to establish himself and from the events at a school where he was not working and responsible , ( so the witness ) did not want to hear anything , and then again around 1993 .	-6.1485
Do Georg Ratzinger consistently cut his ears before the conditions ?	-4.0585
Michael Hesemann : No , for as long ago as 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of Domzhofer , which the report even reproduces .	-5.0927
He points out in this report that ' the caning sentence continues to be applied at the pre-school ' .	-6.6249
In view of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent intervention .	-3.4937
This was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed , when caning penalties were also banned in Bavaria long ago .	-5.0172
Before that , they came in a legal grey area , as everyone knows .	-3.8188
It was also difficult to assess where those affected might have been exaggerated or dramatized and where the permitted limit had really been exceeded .	-5.9627
But we cannot say that he has always turned a blind eye .	-3.6997
That is simply not true .	-1.5858
Only in 1980 did the caning in schools be officially abolished in Bavaria .	-2.9851
Princess Gloria of Thurs and taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today 's educational standards to that time .	-4.2989
How do you see that ?	-1.6604
Michael Hesemann : We historians are talking about the " symptom of Anachronism " , that is , the danger of judging past by moral standards today .	-5.9666
The Prince is right .	-3.2140
But that does not , of course , apply to sexual abuse , which was disgusting at all times , and not to what happened at the pre-school in terms of contradictions and violence on innocent children ’ s souls , which goes far beyond what was then customary .	-7.2437
That is all terrible and I am glad that it is finally being worked up .	-4.0574
But at the same time I must take Georg Ratzinger under protection , because all this had nothing to do with him .	-3.4981
His means of discipline and punishment , that is to say earrings and to draw ears and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .	-4.9668
When physical punishment was then banned , he was also strictly committed to it .	-4.2546
What image of his period of rain has Georg Ratzinger reproduced in the talks with you for the book " My brother of the Pope " ?	-3.7763
Was the subject of caning also raised in the language ?	-2.9819
Michael Hesemann : Well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , that is , Pope Benedict XVI , tells from his perspective , as the Domspatten played only a minor role .	-5.9970
Nevertheless , I am not at all unaware that he had a strict regime there .	-4.9134
But this must also be said : Without this perfectionism , without the demand for unconditional discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of global renown from the Regensburger Domspzen , which until then became more nationally known , true cultural ambassador to Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the United States ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .	-9.7402
With biscuits and candy alone , you don ’ t even make a big singer and stand before every success , whatever the field , but always discipline , passion , and self-domination .	-8.6639
As to what kind of person did you experience Georg Ratzinger in talks about her book ?	-4.2887
Michael Hesemann : Through the work on the book and beyond , I really got to know Georg Ratzinger very well and have seen him again and again as wonderful , humorous , basically friendly , deeply faithful and heartfelt people , from whom you cannot imagine that he might suffer something even if he is just a fly .	-10.0669
I regularly get to know how many former Domspatten still today , 23 years after his emergence , keep contact with him regularly , visit him , read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of their family .	-4.9050
So those who still do not forgive him for being strict with them are clearly in the minority .	-4.0573
Most of his Domspats are grateful to him today for enriching their lives and bringing them to the world of music .	-5.6901
And that he was always a good , paternal teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a lovely respected person to whom they are still standing up today and whom they worship .	-7.3217
I would like to make it quite clear once again that all the above is education methods which were on the agenda at the time .	-6.4241
We can be glad that we have overcome this time long ago .	-3.2161
But it is highly unjust to make a man just because he is prominent and has an even prominent brother to make the media scapegoat .	-4.7345
That is all too obvious the evil intention behind it .	-3.0505
Because the report , which has just been published , relieves it .	-3.2885
Now , decency , a 93-year-old man who has earned a great deal of merit and would probably not know anyone outside Bavaria and perhaps even Germany the Regensburg Cathedral .	-10.8953
