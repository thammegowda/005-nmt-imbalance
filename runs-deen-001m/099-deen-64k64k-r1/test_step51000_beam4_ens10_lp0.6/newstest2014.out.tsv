Good : More Safety for Pedestrians	-3.9508
They are not 100 metres apart : on Tuesday the new B 33 pedestrian pedestrian in the village parking lot was started in Gutach - in sight of the older town hall hall hall hall .	-7.8750
Two systems so close to each other : intention or shield action ?	-5.1955
This question was clearly answered yesterday by Gutaxis ’ s Mayor .	-4.4199
" The Rathausampel was installed at the time because it ensures the school path , " explained the corner yesterday .	-4.9224
The Kluser-lit safe both cyclists and bus drivers and mountain dwellers .	-4.1793
The plant which was officially installed in operation yesterday is important for the crossing area Sulzbachweg / Kirchstra<unk>e .	-4.6707
We have the museum , two churches , spa park , bus stop , a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area <unk> Grub <unk> .	-3.9856
" In the high traffic and pedestrian traffic volume a further traffic light had to be secured , " says Eckert .	-5.5406
This is confirmed also by Peter Arnold of the Board of Governors of Offenburg .	-4.3633
" According to current measurements , around 12 000 vehicles pass through the B 33 daily , about ten percent of which are heavy goods traffic , " underlines Arnold .	-5.2283
Therefore , building another traffic light is more than necessary : " Security is just before " , says Arnold .	-4.9699
In total , four traffic points were carried out , and a roundabout was also planned , but due to the narrowness of the road sulphbachweg / Kirchstra<unk>e .	-8.3760
According to Arnold at the location selection of the traffic light masts , everything was tested beforehand : " With an extra truck loaded for us with particularly long timber rods , we have tested whether these vehicles can drive from the Sulzbach route to the B 33 without altering the traffic light masts " .	-9.5171
The EUR 15 000 invested in traffic lights itself is the ' most modern ' that is currently on the market ' report Arnold .	-6.6010
The complex is equipped with coloured LEDs , which are so powerful that the lights are well visible from the drivers , for example in the sun standing .	-8.3496
It is also economical : the older light plants use about 100 watts , the new one just eight watts .	-4.5709
There are three light installations per driving direction .	-4.1771
Arnold explained the technique of the new system : This is equipped with two radar sensors .	-2.4315
Move the pedestrian button on the top radar sensor to test the traffic situation .	-4.2878
If the road is free , immediately green for the pedestrians , if not , it takes about 15 seconds .	-3.4273
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase can be closed for pedestrians .	-3.4350
" If a group or people with disabilities go through the road , the green phase is prolonged , so everyone is sure about the track " , explained Arnold .	-6.1477
Of course , the car driver must think as a partner here and watch the train .	-5.7273
This was not the case yesterday : hardly showed the traffic light for pedestrians green , driving a classic car through - with bright red .	-5.4875
Josef Winkler has been committed to the needs of his childhood and youth for more than 30 years .	-3.5692
The disaster of his Catholic village childness - the speechlessness , the slope to raw violence and mute victim of sexuality , the closeness and joy - has often described the poet of Carinthia .	-14.4559
The Büchner prize-winner is known primarily as ProSailer , theatre texts are rare in his work .	-5.7483
Collage from Prosatextensive Gerhard Fresacher presents for his performance " Weather lights on the tongue " , which is now visible in the garage X at the Petersborplatz , hence a collage of Prosatextensive .	-8.9513
In 1987 , the director combines elements from the autobiographical novel " Der Leibher " ( 1987 ) with Prominentiation from " corpse , his family besieged " ( 2003 ) .	-7.8841
On the stage , which is largely empty - important props : a creanna sofa , where you can hear and hear about it - the eight-headed ensemble is changing through the text material .	-11.1868
Yet director Fresacher seems to have little faith in the text .	-3.6863
The 70-minute performance exceeds the template with a wealth of cases of register , known from the repertoire of post-dramatic forms of play .	-4.8545
Above all , the actors are involved in the sometimes rather dubious attempts to implement them .	-6.3497
They are spotted hard , with their head dipped under water , spotted the wall with their evening robs .	-5.7851
Designed in Cellophan or Mieds , they are made on dangerously high fronts by staging , either tonologizing them loudly or completely silenced on the stage floor .	-7.9668
The text , however , is hardly getting involved in this intense way .	-5.8141
The best moments have the evening when sung - the bandwidth ranges from Deep Purple to popular songs .	-4.2245
Only by the end is the performance turned out to be something of calm , and Winkless 's absurd humor flashes up .	-6.7987
A black box in the car ?	-1.3262
American road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the declining highway-system , and believe that they have found the solution in a small black box that can accommodate any car in the dashboard .	-5.9107
The devices that record every kilometre of dead and report information to the authorities are at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and the federal planning offices to revise the obsolete system for funding American roads .	-5.3796
The normally rather boring area of road planning has suddenly sparked an intensive debate with coloured alliances .	-3.6937
Libertarians allied themselves with environmental groups and argue that the government can use the small boxes to record the driven kilometers – and possibly also where they were driven – and then use the information to calculate tax modest .	-6.6797
The Tea Party is appalled .	-0.8097
The American Civil Rights Association ( ACLU ) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of data protection concerns .	-2.8785
But , while Congressional action cannot be agreed , several states are no longer waiting .	-3.6447
They are currently considering how to change over the next ten years to a system where drivers pay per mile .	-6.7793
Thousands of drivers have already tested the tachographs , some of which are equipped with GPS surveillance .	-3.0780
This is really a must for our country .	-2.0925
“ It ’ s nothing we can only use , ” said Hasan Ikarhrata , Managing Director of the Southern California Ass of Governents , who plans to record miles of all California car drivers in the federal state from 2025 .	-6.9289
The way in which we pay these taxes will change .	-1.5643
The technology is there .	-1.6551
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund , financed from the taxes that American Americans pay at the pump pillar , is broke .	-3.9672
But America is no longer doing as much as it did before .	-3.3469
Cars use less fuel .	-1.9878
The government mineral oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon ( less than 4 euro cents per litre ) has not increased for 20 years .	-3.1100
Politicians do not dare to raise the tax for high fuel prices even by one cent .	-4.3006
“ The tax on petrol is simply not forward-looking , ” says Lee Munnick , an expert on transport legislation at the University of Minnesota .	-4.0759
His federal state has recently equipped 500 cars with tachographs to test a mileage payments system .	-3.5682
“ This is the most sensible long-term alternative , ” he said .	-2.1574
Bureaucrats call it a mileage based user charge .	-2.5522
Not surprisingly , the idea appeals to urban liberals , for example , the tax could be used to influence driving behavior in such a way that congestion and climate-damaging emissions are reduced .	-4.3077
The California planners are putting on the system to devise strategies to achieve the federal state ’ s ambitious , legally anchored targets for climate change .	-4.7977
But the Republican Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania , Chairman of the House Transportation Committee , has also declared that he sees it as the most viable long-term alternative . , , , and , , , , , , , , , , ,	-4.9765
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are also inspired by the idea of paying drivers based on the distance they are marked .	-7.1490
“ This is not a tax that disappears in a black hole , ” says Adrian Moore , Vice President of Policy at Reason .	-3.1327
People pay directly for what they get .	-1.2380
The movement is also supported by two former American transport ministers , who in a report in 2011 called on Congress to move toward a path of mileage calculation .	-6.0089
The US Senate approved a $ 90 million pilot project last year that would include 10,000 cars .	-3.3608
But the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the move , responding to the concerns of rural MEPs who represent people who often have to travel many miles on their way to work or to the city in everyday life .	-5.7114
Nevertheless , several states and major cities are moving in this direction on their own .	-3.9864
Most committed is Oregon , which is currently recruiting 5,000 drivers for the country ’ s largest experiment .	-4.6890
These drivers will soon pay mileage charges instead of oil taxes to the state .	-2.7974
Nevada has already completed a pilot project .	-0.8115
New York City is also considering such a thing .	-1.5986
Illinois is testing it for heavy goods vehicles .	-3.3502
And the I-95 coalition , which includes the transport ministries of 17 states on the east coast ( including Maryland , Pennsylvania , Virginia , and Florida ) , is currently investigating how to introduce the change .	-3.8827
The concept is not a universal hit .	-0.9445
In Nevada , where 50 volunteers were recently provided with equipment , drivers were skeptical that the government could pursue any of its movements .	-4.2096
“ Concerns about big bread and such things were a major problem , ” explains Alauddin Khan , Head of Strategy and Results Management in the Ministry of Transport of Nevada .	-4.8399
People did not want it .	-1.2584
When the test started , Nevada ’ s ACLU warned on its website that “ It would be relatively easy to turn the tachograph into full-fledged surveillance devices . ”	-4.1579
There is no need to build a gigantic , unwieldy technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data about the daily movements of individuals .	-3.0662
Nevada is one of a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology that allows the state to capture the miles that have passed , but not exactly when and where .	-5.4969
Thus , Khan , the public would also be more reassured .	-3.9183
Hunting for this technology has led some authorities to a small start-up company called True Milage in California .	-2.7858
The company was not initially convened to assist states in taxing car drivers .	-4.4175
Instead , it was their aim to be able to take root in an emerging market for car insurance , where drivers should pay on the basis of the driven miles .	-7.1429
But the equipment they are testing is also interesting for road planners , because they do not work with GPS and provide limited information that will be uploaded regularly via modem .	-5.5994
“ People are more willing to participate if their speed and location are not recorded , ” said Ryan Morrison , Managing Director of True Milage .	-3.0331
Some of these public pilot programmes have made major mistakes .	-3.4761
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways of implementing this .	-2.1440
In Oregon , planners are experimenting with giving motorists a range of choices .	-2.9496
You can choose a device with or without a GPS .	-1.4675
Or they do not choose a device at all and instead pay a flat rate based on the average miles flown by all the state residents .	-5.1017
Others hope to be able to sell the concept of a suspicious public by providing the devices with more functions than with the most advanced ones .	-4.7486
In New York City , civil servants want to develop a vehicle for taxation that also pays parking fees , pays insurance only for driven kilometers , and charges speed data from other vehicles in real time , enabling drivers to avoid congestion .	-7.1444
“ Drivers would be motivated to participate by the added value of the benefits offered by the system , ” it means in a city planning document .	-3.9204
Some transport planners wonder , however , whether all talk of paying per mile is not just a huge diversion .	-4.1877
In the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay , officials said that Congress could solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund simply by increasing the fuel tax .	-3.4415
An additional one-time charge , or an annual levy , could be imposed on drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume little fuel , so that they too pay a fair share .	-4.7393
“ There is no reason for an operation if an Aspirin is enough , ” says Randy Rentschler , the head of the Commission ’ s legislation and public affairs .	-4.3213
If we do that , hundreds of millions of drivers will be worried about their privacy and many other things .	-4.3790
Königsfield : Small team beats shaky	-2.9827
The volunteers worked their autumn main test despite lack of personnel with bravours .	-5.6584
Only 11 men took part in the exercise .	-1.8400
Hans Kammerer , director of the division , chose the spring in Burgberger Stra<unk>e in his practice .	-5.6900
A brief conclusion should have been established with the saw .	-5.9125
The resulting fire and smoke development injured two people , but one of them could still send an emergency call .	-4.4011
After the first examination of the facts by Hans Kammerer , two rescue officers of the resistance were prepared to enter the building .	-6.0539
After a short time , it was possible to find the first person and go outdoors .	-4.7703
The second person had to be worn .	-1.4574
This was not so easy as to overcome a narrow staircase .	-5.3806
The building , a workshop with an integrated stall for two horses , was not easy to secure .	-2.2534
It stored a lot of wood and also a straw ball in it .	-3.8404
There were also electric wood processing machines .	-2.8399
The first extinguishing attack took place over the tank in the vehicle .	-2.4540
Another line was about 100 meters away by an overman Hydrangen .	-6.7502
Three delocations have now been possible .	-2.6080
A hollow tube was also used in the building .	-3.1672
Hans Kammerer also pointed out what is to be done with little staff available .	-4.7496
In the worst case case , support is given to the Königsfeld daily operational group .	-5.8049
The commander was satisfied with the procedure .	-3.3141
Collecting Colleges and Companies	-4.0725
During his visit to the Breisgau-Highlands region , Landtag president Guido Wolf also explained in Titisee-Neustadt how the workers come from tomorrow .	-6.2390
At the Hochschwald Center , he went along with the leading school teachers of the professional schools and the district school school and the parent committee chairman on this important issue .	-8.1992
" Education is an important location factor " , Claudia stand-up , director of the Hans-Thoma school , who presented the interconnected school project Center Hochschwald .	-5.1115
Wolf was impressed by the model projects for education .	-2.9799
Since 2011 there has been a successful cooperation in the rolling city between the Förderzentrum , Kreisgymnasium and vocational school centre .	-5.1280
He also praised the family-friendly nature of the county .	-2.7682
" It is important not only to have a look at the family phase , but also because of demographic change the phase for caring for relatives , " said Wolf .	-5.4637
He also stated that more and more employees were caring for and caring for their families . , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-4.5815
" Without the support of employers , the resulting burden on employees may lead to an end to the employment relationship , " said Wolf .	-3.4800
But no one can afford to lose a skilled workforce , he said .	-2.9962
Another particularly important factor is the networking of universities and companies .	-2.6852
" For those who have already experienced the benefits of the region during his studies will often retain the knowledge and skills of the regional economy , which helps to strengthen the region , " the Landtag president was convinced .	-7.9870
Only if there were enough training places could we meet the need for skilled labour .	-4.3106
In his opinion , the location advantage of the region is its advantageous location in the south-west of Germany , close to France and Switzerland .	-3.9043
In addition , on his way from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg , he has already made efforts to expand local public transport .	-6.3319
" If you continue to stay stubborn and make public transport better , " he explained to local politicians present .	-4.5817
Experience an entertaining afternoon with Music	-2.2855
For 15 years now , the Kaul family has been inviting the Diatinger seniors to coffee , cakes and then to a vesper .	-6.3148
In the past , the elderly were brought to rest .	-3.8140
In the meantime , the care centre of St. Josef takes place this afternoon .	-5.1597
The residents enjoyed the delicious cakes and cakes .	-3.3164
Later there were sausage salad .	-2.8018
With popular melodies , Silvia Kim 's Bantu and her father Karl Kimme stayed .	-3.9522
The more than 100 years old natural stone wall as the front dividing line of the old school courtyard to the church road is to be re-installed with the restoration cost plan of the town of Krenlingen .	-7.9709
In the days before the kilometre , a small angular wall was built at the first works of the reconstruction of the front school , to stabilize and static discharge of the more than one hundred years old natural stone wall with Balustrade .	-6.4049
The next step is to include Alexander Misok from the Bränlinger Municipal Building , the National Monument Office , and to create a restoration concept for the old wall .	-9.4608
A cost calculation will then be carried out by experts , who will then be submitted to the local council to decide and determine the further course of action .	-6.5713
A decision on this will probably be taken next year .	-2.8562
After the renovation , paving and planting of the old school courtyard within the two side wings of the 1912 school , the reconstruction of the walls of the sanitation needs to be reconstructed and put on new foundations .	-9.2775
The historic , hundred years old wall of the old school courtyard to the church road is particularly affected by water and frost damage , as there is no drainage , needs restoration , and has a propensity to bow .	-8.7712
Deep cracks in individual stone are evidence of weather damage , but the wall is not currently at risk of collapse .	-5.2581
A fixed wall is a prerequisite for one of students using Schulhof , which has been achieved through the current fixing work .	-6.1397
Originally , school house remediation was planned even in 2008 / 2009 , but high unplanned expenditure caused a shift .	-4.8451
An important word in the historical school wall reconstruction , which has even been used for film shoots , will be mentioned in the National Monument Office .	-8.4711
If you have any suggestions from this site , the city hopes to receive grants from the guards of the town .	-8.1981
The students of Langlinger Primary School , who are now taught again in a well-restored old school building with new Aula , will soon be able to use the old school courtyard .	-10.3409
<unk>zdemir wants to receive jazz training in Stuttgart	-2.3234
Cem <unk>zdemir , Federal Chairman of the Greens , has now joined the ongoing discussions on the future of music colleges in Baden-Württemberg .	-4.3463
" I think it is wrong to give up the holistic training at the Stuttgart Musikhochschule , " said <unk>zdemir the " Stuttgart News " .	-4.3528
Jazz and classical are just at the Stuttgart Jazz site .	-4.3017
Thus , <unk>zdemir , who is regarded as a favorite for a direct mandate at the federal election of 22 September , contradicts the Green District Government .	-6.7275
On the basis of an expert study , this force forces one of the five music colleges in Baden-Württemberg .	-4.8901
After that , the degree of jazz and pop will be transferred from Stuttgart to the Academy of Music in Mannheim .	-6.6426
USA border : ' super tunnel ' on drug smuggling discovered	-3.1753
On the border between Mexico and the US , investigators discovered and shut down a ' super tunnel ' to drug smuggling .	-2.9899
As the US customs authorities said , the more than 500 metres long pipeline between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity , rail tracks and a ventilation system .	-3.4197
Three suspects were then arrested , eight tonnes of marijuana and nearly 150 kilograms of cocaine seized .	-2.6909
According to the indications , the tunnel has not yet been used .	-3.1305
" These cartels are stupid when they think they could dig under the radar , " said the Attorney General of the U.S. District Southern California , Laura Duffy , at a press conference in front of a storehouse in San Diego , where an end of the tunnel had been discovered .	-5.1142
On the drug gangs , Duffy asserted : " If you continue to build such tunnel and try to use it , we are determined to make it a huge waste of your dirty money " .	-4.9166
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a permanent fight against the drug cartels .	-2.4244
Since 2006 , more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug-related crime .	-1.9871
Engineered by experts	-0.7598
Because of the complex equipment of the tunnel , investigators assume that it was constructed by architects and engineers , and that construction lasted for about a year .	-4.1804
The track system was equipped with electric vehicles there .	-2.7176
On the Mexican side , access is located in a building that is 80 meters from the border . , , and is .	-5.9447
According to the authorities , a ladder leads to a depth of 20 metres to the actual tunnel entrance .	-3.9182
The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 meters in height and 90 centimeters wide .	-2.9888
It would also have been appropriate to promote illegal immigration towards the United States .	-2.8838
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine and cocaine issue .	-2.7446
The third , an Mexicans , was taken for the possession of Marihuanas .	-3.7012
All three threatened as a maximum sentence of life imprisonment , as officials said .	-3.6810
Since 2006 , eight such tunnels have been discovered , the press conference in San Diego continued .	-2.8351
But it is the first time that cocaine has been found in such a tunnel construction .	-2.7306
Normally , cocaine is smuggled in smaller quantities rather than tunnels .	-2.5614
This shows the " desperation " of drug gangs , whose traditional routes are now cut off , Bill Sherman said of the DEFA drugs flag in San Diego .	-4.6815
They would do everything to get to the US .	-2.1959
No details of the arrested were given , at least one was Mexicans .	-3.7419
They have to face up to ten years of prison sentences .	-2.8294
In 2014 , Geisinger ’ s Celebration	-2.9657
The anniversary of the town of Geisinging on the occasion of the 1250 .	-3.4242
The return of the first original mention is coming closer .	-4.0979
The year marks the end of the year in a good eight weeks .	-4.8385
The first mention of violins and church houses was made in 794 urally together .	-5.3080
A certificate was produced in churches in which both towns were mentioned .	-4.6049
On the 15th of March there will be an official start to the anniversary year , and as Geisingen currently has no hall , this event will take place in the venue , where both were mentioned for the first time in 1250 , in church houses .	-8.0092
As part of the anniversary , a number of events are planned both in violin and in church houses .	-4.0740
In July , church houses will be the 1250 , on a festive weekend from 18-20 July .	-5.9845
Repeance is celebrated .	-3.1571
On Friday with a ceremony , on Saturday and Sunday with a festival around the church hall .	-3.0947
On this festive weekend is also the church house festival .	-3.9508
The music director Rudolf Barth has written a contract composition for the city on the occasion of the anniversary , which will be performed at three dates .	-4.9941
On June 21 , together with the Sunday party of the Schwarzwald Club , on July 12 in the Arena with fireworks and on December 13 the first concert of the city music in the new Festhalle .	-5.5242
This will be completed in the anniversary year and inaugurated , the official date is on the last weekend of September , 27 and 28 .	-4.1162
A new chronicle will also be published on the occasion of the painful anniversary of the city .	-4.7723
" But a chronicle should not only be performed by violin himself , but rather a printed work on the violin of today , which consists precisely of violin , church house , Leipzig ferdingen , Aulfingen and Gutmadingen , " said Mayor Walter Hengstler .	-7.5543
And today ’ s violins celebrate 2014 ’ s birthday , and in 1974 today ’ s space was completed with the advent .	-6.8606
The new chronicle will be presented on November 21 or 22 in the new Festhalle in Geisingen .	-3.7779
2014 , however , is another year of anniversaries .	-2.6641
The Narcenunft Stroglonki begins on February 8 with a traditional summer , during its 60 years of existence , the harmony of Gutmadingen will be 90 years and will celebrate the Festbankett on March 29 , and the district music will be held on May 1 to 4 .	-9.4877
The Altenwerk Leipzig event will be 40 years old , the Geisinger school has been at the new location for 50 years and will celebrate this on May 10 , the Polyhymria Leipzig event will be 150 years old and will be celebrating it in the course of the Spring Festival from 4 to 7 July .	-7.9214
The town of Geisingen was first mentioned in an act of donation , owned by the monastery of St. Gallen , in 764 .	-4.8454
The certificate was made in churches ( houses ) , which was then court .	-3.8256
Both communities are therefore mentioned in the same certificate .	-2.7275
To celebrate this 50-year anniversary in 2014 is another 40 years back from the local council .	-6.8682
The Council is targeting track systems	-2.8284
Should the transfer of train " Am Hirschen " be made time-consuming to improve road safety ?	-4.5557
Yes , local councils have agreed .	-2.3830
We must take EUR 220 000 into account for this .	-3.2716
Next year Deutsche Bahn wants to improve the Kinzigszhalle track .	-5.7770
In particular , safety at rail crossings is to be increased - there is a regular nationwide collision of trains with other vehicles .	-6.3146
If the communities agree to the reconstruction , they have to take part in the costs by one-third , the rest share the railway and the federal government .	-7.3204
Roland Griesander , the head of the town , explained to the local council the peculiarities of the Bahover " Am Hirschen " .	-6.6788
There , the city plans to build an examination in the amount of the tunnel attendant to the west of the railway track .	-6.0529
Large vehicles , such as those transporting longwood , could also stand on return transport without having to block the track .	-5.8066
For this reason , Gri<unk>npartner proposed to construct a necessary supporting wall in such a way that the city could broaden the road that followed in due course to ensure a smooth flow of traffic .	-7.1231
This was discussed in the local council controversial because some councils questioned the need for road proliferation : Thomas Kipp , by saying , raised the mood of critics : ' Do we have to take so much money for so few cars ? '	-8.6720
Mayor Thomas Haas said : The rail transfer " Hirschen " is regularly used for the transportation of timber .	-5.4483
Even wood from the " Kuhlbach " area is transported partly through this route because up to 20 meters long vehicles could not use the route at the Häberlesbrücke because they could not turn there into the main road .	-5.5145
Moreover , the route serves as a diversion for those vehicles that cannot use the tunnel if the main road is closed , Haas argued .	-3.5488
It is clear that Kirchberg and Schlossbergtunnel should be rebuilt and reconstructed , as is currently the case in Wolfach , that the railway transfer " Am " Hirschen " could also have an important transport significance for a longer period of time .	-7.9096
The Councils agreed to have a look at the costs of the apparently expanding of the road .	-5.8712
Despite this , the majority of the reconstruction of the railway was agreed on in such a way that the necessary support wall would be built in such a way that the city could possibly extend the road to " Bahnhofstra<unk>e " to about 5.5 meters for connections .	-10.0768
On the other hand , the restructuring of the railway sector at gerchey Trautmann could pose a very different problem , which concerns access to the narrow narrow narrow narrow narrow narrow narrow narrow narrow streets .	-11.0124
The administration had asked the reconstruction plans of the train to be examined by the engineer 's office Breinglinger , as it had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhäuser Wegs was possible without further delay .	-11.1630
The investigation came to the conclusion that it was not possible to rule out that the tilt situation in the street could lead to longer vehicles sitting .	-5.9779
The city bears responsibility for this , in turn , as a street designer .	-4.7635
The reconstruction could therefore entail liability disputes .	-4.1129
Because both the logging and turning worked in the current state of expansion , one should not agree to the railway transfer , Haas argued .	-7.0604
At this point , too , the risk of a collision of turn with a vehicle on the move is significantly lower than the other rail passes because there is a good sight link right next to the center stop .	-8.1713
Even trains from the main train station would have to be slowed down to the point where there was no collision threat .	-5.6401
Most of the time , the reconstruction of this railway crossing was refused approval , because the city of Schiltach had to " take the problem with the arriving vehicles " , so the councils , since the railway could withdraw from the responsibility after the construction work was completed .	-10.1138
The assembly considers the conversions to the " Vorhausen " and " Vor Kuhlbach " railways , for which cross agreements have already been reached with the railways .	-8.8944
Esa decides on major space missions : billions of missions	-4.1908
Distortion planets , gravitational waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects that they want to launch in the next few years .	-4.2171
30 proposals were available , five are still in the race .	-2.2622
Far worlds .	-1.4502
More than 1000 planets in other stars have already found astronomers .	-2.6209
No one knows whether there is at least some of them .	-3.8320
The choice is difficult : should you search for gravitational waves ?	-4.0220
Or rather explore the origins of the cosmos ?	-2.3726
Or look for Earth-like planets , and thus discover alien life ?	-6.6332
These are the questions that are being asked by the leaders of the European Space Agency Esa .	-7.4850
For their " Cosmetic Vision " programme , they are looking for ideas for two major space projects , which are intended to make research progress .	-5.8229
The budget for such " L missions " is approximately EUR 1 billion each .	-3.2950
The start will probably be 2028 and 2034 .	-1.6841
In early September , the elite of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions .	-2.2662
30 ideas were on the table , five of which have now come into the narrow election .	-4.9633
Many bodies examine the proposals and catch up with the researchers .	-4.5138
In the next few days a final decision will be taken by the scientific programme committee .	-3.7154
In total , four major questions have been selected by the Esa , to which the missions of the 2007 " Cosmetic Vision " programme should find answers .	-4.8098
What are the conditions for the emergence of planets and lives ?	-1.6767
The exact events of the formation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus the formation of planets surrounding these stars - are still in the proverbial darkness .	-5.4174
A large infrared telescope in the All could penetrate this darkness .	-5.4862
And when a star has planets under what circumstances can life be created there ?	-3.4112
To investigate this issue , the space telescope " Chesops " is to be launched in 2017 , which will examine 500 already known planetary systems in our immediate vicinity .	-6.3611
But the possibilities are limited , Chen is a small mission with a budget of EUR 150 million .	-3.0276
With larger instruments , astronomers could map similar planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres , looking for " biomarkers " : gases that are considered an indication of biological activity .	-4.2050
How does the solar system work ?	-0.8342
This question , too , should ultimately provide information on the conditions for the emergence of life .	-4.8111
The magnetic activity of a star plays an important role and the interaction of its magnetic field as well as the particle radiation it causes with the planetary system .	-4.7332
In our solar system , these processes can be investigated in a exemplary manner .	-4.5222
With the " Solar Orbiter " , the Esa has already granted a M-class mission ( where the budget is about half a billion euros ) for this issue .	-10.3626
The probe will start in 2017 and observe the sun ’ s surface and activity closely .	-3.3266
Of great interest to the researchers are also Jupiter and its moons .	-3.1151
They want to find out what role the giant planet played in the development of the solar system .	-2.8384
The Esa is the first of the three L-missions of the Cosmetic Vision program .	-3.8982
The spacecraft " Juice " ( Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer ) starts its journey in 2022 .	-2.8625
Eight years later she is reaching Jupiter and is going to investigate the planet 's atmosphere as well as the icy moons Europe , Kallisto and Ganymed .	-4.9157
What are the basic physical laws of the universe ?	-1.2473
The universe offers many possibilities to study matter under extreme conditions and to examine whether the laws of nature we know are still valid there .	-6.0301
Perhaps deviations that could guide physics towards a new theory can also be found , under which all known laws of nature can be combined .	-6.0384
How did the universe evolve and what is it from ?	-3.6666
Our cosmos was founded by the big bang thirteen billion years ago .	-3.4967
In addition to the commonly used matter of stars , planets , and living beings as we exist , Dark Matter , whose gravity galaxies and clusters of galaxies are imploded , and Dark Energy , through which the expansion of the Universe is accelerated .	-8.2220
Up to now , researchers do not know which physical laws were valid in the first fractions of the big bang , nor do they know of Dark Matter and Dark Energy .	-5.6958
With " Euclid " , the Esa has already approved an M-mission , which is planned to start in 2020 .	-5.2276
With a special telescope , the probe is supposed to investigate the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time in the sky , allowing conclusions on the nature of Dungeons matter and Dunler energy .	-6.5709
Who Can Make the Race	-2.9885
Of the 30 proposals , only two will remain at the end of the selection process .	-1.7831
In the opinion of many experts " E-Lisa " , the best chances of getting authorisation as a L-mission has a challenging concept for showing gravitational waves .	-6.1866
This includes physicists thinking of changes in the spatial structure that Albert Einstein predicted nearly 100 years ago .	-4.9686
They have still not been dismissed .	-2.4307
Elisa could do that , hope the scientists behind the project .	-3.3995
The mission provides one out of two or three transmitters with the existing detector , which is deployed in all .	-5.1829
In contrast to plants on Earth , it could also prove gravitational waves that emerged during the big bang , providing new insights into the development of the cosmos .	-6.5811
Four further proposals are still competing for the second L mission : a large X-ray telescope called " Athena " , which is intended to explore black holes , " Icy Planets " , another mission to the outer planets of the solar system , " Prism " , a mission to measure cosmic background radiation , and the " Explanetary Finder " , which is to detect and investigate similar planets .	-5.6990
Among other things , proposals for the recycling of samples from Mars , for research into the moon , Venus and asteroids as well as for solar physics are already withdrawn .	-6.2236
Snowden is ready to “ cooperate with Germany on US surveillance . ”	-3.2179
Edward Snowden , the Whistleblowers of the US secret service , has declared that he is ready to travel to Berlin and say to the German Bundestag when the American National Security Agency and its director , Keith Alexander , do not provide answers to their activities .	-5.0357
The German MEP Hans-Christian Ströbel met Snowden on Thursday in Russia , where he received asylum to discuss with him the statement in Germany .	-4.8254
In a letter from Snowden , which was presented to the media in Berlin on Friday by Strobelah , he writes : “ Even though the result of my efforts has been shown to be positive , my government continues to treat a different opinion as a line of loyalty , trying to criminalise political expression with a threat of punishment , in which no defence is possible . ”	-8.0979
But telling the truth is not a crime .	-1.6992
In the letter , Snowden writes that he is convinced that the support of the international community can convince the American government to drop the charge .	-4.0986
The charge filed by the US Department of Justice includes espionage and theft of state ownership .	-3.3702
The German Minister for the Interior , Hans-Peter Friedrich , said online , “ If Mr Snowden is prepared to speak to German representatives , then we will find ways to do that . ”	-5.1706
US-Germany relations are strained by the claims that the NSA has listened to German Chancellor Angela Merkel ’ s mobile phone .	-2.7739
Thomas Oppermann , the deputy chairman of the parliamentary committee responsible for the secret service , said that we should seize the opportunity to listen to Snowden as a witness , if this is possible , “ without endangering it and completely destroying relations with the US . ”	-6.0300
Ströbelel , a member of the Greens , published a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed .	-3.9862
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia .	-1.4252
Ströbely explained that , according to the lawyer of former NSA staff , Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country .	-4.7503
If Snowden gave an opinion in Germany , he needed an assurance that he was “ safe ” there , says the honourable Member .	-5.1837
Snowden explains in his letter that he would face a “ serious and ongoing ” tracking campaign that drove him out of his homeland .	-3.8992
It is , however , affected by the global response to “ my act of political expression . ”	-3.2853
Citizens around the world , as well as high-level politicians – including in the United States – have described the revelations about an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance as a source of benefit to the general public .	-5.1586
In his letter , Snowden makes an offer of cooperation to the German authorities “ if the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation were resolved . ”	-4.1521
Frontier Airlines charges charges for hand baggage	-4.7869
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to USD 100 of passengers who wish to stow their hand baggage on their flight .	-4.3142
Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to $ 100 for a piece of hand baggage and $ 2 for coffee or lemonade , even if the announcement on Wednesday was to read that passengers should keep the whole can .	-4.9782
The new fee applies to hand baggage bags in the baggage compartment above the seat , small bags under the seat are still free .	-5.2274
Frontier explained that you calculate $ 25 if the fee is paid in advance , and $ 100 for travellers who only paid at the gate .	-6.1046
Fronter-speaker Kate O 'Malley said that the fee of 100 US dollars is to move travellers to pay in advance .	-5.1270
“ We do not want to calculate this sum , ” she explained .	-2.4620
In 2008 , airlines started charging for the first and second piece of baggage .	-2.8688
As a result , passengers who tried to avoid them have packed into their hand baggage as much as possible , which means that they are often crowded above the seat .	-7.1178
Charges are one way of getting passengers less on board .	-2.3503
O 'Malley said that the new fee is not really about earning money .	-1.8702
It is about the most loyal customers of Frontier , who would have made it clear that it is becoming more and more difficult to find space outside the seat .	-6.5335
Passengers who purchase your tickets on the airline website do not have to pay .	-2.6728
This means that a passenger at the gate of Frontier may take one piece of baggage for free , but the next person must pay $ 100 for a comparable piece of baggage .	-5.4967
O 'Malley explained that the Frontier website and the check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers are informed of the charge before they come to the gate .	-4.8359
Frontier ’ s new hand baggage charge will not enter into force until the summer , and there is no exact date yet .	-5.6591
Passengers often travel on baggage surcharges and other charges , but airlines are happy to resort to this .	-4.3591
They argue that transportation of baggage should cost money and passengers this service if they wish .	-4.0601
Many on Wall Street see the new baggage charges as a sign that airlines are taking enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of loss .	-3.7148
Most of them , however , leave the finger of carry-on charges .	-5.0281
Spirit Airlines Inc . demanded three years ago the first duty for hand baggage and later Allegiant Air , also a low-cost airline .	-6.0021
The only other airline with such a charge is the Hungarian Wizz Air , the airline consultant Jay Sorensen , who closely follows the additional charges .	-4.3578
In a December 2011 report , he estimated that Spirit 's hand baggage charge would bring USD 50 million per year .	-4.2211
Sorensen , who previously held a leading position at Midwest Airlines , recently flown with Spirit and was curious about what would expect him at the boarding gate if passengers were faced with the unusual hand baggage charge of the company .	-6.8175
“ The boarding process was one of the most smooth I experienced in aviation , ” he said .	-3.5998
I expected to see high-level and hands-on discussions on the platform .	-3.7797
“ The plane was full , ” he said , “ and boarding was as forged . ”	-2.7822
Frontier also follows Spirit from the 2 dollars required for coffee , tea , lemonade or juice .	-4.1978
The company explained that passengers who bought Limonade or juice should keep the whole can and receive coffee for free .	-4.6359
Water is still free .	-1.0806
US Airways recently tried to charge money for soft drinks in 2008 , but cancelled this seven months later , after passengers complained and no other large company had emigrated .	-7.2286
Frontier 's move to raise charges for hand baggage if passengers do not buy directly from the airline is the latest initiative aimed at guiding customers to their own website .	-6.2602
Airlines pay online travel agencies such as Orbitz $ 10 to $ 25 per sold ticket .	-4.1495
This provides an incentive for all companies to make a direct purchase of passengers instead of an online travel agent .	-5.3535
But Frontier has gone the most far in this area .	-3.1852
In September , the company began to award only half as many frequent flyer miles when booking via an online travel agency .	-4.0137
On Wednesday , the miles were once again reduced to 25 percent of the route .	-3.0739
For this reason , an air travel booked by a third party with Frontier takes more than 1000 miles for customers only 250 miles .	-6.4538
Passengers can also reserve seats exclusively for direct purchase on the Frontier website .	-4.7678
Frontier has a loyal customer base in Denver , but business is shrinking and the company loses money .	-2.5942
The revenue decreased by 9 percent , and the flight capacity contracted just under 13 percent in the first quarter , as indicated in the financial report published on Wednesday by the parent company , Republic Airways Holdings Inc .	-5.0503
Republic has tried to get Frontier 's finances under the sale of the company .	-4.8988
Coming from the Bible , sayings	-4.1463
A good 40 women attended the last women 's breakfast this year in the Protestant parish of Munich .	-4.7122
The theme of the day in the Town Hall were " biblical sayings " and " medieval idioms " .	-4.3732
Zita Köhler , the chairman of the church council , entered the biblical sayings after breakfast .	-3.9902
" Ancients contain principles of life , rules or warnings , " she explained .	-4.8323
She compared several sayings to the corresponding Bible and explained the meaning .	-4.4892
They called sayings like : wood Eye is vigilant , as sheds fall from the eyes , cast an eye on someone who gives His own is the Lord in sleep , washing his hands of innocence .	-6.5863
Several times the referent also advised her listeners , which adage it was .	-6.0908
The Middle Ages ’ speeches took on the Church ’ s recommendations in Christel Dehner : Good things are three , blue , and hated .	-7.0320
She explained the meaning and origin of the idioms she called ' bridges to the past ' .	-3.4570
At the end a raffle was raffle raffle .	-3.4261
The prizes were presented on a table and were humorous before being handed over to the winners .	-4.5824
Among the guests of the breakfast , Roman Waizenegger was a member of the mayor .	-6.1288
Learning , instead of unemployment : pilot projects for unskilled people in tourism	-4.0269
A pilot project for the tourism industry is launched by the Mecklenburg Lake District .	-5.2429
Under the leadership of the Federal Employment Agency , 49 women and men who are already working as unskilled workers are to be qualified for hotels and restaurants over three winter .	-4.7489
" The new thing is that the six months ' courses with degrees end , " said Carmen Wichert of the employment agency Neubrandenburg .	-4.6782
The benefits are varied : the participants would not be unemployed , the firms would receive skilled workers , who are increasingly lacking in hotels and restaurants , and the agency should not finance unemployment .	-6.4285
The project also includes the Chamber of Commerce in Neubrandenburg , as well as the German Hotel and Restaurant Association ( Deutz ) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern .	-5.4693
NSA declares that an “ internal error ” and not hackers are responsible for the crash of the website .	-3.8521
The shadowy National Security Agency said on late Friday , a mistake has crippled its public site for a few hours and not hackers , as has been claimed online .	-5.5947
“ NSA.gov was not available for a few hours this night , as an internal error occurred during a planned update , ” the spy agency explained in an email message sent .	-6.1673
The problem will be fixed this evening .	-1.8598
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed denial of service attack ( DDoS ) is not true .	-2.3941
In the early evening , online server trackers noticed that the NSA website was not accessible for at least six hours and that is still not available for some users .	-4.8633
Previously , a speaker from the NSA to ABC News said that the sensitive internal network of the authority was “ in no way ” compromised .	-3.9609
Intelligence information is not in danger , according to the speaker .	-2.6803
At least a group of hackers took on to paralyze the NSA website with a DDoS attack .	-3.7606
In such attacks , the target website is flooded with page calls until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses .	-3.3433
Cybertactic is relatively simple and attacks do not serve to penetrate the internal network of the target system .	-2.8509
The formerly super-secret NSA , whose nickname was once No Search Agency ( no such agency ) , now finds itself in the bright light of the public and is facing sharp criticism following the revelations that have become known in recent months about its extensive surveillance program at home and abroad – a result of secret NSA data stolen and published by former NSA staff , Edward Snowden , a disenchanted .	-7.9226
The growing controversy surrounding the secret services fueled initial speculation that incident today was the result of a targeted cyperoperation .	-4.4560
In October , the number of people without a job has fallen by 22 to 1,7307 .	-4.5738
Although the quota of 3.1 % was better than last year , and even better than in September , ' we would have hoped for more ' , Monika Felder-Bauer says Assistant Director of the Agency for Labor in Sonthofen .	-5.6673
Because many companies have responded to attitudes so far .	-4.5632
One reason for this is according to Felder-Bauer : " We have hardly any skilled personnel in the craft sector , in the healthcare sector and in the care of the elderly " .	-5.5985
Since September , the hotel and catering industry are continuing to provide job opportunities .	-8.9875
The winter season begins in mid-December .	-2.7618

Bombardier earnings drop following delivery figures and orders	-4.4248
On Thursday , Canadian aircraft and rail manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15 % reduction in net profit after falling orders and aircraft deliveries in the third quarter and treaty problems in the rail sector .	-5.8322
Bombardier , based in Montreal , did not publish any flight test data for its brand new CSeris aircraft and did not provide any new information on whether the aircraft could go to commercial use in accordance with the ambitious timetable of next September .	-4.8560
Only three more starts were followed by the maiden flight of the test aircraft a year and a half ago , which makes it questionable whether the test phase is proceeding as planned .	-5.2810
The results were lagging behind the forecasts and resulted in a crash of over eight percent at the Toronto Stock Exchange .	-5.6467
Cameron Doorsen , Analyst at National Bank Financial , lowered his “ outperform ” rating on Thursday to “ sector perform ” with a view to the stock having a limited price potential in the next one to two quarters .	-5.5850
“ Although weaker delivery figures were expected on aircraft as far as possible , we are clearly disappointed by the trend in the transport sector , ” Doerksen said in a customer letter .	-5.8546
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries when the aircraft testing program advances .	-3.9453
If , however , no new orders are announced in the coming months , we expect the market to become more skeptical of the program .	-3.3319
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft line can catapult the company into the lower market segment that is currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus .	-4.0563
The first test aircraft was presented to the public in March and flew for the first time after months of delays in September .	-2.9631
But , so far , binding orders for the CSeries are 177 moderate , as potential buyers would like to wait for the results of the flight tests and see whether the company ’ s claims concerning fuel efficiency and cost saving potential of the new jet transport are applicable . , , , , , , , ,	-8.1887
There are currently 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies .	-2.2099
CEO Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will achieve its goal of 300 binding orders at the start of commercial use .	-2.9077
The company management also assured analysts and media on Thursday that the programme was in the timetable .	-4.0874
“ The test airplane was no longer on the ground than expected , ” said Beaudoin at a telephone conference and added , while the aircraft ’ s standing time was scheduled for ground tests and software updates .	-5.5084
Each manufacturer is planning differently .	-2.6973
We have decided to make a first flight and then to attach a period of revision to what we have also done .	-5.1313
This is happening throughout the entire programme .	-2.8241
The second of five test aircraft is expected to start in the next few weeks , the rest shortly afterwards , it was said by the company 's side .	-7.9667
Nevertheless , analysts remain sceptical as to whether 12 months after the maiden flight the first customer can launch an aircraft of the CSeries .	-4.7341
Bombardier declared it reviewed the planning for commissioning ( EIS ) and will update them in the coming months .	-3.8216
“ The slow progress of the flight test – even if it obviously corresponds to the bombing of internal planning – reinforces our view that it will move to the first quarter of 2015 , ” said Doerksen .	-5.8579
In the third quarter , ending on September 30 , Bombardier ’ s net profit fell to $ 147 million , or $ 172 million per share , or $ 9 cents per share in the year before .	-5.0147
The adjusted profit per share is 9 cents .	-2.8303
Sales dropped slightly from 4.2 to $ 4.1 billion .	-2.5818
Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and a turnover of $ 4.56 billion , according to Thomson Reuters I / B / E / S.	-3.7768
The fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer in the world admits that it has delivered 45 aircraft this quarter , a 57 drop last year .	-4.0292
Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26 .	-0.9924
The order book in the aerospace sector was 32.9 billion dollars on 30 September , unchanged from 31 December .	-4.1260
“ In the aerospace sector , the results were as part of our specifications , but low order intake and overall market conditions were disappointing , ” said Beaudoin .	-4.6087
Sales in the aerospace sector fell 13 percent to $ 2 billion .	-3.2467
Bombardier , the world ’ s largest railway manufacturer , announced that its sales increased by almost 11 % to $ 2.1 billion .	-3.6656
The order book in the transport sector was 32.6 billion dollars on 30 September and was slightly increased on 31 December .	-4.3135
The transport profit margin has been affected by settlement problems in some major contracts .	-2.7934
According to company management , there will be new targets for the fourth quarter .	-2.8954
In the morning trading on Thursday , the Bombardier stock returned by 8.5 % and stood at 4.83 Canadian dollars , after it was announced that the Google CFO Patrick Pichette will switch to the board .	-5.6860
On Thursday , the Brazilian Embraer SA , the world ’ s third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and flaming competitor , reported a 10 % decline in quarterly earnings .	-4.3422
USA : shots at Los Angeles Airport	-2.3533

A traveler told CNN that many people had been in panic seeking protection .	-4.3919
Travellers would have acted and brought children together .	-3.7197
The waiting panic broke out , many would have been hiding behind chairs for fear .	-4.8429
He has heard two shots , says a traveler of the Los Angeles Times .	-2.4349
One member of the Security Agency TSA has suffered a shooting accident on foot .	-4.3815
The scene was " as in a film " .	-1.6177
After that , he himself was brought into a security area , the man reported .	-4.2178
The shots should be near a security control area .	-3.0159

The LAX airport of Los Angeles is one of the largest airport in the United States .	-2.8355
Koko-dependent lawyer who warned drug boss against police investigation must be in prison .	-4.4116
Basharat Ditta , 42 , gave further information on Lower World size Neil Scarborough .	-3.4698
The lawyer was afraid that his hidden drug addiction might come to light .	-2.7562
He was sentenced by Liverpool Crown Court to three years in prison .	-1.4291
A well-known criminal defender who warned a drug barons against a major police investigation because he was afraid that his secret drug addiction could be exposed was sentenced to three years in prison .	-5.7799
Bashharat Ditta , 42 , supplied underworld size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about its drug-trafficking activities after having been compromised by his own cocaine addiction .	-4.7564
The " First First " attorney , nicknamed " Bash " , was arrested in his house in 2011 after police patrols Scarborough , who he had represented in an earlier drug procedure .	-7.9319
Officials observed , such as Scarborough ( 32 ) , three bags of cocaine delivered at the house of the lawyer in Blackburn , Lancashire , while being with colleagues at a food of the bar .	-5.7231
The investigation revealed that Ditta routinely consumed Class A drugs after tests had found traces of cocaine in his hair , his wallet , and credit cards .	-2.9506
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011 , he tried to obtain unlawful information on the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners .	-3.2569
All four suspects were monitored by the police in the course of a major investigation into heroin and coca trade in Lancashire , Cumbria , Merseyside , Berkshire and West Yorkshire .	-3.9587
Together with 32 other people , they were arrested later after the police secured heroin and cocaine searches at <unk> 1.5 million and <unk> 200,000 in cash .	-5.4849
Ditta , 42 , gave information to the criminals because he feared that his drug addiction could be made public .	-2.9656
Today , Ditta , working for Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn , was found guilty and convicted at Liverpool 's Crown Court after a three-week trial in two charges of obstruction of justice .	-5.2380
In a previous survey , he agreed to cocaine ownership .	-5.0107
The lawyer was convicted after the police found out in their investigation against Scarborough that in February 2011 he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta .	-4.3679
Two investigators followed the suspect and saw how he went to Dittas ’ s house , where drugs , with a purity of 60 % , placed under the dustbin of the lawyer .	-6.2909
Shortly after he delivered the drugs , Scarborough regularly phoned with Ditta , who was at dinner at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park .	-5.5713
The lawyer returned home , took drugs and then exchanged nine messages between the two .	-3.0840
In court , it was known that Ditta was a “ regular consumer ” of cocaine after tests of class A drugs were discovered in his hair , wallet , and credit cards .	-5.1579
Ditta was arrested later , but denied using cocaine and said that he spoke to the alleged dealer because he was his client , and claimed that his discussion was subject to “ legal secrecy . ”	-6.1014
During his arrest , Didta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards , but they were secured and he was taken out of hair .	-4.7625
In the case of police questioning , he has appointed an office and clients , both in his private address and in the workplace , to call him at home for legal matters .	-6.8237
In court , it became known that he had called on important drug trafficking players , some of whom had previously been represented , after significant arrests and informed what investigators knew about them .	-6.1011
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said : “ A criminal lawyer should know better than anyone else that the law is not breaking . ”	-4.4662
Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal defender because he has joined too much with certain clients .	-4.9986
The relationship in question is not simply that of a drug dealer , but a drug dealer who supplies his lawyer with drugs .	-4.4933
Some of his communications were undoubtedly legitimate , because he was the advocate of those people .	-4.4014
But that went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between lawyer and client .	-2.5661
He acted as much as possible with the police investigation so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities .	-4.1898
Mr Didtta brought his profession into disrepute .	-3.1720
He was too close to certain clients , especially Scarborough , and allowed his independence to be compromised .	-2.3622
Ditta pointed out every wrongdoing , saying : “ If I were a corrupt lawyer , which I am not , and wanted to pass information to Scarborough , I would not wait 15 hours , but do so immediately . ”	-6.7916
But after the hearing , Superintendent Lee Halstead said from the police in Lancashire : “ Mr. Ditta took the step from a criminal defense to a criminal at the moment when he started to buy drugs from organized criminals . ”	-5.6479
His cocaine dependency resulted in a hopeless compromise and made him receptive to the motives of leading members of organised crime who nominated him with valuable information on police investigations .	-5.2161
lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure public confidence and confidence .	-2.9735
Didta betrayed this trust and tried to hide behind the facade of his profession .	-3.6349
The Serious and Organized Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigation against Ditta , which also led to a condemnation in three cases for the possession of cocaine and justice , which underlines our determination to bring criminals to justice .	-4.7919
This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that nobody can escape the law 's arm .	-3.5098
We will find you and bring you to court .	-2.3080
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after declaring himself guilty of the conspiracy as heroin , cocaine and cannabis trade .	-5.0559
Thirty-five other people involved in the drug trade were sentenced to total penalties of 153 years for drug offences .	-3.9260
On his website Didta published an area of questions and answers about himself , in which he approached his dream job as a lawyer on death row in America , his ultimate guest at dinner was Mohammed Ali and inequality of opportunity was the motivation for his work .	-5.5022
Revolutionary work of church music	-1.9412
At the end of the celebrations due to its 160-year anniversary , the volume Dunningen is surrounded by two services of worship with the " Deutsche Messe " by Franz Schubert frames .	-6.5048
After the great success of the musical " Rock my Life " , which was enthusiastic by the audience this spring , the songwriter will enrich two services at the end of the anniversary year with the performance of the German Fair by Franz Schubert .	-6.2145
On Saturday , 26 October , this extraordinary fair will be held from 19 during the evening fair at the St. Martinuskirche Dunningen and on Sunday 27 October at 10.15 pm at the Mass at the St. John Baptist Church in Lacensdorf .	-6.9223
The " Deutsche Messe " ( German Fair ) with the original title " Songs for the celebration of the sacred sacrifice of the fair " , D 872 , is a spiritual music work of the composer Franz Schubert dating back to 1826 and was almost revolutionary at the time of the creation .	-8.1540
The exhibition is performed within the framework of the services of God , as the client Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind .	-4.6874
Under the leadership of Hermann Schneider , the choir is accompanied by the band of brass groups of the music club Frohsense Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi on the organ .	-5.2697
Hashach : Populism Grows	-4.7890
In 2015 , for example , the elections to the parish church will change fundamentally in maritime care haslach ( SE ) .	-5.4782
Then there is only one common Parish Church for all six parishes .	-3.5325
On Saturday , the councils of Haslach , Hofstetten , Mühlenbach , Fischbach , Steinach and Welschenhsteinach prepared for the changes .	-3.7997
The fundamental decisions of the diocese of diocese must no longer be changed and it is up to the parish authorities to implement them as satisfactorily as possible .	-6.7408
Over the course of the day , it became particularly clear that skepticism about the new one is weakening in confidence .	-5.9532
From the ideas and expectations of the new developments in 2015 to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the parish church , the extremely constructive discussions of the six bodies with the main members of the maritime care team were drawn up .	-6.8080
On the basis of a presentation , Dr. Georg Schmitt explained the new guidelines for maritime care in the archdiocese of Freiburg .	-5.1515
In the future , the SE Haslach , as a parish , forms a body of public law , which is incorporated into the rights and duties of the six individual church communities .	-7.9990
There will only be a common parish priest and a foundation council in which the priest is represented .	-4.0956
Each parish should represent at least two elected members , in which six parishes are formed on the ground .	-6.1652
Their task in the future will be to promote religious life in the place .	-3.9160
The issue of the finances of the individual parish community was then subject to considerable debate .	-5.9596
The news shows that accumulated credit has been obtained in the parish .	-6.1760
The liabilities , on the other hand , go over to the whole community .	-3.6605
There was a great deal of concern , particularly with regard to the large planned investments , the commitment of which was made by all the parishes .	-6.8608
" In the past , too , was invested only in projects that were managed by the individual parishes alone " , relative Haslach 's parish chairman Bruno Prinzbach .	-6.3382
Practical experience with a joint body for five parishes , Barbarian Knight , the chairman of the board in the Seecaress Schutter-wald-Neuerix .	-8.1565
They did their job in 2006 , ' becoming one , staying five ' and finding that this is not so easy .	-5.8726
The councils of the Haslacher Seesmirship then sought to answer the questions concerning the future composition and size of the common parish church and the practical work of the community teams .	-6.8490
The work will be fleshed out in further meetings and will be decided at another joint meeting of all six bodies next spring .	-5.4614
In the end , the parish priest Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the sea care , which was approved by a clear majority .	-4.4609
Electricity in Pfullendorf will become more expensive .	-2.7069
The citizens of Pflullendorfs must adjust to higher electricity costs .	-3.3094
As the managing director of the cities , Jörg-Arne Bias , confirmed to the S<unk>DKURIER , a four-headed Pflullendorfer family received 70 to 90 extra costs per year .	-5.9307
The substantial reason for the forthcoming increase in prices is the rise in the so-called EEG levy from 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt-hour .	-3.3705
This situation is set anew every year in October by the four operators of the major electricity networks .	-4.5537
These figures are the additional costs incurred by the energy transition , which they can raise by means of a levy on the electricity price .	-7.1733
The Stadtwerke Pfullendorf form the last link in this chain .	-2.3007
In its forecasts , the Supervisory Board of the Energy Company even ran out of a higher position , as Jörg-Arne Bias reported .	-4.4285
Now the concrete figures would have to be calculated before the city buildings could inform their customers about the exact price increase next week .	-4.5326
" We go from an increase of 1 cent plus x out , " said Bias , where the number will be closer to the 2 cent .	-4.5255
Traffic lights on permanent red : Beware of waiting time	-4.3404
Sometimes a traffic light simply does not turn green .	-2.5059
The contact loop in the street does not react , or the sign is broken .	-2.9929
What should you do - drive with red ?	-4.4805
If an injured person waited long enough at a red traffic light and the crossing is free , he can continue , explains Ralf Becker , Stuttgart lawyer , in the magazine " Motorrad " .	-5.5677
However , the waiting time must be ' appropriate ' , which can be interpreted differently from case to case .	-3.9499
Becker advises to endure at least five minutes before starting from a malfunction of the traffic light .	-3.3613
However , anyone who continues the journey despite the red light must be aware that he is fully responsible for an accident caused by it .	-6.4898
Anyone who tolerates less than five minutes may not wait long enough , warns Becker and refers to a decision by the Supreme Court , Hamm .	-3.6641
In the negotiated case , after about three minutes of continuous red , a driver ignored the traffic lights and had to answer for a negligent red light failure .	-5.5724
After all , the traffic lights were not broken , but jumped into green a little later .	-4.7702
He was spared a travel ban because of the special situation - but the fine was not .	-4.7251
Town Council Presidency is pleased about sound budget	-4.6444
Whenever it comes to the budget at Council meetings , Mayor Ralph Gerster laugh well .	-4.2962
The community saw in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and debt has been known by the administration since 2005 .	-4.6995
The 2012 financial year can also be seen as full success in this sense .	-3.4405
This became clear when the accounts were presented for 2012 .	-3.1929
As Andrea Rothmund pointed out , the administrative budget of around EUR 7.6 million was more than planned .	-3.6468
The surplus of the administrative budget is also around EUR 1.8 million above the approach .	-3.1664
The surplus is mainly due to higher commercial tax revenue and the proportion of the municipal income tax .	-5.9074
The asset budget , too , was clear again about the planned values .	-3.9619
Instead of the EUR 1.5 million planned , it was EUR 2.5 million last year .	-2.7539
" This is mainly due to the higher alignment from the administrative budget " , says Rothmund .	-5.0150
Since less investment has been made in the 2012 financial year than planned , the recovery appropriations have also been higher .	-4.8597
Overall , the overall reserve has increased by around EUR 2.1 million to EUR 4.9 million .	-3.4770
Mayor Ralph Gerster spoke to Rothmund and her team for their good work .	-3.3359
" This kind of work is not simply thrown out of the sleeves , " Gerster praised with a view to the annual accounts .	-5.7745
He and local councils were visibly sympathetic to the good figures .	-3.1197
It may seem paradoxical , but these good figures could soon cost citizens dearly .	-3.4639
Due to the good financial situation , the municipality has in the past been able to renounce high rates of elevation . , , , , , , , , ,	-4.7783
However , according to Gerster , subsidies have often been cut back from the country .	-3.8256
There are conditions for these grants from various balancing floors .	-5.1681
Among other things , the towns and communities applying for grants must have certain rates of lifting .	-4.0972
" We must look at the issue of lifting rates , as investments are due in the coming years , for which we would like to have subsidies , " Gerster announced in this connection .	-5.6968

The club was also active in the club , among other things for 28 years as a member of the committee .	-5.4794
He received several awards for his commitment and his faithful association : Jörg Kohr , Pastoralkurent , on behalf of the Cäciety Association of Rottenburg-Stuttgart , submitted him - since the choir is also a church choir - a certificate of the association and a letter of honour signed by Bishop Gebhard Fürst .	-7.0893
His singers presented him with a certificate from the German choir association and a engraved pewter .	-4.5639

One thing that wants to make the name of the programme .	-2.9158
According to Lexicon , Déjà Vu is a psychological phenomenon that expresses itself in the sense of having seen or seen a new situation .	-4.6079
In the event of a visit to the homonymous café at the Opatija in the county town of Kleve , in sight of the University of Rhine-Waal , it must not remain with a pure sense of déjà vu .	-7.4295
After all , the Café with its beautiful name has precisely the aim of making a real stay not only mental , but also physically recurring .	-8.3670
Because it 's just fun and simply beautiful .	-3.3378
A glance inside at the Opel 8 immediately gives the viewer a good feeling .	-5.0097

From moving to Kleve , the friendly café lovers hope to get more visitors .	-5.6440
Not least by the university .	-3.0635
" While we do not have a specific target group , " says Daniel Büttner .	-3.1752
Instead , the two students here want to address young students just as senior citizens and all ages between them .	-5.1930

After all , the port festival took place outside - the Café Déjà Vu did not benefit from it .	-4.6739
But there was also the Ringelnatzling .	-5.3808
" Great , successful and entertaining " , the two 33-year-old people found .	-3.6254
But it is not Jedermann ’ s business .	-4.2164
Maybe Daniel Büttner is not a fancy fan of event evenings either : " You can 't make every right now " .	-6.4034
And with an event I always speak only to those interested in the special event .	-3.6655
Events will therefore be the exception of us .	-3.0489
" We want to disrupt the normal operation as little as possible " .	-2.7767
To say : Déjà Vu is also synonymous with reliability .	-4.4632

UN proclaims new goals in the fight against poverty	-2.9450
The United Nations is starting from now on to draw up a series of new objectives to replace the Millennium Development Goals , announced 12 years ago for combating poverty .	-4.7482
In the run-up to the UN Sustainable Development Summit , which began in Rio de Janeiro in the evening , Australian diplomats played a key role in pushing for “ sustainable development goals , ” which will replace the Millennium Goals that will expire in 2015 .	-4.4774
They were included in the final draft of the document , which will be adopted by world leaders , including Mrs Gillard , at the summit .	-2.6326
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon announced at the summit that the time had come to “ think beyond national interests . ”	-3.9166
“ I am pleased that the member states have agreed to embark on a process to agree universal , sustainable development goals , ” he said .	-3.7761
“ These goals will be built on our progress in the Millennium Development Goals and will form an integral part of the post-2012 development framework .	-3.4398
I will spare no effort to implement the mandate given to me by the Member States to realize our vision of the SDGs , which are based on the success of the Millennium Goals . ”	-4.4151
Even though the SG Achim / Baden has been without victory since four days of play , there is still a good mood in handball .	-8.6798
This leaves no doubt at all to Trainer Tomasz Malmon .	-3.6480
Everyone remains fully motivated in the matter .	-2.9136
Nevertheless , I hope that we will finally win again .	-3.0233
" After all , I don 't know how much victory you can win , " Malmon expects a successful experience from his team at VfB L Fredenbeck II .	-6.3945
Even though the Third Reserve of Fredenbeck has not cut down trees at the moment , Malmon is raising the note in advance .	-6.8983
Many players have trained me in A-Youth .	-4.0707
Therefore , they will certainly be particularly motivated against their ex-coach .	-4.0814
" In addition , it is important to wait for the first gain to be made , " explains the SG-Coach .	-6.3552
In order to finally return to the track of success , the Malamon team must definitely increase itself in comparison with previous performances .	-6.8323
Above all in the cover work and the game turned out to be huge .	-4.5300
The recycling of opportunities must definitely improve as well .	-3.6691
So I hope that my players have finally got their head free during the short break .	-3.6708
Mozambique 's security concerns are growing in the face of clashes between influential people .	-3.7208
Thousands of people gathered in the town of Mapbetide under the watchful eye of the Samora Machel statue , the founder and first president in Mozambique to vote for peace in a rare public demonstration .	-5.8934
“ We want peace again , we want stability , ” said Vanessa de Sousa , director of an investment company .	-1.6844
For fear of the country ’ s future , she traded her business clothes for a T-shirt labelled “ We Are Security ” for Portuguese and joined the crowd on the capital ’ s Independence Square on Thursday .	-5.7141
For two weeks , there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo , among the worst fighting since the peace agreement over 20 years ago .	-3.4983
Renamo was once again a infamous rebel movement , initially supported by White Rhodes and later the South African apartheid government , in an effort to destabilize the country ’ s independent government .	-5.5249
After the 1992 peace treaty , it became an opposition party .	-2.1835
Analysts find it unlikely that the country will return to a full-scale conflict , but recent events have worried foreign investors and local residents .	-4.1069
There is a lot at stake for the rapidly growing economy , because the discovery of huge gas deposits off the coast and coal deposits in the northwest could bring investment of more than $ 50 billion from companies such as Rio Tinto , Vale from Brazil , Eni from Italy , and Anadarko from the US in the next few years .	-6.3832
The ruling Frelilo party , since 1975 the dominant force , and Renamo blame each other for tensions .	-2.6004
Renamo claims that the government has provoked the recent clashes by attacking its members in the province of Sofla , a traditional stronghold of Renaus , on 17 October .	-5.3794
The attacks on the former rebels escalated when government forces attacked Renamo seat points and tried to kill Afonso Dzhlakama , the leader of the group , said Renamos spokesperson for the Financial Times .	-4.3618
The government blames Renamo for the clashes and accuses the organization of having attacked soldiers .	-2.9867
President Armando Guebuza has tried to downplay concerns about instability .	-1.6868
To AFP , the French news agency , he said on Wednesday that Dzhlakama looked like a “ loser ” who wants to use “ all his remaining forces to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government . ”	-4.7714
Both Fredimo and Renamo stress that they want to avoid war .	-2.9013
However , the concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted in the words that Renamo gave up the 1992 peace agreement . , , , , , , , , ,	-5.1241
relative to FT , he said that Fredimo no longer respected the agreement .	-3.3028
“ Our vision is to resume negotiations and indeed seriously , ” said Mazanga .	-3.3121
Previous talks between the parties have done little to resolve the tensions fueled by a series of collisions this year .	-3.9064
“ We have two adult men ( Guebuza and Dhlakama ) here who meet heads , ” says Joseph Hanlon , lecturer at Open University and Mozambican .	-5.0929
None of them are good in bargaining and no one is prepared to make the necessary concessions .	-3.5567
Renamo , who is pushing for electoral reforms , has already stated that she will boycott the municipal elections in November .	-3.6493
presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for next year .	-1.7319
Some commentators have interpreted the use of force as an attempt by a ailing movement to obtain concessions and financial benefits from the government .	-2.9570
Renamos electoral succession have been shrinking since 1992 , while a newer party , founded by a former Rename Democrático de Mo<unk>ambique ( MDM ) , will probably improve in the elections .	-5.4122
Mazanga claims that when his second term ends next year , Guebuza – who is due to resign – wants to destroy the country ’ s democracy .	-4.6321
" He does not want multi-party democracy , he does not want transparent elections , he does not want peace because he does not want to give up the presidency , " said Mazanga .	-3.8192
It is unclear what capacity Renamo has , but it has made appalling attacks on police stations and cars on an important North-South connection .	-5.0159
Most of the fighting took place in the province of la sofa , which is located a few hundred kilometres north of Maputo , in which Beira is located , the port , the mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale to export coal .	-6.4172
In June , Rio broke off the railways for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the track .	-3.9610
Mazanga responded calmly to the question of whether Renamo will repeat this threat .	-3.0386
Renamo wanted to “ warn the international community that things are not good in Mozambique , ” said Mazanga .	-1.9707
Instability has increased frustration with the government , says Fernando Lima , director of MediaCoop , an independent media company , because many people were already worried about corruption , slow progress in development , and a recent wave of governance .	-4.4522
“ People think that the government and the president are responsible for the country ’ s future and that he should be the one who finds solutions to the problems , ” he explains .	-3.3275
Omar Sultanahmet , a demonstrator , said that people simply wanted stability .	-1.9242
“ No one interested Renamo and Fredimo , they just want peace and usable roads , ” he explained .	-3.8935
Children should be taught myths and legends as “ role models for life , ” says an author .	-3.1023
The stories of Thor showed that “ brutal power has no chance of clever tricks , ” and the Artus legend demonstrates how important it is to have a dream .	-2.8017
But many of the myths are “ far too wild , too offensive , and in some cases too dirty to be taught at schools , ” which is why Crossley Holland argued for “ careful selection ” of aged works .	-4.4924
“ I find it wonderful that myths and folklore are already part of education in America , ” he said .	-1.8489
I have proposed this for twenty years as a plan .	-2.2822
He added that , with authors and teachers who are “ overly didactic , ” children would “ shut down completely , ” because in entertaining stories , the messages would be “ subliminal . ”	-5.7892
Crossley Holland , who translated Beowulf from the Anglo-Saxon region and is the author of the Penguin Book of Norre Myths and the British Folk Tales , said : “ You can follow certain intentions , but you should keep them in the background as possible . ”	-6.5649
Perhaps the greatest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an author writing for children is the need to convey hope .	-2.4281
Not everything must be simplified or lead to the Happy End , but there is an immanent sense of good and evil .	-2.6621
This must be shown in the underground , through which history is revealed and not explained .	-5.5140
This is the old story of showing instead of telling .	-2.8481
Hansakob is once again in Freihof	-3.0904
It was 100 years ago that Heinrich Hansakob took up his old life in Haslach , and on Sunday his last years were alive in the " Freihof " .	-7.8929

He spent his time with Erich Becher in Mühlenbach , Germany .	-6.3921
He was received not only by the audience with great applause , but his sister Philippine also welcomed him .	-4.3387
Billy Sum-Hermann understood it incredibly well to embrace the role of the sister and bestowed her in facial expressions and gestures of immense life .	-5.4790
The Mühlenbacher farmers ' band played selected pieces of music between the different game scenes and rounded off .	-7.5493
To award the honorary citizen , Haslach 's mayor , Heinz Winkler , would have the honour of hosting the then incumbent Hättich together with a part of the city council .	-7.5267
After that , the three-king singer , who led the Hansakob to the exclaiming : " Oh like beautiful , there are again youth memories coming alive to my own three-year king . "	-10.2102
With her song " O Jesuin " she enjoyed the audience at the Freihof as well as the storytelling evenings with their loud " omission " .	-6.3990
Hansakob ’ s criticism of the ruling Church was just as critical as his concerns about the excesses in agriculture , the consequences of industrialization , or the effects of war .	-7.1297
In his native soil , behind his tombstone on the fire at Hofstetten , he found his resting place .	-4.3953
" A restless spirit finally found his peace and had gone home forever , " said at the end of the scene .	-4.8784
Many applause and many laudatory words were given by the audience for the performance .	-4.5898

Rhenos Midgard also invested heavily on land .	-3.1116
They distribute the coal coming from ships to the halde .	-3.0161
The company has several irons in fire at its location .	-3.1158
In addition to the coal import , Rhenos Midgard relies , among other things , on wind farm logistics .	-5.3588

Ben Greenman : Ten Years New York Comedy Festival : The New York City	-1.8043
One might say that New York City is the birthplace of Standup Comedy in America : barely a hundred years ago , the Variety Artist Frank Fay , who worked as a Conference Advisor at the Palace Theatre on Broadway , began to tell the crowd directly jokes in the form of a talk .	-5.8556
In the course of the years , Fay ’ s innovation was developed , as recently as at the New York Comedy Festival .	-5.2231
Designed and led by Caroline Hirsch , founder of the Standup-Institution Carolines , this year the festival celebrates its 10th anniversary with more than 60 shows in small clubs and large theatres .	-4.8820

We designed this festival so that we can continue working with them .	-2.2419
This year ’ s event includes performances by Wana Sykes , Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher , as well as the “ Stand Up for Heroes ” , an annual music and comedy charity event for army veterans at Madison Square Garden , where Bruce Springsteen , Jon Stewart , Roger Waters and Bill Cosby are among others .	-6.0030

Nick Kroll was known with a sitcom on cable television ( the iron-slippery fantasy team " The League " on FXX ) and now has its own Sketchshow on Comedy Central .	-5.9808
Jenny Slate was part of the cast both at " Saturday Night Live " and at " Park and Recreation " , although she is best known for her viral video series " Marcel the Shell with Shoes On " .	-4.6031
Both Kroll and Slate and other young comedian with characteristic voices ( the surreal pessimism of Anthony Jeselnik , who focused on racial themes W. Kaumau Bell ) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy .	-4.2372
One of the biggest visitors magnets of the festival is an interview : David Steinberg talks with Larry David .	-3.4167

They would then have played before their homes in a working-class district of football .	-3.2094
The corpse was found in the village of Cerro Pelado , 15 km north of the exclusive beach town of Punta del Este .	-3.7930
As an alibi , a five-year-old half-brother of the boy they had taken should say that she was sexually assaulted by the boy .	-5.4435
But when the girl spoke to the police without mentioning an attack against them , the two boys admitted the deliberate killing of the 11-year-old .	-4.5811
For example , the older one called a rivalry in football .	-5.2722
He was temporarily admitted to a psychiatric youth hospital .	-2.7281

In front of the court , the accused claimed that he was suffering from a severe trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan died alongside him in an explosion .	-4.6292
After a psychiatric expert indicated great doubts about psychological restriction and thus of a limited ability to guilt , the 33-year-old had a comprehensive understanding .	-7.4860
The court had no more hearing of the injured women .	-3.3159
As a Kripo-Beamter reported , at least four other cases of exploitative human trafficking could be identified after a first ad by telephone surveillance measures .	-5.4600

Oil prices continue to reach USD 96 per barrel	-2.4618
The price of oil continued to fall on Friday , after concerns about a high supply overshadowed a report that China ’ s energy-starved manufacturing sector is growing .	-4.4695
The reference raw oil variety for supplies in December fell by 14 cents on 96.24 USD per barrel in Europe in electronic commerce at the New York Mercantile Exchange .	-4.0621
The Treaty fell by 39 cents on Thursday , which meant a price drop of 5.8 % in October .	-2.7744
The large supply of crude oil has impacted prices in recent weeks .	-3.2028
The US Department of Energy declared on Wednesday that the US supply increased by 4.1 million barrels last week .	-3.0460
Over five weeks , supply increased by 25 million barrels .	-2.0441
But on Friday there was evidence of stronger demand by two reports on an increase in activity in Chinese manufacturing .	-4.1626
This suggests continued economic recovery in China , whose growth increased to 7.8 % in the third quarter after it reached its lowest level in the previous quarter for two decades .	-4.7551
Oil of the sort Brent , a reference value for international crude oil , also used by US refineries , fell by 26 cents on the ICE Exchange in London to USD 108.58 per barrel .	-4.2848
Court blocks a decision on the NYPD ’ s Stop and Hair Directive .	-3.8797
A federal court of occupation in the United States blocked a judge ’ s order on Thursday calling for changes to the Stop and Frisk program ( “ Stop and Browse ” ) of the New York police department , and expelled the judge from the case .	-5.8497
The 2nd US Court declared that the decisions of judge Shira Seedlin would be suspended until a decision was made on a city ’ s appeal .	-6.0626
The judge judged in August that the city was protesting against the Constitution with the way in which the program for keeping and covering people was implemented .	-5.5796
The city appealed against its assessment and the imposed relief measures , including the decision to set up a monitoring authority to help the police amend their directive and the relevant training programme .	-5.4203
On Tuesday , the Court of Appeal heard the case for a suspension .	-4.1874
The appeal report stated that the judge must be relieved of the case , since it violated the code of conduct for US judges by determining that a judge should avoid the appearance of the party ; this was partly justified by a series of media interviews and public statements in which she had publicly responded to the Court ’ s criticism .	-7.1811
The judge had judged that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people because they mistakenly targeted black and Latin American men with the stop-and-hairk program .	-4.9164
It appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of major changes , including reforms in directives , training and service supervision , and ordered a pilot programme with body supported cameras in districts where most controls were carried out .	-5.9431
In August , the city of New York declared itself willing to end the practice of storing names and addresses of people made redundant after police control .	-4.4163
An oral hearing on the city ’ s appeal is planned after March 14 , 2014 .	-3.3039
Stop and hairstyles were criticised by a number of citizens ' rights campaigners .	-4.5235
There have been controls of this kind for decades in various forms , but the number of recorded controls increased during the term of office of the non-partisan Mayor Michael Bloomberg to an all-time high of 684.330 in 2011 , most of them black and Latin American men .	-5.0347
In 2004 , four men who belong to all minorities were brought to justice , which became a collective redress .	-5.2838
Supporters of changes to the NYPD ’ s Stop and Frisk program say that the changes will end unfair practices , create a more trustworthy and effective police force , and influence how other police presidents are using it .	-5.7100
Opponents believe that the changes would dampen police morale , but not crime ; nor would money be wasted and the broader problem of a police force that is under pressure after the disappearance of thousands of jobs over the last decade .	-5.5041
The judge pointed out that she did not end the stop-and-hairs-practice that was constitutional , but only the way in which NYPD controls were implemented .	-6.1726
Happiness of the Burning Came	-3.8685

During the speeches pictures of the missions were shown on a large screen , so that guests could see the anniversary event from the actions mentioned .	-6.1362
The desert vehicle of the association has also been shown .	-2.3764
It is a former federal border protection vehicle .	-2.4959
Rainer Prewo , the former OB of Nagold , had made the proposal to equip this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and now , according to Henne , plans to operate with the association in an advisory role .	-5.6602
In 2008 the Zimmerei Schleeh from Baiersbronn in the record time of just under a week did raise a void in Socosti , a district of slums on the outskirts of the capital - volunteers .	-9.1530
Henne also mentioned a new mother ’ s disease in Nouakchott .	-2.6203
Particularly interesting in times when the maternity clinic is to be neutralized in Nagold .	-5.3763
Much has been learned in Africa as a medical doctor , according to Henne , for example deceleration against Burn-out .	-4.1912
Due to political unrest in the country , it was not possible to do as many journeys as planned , but many medical professionals came to Germany to hospitalize here in various areas .	-6.2009

Nor should it be forgotten that Africa is closer than some people think .	-2.9889
From Gran Canaria it is not far from Africa .	-2.3668
Couson used phone hacking to check tips	-4.9953
The former news of the Word-editor Andy Couson reportedly put “ phone hacking , surveillance , and confrontation ” at an attempt to confirm a false tip about an affair of Charles Clarke , then Home Secretary .	-5.3257
In May 2005 , Andrew Edison QC declared to the court in Old Bailey , News of the World heard a false rumor that Clarke had a relationship with his “ attractive special adviser ” Hannah Pawlby .	-5.3312
The newspaper asked private detective Glen Mulcaire to hack Pamlton 's voicemail , and followed them , but Couson also appealed to her and left messages as the court learned .	-6.6738
“ According to the Public Prosecutor ’ s opinion , Couson , who is now the editor of the notary , no one who stands in front of the apartment of people and hopes to catch them on a fresh act , but one who likes to face people with a history to see their reaction , ” Edis said .	-7.9931
He said , Emergency W uses three methods to research investigative stories : telephone hacking , surveillance , and confrontation .	-4.1327
The editor is personally involved in the third method .	-1.2096
Obviously he knows of the second , of surveillance , otherwise it cannot be .	-3.6335
What about the first ?	-1.3494
Does he know about phone hacking ?	-2.5257
He disputes it , but we say : “ And whether he knew it . ”	-4.1303
Rumours about a Clarkes affair were first picked up by NotW ’ s feature editor , when a source that was sexually interested in Pawlby was said : “ Do not waste your time , she is together with Charles . ”	-5.4295
A band with voicemail from their phone of at least three occasions was secured in August 2006 in Mulcaires apartment .	-3.2560
Investigators also found entries on the detector computer , where Pawlby and her sister were saved as “ projects . ”	-4.0008
In the time when the searches ran , the grandparents of Pawlby received anonymous calls asking for information about them , Edis explained .	-4.3357
Meanwhile , former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw the monitoring of the movements of Pawlby .	-3.2373
On 18 June 2005 , Couson left her a Voicemail with the following content : “ I have a story that we want to highlight tomorrow , about which I would like to speak with Charles . ”	-4.4002
Edis explained that Couson ’ s activities on this story followed the same pattern as those of other important figures , such as former Interior Minister David Blunquette .	-5.6567
The jury heard on Thursday that Couson Blunkett faced an affair with a married woman when he himself was livened up with the co-accused Rebekah Brooks who had been married at that time .	-5.8704
Couson and Brooks argue that they have conspired with others to strike phones between October 3 , 2000 and August 9 , 2006 .	-4.0233
Mulcaire , Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted the phone hacking .	-3.2321

In short : No absolute protection possible .	-4.5372
" We want to involve the inhabitants in advance in planning " , Mayor Jens Hä<unk>ler opened the Civil Information Event for the flood protection concept in Gechingen .	-5.4560
Around 80 participants had come to the municipal hall to explain the planned measures , ask questions , express concerns and introduce ideas .	-5.0198
Local leaders made it clear : ' Recent decisions by members of the local council ' .	-3.8830
The flooding , which was unprepared on May 15 , 2009 , was a severe event that raised the question of protection measures for the future , so Hä<unk>ler .	-6.2819
A river basin examination was commissioned with the neighbouring community of Ailingen , which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen .	-3.3015
" Protection of as many cultivated land is the goal " , so Hä<unk>ler .	-4.7253
The train round is the planning of protection against the floods that can be expected according to German weather service statistically every 100 years .	-5.8352
Climate change is taken into account by a 15 % supplement .	-2.6354
In specialist circles this is called " HQ 100aClimate " .	-3.8497
The water masses , which caused considerable damage in 2009 in Gechingen , corresponded to a thousand years of flooding .	-4.9569
" There is no absolute protection , but we can achieve a relative improvement " , says Häuser .	-4.2633
In order to achieve the protection of the HQ 100 climate , around EUR 4 million must be invested in Gechingen , with the municipality accounting for around 70 % .	-7.0585
However , it was pointed out to the House that support only exists if an overall concept is implemented .	-6.0787
In order to do this , the community must rely on the participation of its citizens .	-5.0044
A time-consuming planning and approval procedure must be completed .	-2.0705
In the best case , implementation can begin in 2016 .	-1.6959
Among other things , the protective concept that was already presented in the municipal council last week ( we reported ) provides for local measures in the inflow of the tiny river Irm from the family 's valley .	-7.3778
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept , participants took the opportunity to introduce their concerns .	-2.8708
Amongst other things , it was questioned why no longer dams and restraint basins were planned to protect the place .	-4.3866
Gregor Kühn , a technical director of the civil engineering office Forest and Corbe from Strechaum , who presented the concept , stressed that it needed to combine all the measures presented to achieve the desired goal .	-9.0256
In addition , it is considered the most economical solution , according to Joachim forest of forest and corbe .	-4.8546
The town was home to many old residents , who , even with normal thunderstorms , have to suffer from congestion on the channel network .	-10.2948
The problem is well known with the administration and first measures have already been taken .	-3.1230
However , it has been pointed out to the House that the directives on canal systems are not intended to be mixed up for flood protection and this should not be possible .	-8.3556
The municipality is obliged to interpret the canal network in such a way that two to three years of regeneration could be terminated .	-5.8074

Severely wounded after collision collision	-3.3714
In the early Friday afternoon two drivers were seriously injured on the road 44 near Revensdorf at a head-on collision .	-4.5684
The police immediately closed the road completely , but at the end of the accident there was little to say about it .	-6.7640
However , there are various testimony that should only be evaluated .	-3.2698
It is clear that the 19-year-old steering woman of a VW Golf went to Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf came forward with his hyundai .	-5.9768
Both vehicles collided , and the woman was so hard to admit that the fire brigade needed just half an hour to free them from the vehicle break .	-6.0030
The real cause of the accident was initially unknown .	-3.5430
Both were killed in nearby hospitals .	-3.1819
The track remained closed for about two hours .	-2.4023

“ They are convinced that their son was murdered , ” explained Benjamin Crump , the attorney of Kenneth and Jacquyn Johnson , to FoxNews.com.	-4.6217
They never believed that he had died as the Sheriff had sunk .	-3.5403
“ They believe that there is no logic to infringement of the laws of physics , as well as common sense , ” says Crump .	-6.2079
Instead , they are convinced that the truth will be covered to protect the person or person responsible for the death of their son .	-3.7873
“ Your son went to school and returned to the body ’ s back , ” he commented .	-3.8097
US Prosecutor Michael Moore said on Thursday that there will be a formal investigation into the death of Johnson , as a number of important questions remain unresolved .	-3.5354
What was the cause of death ?	-0.7648
Is his death attributed to a crime ?	-1.7710
That was what Moore said at a press conference on Thursday afternoon .	-1.9991
I follow the facts in which direction they also follow .	-3.1086
My aim is to find the truth .	-1.6057
“ I believe that there is a sufficient basis for a formal investigation , ” he said .	-2.4435
Moore explained to reporters that initial autopsies pointed out that Johnson died of the consequences of “ positioned creation . ”	-4.2115

CDC publishes allergy directives for schools	-2.2302
On Wednesday , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) published a set of guidelines on how children are exposed to food allergies in schools .	-3.2805
These are the first such guidelines issued by the US government , as the number of schoolchildren with food allergies is increasing .	-3.5490
One in 20 children in the United States now has food allergies .	-1.3850
The incidence of food allergies among children has increased by 18 % , according to the CDC between 1997 and 2007 .	-3.1878
The guidelines contain information for schools intended to raise awareness of food allergies to teachers and staff and how to deal with children who show allergic reactions .	-4.0728
It is also recommended that schools have epinephrine in stock – the car injection of the brand EpiPen is used most often – in order to cope with a potentially fatal oversensitivity response .	-4.5500
Legislation in the states has recently changed the rules to allow schools to keep epilepsy in basic stocks .	-4.7104
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms mentioned by children with an allergic reaction .	-2.2970
Children may say : “ It feels like something pushing on my tongue ” , “ My tongue feels like a hair on it ” or “ My tongue cribs ” .	-6.9802
Intersexual children ’ s parents can choose “ gender Non-True ”	-4.2771
Germany is the first European nation to recognize a third sex for children born with non-unequivocal genitals .	-2.2091
newborns are no longer allocated starr male or female .	-3.1672
According to the new law , parents no longer need to declare sex for such children , but can specify “ indeterminate ” or “ not stipulated ” on the birth certificate .	-5.3993
The aim of the law is to put pressure on parents so that they do not have to make hasty decisions on sexual operations in newborns , and to combat discrimination against intersexual people .	-6.4870
An intersexual person said , according to the BBC years later , “ I am neither a man nor a woman . ”	-3.1661
I stay the patchwork created by doctors mutilated and full of scars .	-2.0737
It is estimated that one of 2,000 children is not born as a boy or as a girl every year .	-4.4468
They are part of Intersexual , a group that is part of the diagnosis of “ sexual differentiation disorder ” ( DSD ) , a collection concept for people with atypical chromosomes , germs ( ovaries or testions ) or unusual developed genitals .	-7.2275
Wallis Simpson was perhaps Intersexual .	-2.5588
Gender identification is still not very well developed , but most experts in the US suggest that the best available information on gender should be used if a provision is not possible , and not wait for the psychological and physical development of the child before deciding – if anything – for an operation .	-5.5477
The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher , who specializes in gender identification issues , said that the new German law “ rings for a good thing . ”	-3.8514
Inter-sexual children are an ethical dilemma .	-1.3998
“ Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgical intervention , but most children do not . ” He said .	-3.3881
You can allocate a gender without surgery and then wait for the development of identity .	-4.5638
The scientific data on how a child develops his sexual identity are not very accurate .	-3.3723
Nobody knows why it is happening .	-1.4847
It is like the secret why people are gay .	-1.8581
In a report to the European Commission in 2011 , it says that sexual people are different from transsexual or transgender , because their status is not gender , but because of their biological constitution , which is neither exclusively male nor female , but typically both at the same time or not clearly defined as one of them .	-5.8402
These characteristics were shown in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle mass , hairs , breasts and stature , priority sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals , or in chromosomes and hormones .	-4.5900
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination faced by intersexual and transgender people in professional life and the extent of harassment , violence and prejudice .	-4.1935
Young boys who do not share the gender image now have a special camp .	-3.4797
In Australia and Nepal , it is now possible for adults to declare male , female , or “ third sex ” on official documents .	-3.4800
In June , Australian Norrie May-Welby ( 52 ) was recognised as the world ’ s first “ gender-less ” person , after a court had granted lifetime maintenance of a “ undefined ” sexual status .	-5.4943
In addition to M and W , German cards will have a third assignment , X for Intersexual , so the Ministry of the Interior .	-4.6098
In neighboring France , sexual subjects are still controversial , such as a news message to France 24 .	-5.4326
In 2011 , dozens of French deputies in the strictly Catholic country signed a petition that the “ gender theory ” should be removed from school books .	-3.3142
The US Catholic Online website has also spoken out against German law , on the grounds that , “ If the world is broken into a new state , where sex is a decision , but not sexual activity , then we will destroy two other pillars of civilisation . ”	-6.1640
The mother of a newborns from Maryland explained to Baby Zone , she would be better if babies were to be gender at birth .	-5.0034
“ Even without further restrictions , the parent is already stressed enough , especially if one does not know the sex of his own child , ” she said the parental website .	-6.1798
Children need stability and security .	-0.8257
Historically , children born with both male and female sexual components were called Hermapphrodites , according to the attractive Greek god , who had both sexes .	-5.2409
Even ten years ago , medicine regarded gender as something to be erased and then rebuilt .	-4.1159
But the ethical foundations of an operation are now being questioned after it is known how complex the gender identity is , and that doctors can also be wrong because they do not know how the child feels in growing with the gender they are allocated .	-5.8803
“ In the middle of the 20th century it was called a psychiatric emergency , ” says Drescher .	-3.7495
When such a child was born , we did not call the psychiatrist , but the surgeon .	-3.1625
The ruling theory on the treatment of children with non-unequivocal genitals is back to Dr. John Money from Johns Hopkins University , who argued that gender can be formalised .	-5.4804
He coined the term “ gender identity , ” arguing that social and environmental stimulus – as parents educate a child – interacted with a child ’ s genes and hormone , and characterized a person as male or female .	-3.8273
But in a case known as “ John / Joan ” in 1966 , his theories became controversial .	-3.6176
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been cut off in a pledged circumcision , to pack the child completely and also to remove his testicles and then lift him up as a girl .	-7.9787
“ Money presented this case as a successful example of a conversion , but it was not , ” says Drescher .	-2.9886
When the boy was about 15 , he switched back to male sex and married a woman .	-2.3507
With 38 But he committed suicide .	-1.6116
According to Drescher , there are still doctors who practice this model .	-2.0303
Yet , in the 1990s , with the advent of the Internet , survivors of these sexual operations came to the public , who “ are not happy with the result . ”	-4.5015
For example , Jim Bruce , a 36-year-old author from Montana who was born with XY male chromosomes , but ambiguous genitals .	-4.5052
Doctors were not clear about whether he had a big clitory or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a “ happy life ” as a man .	-3.9239
So his external organ and the testings were removed surgical shortly after the birth of 1976 and he was raised as a girl .	-6.0825
At the age of 12 he was given female hormones .	-1.9505
“ I knew I am not a girl , ” he said to ABCNews.com	-2.2469
I was unhappy , but it was really hard to ask questions .	-1.7319
At the age of 18 he should receive a vaginalplastik .	-3.3024
But , because he was depressed and knew that something was wrong , he demanded his medical files .	-3.9677
What he found out was shocking .	-0.9099
I was sterilized at my birth – and no one ever told me that .	-2.5334
Bruce was born with a DSD , through which his body could not produce enough testosterone to develop genital organs .	-2.8314
After experiencing the truth , he switched back to male identity , received testosterone injections and let his breasts be removed .	-4.5618
Through the operation it has become infertile .	-2.4928
Today , he struggles for others in an organization called Interface Project for intersexual people to be perceived as normal .	-3.2660
But Anne Tamara-Mattis , California ’ s chief executive , Advocates for Informed Choice , ensures that German law can “ encourage stamp and stigmatize . ”	-6.4384
“ Many activists are worried that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and to “ assign ” the child , she explained .	-4.6514
We are afraid that is favourable to intervention .	-3.0467
We think it would be better to allocate male or female sex and then wait .	-2.5777
But we do not yet know how the law will affect , so we can only speculate .	-2.5487
Tama-Mattis said that her organization supports Australian law , because “ it allows adults to recognize as the third gender . ”	-4.9381
“ Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal sex , ” she explained .	-2.7821
The German law is about the assignment at birth .	-2.2891
This is not a battle to which small children should be forced at this time .	-3.2687
When they grow , they can decide their own bodies .	-2.7432
But Dr. Arlene Baratz , a breast radiologist from Pittsburgh , who has a daughter with a sexual disorder and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group , says the German law “ empowers ” both parents and children .	-5.2293
Katie , the daughter of Baratz , was born with male chromosomes , but has a DSD called complete Androgen resistance .	-3.9203
Due to the defect of the target cells for testosterone , cate female characteristics developed .	-3.9600
She has a vagina , but no uterus and no ovaries .	-2.4580
Today , Katie 29 and married ; she is working at the University of Pennsylvania as a member of the Children 's Psyche .	-4.9919
Although she is infertile , she hopes to have a child through adoption or a surrogate mother .	-3.5105
“ The law gives parents room , which does not require them to make hasty decisions , ” said Baratz .	-3.5307
It gives them the time to do various tests and to clarify things and gives them time to write “ male ” or “ female ” .	-4.2332
In this way everything is fine – one pulls the child large and loves it .	-3.6571
One has a wonderful baby and enjoys parental happiness .	-2.7975
And there is no need to rush an operation that can no longer be undone .	-4.4208
“ That includes children in the decision , and it explained the fear that drives parents because they believe they would not do the right thing . ”	-5.6844
Ultimately , the child decides about the sex that suits him better – and that is wonderful .	-4.1065
This will enable children to make their own decision .	-2.8154
Injured Girls by Shot from Auto	-3.4489
The unknown injured a 12-year-old in Sachsen-Anhalt in shots from a car .	-4.9852
The perpetrators probably fired on Thursday evening in Genthin with an air pressure weapon to a group of children .	-3.7444
That was what the police said in Burg .	-3.8830
The girl was easily injured on the left crest .	-2.5376
Rescue staff brought the girl to hospital .	-3.2890
The shot came from a small car that had passed on a group of six children and suddenly stopped .	-3.5732
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car .	-0.6734
The perpetrators also pushed a bus stop .	-2.9790
A disc broke down .	-1.8391
Then they did .	-3.5499
The criminal police established it was on Friday .	-4.3698
Until now , the police inspection department of Kempten can look back on a quiet hallween night .	-4.5914
The officials were created only twice to rally children who threw them against house facades .	-6.4533
Because homeowners recognized this in time and removed ovaries equally , no material damage will be caused .	-5.5204
In addition , some Sylvester were also bred in the city , but there was no material damage either .	-7.0599
A couple of people living in the Bischoff Friendship way reported that his car was wrapped up with toilet paper and his cyclists ' hiding .	-7.4997
Until the police arrived , however , the man found his wheelers all in the immediate vicinity , which is why the police had no further action .	-5.6810
Living with a Future Vision	-1.7649
In fact , Waltraud Ries lives wonderfully .	-3.2365
Your house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with lots of green , an old tree house , nice neighbors and also not too much traffic .	-4.5751
It is only a few minutes away from the city by public transport .	-3.4712
" You hopefully have no fear of spinning ? " , asks Waltrad Ries and points to a fat spider on the door frame .	-4.6778
I have been looking for a new apartment for my husband and me for some time .	-2.6309
But you know how difficult this is in Stuttgart .	-2.0116
The reason , however , is not a spinfire , but the concern that at the age the many stairs to the house and the apartment can no longer be overcome , she explains .	-7.2824
In addition , since a Menisus operation , the mid-fifties have had to learn in their own body what it means to move from the floor with a handicap .	-6.2864
Only recently is a book of her published on the theme of " Happiness at the Age - What form of living is the best for me ? " .	-5.1878
" Our apartment is the best example of what is not going on at old time , " she begins to tell .	-5.1397
When she moved to the Maisonette apartment more than 20 years ago with her husband , it was simply a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green .	-4.4374
Today with the middle of fifty Waltrad Ries thinks differently .	-3.1051
But she also knows that she is one of the few people who are actually dealing with the issue of ' living at age ' .	-5.7255
Most of them are ousting as long as it happens .	-5.3914
Alt will always be only the other ' , she says pretty .	-4.6744
It is only when the pressure of suffering is really great that you think .	-5.0805
Then it can be too late , so Ries .	-4.1207
In her book , interior designers present 17 models of living for a self-determined living in the age .	-5.8752
'What type of living you choose is always an individual decision ' , she explains .	-3.7303
D i e solution there is not for age .	-1.6477
Even those who can afford to spend their time in Tuscany or Brittany should always think that he can also be ill .	-5.6575
And : ' Without a good knowledge of the language of the language , you can also join in the Dolce Vita , ' gives the technical book authorization to consider in the selection .	-8.8787
Among their models are classic care models , alternative forms of living or the often quoted Pensioners ' Party .	-5.5327
At the age , everyone has so many Ticks and creams .	-5.6270
'For me this would be a community of flats but nothing ' , she says with an eye candy .	-6.3959
Even not as in a student ’ s WG with a common bathroom and a kitchen .	-5.7140
" At the age you just need your back room , " says Ries .	-5.9832
Nevertheless , the authors do not want to rule out the fact that an older community can function .	-5.2836
But that should be different from that of the classic student WRG .	-6.2801
And sometimes you just want his calm , " she believes .	-4.1804
With this view , it is not alone in the provincial capital , at least .	-4.8916
'Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own home for so long ' , is also the experience of Theresa Rütten , the head of civic services life at the age of the provincial capital .	-4.9998
Her department advises people around the topic of becoming older .	-3.6017
For this reason , even older people would often take on ease and restrictions , just to remain in their familiar environment , that is also the experience of the Stiftung Warentest .	-6.6880
Today there are many possibilities to make the house or apartment accessible .	-4.6436
Ries recommends that all those concerned with the age-just transformation of their house or apartment should first get informed about themselves thoroughly and not hire the best craftspeople .	-8.1429
Today there are also specialists for age-related restructuring .	-4.6688
Even in the apartment one can realize one or another , and if it is only the toilet seat increase , the interior designers clarify .	-5.3040
But it is not always possible to change the existing apartment for free , even if it is still so beautiful .	-6.0642
This experience had to make Waltrad Ries .	-2.1469
The room was a bit small and the bathroom was very small .	-9.4291
She will continue searching until she has found the ideal object for herself and her husband .	-2.4323
Before moving it , it is more grey than before the spider at its home door .	-5.4828
US Time to prosecute Snowden	-3.8600
The US has not changed its stance on former US intelligence officer Edward Snowden .	-2.5779
He is further accused of providing unsolicited secret information .	-4.5604
So he must face criminal proceedings in the US , the spokesperson of the US State Department , Jennifer Psaki , said in Washington .	-4.9935
Snowden ’ s recent statements would not change this either .	-2.7844
Before that , after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow , the German green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele appealed to the US not to threaten him further with punishment .	-5.5921
Psaki stressed that the words of flow are those of a parliamentarian , not that of a German executive member .	-5.9087
Intelligence officer Edward Snowden is basically ready to talk to German authorities .	-3.7886
First , however , he wants to clarify his situation .	-2.6044
This is what former NSA staff sought by the USA made clear in an unaddressed letter , which the Green politician Hans-Christian Strbelel continued on Friday after a meeting with Snowden published and federal government , Bundestag , and general lawyer .	-7.4164
The letter has the following wording after a translation , which is widely used by flow :	-6.1265
Those responsible	-3.0429
I have been asked to write to you about your inquiry on mass surveillance .	-2.3088
My name is Edward Joseph Snowden and was previously contracted or employed by a direct agency as a technical expert at National Security Agency ( NSA ) , the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) and the Defense Intelligence Agency ( DIA ) of the United States .	-5.2796
As I worked in these institutions , I witnessed systematic abuses of the law of my government , which led me to act out of moral duty .	-5.3959
As a result of the publication of these concerns , I saw a serious and sustained shrug that forced me to leave my family and my home .	-4.5245
I live in exile and enjoy temporary asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation under international law .	-1.6332
I am encouraged by the resonance of my political action , both in the US and elsewhere .	-2.0619
Citizens around the world , and also senior officials - including the United States - have judged revelations about a system of comprehensive surveillance that nobody is accountable as a service to the public .	-5.0897
These espionage revelations led many proposals to new laws and directives aimed at the previously hidden abuse of public trust .	-4.3072
The benefits for society from these insights are becoming increasingly clear , while the risks involved have clearly been reduced .	-5.2947
Although the outcome of my efforts has been proven to be positive , my government continues to treat dissent as a smokescreen , seeking to criminalise and prosecute political expression .	-5.4989
Nevertheless , saying the truth is not a crime .	-2.3600
I am confident that the United States Government will take this dismissive stance with the support of the international community .	-2.9591
I hope that , when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved , I will be able to be appropriately and legally involved in the responsible investigation of the issues relating to the statements made in the media , particularly with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports .	-6.1046
I look forward to meeting you in your country as soon as the situation is resolved and thank you for your efforts to preserve the international law that protects us all .	-3.9316
Edward Snowden testified by Hans-Christian Ströbel	-5.6925
Kindergarten has found a private buyer .	-2.1698
" The building is in good hands " , says Winterlingens Mayor Michael Maier .	-1.4571
The former Kindergarten in the Gartenstra<unk>e was sold to a private person .	-4.2524
The local council approved the sale in its recent meeting in the non-public sector .	-4.6954
The building changed its owner to a " reasonable " price .	-2.3913
" The municipality is satisfied " , says Maier .	-3.0693
EUR 100 000 were allocated in the budget .	-2.7764
It is not yet clear how the new owner wants to use the previous nursery .	-2.8636
The mayor is right that Winterlingen has passed the responsibility for the building to someone else before the winter and therefore no longer has to pay for the entertainment of the house , how to heat , to look after the garden and to clear the way .	-7.1041
" This effort is now gone , " Maier is pleased .	-3.9194

About 50 listeners enjoy the sounds of the Hammerrich musicians .	-2.6518

Report : Obama ’ s campaign to replace Biden with Hillary Clinton	-2.8596
President Barack Obama ’ s closest advisers in secret have been considering replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton in the 2012 election campaign , the New York Times .	-3.4548
The revelation is the most significant surprise of Mark Halperia ’ s long-awaited work on the 2012 campaign , " Double Down : Game Change 2012 " .	-4.2967
The Times is a copy of the forthcoming book , and it reported on Thursday evening that the president ’ s top advisers had conducted “ extensive group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011 ” to see if Obama ’ s diminishing hope of re-election is better looking for him to drop Biden .	-6.1841
According to Jonathan Martin , National Political correspondent of the Times , the book accurately records the history of the campaign ’ s and White House ’ s efforts to measure , notably the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley , what effect it has on poll figures to exchange former Secretary of State Clinton for the Vice-President .	-5.3490
The potential change was a strictly guarded secret of campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office .	-2.2513
Only half a dozen of the president ’ s closest advisers – including Daley , former campaign leader Obama , Jim Messina , and former White House advisers , David Axelrod , and David Plouffe – knew the intended change .	-3.8982
In “ Double Down , ” it is claimed that Daley led the effort to exchange biden despite her “ close personal relationship , ” before deciding against such a move after the data showed that Clinton ’ s candidacy “ would not significantly improve Obama ’ s chances . ”	-5.9093
In an interview with Martin Daley , Daley confirmed that the government was actually considering replacing Biden with Clinton .	-3.6788
“ I expressed a whole series of things that should be considered , and that was one of them , ” Daley told the magazine .	-3.7396
It must be remembered that the president had dreadful poll figures at that time , so we thought : “ For God ’ s sake , what do we do ? ”	-4.5424
While Daley described the investigation as “ due diligence , ” Martin told CNN ’ s Anderson Cooper that a major effort was made during the re-election campaign to determine whether such a move would pay for the ballot box .	-6.4863
“ In campaigns , not so much money is spent on surveys and focus groups if you don ’ t think seriously about something , ” said Martin on AC360 .	-4.0801
But it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team had thought about an exchange .	-2.9682
Martin said to CNN that he asked Daley whether his former boss had known the potential change .	-3.6948
While Daley explained that he did not believe that the president was “ aware ” of the possible change , former chief of staff admitted that it was “ possible ” that Obama knew .	-3.9854
Martin added that “ Double Down ” does not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether the political probes have reached Obama ’ s desk .	-3.7728
Cooper asked Martin whether he thought seriously that Obama knew nothing about whether to let Biden drop in the election .	-4.8872
" Perhaps " , Martin replied .	-2.8989
What happens on the road with my email ?	-2.1106
Email actually means electronic letter .	-3.7584
Did the design of the Internet service translate mail in a manner similar to conventional mail technical ?	-6.5888
The concept of the early Internet services focused on making communication possible .	-4.3786
Therefore , the basic technical protocols did not ensure a stable foundation for a correspondence .	-4.6431
Therefore , a traditional mail is more like an open postcard than a sealed letter .	-3.9497
When users send an email to " Benni " , are the computers of the two directly connected ?	-4.1118
The email program or the browser of Anna will send the mail to the mail server of its service provider in the first step .	-3.5742
For example , if she has a GM account , it would be Google .	-3.1459
This mail server sends content to the provider that Benni uses .	-2.0804
You can run the mail over a number of other servers on the Internet .	-4.7110
Bennie can call the content with his provider .	-3.5946
Are conventional e-mails read through the network on their way ?	-2.8577
Most mails are read by software robots on the road .	-2.4946
The sender 's sender 's provider usually checks whether the mail brings a malicious program as an attachment .	-5.0654
The recipient systems also have a virus check in .	-3.1320
In addition , providers check whether it is a annoying and unwanted spam mail that is immediately deleted or at least sorted into a spam folder .	-5.4581
Do the robots have another task ?	-1.8243
For systems such as GMail , the robot also determines the information Google needs to place context advertising .	-3.2949
If Anna and Benni communicate via GMail about their coming holidays , Google may link to holiday offers .	-5.5479
Do unknown people also read the e-mails ?	-2.4195
The probability that unauthorized people read an email is very low .	-3.4520
But in theory it is possible .	-2.3484
In companies , administrators often have the opportunity to read electronic mail .	-2.9510
The law enforcement authorities and secret services also have legal means to intercept or take note of e-mails .	-4.1462
This may include illegal statements .	-4.8990
Is it possible to protect emails against the reading ?	-3.4934
Using an encryption according to the OpenPGP standard , an email can be encrypted effectively against reading .	-4.5326
It is also possible , with a high technical effort , to disguise the metadata of email communication , so that it is not even easy to identify who has communicated to whom .	-6.1563
How important are Yahoo and Google on the email market in Germany ?	-1.4378
In the largely used mailbox , Yahoo and Google , according to an August 2013 survey by Convios Consulting , play only a minor role .	-6.1672
While the shares of Yahoo Mail were last happy , Gmail could significantly purchase Gmail from Google .	-5.2312
Owned mother in the forest and pension funds	-3.1386
When his elderly mother died , a man from Wolfsburg had a plan .	-3.3652
He bore the deaths in a forest - and continued to collect pension and care payments .	-5.2617
A 67-year-old Wolfburger buried his dead mother after police investigation in the forest to collect pension and care money .	-4.4606
First of all , he was concealing the death of the 89-year-old , then he cut the money over a year and a half .	-6.3847
Now the 67-year-old has to answer for fraud , as a Friday speaker said .	-3.1575
So the man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt .	-3.1145
The man was suspected as early as May : at that time , it was found that no medicines were needed for the needy mother .	-5.3386
Investigators told pensioners that his mother travelled to Spain .	-1.9486
Because this was strange , they continued to determine it .	-5.1841
It was discovered that the two had lived in a common apartment for more than 15 years and finally maintained it .	-5.8006
The 67-year-old finally admitted the death of his mother .	-2.2725
According to the police , a record showed no evidence of a capital crime .	-3.6989
Fancy ice cream lit in the dark ?	-2.5218
A British businessman has developed the first ice in the dark – using guns .	-3.5230
Charlie took advantage of the sea ’ s fluorescence , creating a shining leak .	-4.1161
The idea came to him , after he had read a research on quality and convinced Chinese scientists to produce the shining protein artificially .	-6.3715
The ice cream reacts with the tongue , increasing the pH in the protein and causing the glow .	-4.5283
Chris explains that the more you leak , the more light it becomes .	-4.5193
Charlie , founder of the ice cream company “ Lick Me I 'm Delicious ” , says : “ The product is incredible , but still in a very early production phase , so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds . ”	-3.7813
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with a neutral pH .	-2.1250
When the mouth is heated , the pH is increasing and the ice is lit .	-3.6195
We have tested it over the last few months and it seemed to us the best to bring it onto the market at Halloween , because it has this wonderful shining effect .	-6.1650
It is probably the most expensive ice cream I have ever made , because the quality lamp is four times more expensive than gold .	-3.0848
Each ball costs me about 140 pounds .	-2.1115
But it tastes delicious .	-2.1080
Charlies experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual tastes , including beer , cheese , beef and gold .	-3.1101
But his latest creation is expected to become even more ambitious .	-2.6306
He says : “ I would like to develop an invisible ice cream . ”	-2.3415
This is impossible in itself because of the lightning break caused by the ice cream containing ice cream ; but I suspect we will find a way to create it .	-6.7959
Ice cream uses the fluorescence of a quality produced by Chinese scientists .	-2.9227
After six days the TSV Morsum is still without any point in the handball association league .	-3.9617
The team of Ingo Ehlers will be busy on the Derby against TSV Dagen tomorrow , which celebrated his first victory last weekend .	-6.6441
With this game the season begins anew for us .	-2.7360
" I hope that we finally have our head free , " Ehlers give some optimism .	-4.7836
He finally has his complete cader , except for the permanent Hendrix Blohme .	-6.5667
Even Dagger acts like us on Temposgame .	-5.3490
We therefore need to keep our error rate low .	-2.4727
Above all , however , we need to increase coverage , which has left everything but a certain impression .	-5.4847
Daverden Coach Thomas Panitz is clearly more relaxed after the first season victory against Nordhorn .	-4.7981
The game was of course a number .	-2.8487
But for that reason we are not the favourite , because everything in Derby can always happen .	-4.4695
However , Panitz now wants to set up in Morsum to start a series .	-4.0254
There is no Jan-Malte Jodat .	-3.8377
For this purpose , the A-Youth Joost Wind<unk> , which is active with double rights at the A-Jugend-Bornisei HC Bremen , is celebrating its season debut .	-8.6640
Those who are not hot in such a game should stay at .	-3.8162
Halloween 2013 : In Numbers	-1.8772
When I was small , Halloween had something magical .	-2.1613
My sister and I were allowed to have sweets , to stay late and to suffer for the neighbourhood .	-3.8132
Today I have become the Halloween muffle .	-4.7257
In the last two years , I have not agreed to distribute from my home from sweets , and I do not think this year .	-5.3616
But , according to statistics , I am a black sheep for Halloween .	-1.9920
The majority of Americans – 158 million to be exact – celebrate Halloween this year , spending a total of $ 6.9 billion on sweets , costumes , and decorations , the US Association of Retailers ( NRF ) .	-4.1515
One thing I am looking forward to every Halloween is the trend .	-4.8196
The costumes will make up about 1.2 billion of the USD 6.9 billion spent , according to the NRF .	-3.3321
This year , off-going objects are the last cry .	-3.4061
Women no longer need to dress in sexy clothing , they can now also taste tempting food like pizza , hamburger or carttes .	-5.5260
As far as men are concerned , I expect a lot of Zombies thanks to The Walking Dead , and I bet that the Daft-Pun-Space formers will create it this year into the Instagram feeds .	-5.6573
According to Google , the most sought-after costumes are zombies , Batman , pirates and witches .	-3.1878
I suspect there is nothing wrong with tradition .	-2.5634
Last year we tasted our dogs and were not alone to my astonishment .	-3.2485
Indeed , Americans spend $ 330 million this year on costumes for their pets , according to the NRF .	-2.5753
These are a lot of hot dogs .	-2.3696
As far as sweets are concerned , we are not woolly .	-4.6369
Americans will spend $ 1.9 billion this year , The Nielsen Company .	-1.2004
These are about 270 million kilograms of chocolate bars , crushers , candies and rubber balls .	-4.2693
So good news for 41 million people , according to the US Department of Trade , who drag through the district with the slogan “ sweet or sour . ”	-4.7125
In fact , we will buy over 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and – let us not delude ourselves – eat .	-3.1840
The only thing we do not want to consume is the sugarsweet Candy Corn , yet 15 million kilograms of it is sold for Halloween , according to the National Association of Pharmaceutical Producers .	-4.9509
That is about nine billion corn grains .	-2.0522
It is a mystery that I have not yet been able to solve .	-2.6128
Nothing belongs more to Halloween than any house in which it acts .	-4.4816
They have great names such as " terror disabled the Wall " ( which , incidentally , is in a real prison ) , " Howl-O-Scream " and " The House of Shock " .	-4.3833
Indeed , there are 1,200 officially recognized spukhouses in the United States that make $ 500 million revenue , America Haunts , and that includes the wonderful photos that you are pinching into the pants and then put your friends on Facebook , where you won ’ t get them off again , and one of the types on which you stand leaves a comment like “ nice facial expression . ”	-8.9791
But we finally come to the pumpkin .	-2.6486
Charlie Brown became familiar to us with the great pumpkin when we were children , and the carving of a pumpkin torch is like the celebration of Christmas tree – something that we made of small .	-6.6428
Fortunately , the “ baby in the pumpkin ” trend began last year thanks to Pinterest , so most of us grew up with cutting the pumpkin and not sitting in it .	-4.6666
This year , Americans will spend about $ 106 million on their pumpkin , the US Census Bureau .	-1.7302
The pumpkin grenade , slowly spaying , is presumably from Illinois , where 245 million kilograms of pumpkin was harvested this year .	-5.9525
If you want to make the right points , you can call Tintin and Susan Mathisdon in Napa , California and let them take a little bit of their 921 kilos heavy boule .	-6.9793
Idyllic pet brand in Helmuggles	-6.4601
The fire brigade had to leave in Helmets on Thursday evening .	-2.8628
A three-family house in the County Court begins fire at night .	-3.4567
The rescue forces have a charred body from the house .	-4.2680
In the event of a fire in Helmuggles , rescue forces have found a charred body in a three-family house .	-5.4953
Whether it is a resident is still unclear as a spokesman for the police in Bayreuth said .	-4.3163
It was burnt on the ground floor of the house on the late Thursday evening .	-3.1453
When the fire brigade hit , the flames were already blowing from a window .	-6.3070
The staff went into the apartment and found the body in a room .	-3.5852
The room was clean and comfortable .	-6.1736
The entire ground floor has been damaged .	-1.6339
All other residents were not home during the fire , the police spokesman continued to declare .	-4.1335
For the time being , the building could not be habitable .	-4.2394
The precise cause of the fire was initially not clear .	-2.1428
Germany ’ s largest National Church has launched an offensive to promote the profession of pastor .	-3.1750
Background is a possible parish angel : The Evangelic-Lutheran Church Hannover expects that the number of its currently around 1,800 pastorialists and pastors will halve by 2030 .	-6.8447
Today 's young people are very attractive to the profession and offer good prospects for the future , said Pastor Mathis Burfien ( 43 ) in conversation with the Evangelical Press Service .	-5.6295
It is attractive to be able to determine the working and day process itself .	-4.6765
With Burfien , the National Church has for the first time commissioned a pastor to inspire young people to study theology .	-6.0676
At present , less and less young people choose to study theology after secondary school .	-3.6342
Burfien returns this to the process of de-organization : " God 's voice is quiet , the world is loud " .	-4.8650
The profession is characterised by great freedom and diversity .	-3.3944
I am Mr of the timing and I can set my priorities where it is important to me .	-5.1680
As a sea-planter , pastors could be very close to people .	-4.0889
They deserve as much as teachers and could live well from them .	-3.3072
To be sure , more is paid in the free economy , but theologians would have a safe employer to do so . , , and , , ,	-4.8273
This goes against the young people of today who are not just about careers but about decent work .	-5.1225
According to the National Church , which comprises three quarters of Lower Saxony , around 60 pastors are retired each year .	-4.4543
At the same time , about 40 graduates of a Theology degree begin their co-education .	-3.8678
In sparsely populated areas such as the Harz , Emsland , or the Wendland , it will be difficult to fill jobs in future .	-4.1865
Burfijn wants to host study days for young people and invite celebrities who have studied theology .	-6.1249
Theology studies offer a broad education .	-3.6705
It can even become the president of the Federal Republic .	-4.1161
Land Rover Rally Series announced	-1.0086
In the interior you will find racing seats and six-point belts as well as a free call system .	-4.9230
The options range from reinforced brakes , a service package with the support of Bowler workers and logistical support to vehicle set-up between events .	-5.3469
Drew Bowler , CEO of Bowler Motorsport , explains : “ The rally customers who come to Bowler have changed . ”	-2.6959
They are not all experienced riders , but people who are looking for excitement and adventure as well as an achievable way to world-class events .	-4.5199
We are pleased to be able to open this path in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format opens up new possibilities to experience the different Rally disciplines in Britain and abroad and to prepare newcomers for the matches and the reality of Rally Raid .	-6.3414
We really had fun developing the Defender challenge car – that will be an entertaining championship .	-3.4955
In addition , the Defensive Challenge is a training and test day in February and the option to participate in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East .	-4.6487
A fire brigade called the rescue of a bitch , stuck 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rocky protrusion in a quarry .	-6.7360
Cockerspanic female Ruby ran away after a minor accident .	-3.5420
Three days later it was discovered by a walking woman in a quarry in her predicament .	-3.8937
Fire-fighters picked up the rock wall and rescued the dog from safe death .	-4.0571
The fire brigade was able to bring a bitch in safety that stuck on a 15 meter high lead in a rock wall .	-6.3000
The nine months old Cockpantie-female Ruby had gone away after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before it was rescued from a quarry on Wednesday .	-5.2516
Scott Alderson , 25 , and his friend , Becky Hall , 20 , who owns the dog , came to the quarry Flappit in Denholme , West Yorkshire to receive Ruby again and thank the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service .	-5.4061
They desperately wanted their missing bitch and published help calls on social networks when they had disappeared after a small accident in the quarry .	-6.1488
About 2 : 15 am on Wednesday , a walking woman carrying out his dog saw the stranded Ruby on the 15 meter high paragraph in the quarry .	-6.8655
The technical rescue team at the Cleckheer Fire Station ran out and ropes up for Rubys ' rescue , which was then transported up in a dog box .	-6.2008
Andy Clayton , specialist in the technical rescue team , said : “ She was in a dangerous situation .	-2.9559
It was located in the middle of the cliff wall – 15 meters from the top and the bottom .	-3.8308
She didn ’ t move any muscle during her rescue – she was like stiff frozen .	-3.3592
But now it is doing well .	-2.2336
She then eaten a few dog cakes .	-2.8548
That was a rather unusual task .	-3.1606
The fact that the dog was discovered is unbelievable .	-1.6043
Peter Lau , specialist in the technical rescue team , said : “ Ruby had a huge success . ”	-2.5044
It was possible that she was very seriously injured or worse .	-2.9034
Ruby was brought to the vet , but didn ’ t notice anything except exhaustion and dehydration .	-5.5019
Becky Hall of Halifax , West Yorkshire , said : “ The rescue was scary . ”	-4.8459
I could not even believe that it was really up there .	-3.2844
It was wonderful to keep them back to the poor .	-2.2158
The veterinarian said that if exhaustion had become too large and collapsed , it would probably have crashed .	-3.6498
The firefighters have done great things .	-2.5363
It was really brave what they did .	-2.8850
We are simply so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible .	-2.7059
Scott Alderson from Keighley added : “ We were afraid that it would fall down , but it remained above . ”	-3.6400
The fire fighters were great .	-2.1516
I can hardly believe where she was .	-1.7196
Mick Jagger explained that he never rented Katy Perry when she was 18 .	-2.5940
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week the pop star said she was working as a backgrowth singer on Jaggers song “ Old Habits Die Hard ” from 2004 .	-3.7263
He said she had dinner with the old rocker and that “ he added me when I was 18 ” .	-5.8182
She added : “ This has been a long time ago and he was very nice to me . ”	-2.7995
In a statement , a reporter Jaggers , 70 , said on Thursday that he “ categorically denies that he has ever attempted approaches at Katy Perry . ”	-4.7575
The representative added : “ Perhaps she confused him with someone else . ”	-2.4380
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest appearance at this year 's Rolling Stones Tour .	-2.2142
Their new album " Prism " landed immediately on place 1 this week .	-3.1896
George Kerevan : European unbundling gives Scots the choice .	-4.7884
A new day , a new history of terror about independence .	-2.1625
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland is needed to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership .	-2.3460
This provides the keyword for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a narrow-wire border along Hadrian 's Wall .	-5.1298
In fact , the Strathclyde presentation highlighted the possible economic benefits that would bring more freedom of travel in the rest of Europe , but , as expected , this did not matter in the headlines .	-5.9809
Nor did anyone mention that EU member states often bend their strict rules when it is more convenient for them .	-4.4311
Since Scotland is not currently part of the Schengen area , continuing neglect for Brussels would be only a small concession in return for what the Scots really want .	-4.5093
So there is no story .	-2.2911
And one that has already come so in the years that it is already like a fossil : the first time I heard the “ independence means passport controls ” it heard at least 40 years ago .	-5.9826
An interesting point is lost when continuing to repeat this ancient story .	-4.8453
Why expect an independent Scotland to dance after the European pipe ?	-2.7419
Why trade the London yoke against that of Brussels , especially now ?	-2.9067
These are the real European news : the great post-war plan to unite Europe has stalled .	-4.6803
With the euro crisis , the European project has officially died .	-1.4167
Throughout the EU , parties are gaining ground that are hostile to the EU or want to throw the euro over as a common currency .	-3.0968
Even in Germany , the eurosceptic party Alternative for Germany – founded only this year – could win nearly five million votes in the September federal election , effectively excluding the Free Democrats ( the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats ) .	-6.1123
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe .	-2.3752
But the current economic crisis turns out to be a turning point .	-1.6335
Because of the harsh austerity policies imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank , in conjunction with the straitjacket in which the respective national economy is forced through adherence to the single currency , many people believe that the European project has gone too far .	-5.0916
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments creating excessive budget deficits – that was only the case in Greece .	-3.2210
Instead , the Eurosystem has identified its members with exchange rates , which are beneficial to German exporters – and would like German politicians to do so .	-4.8598
Without the possibility of devaluation of the local currency , southern Europe has recovered with a built-in productivity disadvantage vis-à-vis Germany .	-3.9943
The only way is to cut wages and public spending – spurred by Berlin .	-2.6132
There is a deeper European productivity problem behind the current budgetary and monetary problems .	-5.6773
As a result of the “ green ” energy directives imposed by Brussels – a code for subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – European industry pays twice for electricity and four times for gas , compared with the United States .	-3.5303
This is a crippling cost reduction , as we have seen in Grangemouth .	-2.9641
All wage clauses in the world do not protect the European petrochemical industry from being pressured by cheap American shale gas into the corner .	-4.3675
As a result , a revolt is rising , especially in France , the EU ’ s former cheerleader .	-2.3120
After the war , France ’ s political elite saw the EU as a vehicle for keeping Germany in check and raising Paris on an equal footing with Washington .	-2.9784
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy , and has pushed Europe up its own economic policy , fighting the struggling French economy .	-4.6320
The result : Marine Le Pen ’ s far-right , anti-EU Front National has just won a decisive reelection , leaving the ruling socialists in place three .	-4.7285
The National Front is France ’ s most popular party , with 24 % of the vote – a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a left-right divide would automatically bring benefits .	-4.8737
What is Le Pen doing with her new popularity among the white French of the working class ?	-3.1523
She would like to use the EU elections next year to forge an anti-EU , anti-Community monetary bloc in the European Parliament .	-3.1091
If the anti-EU parties do well in these elections – and that is very possible – then for the first time such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament .	-3.7290
That is the point I want to make : in the not-too-distant future , the growing distrust of the EU and the single currency will come together to eliminate the euro .	-4.4574
The EU will not disappear , but it will become more like the “ Europe of the ( sovereign ) nations , ” favored by General de Gaulle .	-3.0652
Germany and some of its satellite economies may stick to the euro , but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies .	-2.4280
I expect Britain to distance itself from this project in the hope of lumping up with the US .	-3.8225
But Washington ’ s growing interest in the Pacific region suggests that Britain will be alone in Atlantic rain .	-1.9714
Where does Scotland stay with all this ?	-2.8650
We can decide to be a region of ( and ultimately ) little glande .	-4.6053
Or we can defend our own economic interests – including talking to Berlin and Brussels about what they can stand for .	-4.1073
I suspect that Scotland could be a good thing if we retain our own currency in a more informal European network .	-6.8189
Cooperation with other similar countries is easier in a non-federated Europe of nations .	-2.7096
Otherwise , we should consider doing Norway the same and maintaining our economic independence .	-2.9014
The SNP government in Scotland is – remarkably – the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe , and won a spectacular majority in 2011 , owing to the rejection of the proposed ( and implemented ) cuts that the Labour Finance Minister , Alistair Darling , and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem coalition , had to answer .	-4.5615
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to opt for independence now , only to have austerity imposed on Berlin and Brussels .	-3.7182
Early puberty : Grow Up Speed	-5.1109
Afro-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white peers , as studies show .	-2.6089
Physical changes do not mean immediacy .	-1.8070
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible .	-1.2342
Experts believe that the epidemic of obesity is a factor of early puberty .	-2.0748
The early puberty trend is less pronounced by boys .	-2.9830
The former CNN correspondent Pat Ethereridge is a journalist who specializes in children ’ s health and family issues .	-6.5178
Should a mother be worried if her daughter grows breasts and pubhairs at the age of seven or eight ?	-4.4472
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando , Florida , the pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowice stated that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and a new standard .	-4.4692
“ I spend a lot of time bailing out parents – usually this is no sign that the puberty is now entering quickly , ” said Kaplowitz .	-7.2428
Obvious indicators of development , such as growing breasts , shambolic and body odors , show up in girls earlier .	-5.0128
However , there was only a slight shift at the age of the mensarch ( the first period of the mensarch period ) over the last 40 years .	-8.0822
In the United States , the average age is 12.5 years , slightly less than 12.75 in 1970 .	-2.0533
“ When the evolution of the breasts begins , it takes at least two to three years to the menarch , ” said Kaplovwitz , also author of the book “ Early puberty in girls : The essential guide to dealing with this frequently occurring problem . ”	-6.3108
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty advances .	-2.1148
It is controversial , which is actually the beginning of puberty , but it is “ early mature ” when the breast-enlargement is accompanied by a growth boost of eight years ago .	-5.6386
In most cases , the process is slow or stagnating – something that a pediatrician can monitor closely .	-2.8453
In the event of faster progress , tests may be shown by an endatologist to prevent serious problems such as tumour or cysts .	-6.8542
There are treatments that delay an early menstruation and the defense of another consequence : premature aging of bones , which may ultimately lead to growth inhibition , leading to lower body growth in adults .	-7.1830
The recommendations for medication or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child , the speed of development , the growth rate and the emotional maturity .	-3.7164
Psychosocial aspects are also important .	-1.5374
Kaplowitz is cautious about medicines , but he admits : “ The oppression of puberty can alleviate behavioural problems and feelings of girls , unlike their peers . ”	-4.9159
The other big problem is understandable : parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have the period .	-1.9313
“ They worry about maternity risk or about how to use the hygienic side , ” said Kaplovwitz .	-4.6473
“ It was a shock , ” a woman whose daughter received ten days .	-2.7286
Although there were first signs and we had talked about menstruation , it was emotionally unprepared .	-3.9912
She came scared and excited from school home because she was the first in her circle of friends .	-3.3331
There are many extensively published theories about the causes of early puberty .	-2.5594
But there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other food , chemicals in the environment , or sexual messages , would be the cause of the media .	-4.3117
boys get into puberty similar to girls earlier .	-5.2217
Kaplovwitz believes that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of obesity .	-2.6704
He supported the implementation of a study in 2001 about girls aged between six and nine years who establish a connection between body fat and entry to puberty .	-4.9096
Other studies support this conclusion , but there are many other factors that have played a part .	-2.5622
In that country , African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white counterparts .	-1.9022
There are different explanations for this .	-1.9004
Global seems to be influenced by early puberty of all kinds , from economic conditions to climate to genes .	-3.8190
Another puzzle : although boys grow face and pubaddiction earlier , the trend toward full former puberty is not as pronounced as in girls .	-5.0893
Other doctors at the AAP conference underlined the complexity of the issue .	-2.2993
The appearance of acne and pubhair is common even among babies and infants .	-3.1055
" We must be careful how to identify the true beginning of puberty , " said Dr. Lawrence Silverman , a pediatric endocrinologist at the Goryeb Children 's Hospital in Morristown , New Jersey .	-2.9908
Parents should not hesitate to consult their pediatrician how to talk to their child .	-2.4777
“ This can mean that you have to talk earlier than expected , ” says Kaplovwitz .	-5.2670
If you remain calm , the child usually reacts well .	-2.3235
Girls who flourish early need the insurance that the process is a normal part of life , even if it occurs earlier as intended .	-3.8890
Jumbo manufacturers argue in the face of large orders over seat width	-2.1947
Between leading aircraft manufacturers , there has been a dispute over the width of seats in the tourist class on long-haul flights , indicating the tone for a bitter collision at Dubai Airshow this month .	-4.5908
The dispute revolves around the range of seats offered to passengers on long flights in the tourist class – not always those who make the most of the effort , but this distinct space is the key to the efficiency claims made by the latest Airbus SAS and Boeing Co . aircraft .	-7.4446
This week , Airbus requested an industry standard requiring a seat width of at least 46 cm ( 18 inches ) in the tourist class , but the US archrival Boeing says that the airlines should decide .	-4.3355
At a time when aircraft manufacturers are competing to sell even larger versions of their two-engine long haul aircraft , and record orders are expected at the event from 17 to 21 November .	-6.1302
Like the rear part of the aircraft – in particular , if there are rows of nine or ten seats – it is crucial for the given economic results to deliver the new “ mini-Jumbo ” design .	-5.7324
Boeing claims that its modernized 777X handles 406 seats in the tourist class , which are more than 17 inches wide , allowing ten per row .	-5.5457
Airbus says that the competing version of the A350 will carry 350 people in 18 inches wide seats in the tourist class , with nine per row .	-5.4402
Aircraft giants often share Hiebe over technical details via advertising in the technical press .	-5.0607
Now , in front of the Dubai Airshow , where the 777X is expected to take the race with over 100 orders , Airbus is appealing directly to the public .	-4.9396
Recently , the company presented an advertisement that could be the beginning of a new advertisement war and showed donors an image in which three people would sit together in a restaurant , entitled “ Would you accept it ? ”	-6.5726
“ Boeing is proposing long-range flights in seats more close to regional turbo-rope , ” says Airbus Sales Manager John Leahy .	-5.9991
Given changes in eating habits , people are getting fatter , but aircraft seats have not changed radically .	-3.2485
Between the early 1970s , when Boeing 747 defined modern long-range journeys , and by the end of the century , the male average American weight increased by 10 % between 40 and 49 years , according to the data of the US Department of Health .	-5.0040
According to US health statistics , the United States male average man is 100,8 cm in the twenty-first century .	-6.2008
Airbus says that its Rivale is based on a seating concept dating back to the 1950s , when the average body size was smaller than the newly substituted " Jet Set " .	-6.7728
According to Airbus , research has been carried out that an additional tariff ( 2.54 cm ) per seat has increased sleep quality by 53 % .	-4.6509
Boeing denies Airbus ’ figures on its seats and says that it is not at the manufacturers ’ discretion to decide how airlines are to balance air fares and setup .	-6.3862
The company also explains that according to studies , the aircraft experience depends on more than the seating width .	-4.3816
“ It really is about giving airlines flexibility so that they can do what they believe to be successful , ” explains the aviation expert Kent Craver of Boeing .	-4.2471
They do not want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable .	-0.8624
They know their business better than anyone else .	-1.3821
Passengers are concerned with greater freedom of expression , but for manufacturers it is becoming increasingly an issue that can affect sales .	-5.3416
Behind the debate is a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least $ 700 billion at list prices in the coming decades , which could have a lasting impact on the export balance of the US or Europe .	-6.7831
As Reuters reported for the first time in July , the seating layout is the driving force behind the controversy over the new jets .	-2.4946
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest twin-engine long haul designs than the market leader in this segment , the 365-seat Boeing 77-300ER .	-3.3495
The Boeing statements on the results depend partly on the 777X being compared to its ten seats per row with the original design of nine seats in the 777 .	-4.0800
Increased costs per unit are still lower than those currently used with ten seats per row .	-3.5320
“ Boeing therefore places more seats on its aircraft to make it more competitive with our products , ” says Kevin Keniston , leader of passenger comfort at European Airbus .	-5.0391
On the other hand , analysts say that full cabins with ten seats per row for existing 777s indicate that many passengers have opted for closer arrangements , which could be accompanied by cheaper fares .	-5.3827
“ Eighty inches of seats would be great for passengers , but the reality is : from an economic point of view , the Airbus offer is controlled by the 777 threat , ” says Mary Kirby , an expert for cabin equipment , founder and publisher of Runway Girl Network .	-4.5881
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats , but rather a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can select .	-2.9419
The world ’ s travelers even wear bandages to measure the setup at the competition .	-6.5992
Even if they add comfort , all aircraft also offer high-density design for low-cost airlines and regional flights .	-6.3433
Airbus is offering a ten-year A350 , but has not yet sold , according to its .	-5.2242
Until recently , Airbus has stressed the importance of making cabins more adaptable and offering large seats in the corridors for some jets .	-4.4365
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets , experts say that the reputation for a new industry standard is likely to fall , but may distract from the wave of 777X sales .	-4.0009
New Anti-nicotine vaccine could make fun with smoking the Garab	-4.6489
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could spoil smoking fun .	-1.6643
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine for a lifetime .	-2.5398
More experiments are needed before human tests , which can still take a few years , but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said that the first results are good .	-4.9971
“ We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to stop and have tried all methods available on the market , but have seen that their nicotine addiction is stronger than those approaches , ” he said .	-5.6622
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been altered to contain genetic information on the production of nicotine antibodies .	-3.2045
The virus selectively infected the liver cells , which then produce a permanent stream of antibodies .	-2.0809
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain , which means that a smokers do not experience a nicotine high .	-4.5486
In trials of vaccinated mice administered by nicotine , their normal level of activity is equal .	-5.0534
By contrast , mice without vaccination had taken a “ time off , ” the researchers explained that the nicotine had reached their brain .	-4.7516
The experiments are described in the Science Translational Medicine journal .	-2.1312
Previous tobacco imposics failed because they contained antibodies .	-3.2299
The vaccination had to be given so often to maintain the antibodies that they were expensive and impractical .	-3.6002
But the cost of the new vaccine is probably considerably lower , because it transforms liver cells into antibodies factories .	-3.3549
As Professor Crystal said , a future vaccine could be used for people if he is sure to be given to children before they get tempted to taste a cigarette and thus prevent nicotine addiction .	-5.3791
But more likely is that smokers would use it to stop .	-2.4230
“ They then know that when they start smoking again , they no longer enjoy the nicotine vaccine , which helps them to remove the habit , ” he explains .	-6.0350
British scientists said that the results were interesting , but at the same time warned that further research was needed .	-2.6470
Tripodi denies having been influenced by Obeid	-1.4286
The former Labour Minister Joe Tripodi of New South Wales is going to launch an investigation by state corruption control .	-7.1879
The former NSW minister denies that he has changed the Maritime Charter regulations on the request of his political mentor , Edden Obeid , who had covert investments in three land estates in state-controlled land .	-7.8611
On Friday , the Independent Commission Against Corruption ( ICAC <unk> Independent Commission ) extended its studies on the question of whether Obeid has influenced various ministers of state to extend rents to the circular Quay , where the Obeids operated two restaurants and a café , without extending invitations to tender after the end of August 2005 .	-8.1582
Now , because of the accusation , Tripodi knew hidden interest in the land after Tripodi 's previous deputy chief Ashpole , had adequately stated on Thursday .	-8.4017
In years of discussions that began in 2005 , the government had pushed for public tendering for the rents .	-4.1370
The tenants were against this and wanted longer maturities .	-3.4488
In 2009 , the Pachtvearnings for companies were extended to the circular Quay , which brought the obscures $ 2.5 million annually without public tender .	-7.0568
Tripodi , who was the port minister from February 2006 to November 2009 , originally advocated public tendering .	-4.3843
But he contended to have made the changes to the requests of Obeid , who , as Tripodi confirmed , pushed for government reform of the Pachtreble .	-6.1808
A telephone written by the ICAC showed conversations from August to September 2007 between Obeid , Tripod , and Steve Dunn , a senior official who had moved to the port ministry after working in the fishing authority under Obeid .	-6.3932
“ If the issue discussed in these telephone talks was the preparation of commercial compensation rules ? ” , the deputy Commissioner , Anthony Whealy Tripodi , asked .	-5.5724
“ No ” replied Tripodi .	-2.4189
I cannot remember what was discussed , but that was definitely not .	-1.7900
Do not define between me and Mr Obeid .	-2.0941
Israeli warplanes attack Syria ’ s target , so official sources .	-2.7759
Israeli hunting aircraft would have attacked a target in the Syrian port of Latakia for Thursday , and a senior government officer at Fox News confirmed .	-6.4143
The official did not explain what the objective was , but said that it was at least one .	-3.7409
According to the Associated Press , the target was Russian SA-1255 missiles .	-3.6045
At least twice this year , Israel has already performed air strikes on missile deliveries in Syria .	-3.0189
Foreign workers with 457 visas may be subjected to ‘ Authenticity Test ’	-3.4499
In the context of expanded measures , the government is considering a “ security test ” for foreign workers with 457 visas .	-4.5859
If the test is introduced , it would be used by a criterion to prevent the 457 being used for the occupation of unskilled jobs or as the back door for bringing family and friends to Australia .	-5.6776
Today , a proposal for discussion by the government has been published after the previous members of the laboratory party , Maxine McKew , had condemned the government ’ s comments on foreign workers , because they could be regarded as offensive by Australia ’ s neighbors .	-9.3597
“ Strong declarations such as “ foreigners should be trailing behind <unk> and , first , hiring Australians <unk> are a very uncomfortable retreat in times when trade unions demanded a protected labor market , ” she told Australia Institute today .	-8.5158
Historically , it was said that white workers should be protected – and if some in the region hear an echo of this historic artifact , I would not be surprised .	-4.5907
The proposal for discussion outlines twelve measures that were once devised by former Minister for Immigration , Chris Bowen .	-4.6039
Immigration Minister Brendan O 'Connor , who visited Sri Lanka yesterday on human trafficking , has implemented five of the recommended changes , and the others are under consideration .	-4.2145
If the ‘ criterion of authenticity ’ is adopted , someone who is requesting a visa could be examined as to whether ‘ the application is genuine in cases where the applicant is related to or personally connected to the holder or relevant person of the supporting company ’ .	-7.5828
Moreover , firms could be required to account for the number of 45,7 visa owners , after hundreds have ended up in the past with companies that initially wanted to support a small number of workers .	-7.1082
Meanwhile , a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum probably died of a heart attack after arriving this week with a refugee boat on the Christmas island .	-4.7743
The disturbing ninth son of the man who came to Australia with him has been cared for by an adult cousin who was also on the boat since his father ’ s death on Wednesday .	-4.9707
Australian authorities brought the man to Christmas Island Hospital where he died .	-1.4542
A study has been announced by the British Government to increase the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland .	-5.9406
The work of HS2 Ltd proposes implementing high-speed links between Scotland and the North of England at the beginning of Phase 1 in 2026 .	-5.0267
Transport minister Baroness Kramer said that the project “ will bring Britain closer together ” .	-3.1096
The Scottish Transport Minister , Keith Brown , said that he was very pleased to work with the British Government on this plan .	-3.0344
Phase 1 is a new high-speed rail link between London and the West Midlands .	-1.6374
At the end of Phase 2 there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds .	-3.4827
In June , the government adjusted its estimated cost of building high-speed rail between London and the North of England from GBP 32.7 billion to <unk> 42.6 billion .	-3.2394
The UK Government , which talks with Scotland Transport , has mandated HS2 Ltd to seek further route capacity and travel time improvements for Northern England and Scotland .	-4.2747
This includes the possibility of a journey of eventually three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London .	-3.2968
Baroness Kramer said : “ Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network of routes bringing Britain and its cities closer together . ”	-3.4540
We are progressing with HS2 because it brings enormous advantages .	-3.1987
Without it , we face a crisis of capacity in our rail network .	-2.8952
But it is also about the connection between 18 British cities , including Glasgow and Edinburgh , which is improved thanks to HS2 .	-3.3704
The Scottish Secretary , Alistair Carmichael , commented : “ Today ’ s announcement is good news for Scotland . ”	-2.8210
On behalf of the Scottish Government , Keith Brown Carmichael asked for a “ unequivocal ” commitment to Scottish integration into the HS2 network .	-3.5326
Brown said : “ The high-speed rail link has enormous economic benefits for Scotland , but at the same time Scotland ’ s economic power is an argument for fast rail links across the UK . ”	-5.1416
That is why we are pleased to work as a partner of the British Government and to examine the options for a high-speed rail link in Scotland , which creates benefits for all and complements the Glasgow link , which the Scottish Government is already planning .	-6.2340
I look forward to examining the study report with the British ministers next year and to taking the next steps together .	-4.2639
Australian regulations on electronic equipment remain in force for the time being .	-3.4769
Australian air passengers must continue to shut down bilets and smartphones at startup and landing , despite efforts in the US to ease regulations on such devices .	-4.6727
The US Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) allows US airlines to change their requirements so that passengers on their devices can read e-books , view or play videos during critical flight phases , provided they are in “ flight mode . ”	-4.6984
During most of the flight , passengers are already allowed to do so , but many people find it annoying that they are not allowed to read their e-books when they start and landing .	-5.8912
However , Australian companies are not pursuing any immediate plans to amend their regulations to implement them .	-4.7173
The CASA Air Safety Authority also stated that it would look at the announcement , but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical flight phases in Australia still apply .	-5.5979
“ CASA has no specific regulations at present regarding the use of electronic equipment on the aircraft , ” was announced .	-5.6494
The subject is subject to provisions requiring airlines to maintain safety at any time and passengers to comply with the safety regulations provided by cabin crew .	-5.2360
Virgin has already had talks with the CASA about extending the use of its Wi-Fi entertainment system on flights and said that it is open to change , but it must be initiated by the legislator .	-6.5708
“ We would welcome a review of the accreditation of electronic devices by CASA , because we are convinced that this would improve customer experience after we now offer ( wireless entertainment ) during the flight , ” said a speaker .	-4.8767
Qantas said that the current rules will remain in place until further notice .	-5.1723
“ Our current directives stipulate that electronic devices must not be used at startup and landing , and we currently have no plans to change that , ” the company said .	-5.3123
The FAA rules apply to US airlines .	-1.3358
However , we are always interested in developments in regulations that can benefit passengers and will certainly look at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it .	-4.5083
The decision has different implications for US companies , depending on the age of the fleet .	-4.2543
They must prove that their aircraft can tolerate wireless disruptions through mobile devices , and change manuals , training materials , hand baggage programs , and customer charges .	-4.0471
“ After an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet , it can allow passengers to use portable , lighter electronic devices such as tablets , e-book readers , and smartphones at all levels , ” the FAA announced .	-4.8942
In rare cases , the crew will notify passengers while landing the equipment will turn off .	-6.1136
The group also recommended to store heavier equipment on landing and take-off safely under the seat or in the subjects above the seats .	-6.5316
In front of the reversby against Schalke , BVB trailers with luminaires provided ugly scenes in the Veltins-Arena .	-6.0619
Borussia Dortmund then announced hard consequences .	-3.2220
The Ultras responded with a silence before the Friday match of the football Bundesliga .	-6.3127
It was an unusual , almost haunting acoustics that offered the viewer the title of the German coach Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart in the Iduna Park .	-6.8525
Most of the visitors were listening with their voices .	-4.8811
The South Gallery , on the other hand , where the most loyal and loyal of the BVB fans are present , was initially very silent : no strings , no raids .	-7.4470
The Capo pedestal , which otherwise coordinates the joint fire , remained unseated .	-3.5923
And right at the front of the grandstand there was a big flag with the inscription " stadium ban " .	-6.1149
Only as a torkeeper Roman Weidenfeller , as always the first BVB player , burned short-term cheer .	-6.5878
When his team colleagues followed , there were vocal and floating scarves - but not everywhere .	-5.1946
Nothing happened in the central blocks of 12 and 13 of the South Gallery .	-3.7713
Also , Norbert Dickel ’ s career in the stadium was once again marked by the positive experiences of the last few days - Derbyvictory , victory over Arsenal , extension of the contract by coach Jürgen Klopp - did not result in a ceremony .	-9.4303
Just five minutes before the whistle on the Capo will play his podium - and the until then almost tangible tension was covered in a loud cry , as a crowd as usual asked the mood at the matches in the stadium .	-8.9756
As the last one , as always , was the South Gallery in the series - and finally here was once again the loudest place in the stadium .	-7.4016
And , at the latest , when the clamor of the South Gallery met the loud call ' Derbysieger stands up ' , everything was as usual .	-8.5942
The silence before has probably been a response to what has happened in recent days .	-4.3324
Shortly before he returned to the FC Schalke 04 , some of the participating BVB supporters had fired rockets into the spectators and fired on the pitch - and almost shot the goalkeeper of Roman Weidenfeller .	-9.2470
The game was delayed because of the chaotic scenes .	-2.9340
BVB-Boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had received the tips of the Dortmunder Ultras in his office - and believes Watzkes words , this was a rather unpleasant appointment for the fan representatives .	-5.3866
" There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra-movement , " the BVB boss announced on Thursday evening at a podium discussion in Frankfurt .	-3.6212
As an instant measure , Watzke subdued the Ultras a choreography for the home game against VfB Stuttgart .	-5.2731
" I have banned this , " he said .	-3.0261
We cannot give up the zero tolerance policy on pyrotechnics .	-1.3980
In addition , the Ultras have shown various ways of punishing them - until Tuesday , the time has come to choose one .	-5.4207
Otherwise , Watzke says , the BVB will set a penalty by the end of next week .	-2.7743
" This becomes drastic , " said Watzke .	-2.6926
One can look forward to the reactions in the southern gallery .	-4.7276
Deposit houses in Singapore , as the middle-class crisis has arrived .	-4.5284
In a deposit house in the Bendemeer shopping centre in Singapore , Janani Amirthalinga trades a golden armistice , a ring and a pair of earrings to pay the tuition fees of her daughters .	-4.3982
“ My husband and I have just bought a house because my whole money is there , ” says Amirthalinga .	-4.0971
Although she earned 3,000 Singapore dollars ( about 1,730 euros ) each month as an administrative assistant and her husband also work , the monthly family income does not exceed , she explains .	-6.4687
Indeed , demand in parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt is increasing – is so great that ValuMax , where she has made her exchange , has this week been the third deposit house listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange .	-5.5211
The catering of jewellery is not only a quick way to get money – 1,300 Singapore dollars in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also almost as cheap as an uncertain bank loan .	-4.1849
Typically , depositories in Singapore require an effective annual interest rate of 17 % , just above the 15.4 % required by the United Overseas Bank , a local lender with a branch in the same shopping mall .	-4.9791
Deposit houses , however , offer the advantage that there is no need to review creditworthiness or income evidence , which is why loans are faster than banks .	-5.8431
This is why millions of people in the region turn to deposit homes after families feel the pressure from rising living costs and increasing household and consumer debt .	-4.5415
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap credit , owing to easy fiscal policies in developed economies , families with lower and middle incomes are seeking deposit houses to compensate for the difference in fragile economies .	-5.2697
This week , the credit-rating agency Standard & Poor ’ s growing fiscal debt , mainly through rising mortgages , was a risk factor for Asian banks ’ creditworthiness .	-3.3858
Malaysia , Thailand and Singapore are estimated to have the Agency ’ s highest fiscal debt in Asia relative to GDP .	-3.4943
Malaysia is at the top of the list , with 80 % of GDP , an increase of 60 % in in 2008 . reserves reserves reserves , reserves , , , , and reserves .	-8.6488
People 's economy is also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand , which came out of a technical recession this week .	-3.9938
On Thursday , the data showed a continued weakness in exports and a decline in consumer demand .	-4.3156
“ At the end of the day , with rising costs , people in the middle to the lower segment ( the income scale ) will try to supplement their income wherever possible , ” said Song Seng Wum , economist at CIMB , a Malaysian bank .	-5.0625
Historical highs of gold prices over the last two years have reinforced the trend to pledge personal items , as people take the opportunity to turn family jewellery into cash .	-4.8577
In Singapore , about 70 % of the pledged items are in the 200 deposit houses of the City State Gold .	-4.0719
People say : “ The price of gold looks good , let ’ s mortgage grandmothers ’ gold chain and collect it back next month . ”	-5.5081
The largest Thai deposit company , EasyMoney , has seen 20 % customer growth in its branches in recent months .	-4.0938
The growth in deposit business is so strong that ValueMax , the operator of the branch in Bendemeer and 15 others in Singapore , wants not only to neighboring Malaysia – where the company is expanding four houses – but also outside Asia , says Mr. Lee Ching , director of ValueMax .	-5.7404

A $ 325 million Australian Relief Package for TasHealth	-5.4119
The Australian government insists on the harsh conditions associated with the $ 325 million bailout of Australia ’ s health-care system to ensure that the state ’ s government cannot waste the money .	-4.4378
Federal Health Minister Tanya Pliber has announced that the Commonwealth will take “ immediate action ” to avert a crisis caused by an aging population of the island state , a higher rate of chronic diseases and system restrictions .	-4.7822

“ The government has created an emergency rescue package , which we believe concerns the unique challenges facing the federal state , ” says Plibsek today .	-5.4229
The $ 325 million dollar package includes $ 31 million in emergency aid for election benefits .	-3.3341
Further 2600 operations , including orthopaedic interventions and treatments for gray Star , are expected to eliminate residues .	-4.8437
In addition , there is money for daily hospitals in Hobart and Launceston , better aftercare after fixed stays , specialist hospital training , mental health services and the introduction of an electronic system for recording health data in local hospitals .	-4.8577
“ These investments correspond to the ideas of those hospital staff who have told me that they are the best way to improve the Tasmania health system , ” said Tanya Plibsek .	-5.4350

As Wilkie said today , the $ 325 million would be of little use if “ they were not accompanied by real reforms that put the public Tasman health system on a more sustainable course . ”	-4.7767
Nevertheless , he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent assistance , which he first expressed to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May .	-3.7896
“ I am confident that federal aid will make a major contribution to removing the state ’ s public health system from the list of concerns , ” Wilkinson said .	-4.0729

But the German opposition ’ s public health spokesman , Peter Dutton , believes that today ’ s announcement is only a “ plastering solution . ”	-5.0370
“ We are in today ’ s position because the Laboratory Government has deducted $ 430 million from the health system , ” he said to ABC TV .	-4.6423
It cannot be that a state government cut almost half a billion dollars out of the system and the Commonwealth into 300 million , and then pretend to be good news .	-4.3575

Syria has destroyed its ability to manufacture chemical weapons , such as a monitoring group .	-3.0245
Syria has destroyed important chemical weapons and methane ammunition facilities , declared Thursday ’ s global chemical weapons surveillance group , while severe collisions occurred in the north of the country near one of the sites where suspected toxic substances are stored .	-6.1986
Also on Thursday , a Syrian activist force announced that more than 120,000 people had been killed soon after the civil war .	-3.6987
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons ( OPCW ) came one day before the date .	-3.4101
1 November , the organisation established in The Hague , Damascus , in order to destroy all chemical weapons installations or to make “ inoperable ” , including all machines for mixing chemicals to poison gas and filling ammunition .	-6.5149
The conclusion of this process , which is essentially the first stage of destruction , is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable aimed at destroying all Syrian chemical weapons by mid-2014 .	-3.6362
Destroying the institutions means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons .	-2.4761
Damascus , however , still needs to begin to destroy the existing weapons and stocks .	-4.1427
It is estimated that there are about 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons in the country , including Senfgas and the nervous gas of Sarin .	-3.7357
The announcement came at a time when there were fighting in Safira on Thursday , by experts saying that there was a production facility for chemical weapons and storage facilities , as the United Kingdom ’ s National Monitoring Centre for Human Rights said .	-5.5566
The activist group , following the number of dead over a network of activists in Syria , declared on Thursday that 120.296 people had died .	-4.3049
Of these , 61,067 civilians , including 6,365 children .	-2.0354
On the government side , 29,954 of them belonged to the army of President Bashar Assad , who were 18.678 pro-government fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militias .	-3.9757
Also among the dead are 2,202 despoiled army soldiers and 5,375 opposition fighters , many of them foreigners .	-3.4018
On 25 July , the UN estimated the number of deaths in this conflict to 100,000 since March 2011 .	-2.1760
This figure has not been updated yet .	-2.3974
The conflict has forced about two million people to flee the country .	-1.7952
Assad ’ s troops have been fighting for weeks in Safira against the rebels , many of whom have connections to al-Qaeda groups .	-2.7960
The observatory said that there were losses on both sides on Thursday , but did not mention any details .	-3.2938
The battles underline the danger faced by the chemical weapons inspectors , because their mission to liberate Syria from its toxic armory is a race against time amid a raging civil war .	-4.6227
According to the OPCW , working closely with the United Nations , the team “ is now convinced that it has seen and witnessed its destruction all important production and mixing facilities mentioned by Syria . ”	-4.3968
Therefore , “ no further inspection activities are currently planned . ”	-3.1108
At the beginning of the week , the inspectors had declared that they had completed the first round of checks and visited 21 of 23 of the places mentioned by Damascus . , , , and , , , , , , , and , . , , , , and , ,	-7.4284
Because of security concerns , the visit of two bodies was not possible , the inspectors said .	-3.1926
On Thursday , the OPWC declared that the two sites were “ abandoned ” according to the Syrian statement , and the existing objects of the chemical weapons program were moved to other so-called bodies that were inspected . ”	-5.5986
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two institutions that the OPCW inspectors could not visit .	-2.5874
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons , which will have to be approved by the OPWC Executive Committee next month .	-3.2583
“ I salute the bravery and the courage you have shown all in carrying out the most challenging mission ever carried out by this organization , ” Ahmed Ugandu , the Director-General of the Control Organization , stated in a comment published by OPCW .	-6.1715

Wrath of the Bali bombers ’ judgment	-3.3859
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the Bali bombings in 2002 responded to anger at the verdict of the last of the defendants , who were tried in court , as Umar Patek believed to have been shot dead by law .	-8.1345
Patek , who was on flight almost ten years as one of the most sought-after people of south-east Asia , was sentenced yesterday to a 20 year prison sentence for his role in building explosives for the bombing .	-5.9090
He could be released after 15 years of prison .	-2.2542
The 45 year old , the mass murder was found guilty of the attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta , where 202 people died , including 88 Australians , and many more were injured .	-4.9956

The Prosecutor 's Office demanded a life sentence , even if it could have applied for the death penalty for the man who , because of his reputation , is known as the ' Demolition Man ' .	-6.4200
The decision has raised painful memories at June Cortés , a mother from Perth who lost her 39 years old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the desolation caused by Patek and his co-conspirators nearly ten years ago .	-5.4628
With tears fighting she said that Patek should have been sentenced to death .	-2.2671

He fell into coma and “ died ” three times after the attack , one month after the attack , while he insisted on a life-support system .	-6.0440
Mr Hughes said that Patek deserved the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cell Jemaah Islamiah – Amrozi , Mukhhlas , and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the bloodbath and executed four years ago .	-4.2753
Indeed , this type should have the death penalty before all others .	-4.2229
To keep him alive – no , there is no reason to keep him alive .	-3.2987
20 years after killing 202 people and injuring many hundreds , it is not much .	-3.0390
Patek is the last of the bali-Bomber to be tried .	-3.4213
He took refuge almost a decade of arrest , but was eventually taken up in the Pakistani city of Abbott in January 2011 , where US forces killed Osama bin Laden ’ s former Al Qaeda leader just four months later .	-4.8072
During the negotiation , a FBI agent said that intelligence reports had indicated that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the goal of restoring the link between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda .	-5.6258
“ He did not stand , ” Corgen said .	-3.5539
Until recently , he has shown no remorse for how much suffering he has inflicted on other people .	-3.7446
The verdict came before the 10-year anniversary of the attack this year , which was held with commemoration ceremonies in Bali and Australia .	-3.7902
“ There will be many tears this year , ” Coralia said .	-2.3186
He may appeal against his verdict .	-4.1978
FAA : Passengers can now use electronic devices on aircraft ( but do not have mobile phone calls )	-3.7344
Passengers can now use their electronic devices to read , work , play , music and watch movies from departure to landing , not phone calls , such as the new directives issued on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) in the USA .	-6.7861
But passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately .	-1.3252
As soon as they were implemented , headed by the respective airline , FAA staff Michael Huerta announced at a press conference .	-4.8351
The airlines must prove to the FAA that aircraft complies with the new directives and that they have updated the training manuals of the airline crew and the rules for the dispatch of equipment in accordance with the new rules .	-7.5482
The FAA stated that it has already received plans from some airlines which wish to increase the use of portable electronic devices on aircraft .	-5.5121
Among these airlines were also Delta and JetBlue .	-1.9518
“ Depending on the condition of the plan , we could approve the extended use of electronic equipment very soon , ” the FAA announced in a statement .	-3.8081
At present , passengers must turn off smart phones , tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed .	-3.5383
They may not restart until the plane reaches a height of three kilometres and the captain gives the green light .	-4.6345
When entering the landing plane , passengers must switch off and not restart them before the plane landed .	-5.3988
According to the new directives , airlines whose aircraft are safe for electronic interference could allow their passengers to use the equipment also at launch , landing and on the roller field , the FAA stated .	-6.8860
Most new commercial aircraft and other aircraft that have been upgraded to larger heights for the use of Wi-Fi should meet the criteria .	-3.7296
Laura Glading , President of the professional association of professional cabin crew , welcomed the changes .	-2.2340
“ If the new regulation is certainly implemented – and we are working closely with the airline in this regard – both sides will benefit from it , ” said Glading .	-4.4973
To be honest , we are tired of having to feel like a trainer on this issue .	-4.9123
Nevertheless , Internet connections remained prohibited for browsing , mailing exchanges , text messages , or downloading data under three kilometres , the authority explained .	-5.2782
Passengers are asked to put smart phones , tablets and other devices in flight mode .	-3.4924
So still no “ Words With Friends ” , the Scrabble equivalent online game that the actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 , when he had to leave a jet of American Airlines to be public , because he refused to turn off the device while the plane was parked on the platform .	-6.0373
And heavier appliances like laptops must continue to be stowed away , as there is a risk of injury if they fly through the cabin .	-5.4238
Mobile phone conversations will continue to be banned during the flight .	-3.7802
The regulatory competence for phone calls lies with the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) , not the FAA .	-1.8424
FAA may ban certain electronic devices on startup and landing .	-2.5395
Last month , Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board , security expert for national traffic issues on CBS News , said that mobile phones would still be considered a risk .	-4.1993
“ Mobile phones are really a problem , not only because they could cause potentially disturbances in navigation devices , but because we know from the FCC that transmitting the air can also disturb the transmitter masts , ” said Rosenker .	-6.2336
A Advisory Committee of the Industry , which was set up by the FAA to investigate this issue , recommended last month that the government allow a broader use of personal electronic equipment .	-5.1982
In recent years , pressure on the FAA has increased to ease restrictions on use .	-2.6342
Critics such as the Democratic Senator Claire McCamll from Missouri argue that there are no valid grounds for banning it .	-4.1964
The restrictions are also becoming increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of the equipment has become ubiquitous .	-4.0289
Some studies refer to the fact that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore the departure of the device .	-5.0727
The FAA began to restrict the use of electronic equipment by air carriers in 1966 , after reports of disruptions to navigation and communication equipment by means of passenger connected FM radios , which were then the latest technology trend .	-6.9604
New aircraft are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft , but they are also designed in such a way and approved by the FAA that they do not make up any electronic interference .	-4.9403
Airlines have been providing passengers with Wi-Fi for several years now , when flight height is reached .	-5.2263
The aircraft fitted with Wi-Fi systems are also non-sensitive to interference .	-3.9046
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for the increased use of electronic equipment according to the new directives , said Huerta .	-4.0312
Today 's electronic devices generally give far less radio radiation than previous generations .	-2.9380
E-readers , for example , emit only minimal radiation when you convert .	-4.4220
But when downloading or sending data , the transmission values are stronger .	-2.6197
One of the advocates of a relaxation of restrictions on the use of equipment by passengers is Amazon.com.	-3.0715
In 2011 , the company staff picked up a passenger aircraft full of Kindle e-Reader and made a test flight to identify problems but could not identify .	-5.6938
Members of the FAA advisory committee expressed mixed feelings regarding the risk of using devices .	-2.3046
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said that the disruption of the equipment is real , even if the risk is minimal .	-4.8427
Other committee members said that there were only isolated reports from pilots who were talking about aircraft systems being disrupted , and most of them were very old .	-5.7533
However , the FAA Committee recommended that pilots arrange the departure of the aircraft by the passenger on landing instruments with poor visibility .	-6.7496
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and described them as a sensible adaptation for travellers , who would today be extensively equipped with technology .	-5.2407
“ We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not in conflict with security , ” said Roger Dow , CEO of the U.S. Travel Association .	-2.4580
Per air rescue service released bird rescued from North Sea Sea .	-5.0362
A bird caught by air rescue service on the coast , which was found exhausted on a North Sea boring island , was released again into nature .	-5.6795
The rale was flown last month with a helicopter to Aberdeen , where it was picked up by the Scottish animal welfare organisation , SPECA , in its papal rescue center in Alloa .	-6.6501
Colin Seddon , head of the center , said : “ This water rale was probably a winter marshal of northern Europe , which was stopped by the strong winds over the North Sea . ”	-5.7124
Apparently , the exhausted bird sought refuge on the boreisland .	-3.0714
He added : “ He could no longer fly , so we were contacted with the request for help . ”	-3.8130
When she was released , the watermark was again fit and healthy .	-4.4589
Is Europe ’ s elite ready to do business with Britain ?	-1.7927
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy to a table and defining what those who care for prosperity and work in Britain want to change in our relations with the EU .	-4.2160
To this end , we have commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey by British economic leaders , asking them what they think about Britain , the economy and the EU .	-3.3157
YouGov surveyed more than 1,000 executives from the economy , accounting for roughly British business sizes , sectors , and regions .	-5.4315
The results of the survey will surprise many .	-1.6258
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now exported outside Europe and are concentrated in countries that modernise and grow while the states in the EU are stagnant .	-4.8540
They want new trade links with countries such as China , India , and Brazil to be favored by government leaders , rather than holding back the long and demanding process of reforming the EU institutions .	-5.1152
Their view is that they are looking at certain issues that are regulated by law – from cartel law to product legislation – the majority of economic leaders believe that control of this key competence should be brought back to Westminster .	-7.4493
There was widespread discontent about the internal market , because , according to companies , the costs of Brussels ’ rules would now outweigh the benefits of being part of Europe ’ s trade zone – even 40 % of large companies voted for those traditionally most pro-Europeans .	-6.2561
Finally , and this probably says most , our survey of economic leaders found that a clear majority of Britain wants a course towards change to the agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade was not based on politics .	-5.6134
This insight , found among companies of all sizes and leading corporations , shows that the economy is pushing for a “ meaningful change ” that will bring the issue of action back to Britain .	-5.6874
There is a lot at stake – a change in the agreement and better conditions for Britain would lead to a change of opinion in favour of leaving the EU in a referendum at 16 % .	-5.6280
The Prime Minister should have no doubt : this survey shows that the British economy is behind his plan to renegotiate British conditions for EU membership .	-3.0628
It also shows that companies expect a significant shift in power relations back to Britain from renegotiation .	-2.6190
A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary after the eurozone moves toward closer economic and fiscal union .	-2.8960
The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain , as the result of our survey shows , which means greater attention to trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to rules .	-3.9040
Alexei Miller of Gazprom calls Gazprom ’ s pipeline in Bulgaria the beginning of a new gas era	-3.1698
The opening of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the start of one of the largest European energy projects , the Gazprom Board declared .	-4.0338
“ Today ’ s event is a milestone : construction work on the Bulgarian part of the South Stream gas pipeline , the largest and most important project in Europe , has begun , ” said Gazprom ’ s CEO , Alexei Miller , in a statement on Thursday .	-3.4162
The project is a key element in the energy security of the entire European continent .	-1.7387
South Stream is intended to provide Europe with more diversity in Russia 's export routes .	-3.4437
A treaty dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine , where most of Russia ’ s gas is stored for Europe , worries for an increased risk in conventional routes , as official speakers have heard .	-5.3421
Miller said that the direct link to Bulgaria , a member of the European Union , means that geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are “ eliminated forever . ”	-3.1669

Hearing the Royal Commission : Two YMCA employees are charged with charges against Jonathan Lord for sex offences .	-4.5597
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales ( NSW ) have been charged with sex crimes related to children before 2011 allegations have been made against child care worker Jonathan Lord from Caringbah , as the Royal Commission for Sexual Abuse of Children .	-6.1721
But at the opening statement before the Commission , YMCA said that “ there has never been any sexual abuse in the organisation . ”	-5.2856
The CEO , Phillip Hare , was interviewed about a case in which an YMCA employee was accused of committing child pornography and another case in which a sports teacher of YMCA Caringbah Hall was sentenced in 1991 for abuse of familiar children .	-7.7999
Hare said Gail Fury , one of the Commission ’ s assistants , that he knew of the first case , but did not know the second .	-3.8520
He acknowledged that the opening statement of the YMCA to the Commission was also imprecise as to say that “ there were external reviews of the YMCA , in which the YMCA was recognised at the forefront of child safety . ”	-7.1916
Evidence from the Commission rather shows that the YMCA has been informed that it has received the second lowest assessment of four possible levels in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities ( Department of Education ) in August of the year .	-5.0498
Hare , who started with 21 at the YMCA , acknowledged that the management of the company “ failed from me down ” in the recruitment of Lord and did not ensure that employees were aware of their obligations to report violations of the Children ’ s Safety Guidelines .	-6.1556
Lord had been sentenced to twelve boys at the beginning of the year for his two-year work for the YMCA .	-4.9617
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison .	-1.4731
Hare denied , however , that the YMCA had a cultural problem preventing staff from reporting violations of the law relating to children 's security .	-5.4423
The staff said that they had observed violations , including that Lord was alone with children , she was privately cared for as a baby sitter , she was sitting on his lap , to say that he liked it , and children had to play with his mobile phone .	-6.7284
Danielle Ockwwell , whose superior Lord was and who asked for a child protection training because she was worried about his behavior , said that the child service leader , Jacqui Barat , who was the chief of the YMCA Caringbah , was “ very sobering and most of the time very irrefutable . ”	-7.8789
The managing director said that he would not accept statements from employees that they would not have dared to report to their superiors .	-4.0329
Instead , he said , his friendship with Lord affected their judgement , which is why they had not reported him .	-5.5920
Hare explained that he told the Board of Management of YMCA NSW that the lesson the organization had to draw from the “ Jonathan-Lord-incident ” was “ not the posting ” by employees , and the Board approved it .	-6.6754
Hare said that the decision to urge employees to sign confidentiality obligations shortly after the allegations have been made by the managing director of the YMCA Children ’ s Services , Liam Whiteley .	-5.6056
He said that this should prevent contamination of the evidence , but that was “ overzealous ” and poorly implemented .	-5.0146
YMCA NSW was not a safe organisation for children at the time when Jonathan Lord was there between 2009 and 2011 , explained Professor Stephen Smallbone from Griffith University , an expert on sexual child abuse , the Commission .	-4.4861
He explained that there were “ serious problems ” in recruitment , verification , investigation , training , and staff supervision .	-2.7567

In an interview this evening on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his retirement , the 59-year-old announced his views on various domestic issues .	-3.4656
Since his resignation in June 2007 , after a decade of leader , Blair has largely avoided expressing his views on British politics , and his comments are mostly limited to foreign policy and his role as envoys of the Quartet of the Middle East peacemakers .	-6.1128
On the question of whether he would like to return to the Prime Minister ’ s office , Blair was quoted in the words of the Evening Standard from London : ‘ Yes , safe , but it is unlikely that this will happen , that is ... ’	-6.0686
When the equestrian experts gathered in droves in Cardiff to select the horse of the year , they knew that a tough competition was imminent .	-5.0628
No one was prepared for the three-year-old Fenton Kirklevels .	-4.3446
The Knirps , who is not even in the kindergarten and did his first steps a few months ago , and his Shetland-Pony Toffee seeped loose through the three rounds and won the first prize – leaving 30 adult opponents behind .	-6.5274
The broken couple , both equally large , were praised for their appearance , behavior , and style during annual competition organised by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff .	-5.8973
At his appearance in competition against men and women with elegant melons , he had pitch his nose tired in a snout angle and took the two years old toffee through the ring .	-6.7776
Fenton was praised by the judges for his natural skills in dealing with the pony , which lasted well beyond his age .	-4.3956
And Toffee received best marks for his appearance and personality .	-2.1039
Fenton had received Toffee last March as a gift to his third birthday and since each day practiced with Shetland-Pony .	-4.0869
His mother , Donna , 30 , said : “ Fenton and Toffee are a great talker . ”	-2.2036
They had to compete against the entire entry field and went out with Goldpokal and Rosette .	-5.3623
It was only the second time that he had participated in a contest with Toffee , and we were all enthusiastic when he won .	-3.9323
Complete strangers in the arena thought him so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him .	-4.5061
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale , South Wales , follows the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howell , who has been leading horses for over ten years .	-4.8214
Howls told : “ The whole audience was like an electrical one and everyone threw it and glued it . ”	-6.3404
He ran to sand all the length of the Arena and , although he looked so tiny , he did a fantastic job .	-4.1513
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses , tractors and farms and has two chickens to take care of .	-3.2133
As he has started , it will not take long for him to be on the “ horse of the year ” – and I am sure he will do well .	-4.2172
A speaker of the annual horse show said : “ Fenton is only three , but he knows how to deal with his pony . ”	-2.6898
Together they are a great team .	-1.0263
The jurors assessed Fenton and Toffee after how well they were beaten and presented in the lead ring .	-4.1737
They care about good cooperation between pony and guide – and there were Fenton and Toffee the best in the ring .	-3.9218
I am sure Fentons ’ s sweet clothing has done its part to suit the occasion perfectly .	-5.1431
Chinese newspapers are to be called “ reformed . ” :	-3.8983
A Chinese newspaper calling on the front page for the release of a reporter charged for defamation to be reformed declared a press regulatory .	-5.0702
Guangzhou New Express printed a rare public call to release journalist Chen Yongzhou .	-2.4294
But Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to falsify reports of a benevolent firm .	-3.3675
Now , the New Express is subjected to “ comprehensive authentication , ” the regulator declared .	-4.1145
The restoration order was made by the International Press and Publications Authority , Radio , Film and Television in Guangdong .	-6.1323
The preliminary investigation revealed that , between September 2012 and August 2013 , the New Express , which is part of the Yangcheng Evening News Group , published several false reports on the publicly traded company Zolion .	-6.1254
“ The editorial leadership of the New Express was unordered , ” the regulatory authority announced in a statement .	-3.4146
She said he decided to “ impose an administrative punishment for Chen Yongzhou and remove his reporting license . ”	-4.2784
In addition , “ Yangcheng Evening News Group has been instructed to undertake a complete re-examination of the New Express Group and has recommended that the relevant authorities be identified at the New Express and immediately check the New Express leadership team . ”	-8.5920
Chen had written several articles for the New Express in which he reported alleged financial irregularities for a manufacturer of construction machinery called Zoision .	-5.1379
After he was arrested , the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and advocated his journalistic work .	-3.1924
But then Chen appeared on State Television and admitted that he had published false reports for payment .	-3.7196
“ In this case , I damaged Zolion as well as the entire news industry and its ability to win public confidence , ” he explained to the state news broadcaster CCTV .	-5.1775
I did it primarily because I was on money and fame .	-2.7789
I have realised that I was wrong .	-3.4095
Following Chen ’ s apology , the New Express released an apology on the front page and said that it failed to check the reports correctly .	-3.9640
Several well-known suspects have recently taken television confessions .	-3.3685
Experts say that confessions are still being routinely imposed , despite a legislative amendment at the beginning of the year in which the authorities were forbidden to force anyone to blame themselves .	-4.3900
Drug tunnel discovered with its own railway between the US and Mexico	-3.7053
One of the most refined tunnels for drug smuggling between the US and Mexico , which was fully equipped with lighting , ventilation and electric rail operations , has now been discovered .	-4.7281
The US authorities described the 120 times 90 centimetres measuring tunnel as one of the most sophisticated passages they would ever have found .	-2.8657
The tunnel , which runs in the zigzag pattern over a length of almost six football fields , connects warehouses near Tijuana , Mexico , and San Diego , USA .	-4.5098
There are countless unbreakable warehouses in the area , making it easier to hide trucks loaded with drugs .	-4.3910
The tunnel was closed before drugs could be transported unawares , the authorities explained .	-4.6031
During the discovery of the tunnel , eight and a half tonnes of Marihuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were secured , according to the records of the court .	-5.0746
Three men who , according to the authorities , worked as drivers were charged for the ownership and intended sale of Marihuana and cocaine .	-3.5359
They threaten prison sentences of ten years and for life in a sentence of guilt .	-4.0396
In Nogales , Arizona , smuggling engineers rely on an extensive underground network of drainage channels .	-4.3751
The tunnel is the eighth large passage discovered in San Diego since 2006 .	-2.2199
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered in October after the Marihuana harvest in central Mexico , which challenges drug cartels to bring their product to consumers quickly .	-4.8963
In 2010 , authorities found a passage of about 640 meters with rails , which went from a kitchen in a residential building in Tijuana to two storehouses in San Diego .	-5.7597
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr are still love .	-1.9050
Actors Orlando Bloom and Model Miranda Kerr want to go separate ways in the future .	-2.8453
But in an interview Bloom said that he and Kerr still love .	-1.8127
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are two year old Flynn parents .	-2.2502
Actors Orlando Bloom spoke about separating his wife , Topmodel Miranda Kerr .	-2.6988
In an interview with US journalist Katie Couric , which should be broadcast on Friday ( local time ) , Bloom said , " life is sometimes not exactly what we plan or hope for " .	-4.4077
Kerr and his own loved ones still , the 36-year-old emphasized .	-4.7226
" We will support each other and love as our parents on Flynn " .	-4.0677
Kerr and Bloom are married since 2010 , born in 2011 their Sören Flynn .	-3.1395
According to Lexika , veganism is based on vegetarianism , but differs greatly from this one .	-4.5765
Because while vegetarians allow themselves to be eaten by cream , ice or a strong Edam , these feasting are not on the menu of a vegan .	-5.6982
Milk , cheese , egg , besides being deprived of meat and fish , the vegan leaves from all kinds of products - honey is also denied .	-6.6126
Whatever remains , one might wonder , but on closer examination the vegan nutrition world is characterized by a considerable ingenuity .	-5.0957
" Brokers are very popular " , explains Ute Henkelmann , the owner of the local reform house , which holds a variety of special products for vegans .	-4.2972
Reuter is also happy to visit the shop at Domgasse .	-3.5471
For 13 years , the native New Zealand vegan has been living in Lamperheim , where he ( almost ) finds everything he needs to live . " In 1997 I introduced my diet and became a vegetarian " .	-6.7823
At the turn of the century , the next step was taken , and I became a vegan .	-2.4277
" The conviction came not only because of the diet but because of the choice of shoes , " says Proctor , who prefers art leather in normal leather .	-5.4055
He recognized that it goes without animal products in other everyday matters as well .	-5.2551
In the first place , vegan is his ethics .	-5.9862
" I do not want animals to die for me " , explains Proctor the maxim of the Vegans , which covers all consumption behaviour .	-4.1149
Instead of whispering boards , mixers or rubber balls , the Vegan quickly discovered new products that increased enthusiasm .	-5.8342
" It is a double bonus , " says Proctor today , " actually represents vegan is not a waiver , not an Askese , but an enrichment " .	-4.9651
And it was these conditions that allowed some people to fail as well .	-6.1866
" The addiction factor is a very important factor that allows many to give up quickly , just like smoking , " Proctor makes a comparison .	-5.3265
And it is said : " Certain tastes are not tied to the animal " .	-6.5111
It is often the spices or the type of preparation that make up the taste .	-3.8968
" You can create the same effect in another way , " explains the vegan .	-4.3807
Proctor also has a barbecue with avocado , champignons and also a few vegian sausages .	-6.6027
It pays attention to a balanced , varied diet , where it can taste tasty tasty tasty tasty .	-7.3912
Of course you want to have some teeth , that is legitimate .	-3.8622
" It is to taste , but it is not just to reduce it to animal food , " explains Proctor .	-4.2855
Health damages up to eating disorders , another widespread assumption , he did not suffer .	-3.3370
For me , the changeover had a positive aspect .	-3.2447
I don 't take a foreign cholesterol and I have an increased vitamin percentage .	-3.8125
There are high performance athletes who only eat vegan .	-2.5008
" My blood values are excellent , I can check me often " , betrays Proctor .	-5.0156
In particular , against the lack of vitamin B12 , many vegans critics warn .	-3.6042
" Because animals are fed with animal feed instead of scaring on the pasture , it is questionable whether in the meat you buy in the refrigerator the vitamin B12 proportion is high " , explains Proctor .	-5.3727
Vegans also have the possibility to take the Coenzyme in the form of tablets .	-3.9054
" My B12 values are fine , " he explains .	-1.7994
There is no need for Proctor to go for food procurement .	-3.6602
There are basic foods everywhere and every supermarket now has soya milk and other products .	-4.3349
I find everything I need on the ground .	-2.6765
I am buying something special only from time to time .	-3.6407
" Many people overlook the fact that only finished products are expensive , but this is the case with " ordinary " finished products as well .	-5.1928
In any case , the preparation of vegan dishes is much cheaper and less time-consuming than is generally assumed .	-4.7034
" There is much to discover in the kitchen , with a few small cups you can achieve good , if not partly better results , " says Proctor .	-4.3268
Proctor was able to impress his son-in-law , thanks to his savanna cheese cakes .	-8.1534
Family celebrations give the vegan a new flavour .	-4.0004
The dynamism of cooking together is a new priority .	-4.2938
" The situations that can arise are as different as the people themselves " , says Proctor .	-2.5522
Of course , he has already been skeptical .	-3.2348
Do you not like my food anymore ?	-4.5641
" Should I feel bad now , because I drink milk ? " - you must act as a vegan with dexterity .	-5.5948
" I do not reject the people , I am part of this society , " Proctor does not want an enclave period .	-4.5781
And , more precisely , the everyday world does not seem as much as imagined - and does not restrict the community as it is commonly thought .	-7.9025
Fast Food is also allowed .	-1.6338
There are no translations available.Pommeres gibt es everywhere !	-4.4721
" Many Dörner damage offer falafel , or just a vegetarian Yufka " , says Proctor .	-3.6652
In a pizzeria he differs on pasting , or ordered a pizza without cheese , all a matter of habit .	-5.1299
The restaurants are so slowly geared towards this .	-3.8792
" When I started to eat vegan 13 years ago , everything was much more difficult , " the New Year can find a development : " You have to talk to people , draw them to attention " .	-6.0094
" If there is enough demand , they may be inclined to add the menu , " he hopes .	-4.2349
Vegane restaurants develop , such as Kombüse in Mannheim or Café Vogelfrei .	-3.1838
Proctor wants other restaurants to have at least one vegan meal on the menu .	-3.1741
Essentially , organs are there for all .	-2.5931
Everyone can eat them , so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive .	-2.0719
On the other hand , meat dishes are exclusive , in the true sense of the word , because they exclude others , " Proctor states .	-4.3432
" If you want to avoid food scandals , then veganism is a safe way to make the most out of the box " , says Proctor .	-4.2836
However , buying vegan products can be rather difficult at the beginning .	-4.3015
In particular , when you learn to understand that substances are also included in peanuts , you seem to have to rely on the courage to follow ethics on so many hurdles and traps .	-8.5873
Not only for this reason , Reuters Proctor and Lars Thomsen have written a book : " Veganissimo - animal ingredients and their alternatives " explains the many ingredients in the food , but also cleaning agents .	-7.7919
" After and after you develop a scanner view and know what characters and logos you have to respect " It 's sometimes better to take small steps than usual or stumble " , says Proctor .	-6.2079
Veganism , it is an important moral pointer that points to awareness .	-2.9695
Perhaps he does not entirely manage to regulate his habits , but at least he can teach the consumer to critically question his habits .	-5.0110
The stock exchange operator Nasdaq OMX keeps his customers breathless .	-3.4792
The trading at Nasdaq Options Market was interrupted on Friday afternoon of German time .	-3.0763
In a communication , the operator was responsible for technical problems .	-2.2263
The other eleven US option markets , including two of the Nasdaq OMX , continued their business unhindered .	-3.0842
The recent incident continues a whole series of smaller and larger failures with the stock exchange operator .	-4.1794
Only on Tuesday , the Nasdaq indices were not calculated for an hour due to errors in the data transport . , , , etc .	-4.7981
In August of this year , there were two mishaps alone in a week .	-5.8790
First , the US investment bank Goldman Sachs had sent massive faulty buying orders to the options markets due to technical problems .	-4.0458
As a result , the stock exchange operators took almost a whole day to check and cancel the order .	-5.5403
Two days later , half of the total share trading in the US was stalled for several hours due to a computer panic at the Nasdaq-Börse .	-4.7085
Moreover , Facebook ’ s stock exchange was overwhelming last year .	-5.5168

Konstanz : Radler drives 63-year-old people around	-3.3441
According to the police , the accident occurred when a 26 year old man was on Thursday evening , at 22 o 'clock with a female driving wheel in contravention of the road from the station in the direction of market place .	-7.8018
When , suddenly , a 63 year old man walked from a restaurant , the bicycle driver , according to the police , could no longer slow down in time .	-7.1064

British police Assange issue an extradition claim .	-5.5858
The British police have today sent a proof of extradition to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange , who has sought refuge and asylum in the Ecuadorian embassy in London .	-3.7686
Scotland Yard said that a 40-year-old Australian was delivered with a “ call to stand up , ” calling him to appear in a police station , and added that if he did not do so , he threatened him with arrest .	-7.8781
Assange is threatening to extradite to Sweden for charges in a sex offence after his ability to do so under British law has since the Supreme Court rejected his opposition to extradition at the beginning of the month .	-6.1637
As he fears that Stockholm will deliver him to the US , he sought refuge in London on 19 June in the Ecuadorian embassy and asked the South American country for political asylum .	-4.3249
Scotland Yard sent a “ 40-year-old man an invitation to join a police station at a time we were elected ” , a speaker said .	-7.2632
He continues to violate the terms of his release for bail .	-1.5080
The message made no comment on the delivery of the police call .	-4.2033
Assange fears that he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States and indicted for possible charges of spying charges after having published more than 250,000 diplomatic messages on the unveiling website WikiLeaks .	-5.3747

Tax on foreign real-estate owners versus London ’ s speculative bubble	-2.2692
The Treasury has provisionally calculated the CGT measure , but is still waiting for the final decision by Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne , who had imposed a 7 % tax on homes in the 2012 budget , costing more than two million pounds and annual fees for buyers who hold housing as a company and not as individuals .	-7.1523
Already , revenue from the stamps tax on residential property in Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea , which amounted to <unk> 708 million in fiscal year 2012 / 13 , combined revenue for Northern Ireland , Wales , Scotland , north-east , northwest Yorkshire , and the Humber region .	-5.9562
Cook said : “ After the increases in the stamp tax on high price housing and the introduction of related legislation against evasion , it is difficult to claim that high quality real estate is taxed too low , regardless of the impact of the obsolete municipal tax system . ”	-6.7527
“ But this move could make some foreign investors more cautious about buying real estate in London , or discourage owners from selling , ” he added .	-3.3047
First-class properties – the top five to ten percent of the housing market at a price – increased by a record of 11.8 % last year in the affluent London Southwest Belt , which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon .	-5.5823
The prices in Central London had an annual growth of 5.6 % , but were overshadowed by an emerging domestic market , which saw an upward trend for the southern western part of the city , the north ( 7.4 % ) , and the east ( 6.5 % ) , such as an investigation by Saviff .	-6.1725
Scientists could shed more light on the correlation between a dog ’ s tail with its mood .	-3.2540
Previous research showed that happy dogs with the tail woke more to the right ( from the point of view of the dog ) , while nervous dogs were the left side .	-4.4726
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive these subtle differences and react to them .	-2.0689
Professor Georgio Vallorgara , a researcher at the University of Trento , said : “ In humans , it is well known that the left and right brain half react differently to stimuli that produce positive or negative emotions . ”	-5.1773
Here we tried to look at other species .	-2.9360
He also observed that in dogs , just as in humans , the right brain half is responsible for the movement of the left and vice versa , and that the two hemispheres played different roles in feelings .	-3.4834
In order to learn more about how dogs react to their fellow monsters ’ side swings , researchers watched the animals while these films were directed at other dogs .	-7.5687
They measure the heart rate of the pet and analyzed the behavior .	-4.0789
We will probably soon understand why the tail is moving in one direction , one time in the other .	-5.2796
Professor Vallorgara said : “ We have shown dogs ’ films with dogs – either a naturalistic version or a silhouette to eliminate any other aspects , and we have been able to control the movement of the tail more to the left or right . ”	-6.7234
If the animals saw how an otherwise expressive dog moved the tail to the right ( seen from the perspective of the weaning dog ) , they remained completely relaxed .	-3.7782
But if the tail surge was primarily left ( again from the perspective of the dog that wedelt ) , their heart rate rose and they looked restless .	-7.1306
According to Professor Vallorgara , dogs do not intentionally communicate with each other through these movements .	-3.0537
Rather , he is convinced that the dogs had learned from experience in which movements they should worry about and when not .	-4.4371
He said : “ If you have different encounters with other dogs and flirting with the tail in one direction is more associated with friendly behavior and the right side produces less friendly behavior , then you react on the basis of these experiences . ”	-6.2693
The researchers say that the findings of dog owners , veterinarians and trainers could help to understand the emotions of their animal better .	-4.4538
John Bradshaw , an expert on dog behaviour and guest grants at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Bristol stated that this was not the first study to examine whether left and right is important for dogs .	-5.0108
Last year , a team at the University of Lincoln found out that dogs turn their head to the left when they see an aggressive dog , and to the right when they are a satisfied dog .	-4.3268
In another research at the University of Victoria in Canada , “ dogs tend to go to a robot dog if his tail <unk> flies left and not right , rather than becoming restless – exactly the other way around than in the Italian study . ”	-6.4888
According to his statement , the differences could therefore arise that in the various studies dogs did not interpret the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs .	-5.2626
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could help , he explained .	-1.8847
“ While there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two brain halves are used for different purposes , many of the details still need to be determined – and dogs are no exception , ” said Bradshaw .	-4.1342
But since their behavior can easily be captured , it will probably not take long to understand why the tail sometimes moves in one direction , sometimes in the other direction .	-5.0890
Arctic Monkeys Move Performance in Glasgow due to Alex Turner ’ s illness .	-3.8240
The rock band Arctic Monkeys has moved an appearance in Glasgow after their lead singer has been exposed to throat inflammation .	-5.2995

Pope Francis appoints the first cardinal in February	-2.1681
Pope Francis will be appointed for the first time on 22 February , as the Vatican announced on Thursday .	-3.5783
Cardinal ’ s are the highest clergy in the Catholic Church after the Pope , and they are also the ones who elect a Pope , so that Francis will appoint the first group of men who will ultimately participate in the election of his successor .	-5.8317
At present there are 201 cardinal channels .	-2.8097
However , a Cardinal who has reached an age of 80 can no longer take part in the election of the Pope – that falls to a group of 120 “ eligible Cardinal Pools ” .	-5.8212
In a declaration in which the message was announced , Father Federico Lombardi , a spokesman of the Vatican , said that there will be a meeting of all the Cardinal before the ceremony will be held for the appointment of the new Cardinal , also known as a istorium .	-8.4079
“ Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision to convene the constitution in February in advance , so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinal priests from around the world can be planned , ” said Lombardi .	-5.5254
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of eligible cardinal channels will probably have fallen by February .	-4.2975
He explained that a Pope usually had as many Cardinal channels as necessary to return to 120 the number of eligible cardinal channels , and so many priesthood over 80 , as he would .	-7.7244
The constitution next year is important because it is the first since the election of Francis in March of this year , Valero says .	-3.6271
At the moment there is a certain overhang on the part of Europe and , in particular , Italy .	-3.5682
“ It will be interesting to see if the new Pope appointments appointments appointments from the rest of the world to restore the balance , ” he said .	-3.2621
Forty per cent of Catholics live in South America , but they have only a tiny number of cardinal generals .	-3.4441
The cardinal also will be the first to be appointed since the formation of the Cardinal Council , founded by Francis , a group of eight cardinal generals from all over the world who have the task of finding ways to reform the Church .	-5.9673
In the past , the Pope chose everything alone .	-2.3604
“ Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinal channels to help him , ” said Valero .	-3.4096
He said that it was “ possible ” that Francis would ask the cardinal questions for advice .	-4.3141
But , so far , we have not been in this position – all of this is completely new .	-4.9748
Valero said that the bishops of large places would typically call a Cardinal , but Francis is “ full of surprises – so we do not know whom he appoints . ”	-5.6020
GM calls for new pick-up trucks in the US to repair the seat backrest	-3.3506
General Motors is calling back almost 19,000 of its brand new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra-Pickup trucks in 2014 to solve a problem with the manually adjustable seat backrest , such as a communication by the US regulatory authority for vehicle safety on Friday .	-6.8027
Some of the cars may have a defect in the mechanism for putting back the front seat backrest .	-4.5350
For this reason , they do not comply with the German automotive safety guidelines for head restraints .	-4.1517
“ When driving from behind the vehicle , it is possible that the head restraint does not properly protect the occupants , so there is an increased risk of injury , ” was read in the news on the National Highway Traffic Administration ( NHTA ) website .	-7.2062
The models recovered were produced between 1 August and 10 September .	-2.3962
The delivery of GM-trucks began in June and represents the most important model start of the leading American car manufacturer since the insolvent restructuring in 2009 .	-4.5976
GM informed the vehicle owners of the defect in the first half of October .	-2.8441
The NHTSA was unable to check the letter of notification due to 16-day Government shutdown , which had a negative impact on car sales in October .	-5.0290
The sale of the Silverado and Sierra Trucks , which were newly developed for the 2014 model year , increased by 20 % in the first ten months of the year , GM declared on Friday .	-5.1060

The Desperate of an Obama Vot	-2.2756
I have twice elected President Obama in the hope that change will be possible .	-2.5102
He says Obama has made laudable efforts made by the Republicans ’ blocking tactics	-3.3790
The blockade policy does not apologize for Obamacare 's website problems , the drone attacks	-4.1853
Obama ’ s Memoir about the 2008 election campaign was a sad reminder of what would have been possible .	-3.0591
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second year student at Harvard Medical School .	-2.7584
I am reading a terribly sorry book .	-2.9497
It is a book from which I believed that it would bring me to the heart of my second year of medical study and give me hope .	-5.9092
It is called “ The Audacity to Win ” and describes the memoirs of Barack Obama for the presidential election in 2008 .	-3.8350
When I am finished with my patient writings in the evening and go to bed , the book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions and took breath away from a talk .	-7.0603
The election was a landslide victory , and news spokespersons held to bear in mind the historical importance of this hour .	-6.3685
My classmates cry with joy and my parents gathered all the newspapers they could find .	-2.7802
A young team of visionaries was on the way to the White House and the nation was ready for change .	-2.0043
When Obama changed office in 2008 , he had 82 % approval ratings .	-3.4060
And then I finish the book .	-1.9074
Switch back to the present is a bad awakening as if one is taken out of a dream .	-5.1305
It is difficult to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague memory , a sad reminder of missed opportunities .	-2.3489
In the years since I first voted , something has actually changed .	-3.3012
But it is nothing I could have imagined .	-2.0853
I recognise the great and diverse things that Obama has achieved , from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for Health Care to the military withdrawal from Iraq , the end of forced homosexuality in the army , and the killing of Osama bin Laden .	-4.5437
I , too , believe that party policy blockades have thrown too many aspirations to move our nation forward : immigration reform , a public health insurance option , and the closure of Guantánamo Bay , to name but a few .	-6.0098
But , having defended the Obama administration on countless occasions against colleagues and acquaintances , I have come to the end with my attempt to explain .	-4.4798
I have reached a point of political despair .	-1.2534
The republican blockade policy cannot explain why the interception of foreign leaders or the killing of innocent children by drones overseas is allowed .	-3.6393
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data about Americans ’ private lives , and why whistleblowers are being punished who disclose government misconduct .	-3.8534
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaiki , an American citizen , was murdered without trial , nor can public funding and spending limits be circumvented during the presidential election .	-3.8524
It does not justify the results of a report stating that the White House ’ s efforts to calm the media are “ most aggressive ... since the Nixon administration . ”	-4.0569
And recent , it cannot excuse the inability to create a simple website in the more than three years since the Affordable Care Act was adopted .	-3.7800
I do not know whether that is what I should have expected .	-1.6417
Whether I should have understood with 18 that government work could contradict the previous political campaigns .	-4.4224
Obviously , the Office of Deputies is not a predictable course , as an opposition party and random events like the New Town massacre shape public discussion .	-6.8010
But if I look at the examples above , they seem to be largely elected by the government itself .	-3.2466
And that bothers me most .	-1.6307
I re-elected Obama in 2012 , not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy .	-2.3607
Mitt Romney was a confused and unbalanced alternative , and he seemed unable to determine his direction and positions .	-4.2720
I had the impression that a second term for Obama , free from the pressure of future elections , would fulfil the hope that we had heard for so long .	-3.7094
But with the fall of Obama ’ s approval ratings to less than 45 % this week , the return to 2008 through this book has become so much harder .	-5.0141
It awakens my longing for the many promises that have come to air .	-4.3286
This week I read a section in the book describing how Obama had to face a serious loss against Clinton in the primary elections in Pennsylvania .	-3.6059
In a meeting with the electoral heroes after the decision , he told his staff that they would have to come back on track and follow their cause .	-6.1245

Clive Palmer claims that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interests on parental leave .	-2.2224
The billionaire and MEP Clive Palmer says that Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in conflict with his plans for parental leave , because his daughters may become pregnant and benefit from it .	-4.7733
The tycoon , in a judicial dispute about the $ 6 million payment of carbon tax , claimed that he wanted to wipe out questions about whether he was in conflict .	-6.8436
The Palmer United Party could control up to four voices in the Senate , which are important to decide whether carbon and mining taxes will be removed or cut .	-4.4236
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest , and that Abbott ’ s daughters would personally benefit from the laws .	-3.0352
“ He is in a great conflict of interests when it comes to paid parental leave , because if one of his daughters becomes pregnant , he has a direct interest in whether or not she is receiving a holiday , ” he said .	-4.9962
Two months after the election , the Palmer election commission officially declared the winner of the Sunshine Costast Meeting with 53 votes after the recount .	-5.2620
Palmer called for a revision of the voting process so that it can be counted more quickly .	-4.4273
Tony Abbott 's daughters Frances and Bridget .	-0.4426
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of the vote ?	-1.9160
“ We need a better system , ” he said .	-0.8367
Why should we not have a system where you go in , enter the data into a computer , vote immediately and then have the result at 6 : 30 in the evening ?	-6.3800
Palmer also criticized the use of pencils to mark the ballot papers .	-4.2596
Do you use it because you can erase the results if you don 't like them ?	-4.2312
To vote with pencil is unbelievable today .	-4.0706
The Electoral Commission has examined the options for an electronic election and recently published a joint legislative proposal with New Zealand .	-2.6946
Palmer , 59 , said that his policies include an international airport for the Sunshine Coast , and that he will take his new office “ very seriously . ”	-3.7519

RBS suspended two foreign exchange traders	-2.0595
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange department , as two people are familiar with the situation ; this is further evidence that the global administrative investigation into the alleged manipulation of the currency market is taking off fast .	-6.3015
Some of the world ’ s largest banks , including UBS , Barclays , Deutsche Bank , and RBS , have confirmed that they are working with the authorities in the world ’ s largest financial market , where $ 5.3 trillion is exchanged every day .	-5.1423
The two traders would be the first RBS-staff to be suspended in the investigation that is expanding , resulting in the scandal surrounding the Libor-Interbank.	-5.6861
The Bank , which failed to comment on the suspension , confirmed this month that it had received requests for information from authorities .	-4.2575
“ Our inquiries on this issue continue and we cooperate fully with the FCA and other regulatory authorities , ” said the Bank two weeks ago .	-3.6768
Last month , people close to the situation stated that the RBS sent the records of e-mails and instant messages sent by and to an earlier merchant to the British Supervisory Authority , the Financial Conduct Authority .	-5.0771
This trader , Richard Usher , had left RBS 2010 and is now to have been certified by his current position as European head of the forex spot trade at JPMorgan .	-4.1552
Rohan Ramchandani , head of the European Spot Trading at Citi , was judged this week and Matt Gardiner , previously leading currency traders at Barclays and UBS , was suspended at Standard Chartered this week .	-4.6360
None of these traders were accused of any wrongdoing .	-2.4602
Usher Instant Messaging Group included bankers in Barclays and Citigroup , said people close to the situation .	-4.3562
UBS announced this week that it was taking steps against some of its employees after the Swiss regulatory authority Finma explained that it was searching for a suspected manipulation of the foreign exchange market in a series of Swiss banks .	-5.6358
At least six authorities around the world – the European Commission , Finma , the Swiss Competition Authority , the FCA , the US Department of Justice , and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently dealing with allegations that bankers are supposed to have agreed on monetary transactions .	-5.4719
HSBC , Citigroup , JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also initiated internal investigations or received information requests from authorities , said with the situation of familiar persons .	-3.3271
Banks are plagued by instant messages and e-mails from several years in search of misconduct .	-4.0909
The news of these investigations has roiled traders in an area that has been one of the most profitable trading units of investment banks in recent years , but this year was under pressure because low currency volatility restricts the chances of speculators .	-5.4202
Some bankers have tried to downplay the case , saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast and highly liquid foreign-exchange market , but leading traders believe that this is not necessarily true .	-3.5957
A leading trader noted that , despite the massive daily volume of Forex trading , fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the growing use of own internal platforms by banks leads to “ having very low ticket prices already influence the market . ”	-7.2248
The news came out on the same day that Credit Suisse announced that it cancelled a trader of its London Exchange Traded Funds Office this week after causing a loss of just $ 6 million at the end of last year .	-4.4034
The Bank promptly informed the competent authorities and cooperates with them .	-2.3276
“ We are sure that the trader has acted on his own and that the matter is contained , ” said Credit Suisse .	-3.3368
Painting the construction on the Bechtle-Land	-6.4477
A group of the citizens ' initiative " Schweizer Wiese " has beautified the Bauzaun on the Bechtle-lot on the Kurpromenade in Bad Herralz .	-5.2340
They also cleaned and broadened the walk , in a press release .	-4.7995
The planned demolition of the crumbling house at the back of the property was not permitted for security reasons , because the terrain is in danger of sliding .	-5.0580
Alfred Abel , who is currently managing the land , had challenged the beautification action with his colleague Reinhard Domke from the BI .	-4.3299
Before the action of the BI , a banner with the message " We are for it " was put .	-4.6980
However , that did not disturb the approximately 20 members of the citizens ' initiative much in their action .	-3.6180
Your motto on the big poster was " We are against building ruins " .	-2.1826
It wanted to point to the danger of even larger ruins on the Swiss meadow - the gigantic project should one day fail .	-6.0377
When talking to a lot of people in front of the " construction site " it became clear that some citizens believe that the realization of the project of the city will go much better , although few have the same questions on the scale of the presented project as the BI .	-7.0273
But they are beginning to decline because the city continues to delay these responses , it is said by the BI .	-4.3702
Public statements by the Mayor seem to be as heard .	-4.4506
In May , the Council meeting said that he was afraid of the thermal baths , should the people vote against the plans for a spa and wellness complex on the Swiss meadow during the citizens .	-6.8609
Some people therefore seem to be alarmed , others see them as a " gross blackmail attempt " on the population , so it continues in the BI press release .	-7.0828
The BI thanked the donors for the color and all the helpers .	-2.2987
Ranking for Zhirini : Mane no Schwabing King	-6.7161
Ralf Rannick is also pleased with the current high form of Bundesliga-Table Guide Red Bull Salzburg , so the sports director of the " Bullen " was disappointed by the judges .	-5.4977
" There is currently a dangerous tendency for Manse and Alan to be pushed into the category Schwalbenroyal , " he took the two offensive drivers on Thursday at a press conference in Salzburg .	-5.9227
The most recent reason for Ranking ’ s critique was Yellow for Mane at 3 : 0 against Size last Sunday , when a supposed acting profession was turned off by the Senegal woman - which was not , however , as the TV images showed .	-8.5465
" A gross misdecision " , Rannick said , the referee referred to Harar as " completely overstretched " .	-6.1634
Harcame would also have contributed " his part " to the escalation between Salzburg-Coach Roger Schmidt and Val Trainer Adi Hütter after the match .	-4.5985
He firmly defended his German compatriot : " I would have behaved like Roger Schmidt in every single situation .	-3.6003
Schmidt himself wants to have no contact with his colleague after the skirmishes with Hütter .	-3.6219
I do not know why .	-0.8722
" For I am the one who was offended " , stressed the 46-year-old .	-2.6811
However , in view of the track record , Rankink approved a eulogy .	-5.5299
" There are only two words for this : right , " he noted .	-4.8574
There is not much to criticise .	-2.5304
Especially the way the team plays is impressive .	-2.1581
This should continue calmly .	-3.5593
Caderchanges during winter transfer time there will be little .	-3.1988
There are no great reasons to change anything .	-1.7214
" In addition to a player , Rannick clearly stated that he wishes to leave the club .	-5.3891
Supreme Court confirmed Obama ’ s Health Law	-1.5953
It is a big victory for the Obama administration : the US Supreme Court today decided that the health-care law closely tied to Barack Obama is constitutional .	-4.0979
With five to four votes , judges ruled that the individual mandate of the patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – forcing US citizens to sign health insurance or pay a penalty by 2014 – is constitutional in the state ’ s tax authority .	-5.4149
The chief judge John Roberts was on the side of the four more liberal members of the Chamber , while the Judge Scalia , Thomas , Alito and Kennedy decided against it .	-4.1131
The court also confirmed the remaining sections of the law of the 2700 pages , and also argued that the condition of the Health Law that states would either have to extend the conditions of access to Medicaid or otherwise remove all state aid would not be unconstitutional .	-8.7503
The lawsuit against the law was initiated by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business .	-2.6669
The law was decisively rejected by all leading Republican presidential candidates , including the eventual challenger Mitt Romney , in the 2012 pre-election campaign .	-3.0665
Norway : Norwegian City is setting itself with giant mirrors .	-6.1874
With huge mirrors , the inhabitants of a Norwegian village brought light to their dismal valley .	-3.1188
Due to the low degree of sunshine , the Rjukan , situated in the Vestfjord-valley , usually sinks in the shadow of the surrounding mountains from autumn to spring .	-4.9799
With three giant reflectors at 45 metres altitude , a century space was established on Wednesday .	-4.3656
" Finally ! " , the Mayor Steinar Bergsland sang at the start ceremony at the TV station .	-4.7444
Some talresidents were entitled to sun chairs , while others set up sun-glasses for safety reasons .	-7.1521
So far , sun-hungry had to drive to a nearby peak with a cable car in winter .	-4.0269
Ten years ago , the local artist Martin Andersen presented the proposal to direct the rays with mirrors into the valley .	-3.0459
However , this basic idea has been in place since 1913 .	-4.1240
After several years of debate , the City Council finally approved the 5 million kroner ( around 615 000 euros ) of an expensive project .	-4.7490
A similar construction has been giving the Italian Alpine resort Viganella winter sunshine for several years .	-5.1616
Post office barely published on Sundays	-3.7816
" Many citizens will not have noticed that the red points for Sunday reading are still on various central city and suburbs , but read the small print on the yellow boxes of the Post AG , you will quickly find out that the lack of sunlight and public holidays is no longer taking place , " says the FDP .	-8.7828
A FDP request confirmed this .	-2.5938
On Sundays and public holidays , only in front of the post building in the Ernst Ludwig street 36 and in the Jacob-BMüller-Stra<unk>e 1 in the “ Hüttensfeld ” ( “ Stadtbahn ” ) .	-8.6350
Whether in Hofheim and Rosengarten there is also a Sunday conversation will not be answered in the answer to the FDP ’ s question .	-5.8832
The FDP spokesman for Social and Youth Policy , Fritz Röhrenbeck , wants to take a look at this .	-5.7980
Sunday openings are an important postal service at the moment of appointment .	-5.9813
" This undertaking , despite the increase in prices for letters on January 2013 , would be radically and unreasonable . "	-3.7437
Thomas Bittner , Chairman of the Liberal Group and President of the City of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe , supports his fellow Members : " What annoys me is the fact that here the idle times are being changed or cancelled " .	-7.6347
The post office is miles away from the citizens of Europe .	-4.2769
" At least the post boxes in the districts of Neuschloe<unk> and Rosengarten must be emptied again on Sundays " , said Bittner and Röhrenbeck united .	-5.8990
It is also true of the central city , especially non-mobile citizens , that we should be able to reach a mailbox with Sunday openings .	-6.9036
Röhrenbeck asked the town parliament whether the city council was planning discussions with the post office on this matter .	-6.0823
mayor Erich Maier replied that the post did not communicate with Lampersheim .	-2.4149
In Hofheim , however , there is also a Sunday reading in his knowledge .	-6.4940
Your party was in favour of privatisation .	-3.3398
" Then decisions are taken elsewhere , " said Maier .	-2.0419
Frankfurt Park charges should rise sharply .	-2.4652
Parking in Frankfurt could soon become more sensitive .	-3.2922
This morning , the city ’ s main train will advise you on a presentation of transport decent Stefan Majer ( Green ) .	-6.7200
So parking charges are to be increased by 50 % .	-3.4237
For this purpose , however , the prices should not be increased , but the time interval should be reduced from 30 minutes to 20 minutes from parking slots and parking slots .	-6.5432
In December , the Municipal Assembly will have to decide .	-4.1637
The retail committee of the IHK Frankfurt considers this ' not a good idea ' .	-4.2319
The car park in front of the store is " an advantage not to be underestimated for smaller retailers " .	-6.6445
The German Transport Club believes that an increase after two decades is ' quite appropriate and long overdue ' .	-5.0392
Public transport will also become more expensive .	-3.0666
Curiously : Spend fast deals with your host .	-5.7895
With a small Kader , the lords I of TSV Freuddensstadt in the Schiller Schulturnhalle in Reutlingen had to compete against the TG Gönningen from the Swabian Alb .	-5.4585
The elders were with an experienced team on the other side of the net .	-3.2698
Soon , however , it became apparent that they were unable to keep up with the fast actions of the fan bankers , even in terms of age .	-7.1839
With the hard and bursting attacks , the patrons were extremely difficult .	-5.9913
They repeated the passports and attacks revealed by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz over the center of the network and were not in place in block defense .	-5.7001
Two high first sentence profits clearly expressed the superiority of the detainee in all matters .	-4.7312
In view of this overwhelming and player performance , the third set was slightly sloppy and clueless at the 3 : 0 end ( 25 : 13 , 25 : 14 , 25 : 22 ) .	-5.7616
On November 2 , the TV Baiersbronn , who was able to assert themselves clearly in Nagold , will be a far more powerful opponent on the field .	-8.1261
TSV Freuddensstadt I : Dominik Bäuererle , Yannik Büchle , Sebastian Dölker , Felix Popchen , Stefan Räller , Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz .	-4.7111
In the B-class the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudstadt were opposite in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn .	-5.2935
They delivered a two-hour match on a hard battle .	-5.2567
Nerviousness on both sides caused errors and points gifts , especially when taking a ball ; even at the passports , precision was sometimes inadequate and in some critical situations the excess looked at possible point profits .	-9.8739
In this highly balanced encounter the TSV team from Marcus Blasuto always agreed with the great physical commitment and pleasure of both teams .	-8.5839
Adherence day at Small British Lodge	-4.9068
To the fifth day of care in succession of the Natura 2000 project Upper Hotzenwald , a group of dedicated participants met at the small English cottage in Ibach .	-5.2674
Due to popular suggestions , the view to the valley should be cleared on this day in the area of the hut , said mayor Helmut Kaiser .	-5.5375
Many hikers , according to the Emperor , described this area as the pearl of the Schluchten hill , where the landscape offers the ideal setting for magnificent views .	-6.5331
He thanked those present for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the day of care is a suitable tool to strengthen the connection between man and nature .	-4.8145
It offers every citizen the opportunity to focus on nature itself .	-3.1444
At the same time as the tourist aspect , environmental considerations can also be taken into account .	-4.0203
Friederike Triukait explained this ecological aspect by the protection department of the Government President of Freiburg following the greeting by Landrat Tilman Bollacher , who had taken over the patronage and wanted the action to be successful .	-6.8923
According to Triukit , the tourist destination of the Far Sight is covered with the aim of obtaining the now highly grown old Allmendweidfeld with its specific protected types of living space by opening and linking to the existing pastures .	-9.9787
Certain species , such as rare butterflies and grasshoppers , cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest surfaces .	-2.8447
You need these free connections to arterhonization .	-3.5585
Triukit said that she did not want to miss the opportunity to break a lance for the planned Biosphere .	-4.7565
In this planning , the current measure does not just fit seamlessly .	-4.0602
A biospheric area also offers an opportunity for sustainable economic and ecological development based on internationally recognized Unesco status and thus a continuous addition to the Life Project and the nursing days for the future .	-5.6712
Following these various statements , Revenue Manager Christoph Wehle and Life Project Manager Cornelia Bischoff entered the Helpers in groups .	-5.4418
The bigger trees had already been beaten in advance , and the forestry trawlers may be ready to retrieve .	-6.9015
A group of volunteers should take care of the exemption of sentinel bushes and care for the maintenance of a dry stone bar .	-5.4549

Information on the Internet : Although the Baartown of Löffingen , with its 7514 inhabitants , an intact infrastructure , a forward-looking school , children 's , youth and old people policy , as well as its own city buildings , has not yet registered a second mayor .	-8.3650
As the only candidate to succeed , Norbert Brugger , who is no longer a running Mayor , is currently a 45-year-old banker and business manager Dieter Kör served from Löffingen .	-8.5971
The application deadline expires on Monday , 11 November , at 6 p.m.	-3.1769
Google , Samsung , Huawei due to Nortel patents sued .	-3.5266
On Thursday , the group , which owns thousands of former Nortel patents , lodged an avalanche of lawsuits against mobile phone manufacturers , including Google , which was outbid by him in the bankruptcy of Nortel .	-6.1096
Rockstar , the consortium that bought Nortel patents for $ 4.5 billion , sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd , HTC Corp , Huawei , and four other companies for patent infringement before the US Court in Texas .	-3.6794
Rockstar is a collective owner of Apple , Microsoft , BlackBerry , Ericsson and Sony .	-3.7253
Google is accused in seven cases of patent infringement .	-1.5760
The patents concern technology that match search terms on the Internet with relevant advertising , so the complaint that meets the heart of Googles search engine business .	-6.3008
Representatives of Samsung , Huawei , HTC and Rockstar were not immediately reachable .	-2.7580
Samsung , Huawei and HTC make mobile phones that work with Google 's Android operating system , which is in sharp competition with Apple and Microsoft 's mobile products .	-3.7447
In 2011 , Google issued an initial bid of more than $ 900 million for the Nortel patents .	-3.6008
Google increased its offer several times and last offered $ 4.4 billion .	-2.6616
After being outbid by Rockstar 's Nortel patents , Google bought Motorola Mobility for $ 12.5 billion , a business that was also partially motivated by Motorolas 's library .	-5.3828
“ Although Google failed to purchase the item ’ s honor on the auction , Google has breached and continues to do so , ” he said .	-7.5670
Rockstar claims that Google 's patent infringement is intentional , so the accusation is made .	-4.5925
Egypt sworn in first freely elected president	-1.6732
Mohammed Morsi is sworn in , but his day of triumph should not mean the end of the political disputes in Egypt .	-4.1525
Islamicist Mohammed Morsi promised a “ new Egypt , ” when he was sworn to be the first freely elected president of the country , and thus succeeded Hosni Mubarak , who had been ousted from office 16 months earlier .	-4.6287
With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court , Morsi was also the first freely elected Islamic president of the Arab world and Egypt ’ s fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago .	-3.3839
He dropped the oath before the 18 black Roben Judge of the Court , who has his seat on the Nile , who has experienced an ancient Egyptian temple .	-6.0986
“ We strive for a better future , a new Egypt and a second republic , ” said Morsi at the ceremony that was broadcast live on state television .	-3.6377
“ Today , the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom , true democracy and stability , ” said the 60-year-old Morsi , a US-trained engineer and member of the Muslim Brotherhood , a fundamentalist group that has been targeted by the government since its founding 84 years ago .	-5.5453
Hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarded the building when Morsi met a little autoconvoi shortly after 11 o ’ clock local time .	-3.5012
Only a few hundred followers had gathered to the court to celebrate the new president , and , unlike the presidential president Prunk of Mubarak , traffic was suspended only for a short time so that the autoconvoi could cross the usually busy road linking the city centre to southern suburbs .	-6.9733
As the uncharismatic “ substitute wheel ” of the Brotherhood , his personal prestige has increased since his victory and a Friday speech , in which he presented himself not only as a candidate for Islamists , but all those who wanted to bring the 2011 uprising ’ s aspirations to the authoritarian Mubarak .	-6.0254
“ Egypt is now a civil , national , constitutional , and modern state , ” said the Morsi , dressed in a blue suit with a red tie , told the judges in the wood-burning chamber in which he was sworn .	-6.3073
Later , Morsi joined the Cairo University , where he should keep his inaugural speech .	-2.6544
He was officially welcomed by an army band who played the national anthem , which he received in a ceremony .	-4.5064
The military leader Feldmarched Hussein Tantawi was present .	-2.0307
On his arrival , he was welcomed by hundreds of people in the largest listening hall of the university with speakers of “ The army and the people are a hand . ”	-5.2703

Flight Centre seems to resist the trend .	-1.5107
The company has increased its profit prospects for the year as a whole and expects record revenues from Australia and Great Britain .	-5.3279
The travel company is now moving from an adjusted annual profit before taxes of between 325 and 340 million dollars , compared to 305 to 3115 million dollars in its previous forecast .	-4.4776

Salem : Johanna Rahner to the Ecumenical Dialogue Forum	-1.8407
The next Ecumenical Dialogue Forum on Monday , 21 October , at the New Museum of the castle , is about the theme of " hell with hell - Theological considerations about how to deal with the last things " .	-7.6540
Lecturer is Professor Johanna Rahner .	-1.3934
The Ecumenical Dialogue Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Protestant Church parishes of Salem , the Salem Castle and the Kulturamt Bodenseekreis .	-3.5922
Johanna Rahner wants to go into the forum about how people classify the " last things " after death .	-4.4108
If people had known too much of it over the past few centuries , relying on the images of heaven and hell , " which have characterized our ideas today " , the contemporary prophetic doctrine of the hopes of completion is more marked by a certain embarrassment or even speechlessness .	-8.5079
" The greatest hope has been greatly aborted by the religious critique of Christians , " says the referent .	-6.0390
She ' gave us so many question marks that we seem to have lost the sign ' .	-4.3350
Johanna Rahner continues : " But the crucial challenge remains the irritation of death " .	-4.0314
This is linked to the question of the longing that " dream of everything being good at the end " .	-5.6950
Johanna Rahner , born in 1962 in Baden-Baden , studied Catholic theology and biology at Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg from 1982 to 1989 .	-1.5903

In fine weather , 214 cyclists came to Illmensee to ride the round course across the ranges of hills around the lake . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-5.5060
This is shared by Ulrich Knobel from the organizing sport club Illmensee .	-3.1998
Among the participants , especially on a short distance of more than 15 kilometers and 300 metres of altitude , there were also numerous samurai eagles who wanted to practice their hobby in competition once .	-7.6737
Two top German junior drivers were also at the start in this competition : Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Trepelel from ebach-Linz came with the recommendation good places for the German Championships .	-7.9894
This pair was apparently removed from the field .	-5.5685

Pascal Trumpel could again place his place on the 2nd place .	-5.2650
In the ladies , Theresa Duelli was from the team nightmare that made it right up to the top of the .	-5.9237
Anne Adel from Illmensee and Leonie drivers from Owingen came to place two and three .	-3.1356
A pleasant development is the increasing number of drivers living or working in the municipality .	-3.6021
Not only in terms of performance was the whole range represented by athletes .	-3.9857
The age structure was also ten years old with the youngest up to 70 years with the oldest runners .	-6.4683
In the main races this year were even more top athletes at the start .	-3.8942
Four drivers were able to overtake the regional top drivers .	-3.5872
includes Philipp Pangerl , a mountain bike semi-professional from the Black-Tusk-Racing-Team .	-3.8979
Pangerl , together with a team colleague , was already two times the world champion in the 12-hour driving .	-6.3300
This year he became European champion on this special discipline .	-3.2935
Roland Ballerstedt , who already owns two German master titles in the duathlon .	-4.6442
After 45 kilometers and 900 metres of altitude , a performance final came to the target audience in front of the Three Lakes Hall .	-5.7613
Pangerl would be the first to cross the finishing line .	-2.9079
Only a second behind this could be the routing of the ballerstedt second place in the overall rating . , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-5.6343

Towards through mud , rivers , and jungle for free medical care	-4.1539
Dr. Georges Bwave provides free medical assistance to remote villages in Cameroon .	-2.7732
Bwave and his team spend almost every weekend treating hundreds of patients	-2.7942
There are not many doctors in the West African country , only one in 5,000 people .	-2.5838
Vote here or with your mobile device .	-2.4689
Dr. Georges Bwave is one of the top 10 of the “ CNN Heroes of 2013 ” .	-2.6739
You can vote for him or any of the other heroes in the Top 10 to vote for the CNN Hero of the Year .	-3.3517
The winner receives $ 250,000 to continue his extraordinary work .	-2.0757
For 21 years , Georges Bwave saw his sick father repeatedly lost consciousness and traveled to hospitals that had not had the means to help him .	-4.2818
Jamef Bwave was injured in a car accident near Yaounde , the capital Kameradus .	-3.5498
First he had only a broken arm , but then an inflammation was formed that spread out into his brain and caused a hemmatom that should affect him for the rest of his life .	-6.0494
“ There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon , ” said Georges Bwave .	-2.1590
We would have released it from Cameroon if we had had the money .	-1.9560
Instead , Bshaft spent years attending his father in overcrowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer .	-4.9829
“ It ’ s not easy ” , comments Bwave .	-2.6237
You can leave the house at 5 o 'clock in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first , and is not the first .	-4.6262
There are many patients .	-1.2409
Some people are even dying because they have to wait .	-1.8150
The situation has hardly changed since Bwells ’ father died in 2002 .	-2.2413
In Cameroon , there is only one doctor per 5,000 people , according to the World Health Organization .	-3.0706
On the other hand , the relationship in the United States is with a doctor for 418 people .	-3.8917
But even if there was a doctor for them , most Cameroon ’ s visit could not be possible .	-4.5776
Two out of five people live below the poverty line and almost three-quarters of rural health spending is private .	-2.7083
“ The only problem they have is poverty , ” says Bwave .	-2.2591
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life .	-1.0595
His father and so many of his fellow countrymen suffered to see a decision in Bshaft to do something about it .	-4.5336
Dr. Georges Bwave and his voluntary team carried out 700 free operations last year .	-1.9786
He became a doctor himself and works as a vessel surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé .	-3.8963
He also founded a non-profit organization called ASOVIME , which travels to rural areas at weekends and offers free medical care .	-11.5202
Since 2008 , he and his voluntary group have helped almost 32,000 people .	-2.3503
Almost every Friday he and up to 30 people crowded in minibuses and ride with snowed-in medical equipment on the roof over uncoated terrain in the villages that need help .	-5.5090
Not always everything runs smoothly .	-1.8781
More than once , they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud .	-2.9222
But when they arrive they will receive as heroes : a feast , singing and dancing and the best accommodation that the place has to offer .	-3.7812
In these villages , free medical care is really a reason to celebrate and kick – with its broad smile and unlimited energy – is happy to attend the celebration .	-5.3371
The next morning the team will start investigating hundreds of patients .	-3.2158
“ We treat 500 people per journey ” , says Bwave .	-5.4058
You will arrive around the village within 60 kilometres – and on foot .	-4.5720
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas .	-2.6696
Many people are treated for malaria , tuberculosis , malnutrition , diabetes , parasites and sexually transmitted diseases .	-1.6299
Others receive crutches , donated glasses or free birth certificates – a document that is needed for the school , but many poor families simply cannot afford .	-5.1773
In the evening , the team performs simple operations with local stunning .	-3.1212
The operations usually take place in a school , town hall or flat ; after the intervention patients are up and go to the rest area to make room for the next .	-6.2483
The illumination of the OP and disinfectant equipment is fed by the generator of the group and so work BK and its volunteers until early morning hours on Sunday .	-6.9668
It is a heavy sum , but village musicians usually help keep the team motivated .	-2.4525
" They stroll all night so that we can stay awake and continue our work " , says Bwave .	-5.1107
On Sunday the team then returns to the city , tired but proud of the work they have done .	-3.5663
The group – a mixture of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students – carried out 700 free operations last year and knows that , with their work , it makes a huge difference to the people to whom it helps .	-4.8203
A man explained that the free operation of a slide of unemployment that he received now allows him to work again .	-4.8157
“ That changes the future of my family , ” the man said .	-2.8693
In addition to weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital , Bwave also works in private clinics in Yaoundé at night .	-3.9302
With this second job , he finances 60 % of his work of general interest , so Bwave ; the rest comes from private donations .	-5.1453
“ I really do not know when he sleeping , ” says Katie O 'Malley , who is studying the Drexel University in Philadelphia Medicine in the second year and working voluntarily in Bwelles Group .	-5.3009
He is always either in hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so that he can go into these campaigns .	-4.8097
For medical and health care students such as O 'Malley , who come from the USA and Europe and support Bwave , this is an opportunity to gain practical experience that they would never get at home .	-4.4476
" We can be involved in operations where we help to tap blood or keep the instruments for Dr. Bwave , " said O 'Malley .	-4.9114
That would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year .	-1.3955
The students usually pay their trip to Cameroon themselves and bring frequently donated sanitation material .	-3.9778
But if they are in Yaoundé , Bwave takes care of accommodation , transport and instruction .	-5.5039
“ He is a hero without doubt , ” says O 'Malley .	-3.2235
He devotes his life to this organisation and his desire to help the people of Cameroon knows no limits .	-3.9196
For Bshaft the almost constant work is not a burden .	-3.4492
To help others to live in a more prosperous life , and to fulfill a promise that he gave his father , he is delighted .	-7.7433
“ I am so happy when I do this work , ” says Bwave .	-3.9585
And I am thinking of my father .	-1.3087
I hope he will see what I do .	-1.4594
I make it to make people laugh again and to relieve the pain .	-2.2044

Closing the battle with excellence	-3.5127
The role of Santiago , the old man in Hemingway 's novel " The Old Man and the Sea " , Horst Janson is cut to the body .	-4.2657
Janson is himself an old rabbit in his Metier , the acting art .	-3.8374
No one can fool the old man of Santiago for fishing .	-2.7561
So the two are simply superb .	-3.8292
It is almost possible to see the wrinkles at the neck of the old man , of which the fishing boy Manolo speaks .	-5.9801
When Santiago is tired of life prayed on the chair , that 's true with Janson .	-3.9804
In addition , the role of the old fisherman is played by the character that Janson has played .	-6.2916
Hemingway told the story of a warrior , a brave man who does not give up and ultimately wins the battle against the fish through his knowledge and will .	-4.6626
Janson is on stage as sole actor in many areas .	-4.7199
He creates the attention of the audience to focus on itself , so that his monologues are no moment boring .	-4.3217
His efforts to finally pull the fish to the surface of the water are so real that the spectators forget that the sea is made of blue floodlit water bottles .	-5.2456
Director Jens Hasselmann is leaving the old man on the boat in front of the fishing village .	-3.2472
In the course of the performance he puts the respective active scene into light : the hut of Santiago , the bar of singer Marie-Luise favor , which , with her songs and her splendid voice , enjoys Cuba 's sense of life .	-7.0581
The four musicians play Cuban rhythm and are also guests of the bar .	-2.4431
Tourism : Descent to the Romans	-1.4591
Around 120 metres in length , a sewerage channel from Roman times is obtained below Cologne .	-5.2745
If you visit Cologne you will not get to the Duomo .	-4.6618
Around 157 meters the two towers rise into the sky and make it the second highest church building in Europe .	-3.3457
But only a few visitors who admire the two filigree church towers predict that there is also a lot to discover under the cathedral .	-5.5928
Rainer Schulze is an expert in Cologne underworld .	-2.0248
Meeting point for his guided tours is the service center of Cologne Tourism directly at the Dom .	-3.6419
The tour starts completely unspectacular : " We start in the underground car park " , says Schulze .	-4.7256
In the seventies , the city fathers wanted to be an autocjust city , and therefore the remains of the old city walls remained only that which was not too big .	-7.2916
For this reason , most of the visitors of the park have also passed the Roman remains and only hire their car .	-7.9624
However , if you look more closely , a archaeological site separated by metal mesh rods is discovered in the Parkdeck D2 .	-7.2917
You can see about five metres high ruins of hand-painted stone .	-6.6544
" The remains of the Roman city wall , built into Christ in the second half of the first century , " tells Schulze .	-4.6306
Before it goes back to the natural light , schoolze still allows students at the top level to take a look at a dark , 15 meters deep pit .	-7.7866
This is the fountain of the old cathedral , which is unfortunately not recognized .	-5.1447
Next station of the round is the Prettorium , and here the participants descend down to the depth .	-5.4131
We are here to experience the seat of the once most powerful man north of the Alps , the leader of the CCAA .	-4.2400
What CCAA means would like to know a visitor .	-3.6917
The abbreviation stands for " Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinenium " , which means in good German as " the city of Roman law and the city of Agrippineser " , founded under Emperor Claudius on the place of the temple for the cult of the emperor " " . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-9.4913
And the Prätorium is the former fort palace , the power center of the Roman Empire on the Rhine .	-5.0562
From the front of the exhibition there is a tunnel access to the Roman sewers , which is about 120 metres long .	-5.2108
" You can walk a bit along the " Cloaca Maxima " , if you want " , munert Schulze invites guests .	-6.7969
A surprise , Schulze still has .	-3.0897
After moving the key at the checkout desk , he leads the group to a 16 meter deep , walk-in shaft .	-5.9745
" We are now in the Mikwe , a ritual Jewish bath , " he explains .	-2.0178
The Jewish community built its bath deep into the ground to come to the groundwater , which was indispensable for ritual washing .	-4.3473
In the lower end of the Mikwe , whose origins date back to the eighth century , different water levels are visible due to the changing level of the Rhine .	-5.5957
The Mikwe will be part of an archaeological area on the Town Hall Square , for which the construction work will begin soon .	-4.7953
However , it will take some years to complete it .	-3.7730

A trial has begun in front of the District Court in Frankfurt ( Oder ) due to attempted death , dangerous bodily injury and material damage against two 30-year olds .	-6.1064
It is accompanied by strict security precautions .	-2.4817
The accused sweat at the start .	-3.3727
They were supposed to have been active in the rock scene and belonged to the bandidos .	-5.0951
In June 2009 , the Public Prosecutor alleged that three men had joined in a car with unknown accomplices in Finowfurt .	-6.8641
All victims were seriously injured , a man almost lost his leg .	-2.1993
Victims should have heard of Hells Angels competing .	-3.6644
One should have been a high-level member from Berlin .	-2.0835
Apparently , a race hunt with several cars was predicted .	-3.5812
The indictment was about turf battles and a demonstration of power .	-2.8349
The two accused were acquitted in a first trial at the beginning of 2012 .	-2.9093
A court speaker said at the time that it was not possible to prove that men were actually involved in the bloody feud .	-4.6055
The perpetrators had worn masks and had not been recognized .	-2.9868
The Federal Court lifted the ruling after the revision of the Public Prosecutor 's Office and referred it back to the District Court for re-negotiation .	-5.2184
One of the accused is currently open trial for another offence .	-2.8115
First of all , it was about the reconstruction of the procedures in the tattoo .	-5.8180
It was a witness to the Commissioner who was identified at that time .	-3.2910
The focus was on mobile calls from the accused and other people who had listened to the police .	-4.3403
It is difficult that Rocker almost always abide by a law that they are guilty of – and not statements .	-6.2273
That also applies to the victims .	-2.1607
In the first process , only one of the victims had picked up .	-2.6095
Stefan Prosecutor Golfier of the Public Prosecutor 's Office Frankfurt ( or ) said on demand that there have been new traces since the last trial .	-4.6299
11 other negotiating days are scheduled for the process .	-3.3102
The Wegwerfgesellschaft does not think .	-2.7665
The night was long , the music loud and the mood good , but eventually it goes home .	-2.8739
The only thing is that hunger is noticeable in people 's bellies on the front-passenger and back seats .	-5.4811
Of course , you may be responsible for one or other cocktail of champagne or champagne !	-5.1862
What is closer than to driving to the next drive to allow yourself a trifle ?	-5.3005
I admit , I am happy to attend if there is a fast food bill arriving late at night or early morning .	-6.6460
A few French , a Cola , a Burger - and then nix as from home and into bed !	-3.0958
But on the way home the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco classes are becoming apparent .	-5.2077
Because what do you need to be sure that you regularly throw your fast food bag out of the car window ? !	-6.2442
Especially at the weekends , paper bags thrown away on roads and parking spaces are located .	-6.7156
" Why ? " , I wonder .	-1.9530
Are people to doof taking the bags with them home or to the next rubbish bin ?	-4.6408
It is not only the case that the paper tool isolates the landscape .	-4.0190
Transport facilities such as watchmakers have already covered the problem and thus caused accidents .	-7.0022
However , she does not know what this word actually means .	-5.6485
If you ’ re on the road more often in the evening , especially with several people in the car , you ’ ll know what a bank can look like after a night ’ s sleep .	-9.8715
There would be a few bags more or less RS - in contrast to the street , where no one wants to trample on the bones of others .	-7.9534
I already see the day when cities and communities are being exposed - and fast food chains have to demand deposit for their bags .	-7.8090
Obama ’ s Back in Health Policy	-1.3835
After much criticism , President Obama made a backrunner yesterday with his frequently repeated , clear promise : “ If you like your health insurance , you can keep it . ”	-5.1504
After hundreds of thousands of their insurers received notice , the Republicans have criticized the president in recent days for misleading the American public .	-4.2691
Yesterday , Obama made his initial promise .	-3.0621
“ The vast majority of citizens who have effective health insurance can keep them , ” he said at a speech in Boston .	-4.1098
In response to the numerous media reports on the redundancies , Obama called on those Americans who received such messages to look around in the free market for a new insurance .	-5.5896
Most citizens could thus obtain better , more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or less favourable than anticipated .	-4.6866
“ You come a better deal , ” he said .	-2.1224
The government said it was not surprising that the five per cent of the population who have completed insurance themselves would have to look for a different tariff , because their treaty did not meet the new standards of the Affordable Care Act .	-6.3531
“ I would like to say to these Americans quite directly : they deserve better , ” Sebelius said at a hearing before the House of Representatives ’ Committee on Energy and Trade .	-6.0089
Sebelius , who is responsible for the implementation of the Affordable Care Act , stated that the online platform has been launched since October .	-8.2352
“ I am as frustrated and angry as all others , ” she said .	-2.5498
I am determined to regain your trust .	-1.7926
This rebuttal of a broken Sebelius , a retired adviser at yesterday ’ s House hearing , was admitted after a dispute with the Republican MP Billy Long from Missouri , who was about whether she should be required to participate in Obamacare .	-8.5557
After more than three hours of hearing , Long Sebelius repeatedly asked why the Affordable Care Act ’ s “ Architetters ” did not voluntarily renounce state-sponsored insurance to buy a fare at HealthCare Care Care.gov , which she would now sell millions of Americans .	-7.1278
Jerusalem ’ s government does not confirm an attack on Syria ’ s Air Force base .	-3.2658
An American government officer who wanted to remain anonymous said on Thursday to the American news station CNN that Israeli warplanes had attacked an airbase in Syria ’ s Latakia a day before .	-6.1024
The aim was ' missiles and equipment ' , which the Israeli Government feared were intended for Lebanon 's Hezbollah , according to CNN .	-4.2357
Syrian and Lebanese media , as well as the Arab station Al-Arabiya , had previously reported that the base in the port town of Latakia was shot on Thursday at the night of Wednesday , and that the Israelis were responsible for it .	-5.2172
The Israeli television channel channel channel channel channel 2 showed satellite images of the Latakia base , where Russian defensive missiles of type S-125 Newa and a battery of SA3 rockets that have a range of 35 kilometres according to Channel 2 and can carry explosives up to 70 kilos .	-7.5500
Uncertainty The Jerusalem Government has not officially confirmed the attack .	-2.8938
However , the Reuters news agency is quoting an equally anonymous Israeli government official in saying that he believes that Israel has carried out the attack , but is not sure .	-4.8304
In any case , a speaker from the Israeli Ministry of Defence said : ' We do not comment on these reports ' .	-3.3682
The journalist Ron Ben-Yishai emphasized in the daily life of the Yedieth Ahronoth that the Syrian regime had already tried , partly successful , to supply ground air packages to Hezbollah .	-5.6981
The Israeli Government has repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to supply Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons means exceeding a " red line " that would follow a military response .	-3.9371
John Kerry declared in an unprecedented admission that US espionage “ went too far . ”	-4.0146
In an unexpected admission , John Kerry suggested a US wait-and-see stance on its surveillance programs by saying that , in certain cases , the espionage was “ too far . ”	-5.6552
The foreign minister also admitted that he , together with Barack Obama , was responsible for “ autopilot ” when the explosive revelations of the Whistleblowers Edward Snowden about the NSA ’ s spy activities became public .	-4.2275
The leaked information has sent the US Government into a diplomatic storm of indignation on the part of its allies .	-3.4765
At a video speech at the Open Government Conference in London , Kerry said : “ The President and I , as well as others in the government , have learned of a number of things that have almost run through autopilot , simply because there was a capacity to do what goes back to World War II and the difficult years of the Cold War and , of course , to September 11 . ”	-8.2965
He then admitted , first high-level member of the US government , that the US spy crossed a border , but also stressed that no rights had been abused .	-4.4560
He said , “ In some cases this went too far . ”	-3.2564
The President is determined to create clarity and therefore carries out a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel that abuses are taking place .	-5.4060
I assure you that the rights of innocent people are not affected in this process .	-2.1336
Kerry , however , insisted that the NSA was a good force , and that many lives were saved by its surveillance operations .	-3.5294
He added : “ We are dealing with a new world in which people are prepared to blow themselves up . ”	-2.5023
There is a radical extremism in the world that is seeking to kill people , blow up the air , and attack governments .	-3.4431
So what if we were able to catch up and stop it before it happened ?	-3.4016
We have actually prevented aircraft crashes , attacks on buildings and the killing of people because we learned of such plans .	-4.0901
Meanwhile , US lawmakers will travel to Europe to dispel concerns about America ’ s alleged espionage , and convince Europeans of the need to continue to work with the US in the anti-terrorist effort , as the chairman of the Senate ’ s Subcommittee on European Affairs declared on Thursday .	-5.0224
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said that he spoke with representatives of the European Parliament and other people this week and was worried about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorism organisations because of frustration with National Security Agency surveillance .	-5.2330
“ It is very important for US national security interests that Europeans remain on board with regard to our joint efforts against terrorism , ” Murphy , who , as a democrat , is in the Senate for the first time and as chairman of the Senate ’ s Committee on Foreign Affairs and European Affairs , said in an interview in Washington .	-6.4146
I also go to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together on combating terrorism , regardless of its anger over the NSA programmes .	-4.9380
Media reports that the NSA has recorded millions of telephone data in Europe have strained relations with some US allies , although the chief of the secret service said this week that the reports were ill-timed and based on a misunderstanding of meta data collected by NATO allies and exchanged with the United States .	-5.1515
Other revelations quoted from Snowden ’ s forward documents that the NSA has monitored German Chancellor Angela Merkel ’ s mobile phone and up to 34 other leaders worldwide .	-3.7433
The head of the national secret services , James Clapper , defended the espionage of allies as necessary and declared that this was common on both sides .	-4.1066
In all the tumult , Murphy said that his authority prepared the trip of the Congress to take place this year , and hoped that the delegation would comprise members of both parties and chambers .	-5.0668
The names of the other participating Members will be published in the coming days .	-2.4004
He said that the exact itinerary is still being worked out .	-3.5411
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the journey was to improve relations , he also said that there would be some “ serious words . ”	-3.4656
He said that European governments should be honest with their people about the kind of spy programs they themselves have been using for years .	-3.7796
“ Although we can change our surveillance programmes and thus better protect the rights of Europeans , they must also accept the fact that we are not the only ones who spy , ” said Murphy .	-4.4839
Meanwhile , during the weekend , John Kerry is heading for a trip to the Middle East and Poland to address the resentment about the US strategy in Syria , Egypt , and Iran , and US surveillance activities .	-4.9122
A persistent injury to the ankle joint threatens to prevent Nicolai Müller from playing in the Bundesliga game of FSV Mainz 05 at FC Augsburg .	-4.6648
Mainz dumber for a bet of Nicolai Müller .	-4.6736
Tomorrow he will try to train with the team .	-1.7949
So far , he could only do that individually .	-3.6390
" We will decide on his use in the short term , " said Trainer Thomas Tuchel .	-4.5244

Australian appealed against Thailand ’ s prison sentence	-2.9074
A 21-year-old Sydney woman sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket because she had wrongly claimed to have been raped by a taxi driver has appealed against the sentence and was released on bail .	-5.1135
Stevie Rochelle Bamboo was initially found guilty by a provincial court in Phuket on June 15 to have made a false statement after she told the Thai police , a local taxi driver had raped her in the morning hours on Sunday 10 , June , while two other men held it .	-5.9327
Later , however , the recordings of a video camera showed that she had safely arrived at her hotel after being separated from her Australian friend .	-5.2205
The police in Phuket seized Bamford for two days until they thought about history .	-5.1696
Until the trial , she was in police custody on site .	-3.3357
Bamboo was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a low-security hospital on the fringe of Phuket , instead of in a prison for adult women .	-4.7001
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks , a former Australian Ruby League player who approached the foreign ministry in Canberra with the request for help for his daughter .	-4.0319
Tung explained to the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was “ extremely worried ” about the welfare of his daughter and wanted to return to Australia .	-4.2711
“ We are naturally very concerned , but we hope that it will be back at home as soon as possible , ” said Mr. Tung .	-4.2435
Bamford has appealed against the verdict and is open for a deposit of 50,000 Baht .	-3.8888
Australian reports reported that she is enjoying a holiday in the resort of Krabi in southern Thailand .	-5.6620
Vocal of the Court was to hear that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and was warned that the appeal could also lead to the imposition of a higher sentence of up to two years in a adult prison .	-6.1239
However , it is also possible that Thailand , after the recent murder of the travel clerk Michelle Smith in Phuket , might try to improve its hit tourist image , and therefore come a acquittal .	-7.0222
