The National Assembly Commission , which is currently working on a draft law on the name changes , said : ‘ The final decision on the name of the members of the National Assembly is , of course , for the Members themselves . ’	-4.7015
With the Wales Act 2017 Government , the Welsh Parliament was given the opportunity to change its name .	-2.7957
In June last year , the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals that broadly support the name change in the Valais Parliament .	-4.1544
The Commission favored Welsh MEPs or WMPs on the issue of the title of Assembly members , but the MWP option received most support in a public survey .	-4.9915

The referendum will be held to resolve a decade-long dispute with neighbouring Greece in which a province bears the name of Macedonia .	-3.0369
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour is a right to its territory and has repeatedly objected to his application for membership of the EU and NATO .	-3.5067
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov , an opponent of the referendum on the name change , said he would ignore the vote .	-1.9597
However , the advocates of the referendum , including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev , argue that the name change is quite simply the price to pay for accession to the EU and NATO .	-3.2286
The bells of St. Martin are muddled , as churches in Harlem have problems with churches .	-8.9928
" Historically , the old people I spoke to said that there was a bar and a church in every corner , " said Adams .	-3.4887

Churches could be replaced by multi-family homes with property flats filled with the kind of people who will not help the remaining refugees of the district .	-4.5208
The overwhelming majority of people who buy property houses in these buildings will be white , he said , " and will therefore speed up the day when these churches are closed entirely , as it is unlikely that most of those people who buy property houses will become members of these churches . "	-5.9050
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolitan in 1870 – Metropolitan Community , St. Martin ’ s a decade later .	-2.6923

A fire in 1939 left the building seriously damaged , but when the municipal members of Father Johnson made plans for reconstruction , they commissioned the bell game .	-4.0918
Prior to David Johnson , son of Father Johnson and successor in St. Martin 's , the bell game proudly called " the bells of the poor . "	-3.8928
The expert who played the bell game in July called it another : " A cultural treasure " and " an irreplaceable historical instrument " .	-2.8499
The expert , Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan , also noted that it was the first bell game in the world played by a black musician , Dionisio A. Lind , who switched 18 years ago to the larger bell game at the Riverside Church .	-3.7580
Mr Merriweather said that St. Martin 's did not replace him .	-1.4341
What has happened to St. Martin in recent months has been a complicated history of architects and construction entrepreneurs , some of which have been tabled by the Church leaders and others by the bishop diocese .	-4.9677
In July , the sacristy – the parish governing body composed of laymen – wrote to the diocese , worrying that the diocese would " try to pass the cost to the Sakristia " , although the sacristy was not involved in the mandate of the architects and contractors of the diocese .	-6.4575

Sainsbury has tested a joint venture with boats in the early 2000 ’ s , but it ended inevitably , and the income from pharmacies ’ shops could not be shared .	-3.9894
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury 's 281 branch pharmacy business sold three years ago for 125 million pounds to Celesio , the owner of the Lloyd Pharmacy chain .	-3.0036
In four Lloyds stores , the range of luxury skin care products from brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy is to be extended .	-14.2602

He had so many heroes .	-0.6273
Captain Halkett provided a superbly organized defense , while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall kept on the test all the time .	-5.1717
But the rangers lacked ideas .	-1.7307
As good as they were sometimes under Gerrard , they fell far short of these standards .	-3.0135
Their last ball left to be desired – only once they have cut the home team openly – and it is something like a wake-up call for the rangers in the middle table .	-12.7044

The US should double Artificial Intelligence spending	-2.0477
As China becomes more active for artificial intelligence , the US should double its research investments , says Kai-Fu Lee , investor , and AI practitioner who worked for Google , Microsoft , and Apple .	-2.9459
These demands came about after US officials made announcements about KI , even though the US lacks a formal KI strategy .	-4.0597
Meanwhile , China presented its plan last year : by 2030 , it wants to be number 1 in the field of KI innovation .	-13.5022
“ Doubling expenditure on KI research would be a good start , given that all other countries are well behind the US , and a breakthrough in KI research is just around the corner , ” Lee said .	-5.4897
Doubling funding could double the chances that the next achievement in the US artificial intelligence will be achieved , Lee CNBC said in an interview this week .	-3.4526
Lee , whose book “ AI Superpowers : China , Silicon Valley and the New World Order ( AI Superpowers : China , Silicon Valley and the New World Order ) ” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt , is CEO of Sinovation Ventures , a company invested in one of the most famous Chinese KI companies , Face + .	-3.9367
In the 1980s , he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on a KI system that defeated the high-ranking American Othello player , and later became a leader in Microsoft Research and President of Google ’ s Chinese branch .	-5.0225
Lee acknowledged the former US government technology competition , such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency , and asked when the next would take place to identify the next visionaries .	-3.5714
“ Researchers in the US often have to work very hard to obtain government subsidies , ” Lee said .	-2.4309
“ Not China is responsible for the outflow of high-level scientists , but companies , ” Lee remarked .	-2.9505
In recent years , Facebook , Google , and other technology companies have hired university coryphies to work on AI .	-4.0887
Lee said that a modified immigration policy could also help the US reinforce its AI efforts .	-3.7546
“ I think Green Cards should automatically be offered to PhD students in KI , ” he said .	-2.7098

Macedonia is voting in a referendum on whether to change its name .	-2.2469
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether to change their name in the Republic of Northern Macedonia , a step that would resolve a decade-long dispute with Greece that had blocked its offers of accession to the European Union and NATO .	-4.0637
Greece , which has a province named Macedonia , insists that the name of its northern neighbour is a territorial entitlement to the Greek territory , and has veto the country 's entry to NATO and the EU .	-3.7470
In June , the two governments concluded an agreement based on the proposed new name , but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine Macedonia ’ s ethnic identity .	-2.4444
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum , and there is doubt about the result of a boycott campaign , which is a prerequisite for the validity of the referendum .	-4.2125
The question on the vote on the referendum was : ' Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with the adoption of the agreement with Greece ? '	-3.0764
Advocates of the name change , including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev , argue that it is worth keeping the price of being included in institutions such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia , one of the countries to emerge from the Yugoslavia collapse .	-3.9193
“ I have come today to vote on the country ’ s future ; it is a decision for the young people of Macedonia , so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union , because that means a life in more security for all of us , ” said Olivera Georgijevska , 79 , in Skopje .	-3.8561

“ I chose because of my children – our place is in Europe , ” said Gjose Tanevski , 62 , a constituent in Skopje ’ s capital .	-9.6601
Macedonia ’ s Prime Minister , Zoran Zaev , his wife Zorica and his son Dushko , voted in favour of the referendum in Macedonia on the amendment of the country ’ s name , which would pave him the way for accession to NATO and the European Union in Strumica , Macedonia , on 30 September 2018 .	-3.4223
Before the parliament in Skopje , Vladimir Kavardarkov , 54 , has prepared a small stage and presented chairs before the tents set up by those who are boycotting the referendum .	-10.6718
" We are for NATO and the EU , but we want to take part with the heads upwards , not through the service door , " said Kavadarkov .	-3.5251
“ We live in a poor country , but we also have our dignity .	-1.6044
If you do not want to join us as Macedonia , we can turn to others , such as China and Russia , to join us in Euro-Asian integration . ”	-2.8076
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia , a country with an unemployment rate of more than 20 % .	-1.7557
“ I think a large majority will vote in favour , because more than 80 % of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO , ” Zaev said after voting .	-3.6236
According to him , the “ yes ” result would be a “ reinforcement of our future . ”	-2.8110
Last Monday , the Macedonian Institute for Political Research published the results of a survey : between 30 and 43 % of voters would participate in the vote – less than necessary .	-2.6528
Another survey conducted by Macedonia ’ s Telma TV found that 57 % of respondents will vote on Sunday .	-2.6173
Of those who want to participate , 70 % said they would vote ‘ yes ’ .	-3.0912
The referendum will only be adopted if the turnout is more than 50 % .	-1.8898
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to pro-Western policy since it took office in May last year .	-2.5207
View : Sergio Aguero of Manchester City overcomes the entire Brighton Defense on the way to the gate .	-3.3526
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made Brighton 's defense at the Manchester City-2-0 victory on Saturday in Etihad Stadium in Manchester , England .	-3.1508
Aguero made his hit in the 65th minute incredibly simple .	-2.1930
At the beginning of the game sequence , the Argentine storm received a pass in the middle field .	-3.0480
He tricked three Brighton defenders to free himself .	-3.3402
Then Aguero looked surrounded by three green shirts .	-3.6866
He circumvented a defender before running on the brighton penalty for several players .	-4.2430
Then he left a pass and left at Sterling .	-2.3156
The english storm used his first contact to play the ball back to Aguero , which then shot right – past Brighton-Torwart Mathew Ryan in the right side of the gate .	-4.6722
“ Aguero has foot problems , ” said City-Manager Pep Guardiola the reporters .	-2.8046
" We spoke about it ; he played 55 , 60 minutes .	-2.2534
That has happened .	-1.0253
Fortunately , he shot a goal right now . ”	-7.3158
However , it was Sterling who initially led the Sky Blues in the Premier League duel :	-3.3511
The gate came in the 29th minute .	-1.8411
In the game Aguero was played deep in Brighton 's territory .	-2.5528
with a nice steep pass to Leroy Sané along the left side .	-3.8380
San made a few touches before he led sterling to the remote post .	-4.1206

Scherzer wants to play Rockies	-1.3995
As national players were excluded from playoff competition , there was not much reason to force another start .	-3.2020
But the hard-fought Scherzer hopes to climb the hill on Sunday against Colorado Rockies , but only if there are still playoff implications for rockies that have a lead from a game before Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West .	-4.4093
The Rockies won at least one place in Friday evening with a 5 : 2 victory over the National , but the title win in the first league is still not sure .	-5.5161
" Even though we play for free , we can at least beat ourselves , because we know that the atmosphere here in Denver with the people and the other team will probably be the best we have to offer this year .	-4.8137
Why should I not want to make an effort ? '	-3.2029
The nationals have not yet announced a start for Sunday , but are supposedly inclined to let jokes throw in such a situation .	-3.4942

Trump continued : “ You see this terrible , terrible radical Democrat Group , you see that it is happening right now .	-3.1917
And they are determined to regain power by all means necessary , and do not stop it from boshing and communities .	-4.9952
They do not care who they violate , who they have to cross to get power and control , that is what they want , power and control , we will not give them .	-4.4142
“ The Democrats ’ goal is to oppose and block themselves , ” he said .	-1.8019
" And you see this in the last four days , " he said and called the democrats ' angry and common , evil and untrue ' .	-3.3594
" He notably referred to the democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein , a senior member of the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs , harvesting loud crowds from the audience .	-4.2960
" Do you remember your answer ?	-1.7901

The Labour Party is no longer a broad community .	-2.0603
It is intolerant of those who say what they think .	-0.8731
As the current activist in my local party voted to criticise me , it was hardly a surprise .	-2.6897
Finally , I am the last in a number of Labour Members who say that we are not welcome - just because we have said our opinion .	-3.6613
My group colleague , Joan Ryan , has been treated similarly because she has opted firmly for anti-Semitism .	-3.6327
In my case , I have been criticised by the motion of censure because I do not agree with Jeremy Corbyn .	-2.0034

The communication for the East Labour in Nottingham on Friday states : ' We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive ' .	-3.3584
Most of my time in the eight years as a local Labour MEP , the GC meetings on Friday evening were exactly the same .	-2.9657
Unfortunately , it is not the tone of many meetings today , and the promise of a more friendly , more gentle policy has long been forgotten when it has ever begun .	-3.9529
It has become increasingly evident that different views in the Labour Party are not tolerated , and any opinion is judged by whether it is acceptable to party leaders .	-4.2209
This started shortly after Jeremy ’ s assumption of office , because the Members with whom I had previously thought I had a similar political attitude expected me to take a U-turn and take positions that I would not otherwise have agreed with , be it in relation to national security or the EU ’ s internal market .	-6.5185
Whenever I speak publicly – and it does not matter what I say – there is a tirad of abuse in the social media that calls for diselection , denounces the Centre ’ s policy and tells me that I should not be in the Labour Party .	-5.4177
This experience was not only me .	-3.4856
I do know , in fact , that there is more luck than some of my colleagues , because the comments addressed to me tend to be political .	-4.3965
I appreciate the professionalism and determination of my fellow Members , who are subject to a flood of sexist or racist abuse every day , but who are never shocked .	-4.6452
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the scale of abuse has normalized .	-2.2028
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance .	-1.6139
The reality is that we are no longer the broad church and , with any motion of censure or amendment of the rules of selection , the party becomes smaller .	-4.3000
Over the last two years I have received lots of advice to pull my neck , not to be so loud , and then I would be ‘ right ’ .	-4.9104
But for this reason I have not entered politics .	-6.5880
32 years ago , as a student , I joined Labour because of the neglect of the Thatcher Government , which had resulted in my classroom being literally collapsed , as a result I tried to promote better public services for those who need them most , regardless of whether as a local council or a minister .	-6.5756
I have never hidden my political views , even at the last election .	-2.4284
As far as my political positions are concerned , nobody in Nottingham East should have been somewhat confused , as should areas where I disagree with the current leadership .	-3.6277
To those who supported the request on Friday , I just want to say that I do not understand why they are wasting time and energy to remain loyal to me and to the Labour Party when the country is heading towards Brexit , which is detrimental to households , businesses and our public services .	-4.9261
But the only message I have is not Nottingham Momentum , but my constituents , Labour Members or not : I am proud to serve you , and I promise you that I will not prevent any threats to election or political opportunism from the work in what I think is the best interest of all of you .	-5.4972

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose : Ayr Unbeaten at the Leader	-2.3299
Two late tries may have distorted the end result somewhat , but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this wonderfully entertaining Tennent 's Premiership Match of the day .	-3.6711
You are now the only unbeaten of the ten teams running the table .	-4.0595
In the end , the host ’ s superb defense , but also that opportunities were better exploited , and the coach Peter Murchie was very pleased with this .	-7.7983
" We were tested so far through our games and we are still unbeaten , so I must be happy , " he said .	-3.0811
Robyn Christie von Melrose said : “ Thanks to Ayr , they have made better use of their chances . ”	-2.3917
Grant Anderson ’ s 14th minute attempt , transformed by Frazier Climo , brought Ayr forward , but a yellow card for Scotland ’ s captain Rory Hughes , who was given for the game of Warriors , allowed Melrose to speak numbers , and Jason Baggot to make an untransformed attempt to do .	-4.8484
Climo made the lead of Ayr with a punishment before reaching a hit right at the middle of the middle and then made a solo request for the 17.5 break for Ayr .	-8.4535
Melrose , however , began the second half well and Patrick Anderson 's attempt to transform Baggot , reduced the backlog to five points .	-4.3466
After rebooting , Ayr expanded the leadership when a Try was transformed by Stafford McDowal-Climo .	-18.6818
Ayr 's current captain Blair Macpherson then got the yellow card , and again Melrose left the additional man with an unconverted Bruce Colvine attempt to pay at the end of a curse of heavy pressure .	-3.6487
But the home side came back , and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for a tackling without a ball from Climo from the penalty border , MacPherson made a touchdown , the front Ayr back .	-4.8761
Climo converted as almost after the reboot , after Kyle Rowe David Armstrong started boxkick and sent the Gregor Henry wing storm to Try number five .	-4.5490

In the entire enclosed Bolivia , the memory of a coast that was lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the nineteenth century is still alive - as is the desire to return to the Pacific .	-4.2238
These hopes may have been at their peak for decades , as Bolivia is waiting for a ruling by the International Court on 1 October after five years of deliberations .	-3.9109
" Bolivia has the dynamics , spirit of unity and serenity , and naturally awaits the result with a positive view , " said Roberto Calzadilla , a Bolivian diplomat .	-3.5781
Many Bolivians will follow the International Court of Justice ’ s judgment on large screens throughout the country , and hope that the tribunal in The Hague will favor Bolivia ’ s claim that after decades of troubled talks , Chile will have to negotiate to give Bolivia a sovereign access to the sea .	-12.4589
For Evo Morales , Bolivia ’ s charismatic indigenous president – who faces a controversial struggle for re-election next year – is also very much dependent on Monday ’ s decision .	-3.2438
“ We are about to regain access to the Pacific Ocean , ” he commended at the end of August .	-2.6332
Some analysts , however , consider it unlikely that the court will decide in favour of Bolivia , and believe that even a positive decision will not bring about any change for Bolivia .	-3.5748
The Dutch UN body has no authority to grant Chilean territory and has established that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks .	-3.5866
The fact that the ruling of the International Court of Justice came about only six months after hearing the final arguments shows that the case was ' not complicated ' , Paz Zárate , a Chilean expert in international law , said .	-3.9409
Far from pushing Bolivia ’ s cause forward , this may have stopped the last four years .	-3.0072
“ The question of access to the sea is being used by the current Bolivian Government for its purposes , ” said Zárate .	-2.7951
Moral warmongering rhetoric destroyed every remaining Chilean goodwill , she proposed .	-2.5732

Independent schools in Scotland have a track record of academic top quality , which continued with outstanding testing results in 2018 , and individual and group success in sport , art , music and other community activities .	-5.2065
With over 30,000 students throughout Scotland , these schools , represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools ( SCIS ) , are striving to provide their students and parents with the best level of service .	-3.7112
Independent schools are designed to prepare pupils – for secondary education , including at universities , for their desired career and for their role as a world citiz.	-5.0490

The results of this year show that languages are at the top of tables with the highest levels of existence in independent schools .	-3.3414
68 percent of pupils who have studied foreign languages have reached the Higher grade A .	-4.6848
The data collected by the SCIS ’ s 74 membership schools showed that 72 % of students reached a “ Higher grade A ” in Mandarin , while among students learning German , French and Spanish , Note A reached 72 , 69 , and 63 .	-4.1777
This shows that independent schools in Scotland promote foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future .	-2.5903
In the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere , language courses have the same rank as MINT subjects ( mathematics , information technology , science and technology ) .	-3.1684
A 2014 UK Employment and Qualifications Commission survey revealed that 17 % of the reasons why employers had trouble filling vacancies are attributable to a lack of language knowledge . the the . and the the and the .	-15.2284

With the ability to communicate directly with people from abroad , a multilingual person will automatically be ahead of the competitors .	-2.9471
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013 , 75 % were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to talk , and French is the only language that is spoken with a double-digit percentage , namely 15 % .	-11.7630
That is why the current investment in language teaching is important for today 's children .	-2.9633
When children learn to speak several languages – particularly those of developing countries – they will later have a better chance of finding useful employment in the labour market .	-3.9733
Schools in Scotland differ in their language offer .	-2.2987
Some schools focus on the classic modern languages , while other languages that are most important for Britain in 2020 , such as Mandarin or Japanese .	-3.5094

President Donald Trump starts this evening in Wheeling , West Virginia , with a flood of campaign events .	-2.1860
It is the first of five planned elections next week , and Trump also visits the Republican-friendly states of Tennessee and Mississippi .	-3.7273
While its candidate for the vacant Supreme Court remains out , Trump must mobilize his electorate for the upcoming midterm elections , otherwise there is a fear that the Republicans will lose the majority of Congress when elected in November .	-5.3914
When is Trump ’ s West Virginia Rallye tonight and how can they be viewed online ?	-1.9401
Trump 's Rallye in Wheeling , West Virginia , is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight , Saturday , September 29 , 2018 .	-2.2923
You can follow Trump ’ s West Virginia Rallye online via live stream on YouTube .	-1.7755
Trump will certainly respond to this week 's hearings on allegations of sexual abuse against his Supreme Court nominee , Brett Kavanaugh , whose confirmation in office , which the Senate must carry out , was postponed by at least one week until FBI was concluded .	-5.8598
The main aim of these electoral events , however , is to mobilise the Republicans , who face a decisive election in November .	-3.5723
According to Reuters , the aim of Trump ’ s campaign is to mobilize volunteers and supporters with the five elections next week to defend and expand the majority of Republicans in the Senate and House .	-3.4091
“ The majority of Congress is first on the president ’ s agenda , which is why he visited as many states as possible just before the start of the turbulent campaign season , ” a spokesman of the Trump campaign , who does not want to be named , Reuters .	-5.2062
According to the Radionetzwerk West Virginia MetroNews , this evening ’ s Wesbanco Arena election event in Wheeling could attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract the attention of the Pittsburgher media .	-11.2216
On Saturday , Trump West Virgina , the state he won in 2016 with more than 40 percentage points , will visit for the second time this month .	-2.5680
Trump is trying to help the Republicans ’ candidate for the West Virginia Senate , Patrick Morrisey , who lags behind in polls .	-2.6463
According to Reuters , Simon Haeder , Politologist at West Virginia University , said that it is not a good sign to Morrisey that the president must come to improve his poll values .	-4.2933
Ryder Cup 2018 : Team USA is ready to fight to sustain hope for Sunday Singles	-2.9743
After three one-sided encounters , the four games on Saturday afternoon were probably exactly what the Ryder Cup needed .	-2.5898
The swinging pendulum is a freely invented sports concept that players have internalized , especially in competitions like this .	-4.1082
So where would they say now is the momentum ?	-2.0352
“ They had a six-point lead and now there are four , so I think that gives us a bit of momentum , ” Jordan Spieth said when he withdrew for the day . ”	-4.1504
Europe , of course , has 4 points in the lead , twelve more to play .	-4.4090
The Americans , as Spieth says , feel a little wind in their sails , and there was much encouragement for them , not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas , who played together all day and have three out of four points .	-4.8607
Spieth was thinking and set a good example from the outset .	-4.3067
These chicken jewellery were louder than his round went on , he poured a decisive putt to reach a draw in the game 4 after he and Thomas dropped 2 points after 2 games .	-7.8781
His joy about the putt on the 15th hole with which they won the game was such that one thought he still believed in the victory of the Americans .	-4.2067
" You must really concentrate you very strongly and worry about your own game , " said Spieth .	-4.6807
That is all that remains for each of these players .	-3.3351
18 holes to leave an impression .	-1.6490
In the last two days , Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood were the only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas .	-2.7592
Europe ’ s strange but admirable couple plays without failure and makes everything right .	-4.0743
" Moliwood " was the only couple that did not reach a bogey on Saturday afternoon , but they also avoided it on Saturday morning , Friday afternoon and on Friday morning the rear nine .	-3.7449
This run and the way in which its energy appears to flow from this abandoned crowd of spectators makes it the favorites on Sunday and when the sun goes down over Le Golf National there would be no more popular player who seals a possible European victory than Fleetwood or Molinari .	-5.7207
Probably both at the same time in different holes .	-2.2922
To speak of a European victory would be too premature .	-3.3324
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short trials with Sergio Garcia , who won with his partner Alex Noren in the morning .	-2.4663
With a bogey and two doubles at the first nine , the Spaniard and the Swede pit into a hole from which they never came out .	-4.6787
On Sunday , however , nobody will help you out of your hole .	-2.6068
Because of the interactions between the couples , the given advice , the non-given advice and the way a strategy can change in the mouth , it is very fascinating to observe the fourballs and foursomes from close proximity .	-5.4115
Europe has played better as a team and taken on a clear lead in the last day , but this Foursome-session has also shown that Team USA has the pleasure of fighting , which some , especially Stateside , have doubted .	-6.3118
Europe ’ s Ryder Cup Final Day 10-6	-2.3303
Europe will use a solid advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup , having emerged from the fourth and fourth games on Saturday with a 10-6 leadership over the United States .	-3.7327
The inspired Duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the group with two victories over a fighting Tiger Woods to bring its previous record at the Le Golf National to four points .	-3.3799
The European team of Thomas Bjorn , who took to preserve the trophy that she lost two years ago in Hazeltine , dominated an American team fighting with suspects and won the series with 3-1 .	-5.4180
The US offered more resistance in the fourth and won two games , but they could not digest the deficit .	-2.2063
The team of Jim Furyk needs eight points from the 12 individual games of Sunday to keep the trophy .	-2.9282
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four consecutive points , while he and Molinari , after a sensational weekend called " Molliwood " , are only the second couple that wins four points from their first four games in the history of the Ryder Cup .	-3.4948
After destroying Woods and Patrick Reed in the Fourballs , it was assured that they would beat a sobered wood and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau by an even clearer 5 & 4 .	-4.1907
Woods , who dragged through two parties on Saturday , occasionally showed brilliant actions , but he has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in four balls and fourth and seven in a row .	-4.9760
Justin Rose , rested for tomorrow ’ s Fourballs , returned to his partner Henrik Stenson in Foursomes , and beat in a 2 & 1 defeat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – Place One and three in the world .	-4.4870
On a pleasant , airy day southwest of Paris , however , Europe did not have it in its own way .	-2.2991
The three main winners , Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas , set the standard for Americans on Saturday with two points .	-2.9756
They won a bold 2 : 1 victory against the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-pack and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 : 3 in the four-pack after they lost the first two holes .	-3.8313
Only twice in the Ryder Cup story , a team returns from a four-point deficit to the singles , although holder Furyk 's page only needs a draw to keep the trophy .	-4.6165
After two days of second-best , however , a Sunday container looks like going beyond it .	-4.4048
North Korea says that “ there will be no unilateral disarmament without trust . ”	-2.3411
North Korea ’ s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions would deepen its suspicion of the United States , and that , under such circumstances , the country would not unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons .	-4.2367
Ri Yong Ho said to the World Order ’ s Annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken " significant goodwill measures " last year , such as the cessation of nuclear and missile tests , the dismantling of nuclear tests , and the obligation not to disseminate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology .	-5.5831
" But there is no response from the US , " he said .	-2.9953
“ Without any confidence in the US , there will be no trust in our national security , and in such circumstances there is no way that we can disarm ourselves unilaterally first . ”	-3.4002
While Ri reopened the well-known North Korean complaints about Washington ’ s resistance to a “ gradual ” approach to denuclearization , in which North Korea would be rewarded with gradual steps , his declaration seemed significant in that it did not completely reject unilateral denuclearization , as Pyongyang did in the past .	-4.6287
Ri referred to a joint declaration by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a first summit between an incumbent US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June , when Kim committed himself to working towards ' denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula ' , while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea 's security .	-3.8813
North Korea has sought a formal end to the Korean war in 1950-53 , but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons .	-3.1011
Washington also resisted calls for a relaxation of tough international sanctions against North Korea .	-2.8917
The US insists on " denuclearization-first " ( first denuclearization ) and increase pressure through sanctions to achieve its purpose in a mandatory manner , even rejecting the " declaration of the end of the war , " said Ri .	-4.7115
" The perception that sanctions can bring us to the knees is a dream of people who are ignorant to us .	-2.9473
But the problem is that continued sanctions exacerbate our distrust . ”	-1.8702
Ri mentioned no plans for a second Kim / Trump summit , highlighted by the US President at the United Nations at the beginning of the week .	-2.9920
Instead , the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the last five months , and added : ' If the party were to be in such a stalemate on the issue of denuclearization of South Korea and not the US , the de-nuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have fallen into such a dead end ' .	-6.5576
Yet Ri ’ s speech was dramatically different from last year ’ s when he reported it to the U.N. The General Assembly that targeted the US mainland with North Korea ’ s missiles was inevitable after “ Mr. Evil President ” Trump Kim called “ the missile man . ”	-5.1043
This year at the United Nations , Trump , who threatened last year to “ completely destroy ” North Korea , praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm , but he also said that much work had to be done , and sanctions must remain until North Korea destroyed denuclearization .	-4.2252
On Wednesday , Trump said that he had no time frame for this and said : ' It doesn 't matter whether it takes two years , three years or five months ' .	-3.0087
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken .	-1.3872
However , in the United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the UN , Security Council on Thursday , that ' enforcement of the Security Council sanctions must be vigorously and without defect until we achieve complete , final and verified denuclearization ' .	-5.0304
Since 2006 , the Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea in order to prevent the funding of the Pyongyang nuclear and Ballistic missile programmes .	-2.8690
Pompeo met Ri on the margins of the UN General Assembly and then said that next month he will return to Pyongyang to prepare for a second summit .	-3.2031
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year , but his last trip was not good .	-2.0961
He left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made ; only a few hours after that , North Korea condemned him to “ initially similar demands . ”	-4.1170
In a meeting with Moon this month , North Korea promised to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the United States takes ' appropriate measures ' .	-13.1099
He said that Kim told him that the ' appropriate measures ' that he wanted were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore , and steps to normalize relations with Washington .	-3.8824
Harvard students participate in the course to find enough peace .	-2.6214
With a new course this year at Harvard University , all students get more sleep to fight against the growing Macho culture of studying coffee baked nights .	-4.5983
A scientist has found that students at a world-leading university are often unsuspecting when it comes to helping themselves , even when it comes to very simple mechanisms .	-3.9146
Charles Czeisler , Professor of sleep medicine at the Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women 's Hospital , designed the course that he believes is the first of his kind in the US .	-3.1754
He was inspired to start the course after giving a lecture about the effects of sleeping shortages on learning .	-2.9848
In the end , a girl came to me and said : " Why is this told me only now in my final year ?	-4.4638
She said that you never told anyone about the meaning of sleep – which surprised me , ” he told the telegraph .	-3.6253
The first course this year to be offered explains to students how good sleep habits promote academic and sporting performance and improve their general wellbeing .	-4.3500
Paul Barreira , Professor of Psychiatry at the Harvard Medical School and Managing Director of the Health Service of the University , said that the university decided to introduce the course after it discovered that students had sleeped extremely little during the week .	-4.9606
The 1-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks .	-1.6661
In a section there is a picture of a sleeping hall where students click on coffee cups , curtains , trainers and books to be informed about the effects of caffeine and light and how the sporting performance influences through sleep shortages and the meaning of a sleep time routine .	-5.7454
A further section explains how long sleep train can increase the risk of heart attack , stroke , depression and cancer .	-6.8541
A map of the campus with interactive symbols encourages participants to think about their daily lives .	-2.4830
We know that it will not change the behaviour of students immediately .	-2.3001
" But we believe that they have a right to do so - just as you have a right to know the health effects of the decision to smoke cigarettes , " said Prof. Czeisler .	-3.6057
The culture of pride to go through a " night " still exists , he said and added that modern technology and increasing pressure on pupils and students to sleep makes a growing problem .	-4.6266
To have enough sleep of good quality , the " secret weapon " of a student should be to combat stress , exhaustion and fear , he said - also to not grow , as sleeping enough puts the brain in starvation mode and makes it constantly hungry .	-6.1803
Raymond Thus , a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology , Professor Czeisler helped design the course after visiting one of his classes in his first year in Harvard .	-3.6667
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to push for a campus wide course .	-2.2350
The next step , he hopes , is to call on all the doctors to complete a similar study program before entering the Competition College .	-4.9197
Prof. Czeisler recommended that students alert when to go to bed and wake up , and be aware of the harmful effects of the blue light emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting , which can break their cyrcadian rhythm , causing problems in sleeping .	-6.2077
Livingston 1-0 Rangers : Mengas ’ s Goal Erdet Gerrard ’ s MenMeGeGen.	-10.2372
Following a hit by Dolly Menga , Livingston ’ s 1-to-0 defeat for Steven Gerrard ’ s uncertain team came to Livingst.	-5.7760
The Ibrox team wanted to record its first victory since the 4 : 1 triumph in February in St. Johnstone , but the team of Gary Holt added Gerrard ’ s second defeat in 18 games as a trainer , leaving his team eight points behind the disappointed Ladbroke ’ s Premiership Chef Hearts .	-23.1661
Menga landed a hit seven minutes before the half-time , and an inspirational rangers position did not seem as if they could achieve a balance .	-5.3643
Whereas the rangers now fall back to sixth place , Livingston ranks three and lie behind Hibernian only because of the goal difference .	-5.1134
New difficulties for the rangers are emerging , as a head wound had to be supplied by regular judge Calum Spence after hit by a litter – apparently thrown out by the foreign fans sector .	-6.7004
Gerrard made eight changes , passing by Ayr , and straight into the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup .	-11.2902
Holt , on the other hand , raised the same Livi elf that dropped the Hearts a point last week , and he should have been enthusiastic about how his well-trained team did not allow opponents to take action at any time .	-7.4883
The rangers dominated ball ownership , but Livingston managed opportunities better .	-4.8233
They should have met after just two minutes , when Mengas 's first deposit Scott Pittman sent to Allan McGregors Tor , but the midfielder defeated his great change at the gate .	-6.0484
A deep freeze from Keaghan Jacobs then went to Captain Craig Halkett , but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could shoot only far behind posts .	-4.0857
The rangers took control , but there seemed to be more hope than betrayal in their own game , in the last third .	-3.3559
After the first quarter of an hour , Alfredo Morelos was clearly of the opinion that he deserved a penalty after he and Steven Lawless collided , but arbitrator Steven Thomson did not address the Colombian appeals .	-5.4802
The rangers arrive only two shots in the first half , but the former Ibrox Torguard Liam Kelly was hardly captured by Lassana Coulibaly ’ s head jump and the hit of a bislless Ovie Ejaria .	-5.5637
Although Livis ’ s opening strike may have been contrary to the game ’ s performance during the 34th minute , no one can deny that they alone deserved it .	-5.1527
Again , the rangers failed to master a Jacobs standard situation .	-1.9530
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher Scott Robinson played the ball that kept the calm and picked Menga for a simple finish .	-13.1628
Gerrard acted during the break when he exchanged Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the switch immediately affected the game when the wing player played for Morelos , but the impressive Kelly ran from his line to block .	-5.1946
But Livingston continued to attract the guests to play exactly the type of game they like , with Lithgow and Halkett catching long balls after long balls .	-5.7654
Holt ’ s team could have expanded their leadership in the final phase , but McGregor stood well to deny Jacobs before Lithgow came over .	-5.0808
The Rangers Representative Glenn Midleton had another delayed right to a punishment because he devastated himself with Jacobs , but again he saw Thomson looked away .	-6.0159
Almanach : The Inventor of the Victory Counter	-2.5180
And now a page from our Almanach “ Sunday morning ” : 30 September 1882 , which was more than 136 years ago ... The day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm , called Hans , violinist in Germany was born .	-3.6892
Geiger developed a radioactivity detection and measurement method , an invention that eventually produced the device known as Geiger counter .	-4.2912
The Geiger Talker has since become a mainstay of science , as in the 1950s of the film " Bells of Coronado " , which apparently unlikely cowpoke scientist Roy Rogers and Dale Evans appeared :	-4.9389
Man : ' What about everything in the world is that ? '	-1.8912
Rogers : “ It is a violinist who is used to find radioactive minerals like uranium .	-2.5649
If you set up these headphones , you can actually hear the effects of the atoms released by radioactivity in minerals . ”	-3.1080
Evans : “ Tell me , but now it ’ s cracking ! ”	-4.0915
Hans Geiger died in 1945 , only a few days before his 63rd birthday . was and and and . and and and and were and .	-8.5377
But the invention that bears his name will continue to be used .	-2.5480
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “ see ” malicious cells .	-1.3714
New cancer can teach the immune system to " see " and kill evil cells .	-2.1552
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of treatment .	-2.0686
The procedure includes the extraction of immune cells from a patient , modification of those in the laboratory .	-3.1730
You can then see a protein that is common to many types of cancer and then inject again .	-3.1709
A study vaccine shows promising results for patients with a number of cancers .	-2.4804
A woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize rogue cells saw their egg cancer disappearing for more than 18 months .	-3.6454
The method is to extract immune cells from a patient , to change them in the laboratory , so that a protein called HER2 becomes “ visible ” , which occurs in many types of cancer , and then to inject cells again .	-4.0516
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda , Maryland , said : " Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine . "	-2.4096
HER2 “ promotes the growth of various types of cancer , ” including breast , egg , lung and intestinal cancer , said Prof. Berzofsky .	-3.4265
A similar approach to taking patients ’ immune cells and teaching them how to attack cancer cells has worked to treat a kind of leukaemia .	-2.7561
After his performance at Saturday Night Live , Kanye West , dressed with MAGA cap , left a pro-Trump tirade from the stack .	-3.9765
It didn ’ t go well .	-1.9579
Kanye West was released in the studio during a Saturday Night live broadcast after a deepening speech in which he praised the US . President Donald Trump said he would take place in 2020 .	-5.8021
Having listed his third song of the night , Ghost Town , while wearing a Make America Great Mütze , he headed against the Democrats and reaffirmed his support for Trump .	-4.9066
" So often I speak to a white person and she says , " How can you like Trump , he is a racist ? "	-2.5689
Well , if I were concerned about racism , I would have been out of America a long time ago , " he said .	-2.9925
The Saturday Night Live Show began with a sketch in which Hollywood Star Matt Damon made funny appearance before the Senate ’ s Justice Committee on Christine Blasey Fords accusations that Kavanaugh sexually gendered them .	-16.1333
Although it was not broadcast , the film material was shared by West ’ s watchdog by the comedian Chris Rock in the social media .	-4.1903
It is unclear whether Rock tried to mock West with the post .	-3.4558
West , too , complained to the audience that he had been hard behind the stage , because of his head coverage .	-4.4400
" They jumped me behind the stage .	-2.5579
They said : ' Do not go out there with the hat ' .	-3.1819
You have angered me !	-2.0271
And then they say that I am in a given place , " he said , according to the Washington Examiner .	-1.9562
West went on to say : " Want to see the disappeared place ? " and said that he would " attract my superman enchantment , because that means that you cannot tell me what I should do , you want the world to move forward ?	-7.1074
Try it with love . ”	-0.8510
His comments were made at least twice by the audience with bushes and the comedians of Saturday Night Live seemed to be moved , reported variety , and quoted a person with the words : “ The whole studio was dead . ”	-5.0972
It was then used as a substitute for the singer Ariana Grande , whose former friend , Rapper Mac Miller , died a few days ago .	-4.0216
West surprised many with a performance of the song " I Love it " , when Perrier Bottle clashed .	-3.7854
West received support from the head of the Conservative Group TPUSA , Candace Turner , the twitter : " This is for one of the most courageous spirits : DANKE , DASS DU DICH DER MAFIA WIDERSETZT HAST . "	-3.7123
But Talkmasterin Karen Hunter twittered that West is simply " what he is , and that is absolutely wonderful " .	-2.5037
“ But I will not reward anyone ( buying his music or clothing or supporting his art ) , which I believe he accepts and disseminates an ideology that is harmful to my community . ”	-3.8766
It is free .	-0.6843
We also ' added it .	-1.6435
Before the show , the rapper on Twitter announced that he has changed his name and is now called the being formally known as Kanye West .	-3.2043
He is not the first artist to change his name and appears in the footsteps of Diddy , also known as Puff Daddy , Puffy and P Diddy .	-2.6587
Mitrapper Snoop Dogg had the name Snoop Lion and of course that of the later music legend Prince , changed his name into a symbol and then the artist who used to be known as Prince .	-3.9241

" Game of Thrones " -Star Kit Harington Lives Toxic Malness	-2.5428
Kit Harington is known for his heavy-swinging role as Jon Snow in the brachial medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones by HBO .	-3.0428

I personally feel rather strong at the moment - what we did wrong with masculinity ? , he said .	-3.4957
What have we taught men in their youth about the problem we are seeing now ?	-3.1451
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for the rise in toxic masculinity through its very masculine characters .	-2.7218
He continued : What is inherited and what is taught ?	-2.4341
What is taught on television and on the street gives the little boy the feeling that they have to have this particular side of the man ?	-3.5355
I think that is really one of the major questions we have in our time – how can we change that ?	-4.2088
It appears that something has gone wrong for young men .	-2.1078
In the interview he also admitted that he would not make a game of thrones predecessors or continuations when the series ends next summer , and added that he was finished with battlegrounds and horses .	-4.4610

Maxine Waters denies that an employee has reacted to the data of GOP senators , criticises the allegations as “ dangerous lies ” and “ conspiracy theories . ”	-3.4742
On Saturday , US MPs Maxine Waters rejected claims that one of their employees should have published personal data from three Republican US senators on the Wikipedia sides of the legislators .	-3.9519
The Los Angeles democrat is convinced that the claims of ultralight wings and websites have been launched .	-3.8573
“ lies , lies , and even more repulsive lies , ” Waters announced in an opinion on Twitter .	-4.2224

The data of the three senators were published shortly after the survey of Kavanaugh .	-1.9299
Conservative websites like Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with Waters ' office and published the information of a Waters employee , Hill .	-16.2865
“ This unfounded accusation is completely wrong and an absolute lie , ” Waters continues .	-2.3867

This unstinting claim is completely wrong and an absolute lie .	-2.9500
Water ’ s statement quickly led to criticism online , including by the White House ’ s former press secretary , Ari Fleischer .	-2.7160
“ The denial of the matter is extremely annoying , ” Fleischer wrote .	-3.0674
“ This suggests that she is inappropriate as a Congress member .	-2.8918
When someone is accused of having done something , he must not be evil .	-2.6782
They must not be insatiable .	-2.0607
You must not question the plaintiff 's motives .	-2.0490

Fleischer seemed to compare Water ’ s response to the Democrats ’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh , accused by critics of appearing too angry during Thursday ’ s hearing .	-3.2275
Omar Navarro , a Republican candidate who ran next to the seamless Water in the midterm elections , also expressed his thoughts on Twitter .	-4.2246

Review of " Johnny English - One Lives Three " - Poorly occupied parody with Rowan Atkinson	-3.7313
It is a tradition to seek suggestions in every new movie with British tendency for Brexit , and this appears to be applicable to this revival of the Johnny English Action-Comedy-Spoof franchise , which began in 2003 with Joenglishand reviin .	-26.7563
Is the ironic self-satire about the abyss of humanity the nation ’ s new export possibility ?	-3.4233
In any case , the glotzy , rubber and incompetent Johnny English has received the second license to re-massage things .	-5.6773
He is , of course , the silly secret agent who , despite his bizarre claims on smoothie glamour , received a little clouseau , a Spritzer Mr. Bean and a Klacks from this guy , and who contributed a single note to the tie of the fire brigade at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London .	-6.5157
It is also based on the traveller and international , mysterious Atkinson , who once cooperated in the Barclaycard television shows that have been forgotten , always leaving chaos behind . .	-13.6297
There are one or two beautiful moments in this latest Johnny English comedy .	-1.3561
I loved Johnny English , who approaches a helicopter in a medieval armor and briefly beats the main rotor against his helmet .	-3.5704
Atkinson 's talent for body comedy is to be seen , but the humor feels rather weak and strange superfluous , especially since the " serious " film brands like 007 and mission impossible self-confidently offer comedy as ingredients .	-4.1891
The humor feels like being directed more towards children than adults , and for me the mad misfortunes of Johnny English are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson ’ s Mr. Bean silent films .	-4.4831
The perpetual premise now is that Britain is in great difficulty .	-3.1435
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the highly secret British network of spies and revealed the identity of all British agents on the ground to horror the serving agent – a regrettably small role for Kevin Eldon .	-3.5972
It is the last straw for a prime minister who is a pompous and contested person and already suffers a complete core meltdown of political unpopularity . Emma Thompson is doing her best with this quasi-Teresa May figure , but there is not much in the script with which to work .	-5.3302
Their intelligence advisers inform them that , as each individual active spy has been compromised , it must retire someone .	-4.6157
And that means the great path Johnny English himself , who is now employed as a schoolmaster in a noble establishment , but is giving unsurpassed lessons about how to operate as an undercover agent : some nice gags here , while English offers a school of rock academy about spionage .	-6.6556
English is returned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his former long-suffering Kumpel Bough , which is once again played by Ben Miller .	-4.2369
Bough is now a married man who meets a submarine commander , an overwhelming burshicose role in which Vicki Pepperdine is not entirely applicable .	-4.4754
So the Batman and Robin of Chaos at the Secret Service of their majesty are back in action and meet on Olga Kurylenkos beautiful Femme Fatale Ophelia Bulletova .	-3.6704
Meanwhile , the Prime Minister is in danger of hitting the charismatic billionaire that claims to solve Britain ’ s computer problems : the dark Jason Volta , played by Jake Lacy .	-3.9079
English and Bough begin their Odyssey of the colorful Highjinks : as a waiter disguised , they inflict a French Flash restaurant ; they create chaos by smuggling on board Voltas Luxury yachts ; and English triggers pure anarchy when he tries to familiarize himself with a virtual reality headset with the interior of Voltas .	-35.6633
I am sure that all the registers have been drawn for this last sequence , but as lovingly and as outlawed as it is , it is reminiscent of child television .	-6.9827
Very moderate .	-1.5241
And , as with the other Johnny English films , can ’ t I forget : can ’ t the British film industry Rowan Atkinson play a role that really does justice to his talent ?	-4.3154
Labour denies having developed a plan for Britain for a four-day week , for which five days are paid .	-2.7299
Jeremy Corbyn ’ s Labour Party is examining a radical plan in which Britons work only four days a week but are paid for 5 .	-11.8136

The trade union congress has approved the switch to a four-day week as a possibility for workers to use the changing economy .	-4.3202
A high-level source from the Labour Party said the Sunday Times : a policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year .	-2.9777
A four-day week is an objective that is in line with the party ’ s approach to restoring economic balance in favour of workers and the party ’ s overall industrial strategy , but that goal will not be realised overnight .	-5.2885
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea , as the Green Party promised a four-day working week during its election campaign in 2017 .	-2.3681
However , the whole Labour Party does not currently support this move .	-3.5374
A Labour spokesman said : ' A four-day week is not a party policy and is not intended by the party ' .	-2.9551
Treasury Chancellor John McDonnell used last week ’ s Labour Conference to concrete his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy .	-3.0626
Mr McDonnell said that he was determined to regain the power of ' faceless directors ' and ' profiteers ' in utilities .	-2.2196
The Shadow Chancellor ’ s plans also mean that the current shareholders of water companies may not get their full share back , as a Labour government could “ deduct ” because of supposed misconduct .	-5.8592

Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk in “ 60 minutes ” about whether FBI investigations against Kavanaugh could change their minds .	-2.6708
Due to an ongoing FBI investigation into accusations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh , the final vote to appeal the judge to the Supreme Court was postponed by at least one week , and the question is also raised whether the FBI ’ s investigation results might lead to Republican senators abandoning their support for Kavanaugh .	-6.2648
In a Sunday interview , Scott Pelley , correspondent of “ 60 minutes , ” Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham asked whether the FBI ’ s investigation results could persuade them to change their mind .	-4.1005
Kennedy appeared more openly than his South Carolina colleague .	-2.2161
“ In any case , ” Kennedy said .	-1.6524
" I said at the beginning of the hearing that I spoke to judge Kavanaugh .	-1.5770
I called him after that happened after that claim came out , I said : ' Have you done it ? '	-3.2995
He was determined , targeted , unequivocal . '	-2.6533
Graham 's voice seemed to be cast in stone .	-2.5653
" I have an opinion on Kavanaugh board and it would need a bomb accusation , " he said .	-2.9656

" What is the Global Citizen Festival and has resulted in poverty reduction ? "	-10.0270
On this Saturday , the Global Citizen Festival will take place in New York , an annual music event with an impressive selection of stars and an equally impressive mission to end poverty in the world .	-11.5692
This year ’ s seventh Global Citizen Festival will bring together tens of thousands of people at the Great Lawn in Central Park to experience stars such as Janet Jackson , Cardi B , and Shawn Mendes , but also to draw attention to the true goal of the event : end extreme poverty by 2030 .	-11.8681
The Global Citizen Festival , which took place in 2012 , is an extension of the Global Poverty Project , an international interest group aimed at combating poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it .	-2.8736
In order to obtain a free ticket for the event , concert visitors had a whole range of tasks or " actions " , such as volunteering , e-mail to a leader in the world , a telephone or other useful ways of increasing the target of poverty reduction and raising awareness of it .	-6.0749
But how successful has Global Citizen been to achieve his goal at 12 remaining years ?	-2.8949
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert , a real way to persuade people to call for action , or simply another case of so-called clicktivism - people who feel sending a tweet by signing an online petition or an online petition , or by doing so , as if they made a real difference ? is and . and the the the and the the the and the the and the the the and the the the the and the	-18.0955
Global Citizen says that since 2011 , it has recorded more than 19 million “ actions ” by its supporters , pushing for a variety of goals .	-3.0248
It is said that these actions have motivated world leaders to make financial and political commitments worth more than $ 37 billion , which will affect the lives of more than $ 2.25 billion by 2030 .	-3.3503
In early 2018 , the Group led 390 operations and announcements from its actions , of which at least $ 10 billion were already paid or financed .	-3.1559
The group estimates that the funds allocated so far have had a direct influence on almost 649 million people around the world .	-3.0698
The Power of Nutrition , a UK based partnership of investors and executive organisations , has committed themselves to “ helping children to develop their full potential . ” The organization has promised to support Rwanda with $ 35 million to end malnutrition in the country after Global Citizens have entered into more than 4,700 tweets .	-4.8937
“ With the support of the British Government , donors , other state governments , and global cities like you , we can make the social injustice of malnutrition one day history , ” The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman proclaimed the crowd in a live concert in London in April 2018 .	-4.2764
The group also said that , following more than 5,000 actions in the UK , which aimed to improve the nutrition of mothers and children , the government will achieve the financing of the Power of Nutrition project for 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions . the and the the . the and the the the the and the the the .	-13.4731
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on its website , “ Why do you think we can end extreme poverty ? ”	-2.5880

Like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us , we will succeed , because we are more powerful together .	-2.7044

US power , using the Navy , could build a “ blockade ” to impede Russian energy exports – Interior Secretary –	-4.6375
Washington can “ resort ” to his navy if necessary to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets , including in the Middle East , US Home Secretary Ryan Zinke is quoted by Washington Examiner .	-12.5721
Zinke argued that Russia ’ s engagement in Syria was a pretext for exploring new energy markets , especially in activities at the invitation of the legitimate government .	-4.0004
“ I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is as follows : they want to negotiate energy , just as they do in Eastern Europe , the southern part of Europe , ” he said .	-2.7875
And , according to the officials , there are ways to avoid this .	-3.1120
" The United States has this ability to use our navy to ensure that maritime routes are open and , if necessary , block them to ensure that their energy does not come onto the market , " he said .	-4.0568
Zinke spoke to the participants of an event of the Consumer Energy Alliance , a non-profit organization that calls itself the “ voice of energy consumers ” in the US .	-3.3685
He compared Washington ’ s approaches to Russia and Iran and found that they are actually the same .	-2.5326
" The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less to use and replace fuels , " he said , while calling Russia a " one-trick pony " with an economy dependent on fossil fuels .	-2.9182
The opinions come while the Trump administration was on the mission to boost the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe and to replace Russia , which is the much cheaper option for European consumers .	-3.6090
For this reason , members of the Trump administration – including US President Donald Trump himself – are trying to persuade Germany to stop the “ inadequate ” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project that , according to Trump , would turn Berlin into “ prisoners . ”	-3.5354
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11-billion dollar pipeline Nord Stream 2 , which is to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres , is a purely economic project .	-2.7932
The Kremlin argues that Washington ’ s opposition to the project is simply driven for economic reasons and an example of unfair competition .	-2.0931
“ I believe we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument to exert pressure , and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers , ” Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September .	-3.8029

Warren burdened President Donald Trump during the spatial meetings and said that he is ' leading this country in the wrong direction ' .	-5.1179
" I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy , " she said .	-1.5553
Warren ’ s criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court of Chancellor Brett Kavanaugh has not taken a leaf to the mouth .	-5.0959
Warren said in a tweet on Friday : ' Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote ' .	-2.4339
But a survey published on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren ’ s own voters did not believe that it should run in 2020 .	-2.5939
According to a survey by the Suffolk University Political Research Center / Boston Globe , 58 % of the " likely " Massachusetts voters said that the Senator should not run .	-2.2854

The US ’ s new asylum policy has reversed a decision by the 2014 Immigrant Appeals Chamber that undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence can apply for asylum .	-4.2958
The Minister of Justice of the District of Columbia Karl Racine said in an opinion on Friday that the new law ignores decades of national , federal and international law .	-2.6648
The Amicus Curiae states that , according to German law , all asylum applications must be assessed in accordance with the circumstances of the respective complaint and such action violates this principle .	-4.7572
Lawyers further argued in the letter that the policies that refuse entry to immigrants harm the US economy because it is more likely that these immigrant entrepreneurs will become entrepreneurs and “ do the . ”	-4.4205

US ambassadors blame China for “ mobbing ” with “ propaganda advertising . ”	-2.6300
A week after an official Chinese newspaper presented a four-page advertisement in a US daily newspaper on the mutual benefits of US China trade , the US ambassador to China Beijing accused him of using the American press to spread propaganda .	-4.5924
U.S. President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to the paid accompaniment of China Daily in the Des Moines Register , the state with the most selling newspaper in Iowa , after accusing China of interfering in the US congressional elections of 6 November , which China denies .	-19.1892
US officials claim to Reuters that Trump ’ s accusation that Beijing tried to interfere in the US election is a new phase in an escalating Washington campaign to exert pressure on China .	-2.7951
While it is normal for foreign states to place advertisements in order to promote trade , Beijing and Washington are currently in an escalating trade war with several rounds of tariffs on imports .	-5.0454
At an early stage of the trade war , China ’ s retaliation tariffs should , according to Chinese and US experts , hit exporters in US states like Iowa , where many Trump ’ s Republican Party supporters live .	-2.8538
Terry Branstad , US ambassador to China and former Iowa governor , a major exporter of agricultural products to China , said that Beijing has violated American workers , farmers , and businesses .	-3.4817
China , Branstad wrote in an article in the Des Moines Register on Sunday , “ now firmly mobbing through propaganda ads in our own free press .	-4.3813
“ By disseminating propaganda as a paid ad in the Des Moines register , China ’ s government is taking advantage of the estimated American tradition of freedom of expression and press freedom , ” Branstad wrote .	-12.3176
" By contrast , at the newspaper level in the streets of Beijing , you will find only limited divergent voices and see no real rejection of differences of opinion that the Chinese people could have on China ’ s worrying economic development , given that the media are firmly under the control of the Chinese Communist Party , " he wrote .	-5.6760

The Republicans grey with the Kavanaugh debacle voters before the Midterm Elections , Warn AnalysAnalysts	-2.8639
Many of the top Republicans defended board Kavanaugh , a nominee elected to the Supreme Court , even though he was accused of sexual assaults , warning analysts that they will see a counter-attack in the forthcoming elections , particularly women .	-5.0252
The emotions were high , and most Republicans have already said that they want to vote for him .	-3.0043
These things cannot be traced back , said Grant Reeher , Professor of Political Science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University , on Saturday in an article published by The Hill .	-2.5434
Reeer said that he doubted that last minute support from Jeff Flake ( Republican MP for Arizona ) is enough to reconcile upset voters .	-4.5161
“ Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow , nor will they be in November , ” said Karine Jean-Pierre , senior consultant , and national speaker for the progressive MoveOn group on Friday , as a Washington newspaper reported .	-3.3960
On Friday morning , the demonstrators sang “ November comes ! ” while demonstrating in the corridor of the Senate , when the Republicans who control the Justice Committee decided to proceed with Kavanaugh ’ s nomination despite Dr. ’ s statement to continue Christine Blasey Ford , reported Mic .	-4.3585
“ Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be immeasurable , ” said Stu Rothenberg , an impartial political analyst , journalists .	-1.9444
“ People say that it is already quite far advanced , that is true .	-3.2559
But the figure could be higher , especially among voters in suburbs and younger voters , 18 to 29 , who may not suffer the president , but often do not vote . ”	-4.3067
Even before Ford ’ s public statement , in which she expressed her allegations of sexual violence against the candidate for the Supreme Court , analysts noted that a backlash could follow if Republicans pursue the candidacy .	-4.5861
“ This has become a sharp chaos for the GOP , ” said Michael Steele , former Chairman of the Republican National Committee , beginning last week , according to NBC News .	-3.6100
“ It is not just about the election of committees or the final election , or about Kavanaugh being put on the replacement bank , but about how the Republicans have handled this and how they treated it , ” Guy Cecil , US Priorities Director , shared a group that helps elect the Democrats with the news channel .	-6.3880
But the Americans are divided about Ford and Kavanaugh ’ s statements .	-2.5780
A new YouGov survey shows that 41 % of the ford respondents believed evidence definitively or probably , while 35 % indicated that they believed definitively or probably Kavanaugh .	-4.5241
Moreover , 38 % said that they thought Kavanaugh was probably or definitely lied during his statement , while only 30 % said the same about Ford .	-3.4855
On the initiative of Flake , the FBI is currently investigating the accusations of Ford and at least one other prosecutor , Deborah Ramirez , reported to The Guardian .	-3.8001
Ford told the Senate ’ s Justice Committee last week that Kavanaugh had attacked them at the age of 17 .	-3.1968
Ramirez accused the nominee for the highest judicial office , during her studies in Yale in the 1980 ’ s , at a party in the 1980 ’ s , of unleashing his genitals to her .	-7.9046

Desert Island Discs : Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality .	-1.9019
The Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up with the feeling that he was subjected to all because of his sexuality - but that gave him the motivation to become a success .	-4.7261
The 24-year-old said that he had only realised at secondary school that “ not everyone is like me . ”	-3.5725
In the first edition of Desert Island Discs at Radio 4 presented by Lauren Laverne , he said that he spoke publicly about the rights of homosexuals to give other “ hope . ”	-3.0131
He also said that a victory in the Olympic Games after the birth of his first child would have become less important to him .	-2.4984
The regular presenter of the long-running show , Kristy Young , has released several months due to a disease .	-2.8006
Daley appeared in Laverne ’ s first program , saying that he felt “ less worth ” than the others , because “ it was not accepted by society to stand on men and women . ”	-4.2296
He said : “ Until today , these feelings of weniger value and otherness gave me the strength and strength I needed to be successful . ”	-4.3095
He wanted to prove that he was “ something , ” he said , to disappoint nobody when he introduced sexual orientation .	-3.5957
The two-time bronze medal winner has become a high-ranking LGBT activist and used his appearance at this year ’ s Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalise homosexuality .	-13.1569
He said he spoke out because he was lucky to live openly and without consequences , and because he wanted to give others ' hope ' .	-3.5979
The triple world champion said that he loved himself in love with a man , the US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black , who met in 2013 , about which he was very surprised .	-4.8428

The couple became parents of a son , Robert Ray Black-Daley , in June , and Daley said that his " whole perspective " had changed .	-3.4195
“ Last year , everything for me was about winning a gold medal , ” he said .	-9.9380
“ But you know what , there are more important things than Olympic Gold .	-2.5884
My gold medal is Robbie . ”	-0.9163
His son was the name of his father , Robert , who died in 2011 at just 40 years after a diagnosis of cancer .	-3.3042
Daley said that his father would not accept that he would die , and one of the last things he asked was whether they had their tickets for London in 2012 - because he wanted to be in the first row .	-3.5944
“ I couldn ’ t tell him : <unk> You won ’ t see it in the first row , Dad <unk> , ” he said .	-3.8967

On the Ryder Cup Saturday , the Big Mickelson was on the bank ’ s ForS. was . and . and . . and ! . !	-11.9871
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game , but he will have to improve his shape dramatically so that it does not become a sad milestone .	-4.1004
Mickelson , who played for the 12th time at the event every two years , was put on the bank by Captain Jim Furyk for the Fourballs and Foursomees on Saturday .	-3.7655
Instead of being at the center of what happened so often for the US , the five-man Major winner shared his day between fires and practice rounds on the golf course , hoping to overcome his lo.	-5.4384
The 48-year-old , even at the peak of his career , is never the straightest driver and is not suitable for the narrow Le Golf National Square where the long Rough regularly fails .	-4.4042
And as if the square were not challenging enough , Mickelson in the ninth match on Sunday hits the British Open Champion Francesco Molinari , who won all four matches this week together with Neuling Tommy Fleetwood .	-5.1550
If Americans have four points behind when they start the 12 individual games and have a hot start , Mickelson ’ s match may be absolutely crucial .	-4.1682
Furyk revealed his trust in his husband ; what else remained for him .	-5.2576
" He fully understood the role he had today , gave me a clap on my back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow " , said Furyk .	-3.3632
“ He has a lot of confidence .	-2.2567
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has done so much in the past for these teams , and this week .	-1.9277
I would probably not have thought he would play two games .	-2.9135
I had hoped for more , but it did , and that is the way we thought we had to tackle it .	-5.4268
He wants to be out there , just like everyone else .	-2.0635
Until now , Nick Faldo has recorded the most played matches at the Ryder Cup .	-4.5231
This could mark the end of a Ryder cup career that never fits perfectly to the heights of his individual record .	-3.7703
Mickelson won 18 times , 20 times lost , and played unresolved seven times , while Furyk said that his presence would have been invaluable for the team .	-5.2906
" He 's funny , he 's sarcastic , funny , he loves to talk people , and he 's a great guy he can have in the team room , " he explained .	-3.8223
I think the younger players had fun measuring with him this week , that was nice to see . ”	-3.6300
It offers much more than just the game . ”	-1.1687
The European captain , Thomas Bjorn , knows that a great lead can soon disappear .	-2.8823
Thomas Bjorn , the European captain , knows from experience that a great advance in last day 's single games at the Ryder Cup can quickly become an inconvenient knight .	-4.4156
The Dane debuted in 1997 in the game in Valderrama , where a team trained by Seve Ballesteros had a lead of five points towards the Americans , but only scarcely reached the finish line and won with a slightly thin leap of 14 <unk> to 13 <unk> .	-6.5268
" We remember that one was in leadership in Valderrama ; we had a great lead in Brookline where we lost , and in Valderrama we won , but only scarcely , " said Bjorn , after seeing the Class of 2018 , now leading with 10-6 in the Le Golf National , Friday and yesterday with a 5-3 victory .	-6.0395
History will show me and everyone in this team that it is not over yet .	-2.4444
You will have arrived absolutely tomorrow .	-2.7926
Go out there and do the right things .	-1.7473
It is only past when the points are displayed on the table .	-3.3033
Our goal is to win this cup and we focus on that .	-2.7026
I have always said that I firmly believe in the 12 players in our team , but we are dealing with a strong opponent , the best players in the world . ”	-2.4399
Enthusiastic how his players played on a hard golf course , Björn added : " I 'd never be premature .	-3.9840
Tomorrow is also a day .	-1.0936
Tomorrow the personal appearances are coming , and that is another thing .	-7.8447
It ’ s great to be out with a partner when things go well , but if you ’ re out there , your skills as a golf player will be tested on the whole .	-5.4921
This is the message you have to convey to the players : get the best out of it tomorrow .	-4.6373
Now you are moving to your partner and he has to do just as you can . ”	-5.8641
In contrast to Björn , the opposing player Jim Furyk will seek to make sure that his players perform better individually than they do as partners , except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas , who have taken three out of four points .	-5.2305
Furyk himself has seen such a sensational turn on the final day , when he was part of the winner team in Brookline , now he is one of the losers after the European team completed the “ miracle of medinach . ”	-5.8684
" I remember any damned word , " he said on the question of how Ben Crenshaw , the captain of 1999 , had gathered his players on the way to the last day .	-12.2477
Tomorrow we have 12 important games , but we want to get rid of as soon as possible , as we saw in Brookline , in Mediah .	-4.2535
Once an own dynamic has developed , the pressure on the middle matches exerts great .	-4.9183
We built our site accordingly and brought the guys out as we felt , you know , we try to create something special tomorrow . ”	-4.9668
Thomas , along with Paul Casey , Justin Rose , Jon Rahm , Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter , should lead the other European on top rankings in the rankings , the counter-strike against Rory McIlroy in the top game .	-5.3354
I put this group of guys in this order because I think it covers the whole way , " said Bjorn about his individual selection .	-2.6507
Renewed postponement of Germany ’ s New War Ship	-2.1282
The most recent German naval fregate should have been set up in 2014 to replace Cold War warships that have been coming into existence , but it will now take at least until next year , owing to faulty systems and escalating costs .	-7.8630
The commissioning of the “ Rhineland-Palatinate ” , the chief ship of the brand new Baden-Württemberg class , has now been postponed to the first half of 2019 , according to the newspaper “ Die Zeit ” , calling for a military speaker .	-4.8482
The navy should have started ships in 2014 , but serious problems after the first delivery burdened the ambitious project .	-3.7244
The four Baden-Württemberg class freights ordered in 2007 will replace the older Bremen class vessels .	-2.9016
It is assumed that they have a powerful cannon , a series of aircraft defence and ship defence missiles and some stealth technologies , such as reduced radar , infrared and acoustic signatures .	-4.0542
Another important advantage is longer maintenance intervals : the latest frigates should be operational for up to two years without starting their home port .	-5.6804
However , the state-of-the-art warships that should enable Germany to project power overseas will already be outdated by constant delays when they are finally in service , as the weekly newspaper “ Time ” notes .	-5.0982
Last year , the unfortunate F125 fregate made headlines when the German navy officially refused to start the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg .	-4.2382
This was the first time that the navy returned a ship to a ship builder after delivery .	-3.0545
Little was known about the reasons for returning ships ; German media mentioned a number of critical “ software and hardware defects , ” which would make the warship useless in combat operations .	-4.9051
Software shortcomings were particularly important as the Baden-Württemberg class ships are served by a crew of around 120 seafarers - only half of the crew on older Bremen class frigates .	-5.0857
It also turned out that the ship has a considerable overweight , which would limit performance and make future upgrades for the navy more difficult .	-5.1681
It is believed that the 7,000-tonne “ Rhineland-Palatinate ” is twice as difficult as ships of the same class used by Germans in World War II .	-11.6406
In addition to incorrect hardware , the price tag of the entire project - including the training of crew - is also on the subject .	-4.5911
Instead of the EUR 2.2 billion initially proposed , the cost seems to have reached the diminishing € 3.1 billion ( around $ 3.6 billion ) .	-4.0003
In the light of recent warnings , the problems of the newest frigates are of particular importance in Germany ’ s sea-power decline .	-6.8550
Earlier this year , Hans-Peter Bartels , Chairman of the Defence Committee of the German Parliament , admitted that the war fleet was actually “ the ships that could be deployed . ”	-4.3036
The official said that the problem has grown rapidly over time , as old vessels have been left out of service without any replacement .	-5.1353
He complained that none of the Baden-Württemberg Fregatts were put into service by the navy .	-11.9474
The National Trust revolves around the secret life of bats .	-2.9585
New research on a property in the Highlands of Scotland seeks to find out how bats use the landscape for food search .	-3.9677
It is hoped that this will provide new insights into the behaviour of the unique flying mammals , which can provide guidance for future measures to protect animals .	-4.7429
The study by scientists of the National Trust for Scotland will follow in common and soprano ppistles as well as brown long and durable bats in the Inverewe Gardens in Western Ross .	-5.0147
Special recording devices are placed at main points of the accommodation to track bat mouse activities throughout the season .	-3.7445
NHS employees and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys with hand detectors .	-1.7298
A professional tonalysis of all recordings determines the frequency of bat call and arranges calls to species .	-5.1883
The habitat card to be created and the corresponding report should provide a detailed overview of the behaviour .	-3.5530
Rob Dewar , Nature Consultant at the National Trust for Scotland ( NTS ) , hopes to find out which areas of the habitat are most important for the bats and how they are used by the respective species .	-3.8588
This information will help to identify the advantages of habitat management , how meadow formation and how the forests for bats and other related species are best preserved .	-4.9344
The bat mouse populations in Scotland and the whole of the UK have fallen sharply over the past hundred years .	-10.4307
They are threatened by construction works that affect their sleeping places and the loss of habitat .	-2.7632
Wind turbines and lighting may also pose a risk , as well as fly-catch strips and some chemical treatments of construction materials .	-5.6504
Bats are not blind .	-2.0168
The ears are more useful when scoring prey than the eyes .	-5.4257
They use a sophisticated echo orientation technology to locate errors and obstacles in their flight path .	-4.3180
The NTS , which is responsible for maintaining more than 270 historic buildings , 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country , takes the bats very seriously .	-3.0696
There are ten trained experts who conduct regular surveys , inspect sleeping places and sometimes do rescues .	-3.8500
The organization has even set up Scotland 's first and only dedicated bat reserve at the Threade estate in Dumfries and Galloway , where eight of the ten Scottish bats are home .	-4.4884
According to David Thompson , the property is an ideal habitat for them :	-1.8734
“ Here in Threave we have a great area for bats . ”	-2.4839
" We have the old buildings , many old trees and all the good habitat .	-2.0639
But there is still a lot of unknown about bats and the work that we are doing here and elsewhere helps us to understand better what they need to live . ”	-4.0003
He stresses that it is important to check whether bats are there before maintenance work in buildings , and he says it is possible that when a single sleeping place is destroyed , up to 400 females and boys may be killed , a whole local population may be eradicated .	-7.5713
Bats are protected ; it is forbidden to kill , harass or disturb them and destroy their sleeping places .	-3.3358
Elisabeth Ferrell , Scottish Bat Conservation Trust , has encouraged the public to help .	-1.4969
She said : ‘ We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we simply do not know how their populations are . ’	-2.9280
Ronaldo denies rape claims when lawyers sue the German magazine .	-2.3245
Cristiano Ronaldo has branded rape claims against him as " fake news " and claims that people want to " promote themselves " by using his name .	-3.6061

The storm from Portugal and Juventus was accused of raping an American in 2009 called Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas .	-2.8828
He then paid $ 375,000 to keep quiet about the incident , The mirror reported on Friday .	-3.2842
Hours after the allegations were reported , Ronaldo , 33 in an instagram live video to his 142 million followers , reported the reports as “ fake news . ”	-4.1384
No , no , no , no .	-0.7381
What they say today , fake news , “ said the five-time Balloon D 'Or winner in the camera .	-9.9003
" You want to apply for yourself by using my name .	-1.9582
“ That is normal .	-1.6942
They want to draw attention to themselves when they say my name , but it is part of the job .	-2.1896
I am a happy man , and everything is good , ” added the player smiles .	-2.7995
Ronaldo ’ s lawyers are preparing an appeal against the “ Der Spiegel ” magazine for allegations ; according to Reuters , you spoke of “ an inadmissible reporting of privacy suspicions . ”	-4.7312
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player will claim compensation for “ intangible damage in the amount of injury likely to be one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years . ”	-4.5531
The alleged incident will have taken place in June 2009 in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas .	-3.2310
According to documents submitted to the district court of Clark County in the United States state of Nevada , Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the room of the player after learning to the Night Club , where he raped them analytically .	-6.6255
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo had fallen to her knees after the alleged incident , saying that he was “ 99 % ” a “ good guy ” left in the lurch by the “ one percent . ”	-4.3827
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex , but it was agreed .	-1.8842
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and made photos of her injuries in a hospital , but later agreed to an extrajudicial agreement because she feared retaliation and worried about being " publicly humiliated " .	-4.3061
The 34-year-old says that she is now trying to declare the agreement invalid because it continues to be traumatised by the alleged incident .	-3.4841
Ronaldo was close to changing to Real Madrid of Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack and switched this summer with a 100-million euro deal to Italian Giants Juve .	-4.5449
Brexit : Britain would regret losing car manufacturers forever .	-2.1120
“ The United Kingdom would regret it in time if it lost its position as the world ’ s leading car manufacturer after Brexit , ” said Economic Minister Greg Clark .	-3.6923
He added that it was ' worrying ' that Toyota UK told the BBC that they would temporarily stop production at their plant in Burnaston , near Derby , if Britain left the EU without a deal .	-3.3182
“ We need an agreement , ” Clark said .	-1.2196
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the effects of delays at borders in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs .	-3.0514
Last year , Auris and Avensis brands in Burnaston produced nearly 150,000 cars , of which 90 % were exported to the rest of the European Union .	-3.1358
“ When the United Kingdom leaves the EU at the end of March without an agreement , I think it comes to production stops , ” said Marvin Cooke , CEO of Toyota in Burnaston .	-4.6065
Other British car manufacturers have expressed fears of leaving the EU without agreement on cross-border trade procedures , including Honda , BMW and Jaguar Land Rover .	-11.1144
BMW , for example , has already announced its plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit .	-2.4918
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers say about the risks of the supply chain in the event of a ' no deal Brexit ' .	-3.3096
Toyota production plants are based on demand-oriented manufacturing , i.e. , the parts are delivered every 37 minutes by UK and EU suppliers for special manufactures .	-13.9986
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU on 29 March without an agreement , there may be delays on the border that , according to industry information , can lead to delivery shortages and partial shortages .	-4.3675
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day of stock in his plant in Derbyshire , the company said , and so production would be stopped .	-2.4236
Mr Clark said that Theresa May ’ s Chequers Plan for future relations with the EU was “ exactly calibrated to avoid these border controls . ”	-2.9218
We need to have a deal , and we want the best deal that not only allows us to succeed today , we also want to seize this opportunity , ” he said to the BBC Radio 4 programme .	-4.8080
“ The reference not only to Toyota , but also to other manufacturers , is that we must be able to continue with what has become a very successful series of supply chains . ”	-3.9899
Toyota did not indicate how long the production stop could take , but warned that the increase in costs could in the long term suffer the competitiveness of the plant and , after all , lose jobs .	-5.8320
Peter Tsouvalaris , trade union representatives , and employed in Burnaston for 24 years , said that union members have been increasingly concerned : “ My experience , once they have been degraded , is forever lost . ”	-4.7635

The Trump ’ s Rosenstein Meeting could shift again , says the White House	-2.7559
Donald Trump ’ s high-ranking meetings with the Deputy Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein could be " postponed another week " , as the struggle for the Supreme Court candidate , Brett Kavanaugh , read the White House on Sunday .	-4.7918
Rosenstein supervises the work of the Special Adviser Robert Mueller , who examines Russian interventions in the elections , the links between Trump and Russia , and the possible obstruction of the president ’ s judiciary .	-4.1887
Whether or not Trump will fire the Deputy Prosecutor , and so that Müller 's independence will be jeopardised , Washington has made a lot of success for months .	-4.8946
Earlier this month , the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed carrying a cable to record talks with Trump and make it possible to remove the president from the 25st constitutional amendment .	-3.2575
Rosenstein rejected an opinion .	-1.3678
Yet last Monday he went to the White House , while reports hailed that he was just before the resignation .	-4.5507
Instead , a meeting with Trump , who was then with the United Nations in New York , was announced for Thursday .	-2.1829
Trump said he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein , but then the sitting was delayed to avoid a collision with the hearing of the Senate ’ s Justice Committee , in which Kavanaugh and one of the women , Dr Christine Blasey Ford , accused him of sexual misconduct .	-3.8454
On Friday , Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of the claims against Kavanaugh and further delayed a full Senate vote .	-2.7075
Donald Trump ’ s press spokesperson Sarah Sanders was on Fox News on Sunday .	-1.7938
After the Rosenstein meeting she said : " A date for this has not yet been set , it could be this week , I could see that I postpone another week , given all the other things that go ahead with the Supreme Court . I .	-5.6756
But we will see and I always keep the press informed . '	-7.6265
Some reporters would challenge this claim : Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September .	-2.1129
The guest Chris Wallace asked why .	-0.9525
Sanders said that the lack of briefings was not due to a reluctance to television reporters who behaved like self-performers , but she also said : ' I will not be against them in the gallery ' .	-5.7615
She then proposed that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase .	-2.1688
" The President carries out more questions and answers than any president before him , " she said and added , without calling evidence , " We have looked at these figures . "	-4.0752
Briefings will still take place , Sanders said , but if the press had the chance to put questions directly to the President of the United States , it would be infinitely better than to talk to her .	-4.4562
We are trying to do a great deal of that , and you have seen how we have done it in recent weeks , and a press discussion will be replaced if you can speak to the President of the United States itself . ”	-4.6892
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or attending public meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries .	-2.2775
Press conferences with one person are rare .	-0.7426
In New York , the president maybe showed why he made a free-flowing and sometimes bizarre appearance before gathered reporters .	-4.2770

The Scottish parliament , Jane Freeman , wrote her letter less than 6 months before Britain leaves the EU .	-15.4580
The Scottish Government has agreed to pay for the agreed status applications for EU citizens working in their decentralised public service .	-3.0708
In her letter , Mrs Freeman wrote : “ During the summer , negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU were continued on withdrawal , steering on expected decisions in the autumn .	-3.8631
But the British Government has also intensified its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario .	-1.8915
I know that this must be a very worrying time for you all .	-2.1956
That is why I wanted to repeat now how much I would appreciate the contribution of each staff , regardless of their nationality .	-3.6654

Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp tax when buying property in the UK - the additional money will be used for homeless , Theresa May announces today .	-3.6605
This step is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn ’ s efforts to attract young voters with promises , offer more affordable housing , and seek high incomes .	-4.2199
The stamp fee is applied to people and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK , and the additional money will help the government to combat homelessness .	-4.0594
The surcharge - which is charged in addition to the current stamp tax , including the higher rates for secondary housing and rental introduced two years ago - could be up to three percent .	-4.6916

The new policy comes only a few weeks after Boris Johnson had called for a stamp tax cut to help more young people possess their first house .	-2.9913
He accused large construction firms of keeping house prices high by purchasing land cheaply but not cultivating it , and asked Ms May to abolish affordable housing quotas to end the missing housing in Britain .	-5.5550
Mr Corbyn has announced a precise set of proposed housing reforms , including rental controls and ending indebtedness .	-4.9838

Mrs May said : “ Last year , I said that I devote my premiere to the revival of the British dream – life should be better for every new generation .	-3.4450
And that means putting our broken housing market in order .	-1.7203
Britain will always be open to people who live , work and build a life .	-2.1079
However , it cannot be right that it is just as easy for foreign companies and people who do not live in the UK to buy homes as for hard-working British citizens .	-4.0178

" The success for me is currently defined by the question " Can I bring this association back to the Premier League ? "	-3.2048
With its structure and facilities this club belongs undoubtedly to the Premier League , ” he said .	-2.8250
" Creating it is not an easy task , but I would probably only see myself as a success if I can bring the club back there . "	-4.7651
Ross is only three years in his management career , after a time as co-trainer at Dumbarton and a 15-month spell for Hearts ' coaching staff .	-3.1995
He then helped Alloa recover from the Relegation to the third class , and helped St. Mirren from the edge of the Relegation to the master title in the following season .	-5.3377
Ross also says that during his career with Clyde , Hartlepool , Falkirk , St Mirren and Hamilton Academical he never felt as comfortable as now .	-3.4053

The summer heat wave has increased revenue for the attacked British pubs , but increased pressure on the restaurant chains .	-12.8107
Pub and bar groups received a 2.7 % plus in July - but revenue in restaurants fell 4.8 % , so the figures were .	-5.0442
Peter Martin , the CGA company consultancy that put the figures together , said : " Sustained sunshine and England more than expected continuing participation in the World Cup resulted in July following a similar pattern as in June , when the pub search rose by 2.8 % , only that restaurants were more affected .	-6.5149
The fall in the gastronomy business by 1.8 % in June was only exacerbated in July .	-3.9471

It is not surprising that restaurants are still under pressure , although a 4.8 % drop in sales will be particularly painful in comparison with last year ’ s ongoing cost pressure .	-4.7921
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food operators , and time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will provide much-needed pause .	-4.2057

Dairy pump advertising , where mothers are compared to cows , led to controversial online discussions .	-2.6674
A dairy pump company has provoked controversial online discussions due to an ad that compares breastfeeding mothers with cows .	-4.1567
On the occasion of the market launch of the supposedly " first noisy and portable milk pump " , the consumer tech company Elvie published an ironic advertising inspired by music videos to show what freedoms mothers are offered with this new pump .	-4.9682
Four real mothers dance in a chicken in the middle of cows to a number with the following song text : " Yes , I melt me , but you see no cock " and " If you have not noticed that there are no euters , they are my breasts . "	-5.1963
The slogan goes on : " Pump off , pump off , I feed the babies , pump off , pump off , I melt my Ladies . "	-4.0313
However , the display published on the Facebook page of the company has caused controversy online .	-3.3561
With 77,000 calls and hundreds of comments , the video has received mixed reactions from spectators , many of whom say that it lit the " horrors " of dairy farming .	-3.9719
" It is a very bad decision to advertise cows for this product . "	-2.0859
Like us , they also need to become pregnant and bear to produce milk , except that their babies are taken away within a few days of birth , " a person wrote .	-4.2297
The Elvie Milk Pump fits inconspicuously in a Still-BH ( Elvie / Mother ) .	-4.0721
Another commented : " Understandably traumatic to mother and baby .	-1.6879
But yes , why should we not promote a milk pump for mothers who can keep their babies ?	-2.9948
Someone else added : ' Such an outsider advertisement ' .	-1.7796
Others defended advertising , including a woman who admitted that she found the song “ urcomic . ”	-2.7649
I think that is a great idea .	-1.1790
I would have got one if I had stood still .	-2.9838
I felt like a cow by pumping it off .	-2.9577
The display is a bit crazy , but I took it as what it was .	-2.7789
This is a brilliant product , " wrote a person .	-1.9589
Another commented : " This is a fun advertising for mothers who pump ( often in their jobs or toilets ) and feel like " cows " .	-3.7674
It is not advertising that the dairy industry praises or judges . '	-2.7653
At the end of the video , the group of women reveals that they have all danced with the decent pumps in their BHs .	-3.0548
The concept of the campaign is based on the recognition that many women pumping milk say they feel like cows .	-2.6851
The Elvie Pump , however , is completely noiseless , has no wires or hoses and fits inconsistently in a silent sheet , leaving women free to move , keep their babies and even go out of pumps .	-6.3913
Ana Balarin , partner and ECD commented on Mother : " The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that deserves a bold and provocative market introduction .	-3.2005
By drawing a parallel between the expression of women and dairy cows , we wanted to focus on the breast pump and all its challenges , while demonstrating in an entertaining and comparable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring .	-11.8975

Hundreds of migrant children went quiet into a tent camp on the Texas border .	-2.6030
The number of children imprisoned with migratory backgrounds increased , although the monthly border crossings remained relatively unchanged , partly because the Trump administration ’ s hard rhetoric and policies made it more difficult to sponsor children .	-4.5972
Traditionally , most sponsors themselves have been undocumented immigrants , fearing that they risk being expelled to the country when they advocate a child .	-4.1917
The risk increased in June , when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to make fingerprints and that the data would be passed on to immigration authorities .	-3.5533
Last week , Matthew Albence , a senior official within the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Authority , testified to the Congress that the Agency had arrested dozens of people who had advertised to support unaccompanied minors .	-3.2238
The Agency later confirmed that 70 % of arrests had no previous records of criminal records .	-2.7607
" Almost 80 % of people who are either sponsors or budgetary members of sponsors are illegal here in the country , and much of them are criminal alien .	-12.0108
" We are following these people , " said Albence .	-3.5989
In an effort to deal with the requests for children more quickly , officials introduced new rules that some of them require to appear in court within a month of imprisonment , and not after 60 days of what was the previous standard , according to the accommodation staff .	-5.6712
Many will appear not personally , but via video telephone conferences to plead for legal status at an immigration judge .	-3.9463
Those who do not qualify for a discharge are put off quickly .	-3.6857
The longer children remain in prison , the more likely it is that they are afraid or depressed , which can lead to violent outbreaks or attempts to escape .	-4.0160
Advocates said that these concerns are being heightened in a larger institution like Tornillo , where signs that a child has to fight are rather overlooked because of its size .	-5.0644
They added that the moving of children to the tent town without having enough time to prepare them emotionally or get rid of friends could exacerbate a trauma with which many are already struggling .	-5.0537
Syria calls on US , French , and Turkish “ occupying forces ” to withdraw immediately .	-2.2282
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home before the UN General Assembly , even though the war in the country has been going on for eight years .	-2.8011
Moualem , who is also Deputy Prime Minister , said that , on the pretext of combating terrorism , foreign forces are illegal on Syrian soil , and “ they will handle it accordingly . ”	-4.6541
“ You must immediately withdraw unconditionally , ” he said to the Assembly .	-2.1762
Moualem claimed that Syria ’ s “ war on terror ” was almost over , with more than 360,000 people died in the country since 2011 , and millions more were expelled from their homes .	-4.2572
He said that Damascus will continue to fight “ this holy battle until we have liberated all Syrian territories ” from both terrorist groups and “ any illegal foreign presence forces . ”	-2.7900
The US has roughly 2,000 troops in Syria ; mainly train and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs , who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad .	-3.2401
France has deployed more than 1,000 ground soldiers in the war-torn country .	-2.2443
On the question of refugees , Moualem said that the conditions for return were right , and he accused “ some Western countries of fueling irrational fears , ” which led refugees to stay away .	-4.5301
“ We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate their return , ” Moualem said .	-9.3704
“ They politicize a purely humanitarian question . ”	-1.5089
The United States and the European Union pointed out that reconstruction aid could only be given to Syria if a political agreement between Assad and the opposition had come to an end to the war .	-4.6188
UN diplomats said that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold , Idlib , created the opportunity to advance political talks .	-4.1563
The Russian-Turkish deal prevented a large-scale attack by Russia by Syrian troops on the province in which three million people live .	-2.6557
Moualem , however , stressed that the agreement establishes “ clear deadlines , ” and he hopes that military action will be directed against jihadists , including fighters from the Nusra Front associated with al-Qaeda , which will “ be wiped out . ”	-5.4738
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes that soon the first meetings of a new committee of government and opposition members will be convened to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and open the way to elections .	-3.4780
Moualem mentioned conditions for the Syrian government ’ s participation in the committee : he said that the work of the body should be limited to “ reviewing articles from the current constitution , ” and warned of interference .	-4.0712

External money is flowing into the shortest races of the midterm elections to the House of Commons	-9.2094
It is not surprising that Pennsylvanias 17 is experiencing a flood of cash , thanks to a reorientation of a Congress district that reached two incumbents in a race for the same seat .	-4.4433
For this new district in the suburb of Pittsburg , the Democrat Conor Lamb – who won a seat in another district in a special election last spring .	-3.0664
Lamb opposes another incumbent , the Republican Keith Rothfus , who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania , which is clearly overlapping with the new 17th district .	-4.2563
The cards were re-mixed after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that the old districts were manipulated unconstitutionally in the sense of the Republicans .	-3.4863
The race in the new 17th has triggered a campaign financing slag exchange between the major party financing groups , the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee ( DCCC ) and the National Republican Campaign Committee ( NRCC ) .	-4.2614
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after winning special elections in Pennsylvania in March for the 18th Congress district in Pennsylvania with great victory .	-3.6067

But sanctions were only considered against El Salvador , which received an estimated $ 140 million in American aid in 2017 , including drug controls , development , and economic support .	-3.4624

Why did Mr Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to determine ?	-1.8668
Their restraint is simply due to the timing .	-1.6295

Nancy Pelosi refers to Brett Kavanaugh as hysterical and says that he is unsuitable for the Supreme Court service .	-3.1244
The Chairman of the Democratic Minority Group , Nancy Pelosi , called Brett Kavanaugh , “ hysterical ” to the Supreme Court of Justice ’ s nominee , saying that he was unsuitable from temperament to serve the Supreme Court .	-4.5996
Pelosi made the comments on an interview saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin , Texas .	-1.8653
“ I could not be different from thinking that if a woman ever behaved in this way , they would have called it “ hysterical , ” Pelosi said about her response to Kavanaugh ’ s statement to the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday .	-4.2922
Kavanaugh emotionally loaded the allegations that he had sexually attacked Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both young people .	-3.9345
During his opening speech , Kavanaugh was very emotional , sometimes he shouted almost and fought with the tears when he talked about his family and his high-school years .	-3.3266
He also explicitly condemned the democrats in committee , calling the allegations against him a “ grotesque and coordinated reputation campaign ” organised by Liberals who are angry that Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election .	-4.2814
Pelosi said that she believed that Kavanaugh ’ s statement proved that he could not serve before the Supreme Court , as he showed that he was biased against democrats .	-4.0761
“ I believe that he himself disqualified with such statements and the way in which he can be influenced by the Clintons and the Democrats , ” she said .	-3.4617
When asked whether , in the event of its confirmation and a democratic majority in the House of Representatives , it would seek an impeachment procedure against Kavanaugh , Pelosi hesitated .	-4.4092
“ I want to say this : if he says the truth neither to Congress nor the FBI , he is not only inappropriate for the Supreme Court service , but also for the service to the court in which he is currently working , ” Pelosi declared .	-6.0627
Kavanaugh is currently a district judge in DC appeal court .	-10.0873
Pelosi added that she was a democrat concerned about possible Kavanaugh rulings against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade , because he stands for conservative justice .	-3.3319
In his confirmation hearings , Kavanaugh has evaded questions as to whether he would topple certain decisions of the Supreme Court .	-4.1356
