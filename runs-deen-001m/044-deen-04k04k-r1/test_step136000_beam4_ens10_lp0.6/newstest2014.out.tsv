Gutach : More security for pedestrians	-2.1250
They are not 100 metres away from each other : on Tuesday , the new B 33 pedestrian lamp on the village parking lot was put into operation in Gutach - in sight of the older town hall lamp .	-7.0623
Two installations so close to each other : intention or bypassing ?	-5.0311
Yesterday , Gutach ’ s mayor clearly answered that .	-3.0692
" The Town Hall Hall Hampel was installed at the time because it secures the school path , " explained Eckert yesterday .	-6.0985
The Kluser traffic lights ensure both cyclists and bus passengers and mountain residents .	-3.9815
The plant officially commissioned yesterday is important for the intersection of Sulzbachweg / Kirchstra<unk>e .	-3.5723
We have the museum , two churches , spa park , the bus stop , a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area <unk> Grub <unk> .	-3.0147
Eckert said that " with the high volume of traffic and pedestrian traffic , there was a further traffic light on their safety .	-7.2886
This also confirms Peter Arnold of the Offenburg Council .	-2.2528
" According to current measurements , approximately 12 000 vehicles per day go through the municipality of Gutach on the B 33 , of which approximately 10 percent are heavy traffic , " said Arnold .	-5.2681
Therefore , the construction of another light is more than necessary : ' Safety just goes ahead ' , arnold says .	-4.4848
Four traffic sights were carried out and a roundabout was also conceived , but because of the narrow corner of the Sulzbachweg / Kirchstra<unk>e intersection .	-6.5348
Arnold says everything was tested in the selection of the traffic lights : " By means of an extraordinarily long wooden trunk loaded transporters we have tested whether these vehicles can go from the Sulzbachweg to the B 33 without knicking the traffic lights " .	-9.0545
The approximately EUR 15 000 expensive traffic light system itself is the ' most modern thing currently on the market ' , explained Arnold .	-5.5533
The plant is equipped with coloured LEDs , which shine so vigorously that the lights are easily recognized by drivers , for example , even in the low sun .	-7.4220
And economical : the older lights consume about 100 watts , the new just eight watts .	-3.7565
There are three light systems per journey .	-8.9882
Arnold explained the technology of the new plant : This is equipped with two radar sensors .	-3.1263
Pressing the pedestrian light button , the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation .	-2.5209
If the road is free , comes immediately green for the pedestrian , if not , it takes about 15 seconds .	-2.5293
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase for the pedestrian can be finished .	-2.9584
" If a group or disabled people cross the road , the green phase will be extended , so everyone will come safely across the road , " said Arnold .	-5.1880
Naturally , the driver should have a say as a partner and watch the road .	-6.7854
This was not the case yesterday : hardly did the traffic light show green for pedestrians , a top class vehicle rolled through - with shining red .	-4.4293
Josef Winkler has been writing for more than 30 years the needs of his childhood and youth from the soul .	-2.7591
The catastrophes of his Catholic village childhood - the voice loss , the slope to raw violence and stubborn sexuality , the narrow and joylessness - have often described the Carinthian poet .	-5.8822
The Buchner Prize winner is known primarily as a prosaauthor , theatre texts are rare in his work .	-4.8474
Collage from prosatexts Gerhard Fresacher comprises a collage of prosa texts for his performance " Weon the tongue tip " , which is now visible in Garage X at Petersplatz .	-5.6595
The theatre maker , for example , combines elements from the autobiographically characterized novel " Der Leibenige " ( 1987 ) with prosaminiatures from " Leichnam , his family revolutionary " ( 2003 ) .	-5.7824
The eight-headed ensemble is hanging through the text material on the largely empty stage - an important requirement : a broken sofa , on which it is otherwise colulated and masturbated - the eight-headed ensemble .	-8.0704
Director Fresacher seems to have little faith in the text .	-2.8883
The 70-minute performance surpasses the template with a wealth of regional features , known as the repertoire of postdramatic forms .	-5.2193
Above all , the actresses come up with some questionable scenic translations .	-4.8807
They are toughly attacked , smoked under water , with their evening drones tagged to the wall .	-6.4555
Forced in cellophane or leather , they stack on dangerously high stocks by staging , either monologize loudly or are completely silenced on the stage floor .	-6.4862
However , the text hardly conveys itself in this arduous way .	-4.2372
The best moments in the evening when sung - the bandwidth ranges from Deep Purple to popular songs .	-3.3478
Only by the end will the over-rotated performance come to rest , and Winkler ’ s aftermath absurd humor blows up .	-6.2189
A Blackbox in the Car ?	-1.6691
US road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the declining high-way system , and believe that the solution has been found in a small black box that can be placed on the armature board of every car .	-5.1460
The equipment that record every kilometre driven and report information to the authorities is at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and state planning offices to revise the obsolete system for financing US roads .	-4.0561
The normally boring area of road planning has suddenly created an intensive debate with colourful alliances .	-3.3871
Libertarians have joined environmental groups and argue that the government can use small boxes to record the kilometres driven – and possibly also where they have been driven – and then use the information to calculate tax models .	-5.0308
The Tea Party is horrified .	-0.8715
The American Civil Rights Association ( ACLU ) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of concerns about data protection .	-2.2707
But , while Congress cannot agree on action , several states are no longer waiting .	-2.7789
They are currently checking how they can switch over the next ten years to a system where drivers pay per mile driven .	-4.2722
Thousands of drivers have already tested the tachographs , some of which have GPS monitoring .	-2.3368
This is really a must for our country .	-1.9804
“ It is nothing we may only use , ” said Hasan Ikhrata , Managing Director of Southern California Assn. of Governments , who plans to record the miles driven by all Californian drivers in the state from 2025 .	-4.4687
The way we pay these taxes will change .	-1.4496
The technology for this is there .	-1.7707
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund , funded from taxes paid to US Americans at the fuel column , is broken .	-4.3242
But America is no longer getting as much in the way it used to .	-4.2603
Cars use less petrol .	-1.6935
The government mineral oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon ( less than 4 Eurocent per litre ) has not increased for 20 years .	-3.2756
Politicians do not dare to raise the tax by just one cent at high injection prices .	-4.0436
“ The gasoline tax is simply not future-proof , ” Lee Munich said , an expert on transport legislation at the University of Minnesota .	-10.9987
His federal state has recently equipped 500 cars with tachographs to test a mile-based payment system .	-12.0707
“ This is the longer-term most useful alternative , ” he said .	-2.8277
Bureaucrats call it a mile-based user fee .	-1.7774
It is not surprising that the idea is supported by urban liberals , for example , because the tax could be used to influence driving behaviour in such a way as to reduce congestion and climate-damaging exhaust gases .	-5.5579
California ’ s planners rely on the system to draw up strategies to achieve the Federal State ’ s ambitious , legally anchored goals on climate change .	-4.8529
But the Republican Bill Shuster from Pennsylvania , Chairman of the House Transportation Committee , also stated that he was the most viable long-term alternative .	-3.0002
The Reason Foundation ’ s freelance marketers are also enthusiastic about the idea of letting drivers pay on a journey .	-7.1154
“ This is not a tax that disappears in a black hole , ” says Adrian Moore , Vice President of Reason , for directives .	-2.6906
People pay directly for what they get .	-1.2270
The movement is also supported by two former US Transport Ministers who , in a report in 2011 , called on Congress to move toward mile-based settlement .	-3.3835
Last year , the US Senate approved a $ 90 million pilot project , comprising 10,000 cars .	-2.1843
But the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the push , responding to the concerns of rural MEPs who represent people who often have to go many miles on their way to work or to the city in everyday life .	-6.3631
Several states and large cities are nevertheless moving in that direction in their own fashion .	-10.6731
Oregon , who currently has 5,000 drivers , is most committed to the country ’ s biggest experiment .	-4.2223
These drivers will soon pay the mileage fees to the federal state instead of the petroleum tax .	-3.4512
Nevada has already completed a pilot project .	-1.0852
New York City is also considering such a move .	-2.0380
Illinois tests it to a limited extent with trucks .	-1.4627
And the I-95 coalition , which includes the Transport Ministries of 17 states on the east coast ( including Maryland , Pennsylvania , Virginia , and Florida ) , is currently examining how to introduce the change . the and the the . the the the the the the the the the the the .	-10.2312
The concept is not a universal hit .	-0.8239
In Nevada , where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with the equipment , drivers were sceptical about the idea that the government could pursue any of its movements .	-2.7986
“ Concerns about Big Brother and such things were a major problem , ” says Alauddin Khan , head of strategy and earnings management in the Nevada Transport Ministry .	-3.6916
People did not want it .	-1.1902
When the test started , Nevada ’ s ACLU warned on its website : “ It would be relatively easy to turn the tachograph into adult monitoring devices . ”	-4.2917
There is no need to build a massive technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals .	-2.9022
Nevada is part of a series of states that are now looking for affordable technology that will allow the state to capture the driven kilometres , but not exactly when and where .	-4.7824
That , Khan argues , would also reassure the public .	-2.9115
Hunting for this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California .	-2.2400
The company did not originally intend to help states tax drivers .	-4.2499
Rather , their aim was to take root in an emerging market for car insurance , where drivers should pay on the basis of the miles driven .	-5.0540
However , the equipment it tests is also interesting for road planners , because they do not work with GPS and provide only limited information that is regularly uploaded by modem .	-4.2703
“ People are more willing to participate if their speed and location are not recorded , ” said Ryan Morrison , Managing Director of True Mileage .	-2.8453
Some of these public pilot programs have made great mistakes .	-2.5509
There are considerably cheaper and less intrusive ways of implementing this .	-11.2281
In Oregon , the planners experiment with giving car drivers a range of options .	-10.9972
You can select a device with or without GPS .	-7.4993
Or you choose no device at all and instead pay a flat-rate fee based on the average miles driven by all the inhabitants of the festate .	-4.8059
Other bodies hope to sell the concept of a suspicious public by providing the devices with more functions than with a few .	-3.7658
In New York City , transport officials want to develop a taxation device that also pays parking fees , insurance only for driven kilometres , and speed data are collected from other vehicles in real time , thanks to which car drivers can evade congestion .	-6.4342
“ Car drivers would be motivated to participate by the added value of the benefits that the system offers , ” says a city planning document .	-3.1331
Some traffic planners , however , are wondering whether the whole talk about paying per mile is not just a huge diversion .	-13.4745
In the San Francisco Bay Metropolitan Transportation Commission , officials stated that Congress could simply solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund by raising the fuel tax .	-3.6342
An additional one-time fee or annual levy could be imposed on drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that use little petrol , so that they also pay a fair share .	-3.9174
“ There is no reason for an operation , if an aspirin suffices , ” explains Randy Rentschler , the head of legislation and public affairs of the Commission .	-3.5646
If we do , hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about their privacy and many other things .	-2.5664
Königsfeld : A Small Team Beats Wacker	-2.8086
The voluntary fire brigade managed its autumn test despite the lack of staff with Bravour .	-4.8637
Only eleven men participated in the exercise .	-1.8189
Department commander Hans Kammerer chose in his exercise acceptance the property Feder in Burgberger Strasse .	-3.9821
A short circuit should have been created there when sawing .	-5.5625
The emerging fire and smoking development have injured two people , but one of them could send an emergency call .	-3.6374
Two respiratory representatives of the Wehr prepared to enter the building after the first review of the situation by Hans Kammerer .	-4.2290
After a short time it was possible to find the first person and lead it outdoors .	-3.8737
The second person had to be worn .	-0.9295
This was not as easy as a narrow staircase was to be overcome as well .	-10.6473
The building , a workshop with an integrated stall for two horses , was not easy to secure .	-2.7675
A lot of wood and straw balls were stored there .	-3.3392
There were also electrical woodworking machines .	-3.0254
The first solution was attacked by the tank in the vehicle .	-3.8648
Another line was taken over a hurricane hydrate in about 100 meters distance .	-6.2120
Three alternatives could now be .	-3.3933
A hollow beam tube was used in the building .	-9.1575
In the exercise , Hans Kammerer was also interested in showing what is to be done with little staff available .	-6.7584
In the worst case , there will be support from the Königsfeld daily operations group .	-5.1321
The commander was satisfied with the process .	-2.7997
Networking Universities and Companies Important	-2.1392
During his visit to the district of Breisgau , the Black Forest , LandagsPresident Guido Wolf also clarified where tomorrow 's workers come from .	-5.8096
At the Förderzentrum Hochschwarzwald , he joined with the executive executives of vocational schools , as well as the Kreisgymnasium and the Chairman of the Partner Advisory Board on this important issue .	-8.0250
" Education is an important site factor " , emphasized Claudia Stehle , director of the Hans-Thoma School , who presented the networked school project Education Center in the Black Forest .	-4.4429
Wolf was impressed by the model projects for education .	-2.8730
Since 2011 , there has been successful cooperation in the forest town between the centre of funding , the Kreisgymnasium and the vocational school centre .	-4.5786
He also praised family friendliness in the county .	-2.3141
" It is important not only to look at the family phase , but also the phase of maintaining the care of relatives , " said Wolf .	-5.0667
He also indicated that more and more employees were concerned about the care and care of their relatives .	-4.2683
" Without the support of employers , the resulting burden on employees may lead to an end to the working relationship , " said Wolf .	-4.1872
But no one could afford to lose qualified workers , he continued to say .	-2.5412
Another , particularly important factor is the networking of universities and businesses .	-3.9521
" Those who have met the benefits of the region during their studies often retain the regional economy with their acquired knowledge and skills , which contributes to strengthening the region , " showed the country 's president convinced .	-6.6231
Only if sufficient training places are offered can skilled workers be met .	-4.2195
In his opinion , the advantage of the county 's location is its favourable location in the southwest of Germany , close to France and Switzerland .	-12.1426
He also experienced the efforts already made to develop public passenger transport on his journey from Titisee New Town to Freiburg .	-4.8645
" Stay stubbornly and ensure that public transport is improved " , he told the local politicians present .	-4.1900
Experience Music Entertaining Afternoon	-3.6276
For the last 15 years the Kaul family invites the Dietinger seniors to coffee , cake and afterwards to a vespar .	-5.0091
Previously , the elderly were held in the resting place .	-5.1367
Meanwhile , this afternoon will take place in the nursery St. Josef .	-3.9862
The residents are looking forward to the delicious cakes and cakes .	-2.9119
Later , there were sausages .	-2.7320
Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich entertained with conventional melodies .	-2.8037
The more than 100 years old natural stone wall as the front limit of the old school courtyard to the Kirchstra<unk>e , which is in front of the renovation , is to be replaced with the restoration plan of the city of Bränlingen .	-7.1425
In the days before the Kilbig , a small angular wall was built in the first works of renovation of the front courtyard , to stabilise and static discharge of the natural stone wall with Balustrade , which was over a hundred years old .	-6.9185
The next approach is to include Alexander Misok of the Bränlinger City Building Office , the National Monument of the Planning , and to create a rehabilitation concept for the old wall .	-7.4910
Then a cost calculation is to be made by experts , which will then be put on the table of the municipal council to decide and determine how to proceed .	-6.5266
A decision on this is expected to be taken next year .	-2.2430
After the renovation , pavement and tree planting of the old school courtyard within the two wings of the school built in 1912 , it will be necessary to refurbish the restoration wall from scratch and rebuild it .	-7.5719
The historical , one hundred years old ceiling wall of the old school courtyard to the Kirchstra<unk>e , is mainly due to water and frost damage , because there is no drainage , needy to renovate and has an archery needing forward .	-12.8569
Deep cracks in individual stones bear witness to damage to the weather , but the wall is not currently under threat .	-3.7826
A steady wall is a precondition for a student using school courtyard , which has been done through the current fastening work .	-6.5480
Originally , school refurbishment was even scheduled in 2008 / 2009 , but high unscheduled expenditure brought a shift .	-5.0356
An important word in the historical renovation of schools , which has even been used for film recordings , will be the national monument .	-5.1092
Should specifications come from this site , then the city of Bräunlingen hopes for grants from the monument makers .	-5.5021
The students of the primary school in Bränlingen , who are now being taught again in a well-restored old school building with new aula , can soon use the old school courtyard .	-6.7618
<unk>zdemir wants jazz training in Stuttgart	-1.9130
The ongoing discussions on the future of music universities in Baden-Württemberg have now also turned on Cem <unk>zdemir , the Green Chairman of the .	-4.6416
" I think it is wrong to give up holistic training at the Stuttgart Music High School , " said <unk>zdemir the " Stuttgart News " .	-3.4880
Jazz and classics belong just at Stuttgart jazz site .	-2.7743
In this way , <unk>zdemir , who is considered to be a favourite for a direct mandate in the parliamentary elections on 22 September , is contrary to the Green Red National Government .	-5.7130
On the basis of an expert study , this is promoting a reorganization of the five music universities in Baden-Württemberg .	-11.7672
Then , among other things , the study course Jazz and Pop is to be moved from the Stuttgart Music College to the Mannheim Music College .	-5.7408
US border : ' Super Tunnel ' discovered to drug smuggling	-3.8851
On the border between Mexico and the US , investigators discovered and decommissioned a " super tunnel " to drug smuggling .	-2.9712
As the US customs authorities have said , the more than 500 metres tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity , railway tracks and an ventilation system .	-4.4362
Three suspects were therefore arrested , eight tonnes marijuana and nearly 150 kilograms of cocaine seized .	-2.3663
According to the data , the tunnel has not yet been used .	-3.1043
" These cartels are stupid if they think they could go through under the radar , " said the US District Prosecutor Southern California , Laura Duffy , at a press conference in front of a camp in San Diego , where the end of the tunnel had been discovered .	-12.1390
Duffy insured the drug gangs : " If you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them , we are determined to make this a huge waste of your dirty money " .	-4.1838
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a permanent battle against drug cartels .	-2.2854
Since 2006 , more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug crime .	-1.9700
Constructing Experts	-1.1897
Due to the expensive equipment of the tunnel , the investigators assume that he was constructed by architects and engineers and that the construction took about a year .	-4.7485
The track facility was equipped to allow the use of electrically operated cars .	-4.5097
On the Mexican side there is access in a building 80 meters from the border .	-2.8445
According to the authorities , a ladder takes 20 meters to the depth of the tunnel .	-3.6494
The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 metres of height and 90 centimeters width .	-9.1653
It would also have been appropriate to promote illegal immigration towards the US .	-3.3161
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine Fund .	-9.6876
The third , a Mexican , was caught because of the seized marijuanas .	-3.2119
All three threaten as the maximum sentence of lifelong freedom deprivation , as officials have said .	-3.8041
Since 2006 , eight such tunnels have been discovered , it continued at the San Diego press conference .	-2.9010
But it is the first time that cocaine was found in such a tunnel building .	-2.9795
Normally cocaine is smuggled in smaller quantities , not tunnels .	-2.5001
This shows the " despair " of drug gangs whose traditional routes are now cut off , Bill Sherman said of the DEA drug tracking in San Diego .	-4.2968
They would do everything to get to the US .	-1.9521
No details were given to those arrested , at least one Mexican was , it was said .	-4.1421
They have to expect prison sentences of up to ten years .	-2.4387
2014 Will Geisinger Festival	-2.7256
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250 .	-1.7836
Recurrence of the first reference is getting closer and closer .	-4.9240
The anniversary year ends in over eight weeks .	-11.5978
Geisingen and church homes were first mentioned in 794 .	-4.4882
A certificate was produced in churches in which both places are mentioned .	-3.8287
On March 15 there will be an official start to the anniversary year , and as Geisingen currently has no hall , this opening event will take place in the place where both were first mentioned 1250 years ago , in church homes .	-11.7506
A number of events are planned during the anniversary , both in Geisingen and in church houses .	-3.8124
The 1250 church houses will be held in July on a weekend from 18 to 20 July .	-4.3024
Celebrate again .	-2.3416
On Friday with a festival , on Saturday and Sunday with a festival around the church hall .	-3.2506
On this weekend is also the church house festival .	-3.7286
Rudolf Barth City Music Director wrote an order composition for the city on the occasion of the anniversary , which is performed on three dates .	-5.1918
On June 21 , together with the Sunnwend Celebration of the Black Forest Association , on July 12 in the Arena with fireworks and on December 13 as the first concert of the city music in the new Festhalle .	-5.0390
This will be completed in the anniversary year and the official date will be last September weekend , 27 and 28 September .	-4.7776
On the occasion of the Geisingen city anniversary , a new chronicle will also be released .	-4.3886
" A chronicle should not only be made by Geisingen himself , but also a printed work on today 's hosting , which consists of hostages , church houses , lining , eye-catching and gutmadings , " says Mayor Walter Hengstler .	-7.6744
And today ’ s hostages celebrate 2014 ’ s birthday , in 1974 , the present space with the communities was carried out .	-5.8030
The new chronic will be presented at the new Festhalle in Geisingen on November 21 or 22 .	-3.0505
2014 , however , is also a year otherwise with many anniversaries .	-3.1532
The festival Strohglonki starts on February 8 with a customs evening on its 60th anniversary , the Harmonie Gutmadingen will be 90 years and has the festival banquet on March 29 and will celebrate the district music festival from May 1 to 4 .	-5.7488
The Altenwerk Leiferdingen is 40 years old , the Geisinger School has been at the new site for 50 years and celebrates this on May 10 , the Musikverein Polyhymnia Leiferdingen will be 150 years old and celebrates it at the fountain festival of July 4th to 7th .	-5.1490
The town of Geisingen was first mentioned in 764 in a donation document owned by the monastery of St. Gallen .	-4.1110
The certificate was produced in churches ( houses ) , which was then a court .	-3.9226
Both municipalities are therefore mentioned in the same certificate .	-8.7208
In addition , the municipal reform dates back 40 years in addition to this to in . and to to to . to to to to . to to	-10.8334
The Guidance of Galleries	-4.5703
Should the railway passage " Am Hirschen " be extensively rebuilt to improve traffic safety ?	-5.1805
Yes , local councils have decided .	-2.3100
For that , Schiltach must take EUR 220 000 into account .	-3.8971
Deutsche Bahn wants to improve the Kinzigtal railway next year .	-2.5443
Especially the safety of rail passengers is to be increased - regularly collisions of trains with other vehicles occur throughout Germany .	-6.0342
If the municipalities agree to the reconstruction measures , they have to take part in the costs of one third , the rest share the railway and covenant .	-5.9324
Schiltach City Baumeister Roland Grie<unk>haber explained to the municipal council the peculiarities of the railway transition " Am Hirschen " .	-4.6120
There , the city plans to build an excavation at the level of the tunnel mouth there west of the railway track .	-4.4680
Major vehicles , such as those carrying long wood , could also be in the vicinity of traffic without having to block tracks .	-6.5933
Greekers therefore proposed constructing a necessary support wall so that the city could spread the subsequent road in due course to ensure a smooth flow of traffic .	-4.6816
This was discussed controversially in the municipal council , as some councils called into question the need for road proliferation : Thomas Kipp , in his statement , put the critics ’ mood at the point : ' Do we have to take so much money into the hands of so few vehicles ? '	-6.9617
Mayor Thomas Haas contradicted : the " Hirschen " railway crossing is regularly used for long timber transportation .	-3.5771
Even wood from the area " Kuhbach " is partly transported via this route , because the vehicles up to 20 meters long could not use the route at the Häberle bridge because they could not turn to the main road .	-18.0248
Moreover , the route serves as a diversion for those vehicles who cannot use the tunnel when the main road is closed , Haas argued .	-3.9195
Apart from the fact that Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnels should be rebuilt and renovated , as is currently the case in Wolfach , the railway transition " Am " Hirschen " could also be an important means of transport for a longer period of time .	-6.1700
The Councils agreed to have investigated the costs of the intended spreading of the road .	-5.1442
Notwithstanding this , the majority agreed to rebuild the railway transition with the provision that the necessary support wall is built in such a way that the city could expand the subsequent road towards " Bahnhofstra<unk>e " , where appropriate , for encounters to around 5.5 meters .	-14.8198
On the other hand , the conversion of the railway transition to the Trautwein area could cause a very different problem , which concerns access to the very increasing " Geroltzhäuser Way " .	-7.6328
The administration had carried out an investigation into the reconstruction plans of the railways by the Breinlinger engineering office , as it had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhäuser path would be easily possible .	-7.0716
The investigation concluded that the road 's propensity could lead to longer vehicles coming up .	-4.9174
In turn , the city bears responsibility for this as a carrier of road construction .	-4.5448
Rebuilding can therefore result in arrears of liability .	-3.3705
Since both the timber withdrawal and turning off worked in the current state of expansion , Haas argued that the transition would not be acceptable .	-6.3677
At this point , too , the risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle on the transition is much lower than at the other railway crossings , because it is right next to the central stop , where there is a good visibility link .	-8.0889
Even trains from the main railway station would have to be braked here so far that no collision threatens .	-4.4316
The majority refused to approve the rebuilding of this railway transition , because the city of Schiltach would have to ' eradicate ' the problem of upstream vehicles , the councils said that the railway can withdraw from responsibility after the construction work has been completed .	-14.8402
The Board considers unproblematic the reconstruction of the railway passes " Before Heubach " and " Before Kuhbach " , for which intersections have already been reached with the railway .	-6.5732
Esa decides on major space missions : Billions of missions	-3.0717
Remote planets , gravitational waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects they want to launch in the next few years .	-3.5776
30 proposals were available , five are still in the race .	-2.7143
Far worlds .	-0.5279
More than 1000 planets on other stars have already found astronomers .	-2.0957
Whether there are life , at least , on some of them , nobody knows .	-3.3198
The choice is difficult : Do you want to search for gravitational waves ?	-4.0840
Or rather explore the origin of cosmos ?	-2.1978
Or searching for earth-like planets and discovering alien life ?	-5.2903
These are the questions that are being asked by the European Space Agency Esa .	-3.8534
For their " Cosmic Vision " program , they are looking for ideas for two major space projects , which are intended to make the research decisive .	-5.6273
The budget for such " L missions " is approximately EUR 1 billion .	-2.5113
The start is expected to be 2028 and 2034 .	-1.7078
In early September , the elite of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions .	-2.0160
30 ideas were discussed and five of them have now come to a closer choice .	-4.2019
Many bodies examined the proposals and followed up with researchers .	-4.0631
A final decision will be taken by the scientific programme committee in the next few days .	-2.7117
Overall four major questions have been selected by the Esa , to which the missions of the 2007 programme " Cosmic Vision " should find answers .	-4.7120
What are the conditions for the emergence of planets and lives ?	-2.2513
The exact steps in the emergence of stars from large gas clouds - and hence the emergence of planets surrounding these stars - are still in the proverbial dark .	-5.0316
A big infrared telescope in all could get through this dark .	-2.8856
And if a star owns the planet under which circumstances can life arise there ?	-3.0878
To investigate this question , the 2017 space telescope " Cheops " will be launched , which will examine more closely the 500 already known planet systems in our neighbourhood .	-6.4901
However , the opportunities are limited , Cheops is a small mission with a budget of EUR 150 million .	-2.5423
With larger instruments , astronomers could map earth-like planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres , searching for " biomarkers " : gases that are considered to be an indication of biological activity .	-4.3260
How does the solar system work ?	-1.1053
This question , too , should ultimately provide an insight into the conditions for the emergence of life .	-4.9013
The magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field as well as its particle radiation with the planet system plays an important role .	-3.7344
In our solar system , these processes can be examined exemplary .	-3.6084
With the " Solar Orbiter " , Esa has already approved a M-Class mission ( where the budget is about half a billion euros ) for this issue .	-4.4638
The probe should start in 2017 and watch the surface and activity of the sun carefully .	-4.1574
Jupiter and his moons are also of great interest to researchers .	-2.8504
They want to find out what role the giant planet played in the development of the solar system .	-3.1158
For this , Esa provides for the first of the three L missions of the " Cosmic Vision " program .	-3.9177
The song " Juice " ( Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer ) will start in 2022 .	-2.9205
Eight years later , she reaches Jupiter and is intended to examine the atmosphere of the planet and the icy moons of Europe , Kallisto and Ganymed .	-8.6475
What are the basic physical laws of the universe ?	-1.2342
The everyday world offers many opportunities to study matter under extreme conditions and to examine whether the laws of nature we know are still valid there .	-5.9663
Perhaps there are also deviations that could guide the physicists to a new theory under which all known laws of nature can be united .	-5.2093
How did the universe emerge and what is it made of ?	-3.5306
Our cosmos came through the big bang 13.7 billion years ago .	-2.9299
In addition to the common matter of stars , planets and living creatures like us , there are dark matter whose gravity holds galaxies and galaxies together , and Dark Energy , which accelerates the expansion of the space .	-6.2429
So far , researchers do not know which physical laws were valid in the first second fractions of the urban band , nor what dark matter and dark energy consist of .	-5.1426
With " Euclid " , the Esa has already approved an M mission , whose launch is planned for 2020 .	-4.6008
With a special telescope , the probe is supposed to examine the distribution of the matter in the universe for the first time throughout the sky , enabling conclusions on the nature of dark matter and dark energy .	-5.2919
Who Perhaps the Race	-2.8907
Of the 30 proposals , only two will remain at the end of the selection process .	-1.5118
In the opinion of many experts " E-Lisa " , the best chances for an L-Mission is a demanding concept to demonstrate waves of gravity .	-6.8589
Physicists understand changes in the structure of space that Albert Einstein predicted almost 100 years ago .	-3.1735
They have not been proven to date .	-2.0146
Elisa could do that , the scientists hope behind the project .	-2.6420
The mission provides for a detector consisting of two or three probes , which is stationed in all .	-3.4692
In contrast to plants on the Earth , it could also prove gravity waves that were created during the big bang , and thus provide new insights into the emergence of cosmos .	-6.6622
Four more proposals compete for the second L-mission : a great X-ray elescope called " Athena " , which is to explore black holes , among other things , " Icy Planets " , another mission to the external planets of the solar system , " Prism " , a mission to measure the cosmic background radiation , and the " exoplanet finder " , which is to track and investigate planets similar to the planet .	-6.7061
Proposals for sample return from Mars , for the exploration of moon , Venus and Asteroids and for solar physics are already excluded .	-5.5901
Snowden ready to “ cooperate ” with Germany on US surveillance .	-2.2859
Edward Snowden , the whistleblower of the US secret service , has stated that he is ready to go to Berlin and tell the German Bundestag if the American National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander do not give answers to their activities .	-4.2295
The German MEP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden on Thursday in Russia , where this asylum received to discuss with him the statement in Germany .	-3.5428
In a letter from Snowden , presented to the media in Berlin on Friday of Ströbele , he wrote : “ Even though the outcome of my efforts was evidently positive , my government continues to treat a divergent opinion as a faithful and attempts to criminalise political expression with a threat of criminal defence . ”	-6.8791
The truth is not a crime .	-1.6937
In the letter Snowden writes that he is convinced that the support of the international community can convince the American Government to drop the charges against him .	-3.5188
The charges issued by the US Department of Justice include espionage and theft of state property .	-2.7579
The German Minister of Interior Hans-Peter Friedrich said to Time Online : “ If Mr Snowden is willing to talk to German representatives , then we will find ways to make that possible . ”	-4.8362
Relations between the US and Germany are burdened by the claims that the NSA has interrogated Chancellor Angela Merkel ’ s mobile phone .	-3.2256
Thomas Oppermann , the honourable Member who chairs the parliamentary committee responsible for the secret service , said that one should seize the opportunity to listen to snowden as a witness when possible “ without jeopardising him and completely ruining relations with the US . ”	-4.5960
Ströbele , a Green MEP , published a picture of himself and snowden in his Twitter feed .	-1.9865
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia .	-1.4290
Ströbele explained that , according to the lawyer of the former NSA employee , Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country .	-3.1712
When Snowden says in Germany he needs an assurance that he is “ safe ” there , the honourable Member says .	-3.5511
Snowden stated in his letter that he faced a “ serious and ongoing ” persecution campaign that driven him out of his home country .	-4.2838
But it is touched by the global response to “ my act of political expression . ”	-2.8044
Citizens around the world , as well as senior politicians – including in the United States – have described revelations of an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance as a merit to the general public .	-3.6889
In his letter , Snowden offers the German authorities an offer of cooperation “ when the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation have been resolved . ”	-3.3823
Frontier Airlines charges hand baggage fees	-2.0604
Frontier Airlines plans to demand up to $ 100 of passengers wanting to store hand baggage on their flight .	-3.6117
Frontier Airlines intends to calculate up to $ 100 for a piece of hand baggage and $ 2 for coffee or limonade , even though the announcement on Wednesday was to read that passengers should retain the entire dose .	-4.2011
The new fee applies to hand baggage in the baggage compartment above the seat , small bags under the seat are still free of charge .	-2.6800
Frontier explained that US $ 25 is calculated when the fee is paid in advance , and $ 100 for passengers who only paid at the entrance .	-5.8587
Frontier-Speaker Kate O 'Malley said that the fee of $ 100 is aimed at moving travellers , taking care of payment in advance .	-3.8963
“ We don ’ t want to calculate that sum , ” she explained .	-2.1702
Airlines started charging for the first and second piece of baggage in 2008 .	-2.3699
Passengers who tried to bypass them have therefore put as much as possible into their hand baggage , which means that the baggage compartments are often overcrowded over the seat .	-5.4134
Fees are a way of moving passengers to take less on board .	-2.5779
O 'Malley said that the new charge is not really about making money .	-2.2942
It is about the most loyal customers of Frontier , who would have clearly stated that it would be increasingly difficult to find space in the compartment above the seat .	-5.3496
Passengers who buy tickets on the airline 's website do not have to pay .	-2.3514
This means that a passenger may take a piece of baggage free of charge at the entrance of Frontier , but the next person has to pay $ 100 for a comparable baggage .	-12.1887
O 'Malley explained that the Frontier website and check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers are informed of the fee before they arrive at the flight .	-4.6833
Frontier ’ s new hand baggage fee will not enter into force until the summer , and there is no precise date yet .	-5.1312
Passengers often baggage surcharges and other charges , but airlines are happy to use them .	-4.5837
They argue that transporting luggage costs money and passengers should pay this service if they so wish .	-2.6419
Many on Wall Street view the new baggage charges as a sign that airlines are taking enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of loss .	-4.0064
Most have , however , been fingers of hand baggage fees .	-9.5443
Spirit Airlines Inc . requested three years ago as the first charge for hand baggage and later Allegiant Air , also a low-cost flyer .	-4.7276
The only other airline with such a charge is the Hungarian Wizz Air , explained the airline consultant Jay Sorensen , who closely follows the additional charges .	-3.7076
In a December 2011 report , he estimated that hand baggage fee would bring USD 50 million a year to Spirit .	-3.5573
Sorensen , who previously held a leading position at Midwest Airlines , recently flew with Spirit and was curious about what would expect him to climb if passengers were confronted with the company ’ s unusual hand baggage fee .	-5.6108
“ The boarding process was one of the most smooth I experienced in my career in aviation , ” he said .	-2.8218
I expected to see teeth noise and manual discussions on the flight bridge .	-4.1937
“ The plane was full , ” he explained , “ and boarding ran as lubricated . ”	-2.1734
Frontier also follows the 2 dollars required for coffee , tea , limonade or juice .	-2.3532
The company explained that passengers who bought limonade or juice should keep the entire dose and that coffee would be refunded free of charge .	-4.7569
Water is still free .	-0.9855
In 2008 , US Airways recently tried to demand money for refreshments , but reversed it seven months later , after passengers complained and no other large society had moved .	-13.7074
Frontier 's move to charge hand baggage if passengers do not buy directly from the airline is the latest initiative to guide customers to their own website .	-4.0395
Airlines pay online travel agents such as Orbitz 10 to 25 U.S. dollars per ticselected tic.	-3.5359
This gives all companies an incentive to move passengers to buy them directly instead of using an online travel agent .	-4.1061
Frontier has , however , gone the most in this area .	-2.9553
In September , the company started awarding only half the frequent flyer miles when booking through an online travel agent .	-3.6570
On Wednesday , miles were cut to 25 % of the route .	-2.0829
A 3rd party airline journey with frontier over 1000 miles therefore only brings customers 250 miles .	-4.8557
Passengers can also reserve places exclusively for direct purchases on the Frontier website .	-3.6699
Frontier has a faithful customer base at his headquarters in Denver , but business shrinks and the company loses money .	-2.9488
The earnings fell by 9 % , and aircraft capacity shrinked just 13 % in the first quarter , as read in the financial report published on Wednesday by the parent company , Republic Airways Holdings Inc .	-15.2956
Republic tried to get Frontier 's finances under the Company 's sale .	-4.0587
Scriptures from the Bible	-2.6044
Well 40 women attended the last female breakfast this year in the Protestant church parish of Bising .	-10.5712
The theme of the day in the municipal house was " Bible sayings " and " Middle Ages speeches " .	-4.6351
After breakfast , Zita Köhler , the chairman of the church municipal council , entered the Biblical saying words in a lecture .	-4.6884
" Swords contain life-wise , rules , or warnings , " she explained .	-3.9053
She compared several proverbs with the corresponding Bible sites and explained the meaning .	-2.7386
She called proverbs like : wooden eye is vigilant , as scales fall from the eyes , throw an eye on someone , the His gives the Lord in sleep , his hands wash in innocence .	-4.9701
Several times , the speaker also asked their listeners what the proverb was .	-4.8496
The speeches from the Middle Ages accepted Christel Dehner 's parish parish : All good things are three , blue , do something .	-6.0206
She explained the importance and origin of the speeches she called ' bridges to the past ' .	-2.9450
Finally , a raffle was lost .	-2.7907
The prizes were covered on a table and were described humorously before being handed over to the winners .	-3.4147

Learning rather than unemployed : Tourism pilot project	-2.1752
A pilot project for the tourism industry started at the Mecklenburg Lake Platz .	-12.6788
Under the leadership of the Federal Labour Agency , 49 men and women who are already working as unskilled workers in the industry will be qualified for hotels and restaurants over three winters .	-4.6402
" New to this is that the six-month courses end with degrees , " said Carmen Wiechert of the Neubrandenburg Working Agency .	-4.7346
The benefits are diverse : they would not be unemployed , the companies would receive skilled workers , who were increasingly lacking in hotels and restaurants , and the agency would not have to finance unemployment .	-5.6247
The project also involves the Chamber of Commerce in Neubrandenburg , as well as the Deutsche Hotel- und Gaststättenverband ( Dehoga ) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern .	-8.4508
NSA declares that an “ internal error ” and not hackers are to blame for the crash of the website .	-3.0384
The shadow National Security Agency declared last Friday that a mistake made its public website a few hours paralysed , not hackers , as was claimed online .	-4.8693
“ NSA.gov was not reachable for a few hours this night , as an internal error occurred during a planned update , ” the Spy Agency explained in an e-mail message .	-4.9752
The problem will be fixed this evening .	-1.3512
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed denial of service attack ( DDoS ) was not true .	-2.3877
In the early evening , online server trackers noticed that the NSA website was not accessible for at least six hours and that for some users it remains unavailable .	-4.8059
Previously , a NSA spokesman told ABC News that the Authority ’ s sensitive internal network was “ in no way ” compromised .	-3.0724
Secret information is not in danger , according to the speaker .	-2.5634
At least one group of hacktivists claimed to have paralyzed the NSA website with a DDoS attack .	-2.3394
In such attacks , the target website is flooded with page calls until the servers are overloaded and the website collapses .	-3.8286
Cybertactics are relatively simple , and attacks are not designed to penetrate the target system 's internal network .	-3.3246
The former super-secret NSA , whose nickname was once No Such Agency ( none of these agencies ) , is now in the bright light of the public and sees the revelations of its extensive surveillance program at home and abroad – a result of the secret NSA data stolen and published by the disillusioned former NSA employee Edward Snowden .	-6.2414

Winning losses in Bombardier after decline in delivery and orders	-4.2790
The Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15-percent decline in net profit on Thursday , after having been pressurised by declining orders and deliveries on third quarter aircraft as well as contract problems in the railway sector . the and the the the . the the and the the the the the .	-14.3039
Bombardier , headquartered in Montreal , did not publish any flight test data for his CSeries brand new aircraft and did not give any new information on whether the aircraft could go to commercial use in accordance with the ambitious timetable for next September .	-5.5314
On the juvenile flight of the test aircraft a year and a half ago , only three new launches have been followed , which makes it difficult to see whether the test period is as planned .	-7.4073
The results remained behind the forecasts , resulting in a fall in more than eight percent on the Toronto stock market .	-4.4230
On Thursday , Cameron Doerksen , Analyst at National Bank Financial , lowered his assessment from “ outperform ” to “ sector performance ” in order to ensure that the share possesses limited rates over the next one to two quarters .	-5.4528
“ While weaker aircraft delivery figures were widely expected , we are clearly disappointed by the margin development in the transport sector , ” Doerksen said in a customer letter .	-5.1829
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries when the aircraft ’ s testing program adv. new and . and . and . and . and . and and .	-12.7869
However , if new orders are not announced in the coming months , we expect the market to become more sceptical towards the programme .	-3.4659
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries ’ aircraft grip can catapult the company to the lower market segment currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus .	-3.0940
The first test aircraft was presented to the public in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delay .	-2.7778
However , binding orders for CSeries have been moderate to date for 177 , as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests and want to see whether the company ’ s claims are true in terms of fuel efficiency and cost savings potential for the new nozzle aircraft .	-6.1870
There are currently 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies .	-2.1817
Chairman Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will reach his target of 300 binding orders at the beginning of the commercial use of the jet .	-2.9038
On Thursday , corporate governance also assured analysts and media that the program is in the schedule .	-4.1447
“ The test aircraft was no longer on the ground than expected , ” said Beaudoin at a telephone conference and added , while the aircraft was running , ground testing and software updates were scheduled .	-5.3140
Each manufacturer plans differently .	-1.7365
We decided to take the first flight and then add a period of revision , as we have done .	-4.2338
This is happening throughout the flight programme .	-2.2303
The second of five test aircraft will probably start in the next few weeks , the rest shortly after , said it was from the company page .	-4.9808
However , analysts remain sceptical as to whether the first CSeries aircraft can operate twelve months after the boy flight .	-4.5289
Bombardier explained that it checks the planning for commissioning ( EIS ) and will update it in the next few months .	-12.9979
“ The slow progress of the flight test – though obviously bombarders of internal planning – reinforces our view that commissioning is postponing to the first quarter of 2015 , ” said Doerksen .	-4.3849
In the third quarter , with the end of September 30 , Bombardier ’ s net profit fell to $ 147 million , or 8 cents per share of $ 172 million , or $ 9 cents per share in the previous year .	-3.7285
The customized earnings per share is 9 cents . and winni.	-5.5096
Sales dropped slightly and dropped from $ 4.2 billion to $ 4.1 billion .	-2.9944
Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and a turnover of $ 4.56 billion , said Thomson Reuters I / B / E / S.	-2.9809
The fourth largest aircraft manufacturer in the world says that he delivered 45 aircraft this quarter , a decline of 57 last year .	-3.4764
The net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26 .	-1.3708
The order book in the aerospace park was $ 32.9 billion on 30 September and was thus unchanged on 31 December .	-3.9752
“ In the field of aerospace , the results were within the framework of our requirements , but the low order intake and the overall market conditions were disappointing , ” said Beaudoin .	-4.3999
Aerospace revenues fell by 13 % to $ 2 billion .	-2.4938
Bombardier , the world ’ s largest railway manufacturer , announced that sales in this save have risen by just under 11 % to $ 2.1 billion .	-13.9912
The order book in the transport division was $ 32.6 billion on 30 September , thus slightly increased on 31 December .	-4.5716
The profit margin in the transport sector has been affected by settlement problems for some major contracts .	-3.5800
According to corporate governance , there will be new targets for the fourth quarter .	-2.7836
In the afternoon trading on Thursday , the Bombardier share fell by 8.5 % and stood at 4.83 Canadian dollars , after it was also announced that the Google Financial Board Patrick Pichette will switch to the Board .	-4.5008
The Brazilian Embraer SA , the world ’ s third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and bombardier of the closest rival , reported on Thursday a ten-percent decline in quarterly prof.	-4.0379

Cocaine independent lawyer warning drug boss of police investigation must be in prison .	-3.4904
Basharat Ditta , 42 , continued to provide Neil Scarborough Underworld Size Information	-2.8522
The lawyer was afraid that his hidden drug addiction could come to light .	-1.9192
He was sentenced to three years ' imprisonment by the Liverpool Crown Court	-2.6141
A well-known criminal defender who warned a drug baron against a major police investigation , fearing that his secret drug addiction could be detected , was sentenced to three years in prison .	-4.2749
Basharat Ditta , 42 , provided Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about his activities in drug trafficking after being compromised by his own cocaine addiction .	-3.7349
The “ first-class ” criminalist lawyer with the nickname “ Bash ” was arrested in his house in 2011 after the Scarborough police supervised by Scarborough , who he represented in an earlier drug procedure .	-5.2793
Officers observed how Scarborough ( 32 ) delivered three bags of cocaine at the house of the lawyer in Blackburn , Lancashire , during which he was with colleagues at a meal of the bar .	-4.8706
The investigation showed that Ditta regularly consumed Class A drugs after testing traces of cocaine were found in his hair , wallet , and credit cards .	-3.9151
Over eight months between January and August 2011 , he tried to obtain illegal information on the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners .	-3.0076
All four suspects were then monitored by the police in the course of a major investigation into the heroin and cocaine trade in Lancashire , Cumbria , Merseyside , Berkshire and West Yorkshire .	-2.8917
Together with 32 others , they were arrested later after the police secured heroin and cocaine worth <unk> 1.5 million and <unk> 200,000 of cash in a series of house searches .	-4.6122
Ditta , 42 , passed on information to criminals because he feared his drug addiction could become public .	-2.7136
Today , Ditta , working for Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn , was found guilty and sentenced at the Liverpool Crown Court after a three-week trial on two charges for obstructing the judiciary .	-4.5582
In an earlier survey , he admitted to cocaine ownership .	-3.5575
The lawyer was executed after the police found out in their investigations against Scarborough that in February 2011 , he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta .	-3.7673
Two investigative officers followed the suspect and saw how he went to Ditta ’ s house , where drugs with a purity of 60 % in a black golf glove lawyer ’ s rubbish .	-5.9386
Shortly after he delivered the drugs , Scarborough regularly telephoned Ditta , who was in Ewood Park during the dinner at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium .	-4.5127
The lawyer returned home , picked up the drugs and then exchanged nine communications between the two .	-2.9755
In court , Ditta was known to be a “ regular consumer ” of cocaine after class A drugs were discovered in his hair , wallet , and credit cards .	-4.5834
Ditta was arrested later , but disputed to take cocaine and said that he spoke to the alleged dealer because he was his client and claimed that her discussion was subject to “ lawyer secrecy . ”	-4.4800
During his arrest , Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards , but they were ensured and he was taken from a sample of hair .	-3.4915
In the case of police interrogation , he stated that , under his private address as well as in the workplace , he had an office and clients would call him at home for legal matters .	-5.9848
In the court , it became known that he had called for important drug trafficking actors , some of which had previously been represented , after important arrests and informed of what the investigators knew about them .	-6.4321
Public prosecutor Anne Whyte said , “ A criminal prosecutor should know better than everyone else that the law is not broken . ”	-3.0636
Ditta is charged with abusing his position as a criminal defender , as he has admitted too much with certain clients .	-4.2391
The relationship in question is not just that of a drug dealer , but a drug dealer who provides his lawyer with drugs .	-3.4530
Part of his communications was undoubtedly legitimate , because he was the lawyer of these people .	-2.8730
But that went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between lawyer and client .	-1.8567
He has done as much to counter police investigations as possible , so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities .	-5.0948
Mr Ditta thus brought his profession into disrepute .	-3.1286
He was too close to certain clients , especially Scarborough , and he allowed his independence to be compromised .	-1.9108
Ditta pointed out any misconduct by himself and claimed , “ If I were a corrupt lawyer , which I am not , and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough , I would not wait 15 hours , but do so immediately . ”	-5.2444
But , after the hearing , Lee Halstead , the police in Lancashire said : “ Mr Ditta took the step from a criminal defender to a criminal at the moment when he started to acquire drugs from organized criminals . ”	-4.3905
His cocaine dependence led to a hopeless compromise and made him receptive to the motives of leading members of organised crime who commissioned him to obtain valuable information on police investigations .	-4.1436
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure public confidence and confidence .	-1.6936
Ditta lost that trust and tried to hide behind the façade of his profession .	-3.4051
The Serious and Organised Crime Unit of Lancashire conducted investigations against Ditta , which also led to a conviction in three cases because of the possession of cocaine and legal disability , which underlines our determination to bring criminals to justice .	-4.7442
This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that no one can escape the arm of the law .	-2.5257
We find you and bring you to court .	-1.6862
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after having declared guilty of conspiracy as heroin , cocaine and cannabis trade .	-11.2975
Thirty-five others involved in drug trafficking – people were sentenced to a total of 153 years for drug elicts .	-4.2734
On his website , Ditta published an area with questions and answers about himself , stating that his dream job is to represent American lawyers in death cell , his ultimate guest was Mohammed Ali and equal opportunities is the motivation for his work .	-5.9884
The Revolutionary Work of Church Music	-2.2042
At the end of the celebrations of its 160th anniversary , the Liederkranz Dunningen will frame two services with the " Deutsche Messe " of Franz Schubert .	-3.9951
Following the great success of the musical " Rock my Life " , which inspired the spectators in the spring of this year , at the end of the anniversary year , the Liederkranz will enrich two God services with the performance of Franz Schubert 's Deutsche Messe .	-5.5045
On Saturday 26 October , this extraordinary trade fair will be heard from 19 during the evening fair in the St. Martinuskirche Dunningen and on Sunday 27 October , from 10.15 a.m. at the God Service in the St. John Baptist Church in Lackendorf .	-5.9764
The so-called Deutsche Messe with the original title " Songs for the Fair of Sacred Sacrifice of the Messe " , D 872 , is a spiritual musical work of the composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was considered almost a revolutionary at the time of its creation .	-6.3305
The exhibition is performed within the scope of the services , as the client Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind .	-4.2287
Under the leadership of Hermann Schneider , the choir is accompanied by the group of blowers of the Musikverein Frohsinn Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi at the organ .	-4.2249
Haslach ’ s Skepticism Refuses Confidence	-2.7727
The 2015 elections to the parish council will change , for example , in the Haslach ( SE ) maritime unit .	-4.8246
There is only one common parish council for all six parishes .	-2.3812
In a joint meeting on Saturday the bodies of Haslach , Hofstetten , Mühlenbach , Fischerbach , Steinach and Welschensteinscheinach prepared for the changes . and at . and and and and . and and and .	-9.2130
There is nothing more to change the fundamental decisions of the diocese and it is up to the parish communities to implement them as satisfactorily as possible .	-3.4907
Over the course of the day , it became particularly clear : skepticism toward the new is slow , but increasingly confident .	-5.5320
From the ideas and expectations of new developments in 2015 to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the parish community , the very constructive discussions of the six bodies with the headquarters of the Seelsorge Team were completed .	-5.9204
Regional decan Georg Schmitt presented the new directives on seal care units in the archdiocese of Freiburg on the basis of a presentation .	-4.2048
After that , the SE Haslach , as a parish of the church , will in future form a public body that will enter into the rights and obligations of the six parish communities so far .	-6.4852
There will only be a common parish council and a founding council in which the priest power is represented .	-4.1010
At least two elected members are to be represented from each parish , in the six parishes so-called community teams are formed on the ground .	-4.6739
Their task in the future will be to promote church life in the village .	-3.5950
On the question of the finances of the individual parish parish communities there was then considerable need for discussion .	-4.6568
The innovations provide that accumulated credits are preserved in the parishes for purpose bound .	-5.7413
On the other hand , liabilities go to the general community .	-2.7262
Especially with regard to the large planned investments , whose obligation then affects all parishes , there was great concern .	-5.5660
" Also in the past was invested only in projects managed by the individual parishes alone , " Haslach 's parish chairman , Bruno Prinzbach , relative .	-5.0244
Practical experience with a common body for five parishes described Barbar Knitter , the chairman of the body in the Seelsorgeeit Schutterwald Neuried .	-4.6437
They set themselves up to ' become one , five remain ' in 2006 and found that this is not so easy .	-11.6750
The Haslacher Seelsorgeeit ’ s bodies then set out to answer the questions about the future composition and size of the common parish council and the practical work of the community teams .	-4.9966
The preparations will be made more concrete at further meetings and will be adopted at a further joint meeting of all six bodies next spring .	-5.0864
At the end , Michael Schöner , the parish community from Steinach presented the new logo of the Sea Sort Unit , which was approved by a clear majority .	-5.1979
In Paulendorf , electricity becomes more expensive .	-2.4041
Ppullendorf ’ s citizens must adapt to higher electricity costs .	-3.1564
As Jörg-Arne Bias CEO confirmed to S<unk>DKURIER , a four-headed Pullendorf family has increased 70 to 90 euros per year .	-5.8824
The main reason for the upcoming price increase is the increase in the so-called EEC turnover from 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt-hour .	-4.0910
Every year in October the four operators of the large electricity routes redefine this conversion .	-6.9291
These figure the additional costs incurred by the energy transformation that they can levy on the price of electricity .	-6.3949
The Paullendorf city works form the last link in this chain .	-3.2382
In its forecasts , the supervisory board of the energy company had even assumed a higher volume , as Jörg-Arne Bias reports .	-4.2646
Now we need to calculate the concrete figures before the city works could inform their customers about the exact price increase next week .	-5.6132
" We are starting from an increase of 1 cent plus x , " said Bias , where the figure is more close to 2 cents .	-5.5820
Duration traffic lights : watch for waiting time	-4.4859
Sometimes a traffic light is not green .	-2.5708
The contact loop in the street does not react , or the light sign is broken .	-2.5202
What should be done then - riding with red ?	-3.9926
If a affected person has waited long enough at a red light and the crossing is free , he can continue , explains the Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine " Motorrad " .	-4.0979
However , the waiting time must be " appropriate " , which can be interpreted differently on a case-by-case basis .	-11.3252
Becker advises to stay at least five minutes before starting a traffic light .	-3.3630
Anyone who continues the journey in spite of redshift must realise , however , that he is entirely to blame for an accident caused by it .	-5.0740
If you tolerate less than five minutes , you may not wait long enough , Becker warns and refers to a decision by the Hamm Supreme Court .	-3.5416
In the negotiated case , a driver had ignored the traffic lights after about three minutes of permanent red and had to answer for a negligent red light violation .	-5.4906
After all , the traffic light was not broken , but changed to green a little later .	-4.8109
He was spared a ban on driving because of the particular situation - but not the fine .	-5.3247
The municipal council is pleased about sound budgets .	-3.7880
Whenever the budget is at stake in municipal meetings , mayor Ralph Gerster has laughed well .	-2.7393
The municipal baggage in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and debt is no longer familiar with the administration since 2005 .	-2.9261
The 2012 financial year can also be considered a full success in this regard .	-3.5631
This became clear when the 2012 annual accounts were presented .	-2.8702
As Andrea Rothmund pointed out , the administrative budget of around EUR 7.6 million was more than a million .	-3.5719
The administrative surplus was also about EUR 1.8 million above the approach .	-3.4926
The surplus is mainly due to higher commercial tax revenue and the municipal share of income tax .	-3.9994
The asset budget , too , was clearly above the planned values .	-3.3970
Instead of the EUR 1.5 million envisaged , it was EUR 2.5 million last year .	-1.7581
" This is essentially due to the increase in the management budget , " said Rothmund .	-4.3085
Because fewer investments were made in the 2012 financial year than planned , the injection of the reserve was also higher .	-6.4645
Overall , the general reserve has increased by around EUR 2.1 million to a total of EUR 4.9 million now .	-2.9403
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for their good work .	-2.1680
" So a work you don 't just shake out of the sleeve " , praised Gerster with a view to the annual accounts .	-4.2211
He and the local councils were delighted with the good figures .	-2.4781
It may seem paradoxical , but it is precisely these good figures that citizens could soon be expensive .	-3.6569
The good financial situation has enabled the community to avoid high heights in the past .	-4.4310
In turn , according to Gerster , grants have been reduced by the country many times .	-6.0266
These grants from various compensation stocks are required .	-4.1450
Among other things , cities and municipalities applying for grants must have certain levies .	-4.1672
" We need to look at the issue of levies because there are investments for which we would like subsidies in the coming years , " Gerster announced in this context .	-5.5795
Nagold : Hugo Wermter in Chor for 60 years	-2.0233
Hubert Wermter ’ s history at the Caecilia male singer is almost twice as long as that of the autumn festival , in which he was honoured solemnly .	-6.2574
As usual , Hubert Wermter stood on stage in the colours of his male singing group .	-10.3633
Even after 60 years , the singing with the chorus , which is now more than lovingly won , still makes him great fun .	-5.9116
Wermter was also active in the association , including for 28 years as a member of the committee .	-2.9523
He received several awards for his commitment and his club scattering : Jörg Kohr , Pastoral speaker on behalf of the Caecilian Association Rottenburg-Stuttgart , presented him - since the choir is also a church choir - a certificate of the Association and a letter of honour signed by Bishop Gebhard Fürst .	-6.2431
His fellow singers presented him with the certificate of the German choir association and a grave pensioner .	-5.8070
In addition to the honour , the 31st autumn festival took place in the usual railways : with the MGV Betra , the Liederkranz Salzstetten , the singer department Baisingen and the local music association , the Vollmaringer loaded a colourful mix of various choirs and vocal styles that had the around 400 visitors .	-8.0811
The MGV Vollmaringen opened with atmospheric songs such as " In Wine Paradise " and " Lustig , her brother " .	-3.8870
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart 's " Bundeslied " was awarded to her honorary singer Hubert Wermter .	-3.0003
The Men ’ s Song Association Betra also sang classic choral songs like Julius Wengert ’ s " Julius Wengert " , " Wit , far away " from Hubert Goisern and the folk song " When you go through through the valley " .	-6.2389
The Liederkranz Salzstetten , with his mixed choir and group of women - the " Impulschor " - created the festival 's quota .	-5.0864
The mixed choir abducted from Antos Gus in foreign countries with the Neapolitan referendum " Santa Lucia " and " Eviva Espana " , while the " Impulschor " also used foreign languages : " Liberatio " and " Hey Jude " were part of their programme .	-4.9795
The singer department of the Baisinger Sportverein returned to home where the Fullmaringer Musikverein had a crowning musical degree .	-6.3664
For the children there was a small side programme - " Oma Hanne " alias Hannelore Stollsteimer introduced a Kasperltheater and read a few stories about the children at lunch .	-5.4298

Kenyan press outraged by controversial media law	-2.2790
“ We are in a frightening situation and we can ask ourselves what is Parliament ’ s view of simply abolishing judicial independence tomorrow , ” was read in the newspaper , which considers the draft law unconstitutional .	-6.4262
“ The law is draconian and very punitive and we reject it , ” said Cyrus Kamau , Managing Director of the Capital Group , which also includes CapitalFM , one of Kenya ’ s most respected independent radio stations and news websites .	-3.6653
He said that the new media mibunal “ will always be prejudiced , because it is an extended arm of government , ” and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya ’ s position in the global economy .	-3.3880
“ I hope the President stops us and we appeal to him to reject this bill and send it back to Parliament , ” he said .	-2.8071
According to The Star newspaper , the new law “ effectively puts the media in a stranglehold , ” by contrast , The Standard , Democracy , and Freedom of Speech in Kenya would have suffered “ a serious blow , ” and praised the draft as “ draconian . ”	-5.6898
The adoption of the law is one of a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security following the attacks by armed Islamists on the Westgate shopping centre in September .	-3.6323
The Kenyan media took the wrath of the authorities because they published photos of security cameras on which to see how the units dispatched to the site allegedly robbed the luxurious shopping centre .	-7.1345
Police chief David Kimaiyo reacted to hear about the appointment of two journalists and a leading media representative , even though the subpoena was withdrawn after a media outcry .	-4.7078
Under the new law , media houses can be punished by up to 20 million Kenyan shillings , and individual journalists with up to one million , as well as the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation officially . and the and the the . the and the the the and the the . the	-11.9994
The Tribunal also has the right to confiscate the ownership of those affected if a penalty is not paid .	-3.4817
According to Daily Nation , “ already one penalty can push most radio stations into bankruptcy . ”	-1.9952
Moreover , the newspaper believes that these measures could have a devastating effect on Kenya ’ s description of Kenya ’ s “ lively blogosphere . ”	-2.9429
If they silence the media , politicians could do whatever they want without punishment .	-1.7009
“ No one will ever know it , ” Mutuma Mathiu , journalist of the nation , who calls the Kenyan media a decisive control factor in public life .	-4.2900
“ Left politicians to themselves , they lead the country into bankruptcy and back to the time of hunters and collectors , ” he commented .	-3.5775
Kenya ’ s legislators have in the past raised public trouble .	-3.5469

Other greeting words spoke for the urban Sports Committee Hubert Baier , the district chairman of the Southern Badian football association , Kuno Kayan , and Friedrich Knorr from the planning office who announced a donation to the club ’ s youth department .	-4.5919
Mayor Klupp reminded us that recurring weather-related influences in spring and autumn put the original lawn in such a way that it could not be played .	-4.4188
Already 15 years ago , we had the first thoughts on resolving the problem when we thought about building a third place at the football club site or at the Realschule am Salinensee .	-5.6435
Both have been rejected .	-1.3864
Six years ago , the idea of creating an artificial grass pitch came up , which was widely regarded as the ultimate solution .	-4.6244
Concrete plans were introduced two years ago , when the FC took over the shelter 's seat in heritage , pledged a cost share of EUR 100 000 for the construction of the place and approved the country funding of EUR 104 000 .	-7.0229
In October 2012 , the municipal council decided to take over the remaining EUR 356 000 of the total costs of EUR 560 000 , summed up .	-4.1347
The construction of the 68 times 108 metres large art grass pitch took place on the 4th of June .	-5.3551

There were threats of exemption traffic on land roads that are already focused on accidents .	-5.2238
Moreover , the introduction of tolls for all cars would , from the point of view of Pronolds , only be a first step .	-4.1183

Airport Vienna abolishes passenger calls	-1.5723
Mr Max Maier , please come to Gate 24 .	-0.7991
Things like this will no longer exist at Vienna Schwechat Airport .	-3.7938
Much of the speaker verdicts will be removed - noise levels should be reduced so significantly .	-6.3370
To create a more relaxed atmosphere is the goal of this innovation .	-2.1456
As Airport-Speaker Peter Kleemann announced to Radio Vienna , the Vienna Airport is following an international trend by recruiting passengers .	-4.0091
For example , the airports in Copenhagen , Frankfurt or Dubai already renounce the noisy calls .	-3.6514
The abolition of these verdicts - on average , roughly 200 personal calls by the speakers on a day - is intended to make it more quiet at the airport in the future .	-6.3268
" Experience has shown that these individual transactions have not been perceived in a relatively small way , but also all the other information on changing flights or departures here is undermined , " said Kleemann in conversation with the radio station .	-9.0697

One that invites you to stay and get back again .	-3.4155
One who wants to make the name of the program .	-2.6471
According to Lexikon , déjà Vu is a psychological phenomenon that expresses itself in the feeling of having experienced or seen a new situation before .	-3.7043
In the case of visiting the cafe of the same name at the opset in the district town of Kleve , it does not have to remain the pure Déjà Vu feeling .	-6.4007
After all , the café with its beautiful name has the goal of making a real stay not only thoughtful , but also recurring .	-7.0869
Because it 's fun and simple .	-2.6692
A glance into the inner life of the opposite 8 gives the viewer a good feeling at hieb .	-4.3603
The ultra-modern , but not cool , cafe atmosphere looks like a place to feel good .	-3.9024

The owners , both 33 years old , have already made their name before the opening of the jewelry café as a gastronomer : in Kranenburg they led the " Art Lounge " .	-5.7859
From moving to Kleve to the opposite , the pleasant café lovers hope for more audience .	-5.0304
Last but not least , it is also through the university .	-4.0971

Two events were held in the bright cafe .	-3.1957
Better said one .	-1.6667
The port festival was rather outside - the Café Déjà Vu did not benefit from it .	-3.5324
But there was also the Ringelnatz evening .	-3.3248
" Beautiful , successful and funny " , the two 33-year-olds found .	-3.0638
But not everyone 's business .	-2.6449
Perhaps Daniel Büttner is not a fan of event evenings either : " You can 't do everything right " .	-4.8609
And with an event I only address those who are interested in the special event .	-3.0691
Therefore , events will be the exception of us .	-3.4028

New Poverty Reduction Goals	-2.6220
The United Nations is now beginning to draw up a series of new objectives aimed at replacing the Millennium Development Goals announced 12 years ago to combat poverty .	-4.2294
In the run-up to the UN Summit on Sustainable Development , which began in Rio de Janeiro in the evening , Australian diplomats played a key role in pushing for “ sustainable development goals ” to replace the Millennium Goals that expire in 2015 .	-3.3886
They have been included in the final draft document that will be adopted by world leaders , including Mrs Gillard .	-2.6619
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at the summit in the evening that the time has come to “ think beyond national interests . ”	-2.9078
“ I am glad that member states have agreed to begin a process to agree universal , sustainable development goals , ” he said .	-3.7879
“ These objectives will be based on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and will form an integral part of the post-2015 development framework .	-2.7876
I will spare no effort to implement this mandate given to me by the Member States to realise our vision of the sustainable development goals , which are based on the success of the Millennium Goals . ”	-3.9184
Even though the SG Achim / Baden has been without victory for four days , the Handball Oberligisten continues to have a good atmosphere .	-5.4507
Trainer Tomasz Malmon leaves no doubt at all .	-2.0937
Everyone is still fully motivated with the matter .	-2.5266
However , I hope that we will finally win again .	-2.7964
" After all , I don 't know how to taste a victory , " Malmon expects a success experience from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II .	-4.2047
Although the Third League Reserve from Fredenbeck is not currently running out of trees , Malmon heads the finger in advance warning .	-5.7383
I still trained many players at the A-youth .	-4.5649
Therefore , they will certainly be very motivated against their ex-coach .	-3.0529
" It is also important to see if there is still some reinforcement from the first one , " the SG-Coach explains .	-6.5955
In order to finally return to the track of success , the Malmon team must certainly increase in comparison with the previous performances .	-5.0180
Most importantly , it lasted enormously during the covering and swi.	-6.6971
It is also definitely necessary to improve the management of opportunities .	-3.5153
So I hope that my players have finally released their heads during the short break .	-3.5790
Mozambique security concerns are growing in the face of clashes between influential figures .	-2.0547
Thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo under the watchful eye of the statue of Samora Machel , the founder of the state , and the first President of Mozambique to agree peace in a rare public demonstration .	-3.8135
“ We want peace again , we want stability , ” said Vanessa de Sousa , Managing Director of an investment company .	-1.9725
For fear of the country ’ s future , she has exchanged her business clothing against a t-shirt with the label “ We demand security ” in Portuguese and joined her on the capital ’ s independence square on Thursday .	-13.7525
For almost two weeks now , there have been reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo , one of the worst battles since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago .	-4.1469
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement , initially supported by the White Governed Rhodesia , and later by the apartheid government of South Africa to destabilize the country ’ s independent government .	-4.5040
Following the 1992 peace treaty , it became an opposition party .	-1.5748
Analysts consider it unlikely that the country will fall back into a full-scale conflict , but recent events have worried foreign investors and locals .	-3.6920
The stakes for the rapidly growing economy are high , because the discovery of huge gas resources off the coast and coal camps in the north-west could bring in investment of more than $ 50 billion from firms such as Rio Tinto , Vale from Brazil , Eni from Italy , and Anadarko from the US in the next few years .	-4.9696
The ruling Frelimo Party , since 1975 the dominant force , and Renamo blame each other for tensions .	-2.3507
Renamo claims that the government has provoked recent clashes by attacking its members in the province of Sofala , a traditional Renamos stronghold on 17 October .	-3.1295
The attacks on the previous rebels escalated when government forces attacked Renamo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama , the leader of the group , explained Renamos Speaker to the Financial Times .	-3.4598
The government blames Renamo for the clashes and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers .	-2.1176
President Armando Guebuza has sought to undermine concerns about instability .	-2.5081
Opposing AFP , the French news agency , he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama would see himself as a “ loser ” who wants to “ use all his remaining forces to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government . ”	-5.1714
Both Frelimo and Renamo emphasise that they want to avoid war .	-8.3717
But the concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted as saying that Renamo has absorbed the 1992 peace agreement .	-3.7075
Compared to the FT , he said that Frelimo no longer respect the agreement .	-3.3393
“ Our vision is to resume negotiations , and to do so seriously , ” Mazanga said .	-7.1998
Previous talks between the parties have done little to settle the tensions fuelled by a series of clashes this year .	-3.0180
“ Here we have two adult men ( Guebuza and Dhlakama ) who are gathering their heads , ” says Joseph Hanlon , lecturer at the Open University and Mozambique expert .	-4.2199
None of them is well negotiated and none is prepared to make the necessary concessions .	-2.7831
Renamo , which is pushing for electoral reforms , has already stated that it will boycott the local elections in November .	-2.6801
Presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for next year .	-1.4954
Some commentators interpreted the use of force as an attempt by an ailing movement to obtain concessions and financial benefits from the government .	-2.7192
Renamo ’ s electoral success has been shrinking since 1992 , while a newer party , the Movimento Democrático de Moñambique ( MDM ) , founded by a former Renamo member , will probably improve in the elections .	-4.3534
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – whose resignation is due when his second term ends next year – wants to destroy the country ’ s democracy .	-2.7787
“ He does not want multi-party democracy , he does not want transparent elections , he does not want peace because he does not want to give up the presidency , ” says Mazanga .	-2.7037
It is unclear what capacity Renamo has , but it has undertaken troublesome attacks on police stations and vehicles on important north-south connections .	-4.1928
Most of the battles took place in Sofala province , which is located a few hundred kilometres north of Maputo , but is located in Beira , the port , mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale to export coal .	-4.7143
In June , Rio suspended the use of the railway for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the track .	-3.2149
Mazanga responded cautiously to the question of whether Renamo will repeat this threat .	-2.5391
Renamo wanted to “ warn the international community that things are not good in Mozambique , ” said Mazanga .	-1.8553
Instability has increased frustration over the government , says Fernando Lima , Head of Mediacoop , an independent media company , because many people have been concerned about corruption , slow progress in development and a recent wave of abduction .	-4.0108
“ People think that the government and the president are responsible for the country ’ s future , and should be the one that finds solutions to the problems , ” he explains .	-2.9675
Omar Sultane , a demonstrator , said that people simply wanted stability .	-1.1182
“ No one interested Renamo and Frelimo , they just want peace and usable roads , ” he explained .	-2.9500
Children should be taught myths and legends as “ models for life , ” an author says .	-3.1135
The stories of Thor showed that “ brutal force has no chance against clever tricks , ” and the Artus legend demonstrates how important it is to have a dream .	-2.7264
But many of the myths are “ far too wild , too offensive , and in some cases too dirty to be taught at schools , ” which is why Crossley Holland advocated a “ careful selection ” of ancient works .	-4.0617
“ I find it wonderful that myths and folklore are already part of education in America , ” he said .	-1.8118
I have been proposing this as a plan for twenty years .	-2.0359
He added that for authors and teachers who are “ excessively didactic , ” children would “ shut down ” completely , because in entertaining stories the messages would be “ subliminal . ”	-4.6686
Crossley Holland , who has translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon , and is author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myth and the British Folk Tales , said : “ You can pursue certain intentions , but you should keep them in the background as possible . ”	-3.8355
Perhaps the greatest difference between an adult author who writes for adults and an author who writes for children is the need to give hope .	-2.8873
Not all must be simplified or lead to the Happy End , but there is an immanent sense of good and evil .	-8.4508
This must be understood , revealed by history and not explained .	-3.4979
This is the old story of showing rather than narrating .	-3.2500
Hansjakob once again moves to Freihof	-3.4794
100 years ago , Heinrich Hansjakob obtained his retirement residence in Haslach , and on Sunday his last years were alive in the " Freihof " .	-4.4540

He was received not only by the audience with a lot of applause , but also his sister Philippine welcomed him .	-3.0880
Billy Sum-Hermann understood it incredibly well to get into the role of the sisters and gave her immense life in mimic and gesture .	-4.9243
Between the various game scenes , the Mühlenbacher Farmer band played selected songs to complete the performance .	-5.2804
Haslach ’ s Mayor Heinz Winkler gave the honorary citizenship the honorary honor that , together with a part of the town council , made his appearance in representation of the then incumbent .	-7.6047
Their expectations subsequently made the Three-King singer , who made Hansjakob the call : " Oh how beautiful , there are again youth memories of my own tri-kingdom " .	-7.4478
With their song " O Jesulein " , they enjoyed the audience in the Freihof as well as the Stork Day Children with their loud " Ein , " .	-9.5156
His criticism of the presidential church was as expressed by Hansjakob at the time as his concerns about the excesses in agriculture , the consequences of industrialization or the effects of war .	-4.6160
In his homeland , behind his tomb band on the fire near Hofstetten , he found his resting place .	-4.2176
" A troubled spirit finally found its calm and had gone forever " , it said at the end of the scene game .	-3.3113
Many applause and many laudable words were given by the audience for performance .	-4.0553
Basketball : The Hope of the Giant Neckar grows .	-2.3968
The chances for the league remain of the sporty descended Bundesliga Basketballer have increased .	-4.0970

The Basketball Project Hamburg Towers refrains from applying for a possible after-back place .	-4.1733
" We will not participate in the wildcard procedure , " said former national player Pascal Roller , who since 2012 established the concept of a professional club in the Hanseatic city .	-4.0733
However , a first breathing was not heard from Ludwigsburg .	-3.6046
" We did not deal with the wildcard procedure until Düsseldorf has been licensed , " said Neckar-Giant Boss Alexander Reil of our newspaper .	-4.0483
Until May 23 , ascent Düsseldorf Baskets can still submit documents to the Court of Arbitration and prove his economic federal league fitness .	-5.7003
So far the Rhine countries have been denied licence twice .	-3.0989
The Court of Arbitration is the last instance .	-1.4577

Snowden could also say goodbye to Russia	-2.2987
The former US intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in the US Spährer in his Russian asylum .	-3.4749

This was reported by the Interfax Agency , invoking unnamed circles that are familiar with the situation .	-5.2815
Such a question could be resolved intergovernmentally , it was said .	-9.0294
Snowden 's exit from Russia is practically exclu.	-3.0890
" In this case , he loses his refugee status , " the agency quoted her source .	-2.5223

Rhenus Midgard also invested heavily on land .	-1.6918
They distribute the coal coming from the ships to the hall .	-3.1468
At the site the company has several irons in the fire .	-3.2110
In addition to coal imports , Rhenus Midgard relies , among other things , on wind systems logistics .	-3.5402
Black shines the coal on the camp in front of the deich .	-2.9719
Two massive blue hold bulk and back loaders distribute or load the coal here as needed .	-6.2608

Tribunal blocks decision on NYPD ’ s Stop-and-Frisk Directive	-3.7972
On Thursday , a federal court in the USA blocked the order of a judge who had requested changes to the New York Stop-and-Frisk program ( “ Hold and Search ” ) , and dismantled the judge from the case .	-14.1231
The 2nd Court of Appeal declared that judge Shira Scheindlin ’ s decisions would be suspended until a city appeal was decided .	-12.3682
In August , the judge judged that the city was in breach of the Constitution with the way in which the program was implemented for the presence and inquiry of people .	-5.3006
The city appealed against its assessment and the arranged remedies , including the decision to set up a supervisory body to help the police amend their directive and the relevant training programme .	-4.9978
The appeal court heard on Tuesday the arguments for the request for suspension .	-2.5171
The appeal report declared that the judge had to be deprived of the case , as it violated the code of conduct for US judges , determining that a judge should avoid the appearance of partiality ; this was partly justified by a series of media interviews and public statements in which she publicly responded to the judicial criticism .	-6.2771
The judge had judged that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people because , in an inappropriate way , they targeted black and Latin American men with the stop-and-fresh programme .	-4.1992
They appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of essential changes , including reforms in directives , training and service supervision , and arranged a pilot program with body powered cameras in quarters where most controls were carried out .	-4.3896
In August , the city of New York agreed to end the practice of storing names and addresses of people who were redundant after police control .	-3.7757

Advocates of changes to the NYPD ’ s stop-and-fresh programme say that the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trustworthy and effective police force , as well as influence the way in which other police presidencies use the system .	-4.9801
Opponents believe that the changes would dampen the morality of the police , but not crime ; nor would money be wasted and the broader problem of a police force under pressure following the disappearance of thousands of posts over the last decade .	-5.0970
The judge pointed out that she does not end the stop-and-fresh practice , which is constitutional , but only the way the controls are implemented by the NYPD .	-4.3099

Henne also mentioned a new Mother Child hospital in Nouakchott	-3.6365
Especially interesting in times where the birth hospital is to be deployed in Nagold .	-3.5895
Much is learned in Africa as a medicine , Henne says , for example , to decelerate against burn-out .	-4.6841
Due to political unrest in the country , it was not possible to make as many journeys as planned , but there were many medical professionals coming to Germany to hospite here in various areas .	-5.9070

Coulson used telephone hacking to check a tip .	-1.9253
The former news of the Word editor Andy Coulson supposedly used “ telephone hacking , monitoring , and confrontation ” in an attempt to confirm a false tip about an affair by then Minister of Interior Charles Clarke .	-4.4978
Public Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC declared to the court in Old Bailey , News of the World in May 2005 a false rumor that Clarke had a relationship with his “ attractive special adviser ” Hannah Pawlby .	-3.4459
The newspaper commissioned Private Detective Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlbis voicemails and followed them , but Coulson also called on and left news as the court learned .	-4.3788
“ In the opinion of the public prosecutor , Coulson , who is now the publisher of NotW , no one who stands in front of the home of people and hopes to tap them fresh , but one who likes to confront people with a story to see their reaction , ” said Edis .	-6.7118
He said NotW uses three methods to investigate stories : telephone hacking , monitoring and confrontation .	-2.7499
The publisher is personally involved in the third method .	-1.4716
Obviously he knows of the second , the surveillance , otherwise it cannot be .	-3.2256
What about the first ?	-1.2936
Do he know about phone hacking ?	-9.0688
He disputes that , but we say , “ And whether he knew it . ”	-2.8652
Rumours about a clarkes affair were first taken up by the NotW feature editor , when a source sexually interested in Pawlby was said : “ Do not waste your time , it is associated with Charles . ”	-4.3863
A band with voicemails from their phone of at least three occasions was secured in Mulcaire ’ s apartment in August 2006 .	-2.8950
The investigators also found entries on the detective computer on which Pawlby and their sisters were stored as “ projects ” .	-4.0826
In the time when the search was running , the grandparents of Pawlby received anonymous calls asking for information about them , Edis explained .	-4.5347
Meanwhile , former Chief Exporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup overseen the Pawlby movements .	-2.9907
On 18 June 2005 , Coulson left her a voicemail with the following content : “ I have a story that we want to bring out tomorrow , about which I would like to talk to Charles . ”	-4.2866
Edis explained that Coulson ’ s activities on this story followed the same pattern as with other major figures , such as the former Home Secretary David Blunkett .	-4.1331
The sworn heard on Thursday that Coulson Blunchatt faced an affair with a married woman when he himself had lied with the co-accused Rebekah Brooks , who had been married at that time .	-4.9612

Freedom made it clear : ' The final decisions are taken by the members of the municipal council ' .	-4.0937
The flood , which Gechingen met unprepared on 15 May 2009 , was a major event that raised the question of protection measures for the future , homes .	-4.5967
A river area study was commissioned with the neighbouring municipality of Aidlingen , which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen .	-3.6178
" Protecting as many plots as possible is the goal , " said Häuser .	-4.4839
The planning is based on the planning of the protection against a statistical flood , which is to be expected every 100 years , according to the German weather service .	-11.6565
Climate change is taken into account by a 15-percent surcharge .	-2.3307
In specialist circles this is called " HQ 100aClimate " .	-3.8392
The water masses that caused considerable damage in Gechingen in 2009 corresponded to a 1000-year flood .	-3.7737
'There is no absolute protection , but a relative improvement can be achieved ' , homes say .	-3.7308
In order to achieve the HQ 100a climate protection , some EUR 4 million must be invested in Gechingen , with the municipality expecting national subsidies of around 70 % .	-11.1275
Builder , however , pointed out that there is support only if an overall concept is implemented .	-4.9221
The municipality needs the participation of its citizens .	-3.2943
A complex planning and approval procedure must be completed .	-2.5381
In the best case , implementation could begin in 2016 .	-2.6449
Among other things , the protection concept presented last week in the municipal council ( we reported ) envisages local measures in the influx of the river Irm from the Stammheim Valley .	-11.0690
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept , participants took the opportunity to contribute their concerns .	-2.8047
Among other things , it has been questioned why no more dams and restraint basins are planned to protect the place .	-3.8263
Gregor Kühn , specialist planner of the engineering agency Forest and Corbe from Hillsheim , who presented the concept , stressed that it needed the interplay of all measures presented to achieve the desired goal in the . the and the and the . and the the and the the the .	-11.3386
In addition , it is important to find the most economical solution , according to Joachim Forest of Forest and Corbe .	-4.2178
It was unfortunate that the altort was running , which , even in normal thunderstorms , suffered repeatedly from congestion of the channel network .	-8.4165
The problem is well known with the administration and initial measures have already been taken .	-3.6964
Häuser , however , pointed out that the directives on channel systems are different from those for flood protection and should not be mixed .	-5.5665
The municipality is obliged to interpret the channel network in such a way that it could cope with two to three years of rain .	-4.1762
Making the sanitation channels larger would devour millions .	-2.3249
Heavy Injured After Catholic Crisis	-9.1913
On the early Friday afternoon , two drivers were seriously injured on the National Road 44 near Revensdorf on a front collision .	-12.4567
The police immediately blocked the road completely , but could say little about the accident .	-4.4944
However , there are various testimonies that should be evaluated .	-2.9041
It is a fact that the 19-year-old guide of a VW golf took you to Revensdorf and the 38-year-old Gettorf man met her with his Hyundai .	-5.5949
Both vehicles collapsed and the woman was so badly dressed that the fire brigade needed almost half an hour to free them from the vehicle wreck .	-5.2016

Amazing the kindness in the exterior : the stunning eyes , the beard , the high forehead .	-4.4072
And just as Fjodor M. Dostoyevski , with his massive oeuvre , is to be understood as the founder and apologist of the Russian soul , Philip K. Dick is read as an American prophet , which is certainly true in his own country .	-5.3592
Some titles have been published in Heyne Verlag , the Haffmans Cassette with the 118 narratives distributes two-thousand one .	-5.6145
Dick explains America - the kingdom of stunning technical progress , coupled with paranoia , security coercion , and belief to be selected .	-3.7971
Dick had experiences of God , his late books read like a mixture of the revelation of John and a computer manual .	-3.2662
Perhaps he was crazy , drugs had added his brain .	-2.5123
He has captured , early that the machines are divinities .	-2.9972

They assume that bad things are happening and prevent the criminal idea from being translated into action .	-3.2141
Dick ’ s narrative works like the blueprint for the anti-terrorist laws and the NSA ’ s interception .	-4.7129
Ancipation of the attack : Obama ’ s drone philosophy and practice works as well .	-2.2736
But Dick ’ s story is not over yet .	-2.6179
The police chief complains that there is no separation of powers , the military controls everyday life - and what remains of the state .	-3.5970

The former US intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum in the US Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel ’ s US secret service officer .	-3.8586
Representatives of the German Federal Prosecutor could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old in Russia personally , the agency Interfax reported .	-4.3129

According to the German media , the BVT wanted to prove the existence of surveillance antennas and the action led to a change of words between the US and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin .	-3.3484
James Clapper , US Director of National Intelligence , insisted in September that the US did not use foreign espionage opportunities “ to steal foreign firms ’ business secrets on behalf of US firms to boost their international competitiveness or profit . ”	-4.8274
But , since Edward Snowden , who became a whistleblower former worker , has begun publishing his full-horn of US surveillance secrets , European governments and business leaders are no longer sure whether they can take the Director at their word .	-5.8557
Reports that the American National Security Agency has spied Brazilian oil company Petrobas and gained data from American cloud suppliers , including Google and Yahoo , have brought corporate paranoia to a new peak because of state surveillance .	-4.6488

German companies believe that the US is now almost as high a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft , such a survey published by the advisory company EY in July .	-15.0414
However , Snowden ’ s leaked documents have so far shown no evidence that the US has passed on foreign companies ’ operating secrets to its own companies .	-4.7029
Politicians have expressed their concern that the EU should lack certain IT and Internet possibilities and reduce its dependence on the US .	-2.9826

Parents of a teenager from Georgia who died in tragic accident believe in murder	-2.1389
The parents of the teenager , whose body was found in a broken ring mat in the gymnastics hall of his High School , are convinced that their son was murdered , explained the family lawyer on Thursday .	-5.1875
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta in the U.S. state of Georgia was found on 11 January in an upright mat located behind the gallery in the Schulturnhalle .	-4.6387

" They are convinced that their son was murdered , " said Benjamin Crump , the lawyer of Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson , to FoxNews.com.	-2.4012
They never believed that he died as the Sheriff concluded .	-2.6119
“ They believe that there is no logic to violate the laws of physics and common sense , ” says Crump .	-4.0102
Rather , they are convinced that the truth is being concealed to protect the person or persons responsible for the death of their son .	-3.2373
“ Your son went to school and came back in the corpse bag , ” he comments .	-3.4405
US Public Prosecutor Michael Moore said on Thursday that there will be a formal investigation into the death of Johnson , as a number of important issues are still unresolved .	-3.4929
What was the cause of death ?	-0.8162
Is his death a crime ?	-1.1922
The explained Moore at a press conference on Thursday afternoon .	-1.8866

My aim is to find out the truth .	-1.3894
“ I believe there is a sufficient basis for formal investigation , ” he said .	-2.3629
Moore explained to reporters that initial autopsy suggests that Johnson died as a result of “ position-related destruction . ”	-3.3276

CDC Publish Allergic Guidelines for Schools	-2.3134
On Wednesday , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) published a series of guidelines for the handling of children ’ s food allergies in schools .	-2.8779
These are the first such directives that the US Government has issued , as the number of educated children with food allergies is increasing .	-3.8343
One in 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy .	-1.4067
According to CDC , the spread of food allergies among children increased by 18 % between 1997 and 2007 .	-2.0814
The guidelines contain information for schools intended to raise awareness of food allergies and how to deal with children who show allergic reactions .	-4.2028
It is also recommended that schools have epinephrine in stock – the Auto Injection of the EpiPen brand is most frequently used – to address a potentially fatal over-sensitivity response . the the and . the the the and the the . the the the the the and	-11.9290

Intersexual children ’ s parents can choose “ Gender Uncorrect ”	-2.9785
Germany is the first European nation in which a third gender is recognised for children born with unambiguous genitals . the and the .	-10.7688
Newborn is no longer assigned to male or female .	-3.9218
According to the new law , parents no longer have to declare sex for such children , but can indicate “ indefinitely ” or “ not fixed ” on the birth certificate .	-4.9705
The aim of the law is to exert pressure from parents so that they do not have to take rushed decisions on operations for the allocation of sex in newborns and to combat discrimination against intersexual people .	-5.6463
According to BBC years later , an intersexual person said : “ I am neither man nor woman . ”	-2.2547
I remain the patchwork created by doctors mutilates and scars .	-3.5823
It is estimated that one in 2,000 children every year is neither a boy nor a girl .	-3.6523
They are among the intersexuals , a group that falls under the diagnosis of “ sexual differentiation ” ( DSD ) , a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes , germ glands ( eggstocks or hodes ) , or unusually developed genitals .	-5.7555
Wallis Simpson may have been intersexual .	-1.4020
The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed , but most US experts suggest that the best available information on gender allocation should be used if a provision is not possible , and not wait for the child ’ s psychological and physical development before deciding – if at all – for an operation .	-5.6051
The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher , who specialized in gender identification , said that the new German law “ sounds like a good thing . ”	-3.0251
Intersexual children are an ethical dilemma .	-0.8665
“ Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgical intervention , but most children do not apply , ” he said .	-2.9183
A gender allocation can be done without surgery and then wait to see how identity develops .	-4.4602
The scientific data on how a child develops its gender identity is not very accurate .	-3.0222
No one knows why it is happening .	-1.4605
It is like secret , which is why people are homosexual .	-2.2266
A report to the European Commission in 2011 says that intersexual people should be distinguished from transsexual or transgender individuals , because their status is not gender-related , but through their biological constitution , which is neither male nor female , but typically defined both simultaneously or not clearly as one of them .	-4.9763
These characteristics have been shown in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle mass , hair , breasts and stature , primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genital , chromosomic structures and hormones .	-5.5691
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination suffered by intersexual and transgender people in professional life , as well as of the extent of harassment , violence and prejud.	-12.8062
The boy who does not agree with the gender image now has a special camp .	-4.2481
In Australia and Nepal it is now possible for adults to specify male , female , or “ third gender ” on official documents .	-3.1060
In June , Australian Norrie May-Welby ( 52 ) was recognised as the world ’ s first “ sexless ” person after a court granted the lifetime maintenance of “ unspecified ” gender status .	-4.2308
In addition to M and W , German cards will in future have a third assignment , X for intersexual , according to the Ministry of the Interior .	-3.5420
In neighbouring France , gender issues are still controversial , such a message on France 24 .	-2.8489
In 2011 , dozens of French MEPs in the strictly Catholic country signed a petition that “ gender theory ” should be removed from school books .	-2.2372
The US website Catholic Online has also opposed German law , on the grounds that “ if the world is torn into a new state where gender is a decision , but sexual activity does not , then we will turn away two other pillars of civilisation . ”	-5.4586
The mother of a newborn Maryland told Baby Zone that she would find it better if babies were assigned a sex at birth .	-3.8048
“ Parent life is already stressful enough , especially if you don ’ t know the sex of your own child , ” she said to the parent website .	-4.5180
Children need stability and security .	-0.5289
Historically , children born with both male and female sexes were called hermaphrodites , after the attractive Greek God who had both sexes .	-4.1154
Ten years ago , medicine viewed gender as something that could be extinguished and then rebuilt .	-3.4534
But the ethical foundations of an operation are now being questioned , as it is now known how complex the gender identity is , and that doctors can be wrong because they do not know how the child feels when it grows with the gender they allocate .	-5.9352
“ In the middle of the twentieth century , one called a psychiatric emergency , ” said Drescher .	-3.5253
When such a child was born , one did not call the psychiatrist , but the surgeons .	-2.5553
The prevailing theory on the treatment of children with unclear genital dates back to Dr. John Money of John Hopkins University , who argued that gender was formable .	-4.5726
He shaped the term “ gender identity , ” and argued , social and environmental stimulus – as parents educate a child – interacted with a child ’ s genes and hormones , shaping a person ’ s view as a male or female . as and as .	-14.8017
But , in a 1966 case known under the title of “ John / Joan , ” his theories became controversial .	-2.8383
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been separated in a bought circumcision to cast the child completely and to remove his horses and then to draw him up as girls .	-6.8207
“ Money presented this case as a successful example of a conversion , but it was not , ” Drescher said .	-3.5212
When the boy was about 15 , he moved back to the male sex and married a woman .	-2.4832
But he committed suicide with 38 .	-2.4421
According to Drescher , there are still doctors who would practice this model .	-1.9369
But in the 1990 ’ s , with the Internet ’ s entry , survivors of these sexual agencies came to the public , who “ are not happy with the outcome . ”	-5.2311
For example , Jim Bruce , a 36-year-old Montana author who was born with XY-male chromosomes , but ambiguous genitals .	-2.9307
Doctors didn ’ t know whether he had a big clitori or a small penis , and were convinced that he could never lead a “ satisfying life ” as a man .	-4.3638
So his external organ and the Hoden were surgically removed shortly after the birth of 1976 and he was brought up as girls .	-3.3267
At the age of 12 he received female hormones .	-1.9523
“ I knew I ’ m not a girl , ” he told ABCNews.com	-8.7555
I was unhappy , but it was really difficult to ask questions .	-1.4888
At the age of 18 he should get a vaginal plastic .	-2.0043
But as he was depressive and knew that something was not right , he demanded his medical acts .	-3.1718
What he found out was shocking .	-1.0171
I was sterilised at my birth – and nobody ever told me that .	-2.3551
Bruce was born with a DSD , through which his body could not produce enough testosterone to develop genitals .	-3.2300
After learning the truth , he moved again to male identity , received Testosteron injections and allowed his breasts to be removed .	-3.7178
The operation has made it infertile .	-1.8148
Today , he is fighting for others in an organization called Interface Project for intersexual people to be perceived as normal .	-3.2696
But Anne Tamar-Mattis , CEO of Advocates for Informed Choice , cares that German law can “ encourage stamping and stigmatizing . ”	-3.1236
“ Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to take quick decisions and allow the child not to determine , ” she explained .	-4.0639
We are afraid that it favours intervention .	-3.4564
We think it would be better to allocate male or female sex and then wait .	-1.9510
However , we do not yet know how the law will affect , so we can only speculate .	-2.2206
Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports Australia ’ s law , because “ it allows adults to recognize the third gender . ”	-3.6538
“ Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal sex , ” she explained .	-2.5790
German law deals with the assignment of birth .	-2.8789
This is not a struggle to force small children at this time .	-3.0034
When they grow up , they can decide their own bodies .	-3.2048
But Dr. Arlene Baratz , a Pittsburg breast radiologist who has a daughter with a sexual disturbance and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group , says the German law “ empowerment ” both parents and children .	-3.7995
Katie , the daughter of Baratz , was born with male chromosomes , but has a DSD called complete Androgen resistance .	-2.7365
Due to the receptor defect of the target cells for testosterone developed cation female characteristics .	-3.2324
She has a vagina , but no uterus and no eggs .	-2.9607
Today , Katie 29 is married ; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as a member of the psychiatry for children .	-3.6365
Although it is infertile , it hopes to get a child through adoption or a surrogate mother .	-3.3100
“ The law gives parents space , which does not lead them to take rush decisions , ” said Baratz .	-3.8976
It gives them the time to do different tests and clarify things and gives them time before writing “ male ” or “ female ” .	-3.3642
In this way , everything is fine – you pull your child up and love it .	-4.0790
One has a wonderful baby and enjoys the parent happiness .	-2.9296
And we do not need to undertake a hasty operation that can no longer be undone .	-5.4867
“ This includes children in the decision and eliminates the fear that parents are turning around because they think they are not doing the right thing , ” she explained .	-4.5415
Ultimately , the child decides on the sex that fits better with him – and that is wonderful .	-3.6051
This will enable children to make the decision themselves .	-1.7567
Unknown Injured Girls from Car	-3.0141
Unknown people have injured a twelve-year-old in Saxony-Anhalt in shots from a car .	-3.8970
On Thursday evening in Genhin , the perpetrators had probably managed an air pressure weapon on a group of children .	-3.4951
That was what the police informed in Burg .	-2.9875
The girl was easily injured on the left wall .	-2.0452
Rescue forces brought the girl to the hospital .	-1.4089
The shot came from a small car that passed through a group of six children and had suddenly stopped .	-2.9590
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car .	-1.2364
The perpetrators also shot on a bus stop .	-1.7040
A disc collapsed .	-1.8775
Then they went .	-2.8512
The criminal police investigated , it was said on Friday .	-2.6916
Until now , the police inspection of Kempten can look back on a quiet Halloween night .	-3.0848
The officials were called only twice to hurricane children who threw them against house fades .	-4.7537
Because the owners recognized this in time and removed the egg remains immediately , no material damage would have been caused .	-6.4920
There are also some Sylvester peoples in the city area , but no damage has been done .	-6.4641
A resident in the Bischof-Friendorfer Path reported that his car was wrapped in a cloppaper and his cycling blenders were evaporated .	-6.7678
Until the police arrived , however , the man rediscovered his cycling blinds in the immediate vicinity , which is why the police did not have to continue working .	-6.1402
Living with a Future Perspective	-1.7161
In fact , Waltraud Ries dwells dreamy .	-3.7018
The house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with lots of green , an old tree ground , nice neighbours and not too much traffic .	-4.3993
It is only a few minutes by public transport to the city .	-2.7369
" You hopefully have no fear of spinning ? " asks Waltraud Ries and shows a fat spinning on the door frame .	-3.9342
I have been looking for a new apartment for my husband and myself for some time .	-2.0156
But you know how difficult it is in Stuttgart .	-1.8942
However , the reason is not a spinning phobia , but the concern that at age the many stairs to the house and the apartment can no longer be dealt with , she explains .	-6.7290
Additionally , since a Meniskus operation , the mid-fifties have had to experience at their own body , which means moving from floor to floor with handicap .	-5.9719
Recently , a book of her appeared on the theme of ' Happy living at age - What form of living is the best for me ? ' .	-5.5005
'Our apartment is the best example of what is not going at all at age ' she starts to tell .	-4.6112
When she moved to the maisonette apartment more than 20 years ago with her husband , it was simply a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green .	-3.3955
Today , at the middle of fifty , Waltraud Ries thinks differently .	-2.4927
She also knows that she is one of the few people who are dealing with the issue of ' living at age ' .	-4.3861
Most displace it as long as it goes .	-3.3811
Alt becomes only the others ' , she says dirty .	-3.1331
Only when the pressure of suffering is really great will one think .	-3.6199
'Then it may be too late ' , so ries .	-4.4811
In their book , the interior designers present 17 living models for a self-determined living at age .	-4.4472
'Which type of home you choose is always an individual decision ' , she explains .	-3.3470
D i solution does not exist for age .	-2.3991
Even those who can afford the retirement seat in Tuscany or Brittany should always consider becoming sick .	-3.7234
And : ' Without good knowledge of the language of the country , you can also combine in the Dolce Vita , ' the author of specialist booksellers to consider settlements .	-6.8266
Among their models are classic care models , alternative forms of living or the often quoted pensioner WG .	-4.1464
At Age , Everyone has his Ticks and Macks	-3.0965
'For me , such a community would be nothing ' , she means with a twinker .	-5.5028
Not even like a student toilet with a shared bathroom and a kitchen .	-4.5080
'At age you simply need your retreats ' , Ries said .	-5.4762
However , the author does not want to rule out the fact that a senior residence community can still work .	-4.8426
But that must be different from the classic student 's WG .	-6.3833
And sometimes you just want your rest , " she believes .	-4.2638
It is not alone in that opinion , at least in the capital .	-3.0154
'Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own home as long as it goes ' is also the experience of Theresa Rütten , the head of the citizens ' service life at the age of the state capital .	-4.3969
Your department advises people about ' becoming older ' .	-2.8895
That is why it is precisely the older people who would often also be able to buy inconveniences and restrictions only in order to remain in their familiar surroundings , that is also the experience of the Warentest Foundation .	-6.5958
Today there are many ways of making the house or the apartment accessible .	-4.0071
Ries recommends that anyone who deals with the reconstruction of their house or apartment , should be carefully informed and not commissioned by the first craftsman .	-15.4313
Today , there are also specialists for the reconstruction of old age .	-4.9369
Even in the rental apartment this can be realized , and if it is only the toilet seat increase , the interior architects clarify .	-5.4742
But it is not always possible to renovate the existing apartment in an old fashioned way , even if it is still so beautiful .	-6.5539
This experience had to make Waltraud Ries .	-2.8464
There is also a staircase in the apartment which could be installed , but it would be a far greater obstacle .	-8.6934
She will continue looking for the ideal object for her and her husband .	-2.7255
Before moving , she grew more than before the spider at her doorstep .	-4.4447
The US wants Snowden to pursue criminal law .	-4.1254
The US has not changed its stance on former US intelligence officer Edward Snowden .	-1.9214
He will continue to be accused of dismissing secret information .	-3.3758
Therefore , he must face criminal proceedings in the US , said the spokesperson of the US Department of Foreign Affairs , Jennifer Psaki , in Washington .	-3.6931
The recent statements by Snowden would not change this either .	-3.3357
Previously , German Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele appealed to the US after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow not to continue threatening him with punishment .	-3.9028
Psaki stressed that Ströbele ’ s statements are those of a parliamentarian , not those of a German member of government .	-4.7386
Intellectual Service Thuller Edward Snowden is willing to talk to German authorities in principle .	-4.5574
But first he wants to know his situation .	-2.5750
The former NSA employee sought by the USA in an unaddressed letter published by Hans-Christian Ströbele Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele on Friday after a meeting with snowden and forwarded to the Federal Government , the Bundestag and the Federal Prosecutor .	-5.6437
After a translation of ströbel , the letter has the following text :	-9.5231
The competent authorities	-1.7345
I have been asked to write to you on your inquiry into mass surveillance .	-2.2950
I am called Edward Joseph Snowden and was previously contracted or employed as a technical expert at the National Security Agency ( NSA ) , Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) and the Defense Intelligence Agency ( DIA ) of the United States .	-3.2885
In the course of my work in these institutions , I witnessed systematic infringements of my government , which led me to act in a moral manner .	-5.0026
As a result of the publication of these concerns , I was faced with a serious and lasting hatch that forced me to leave my family and my homeland .	-4.5023
I live in exile and enjoy temporary asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation under international law .	-2.6894
I am encouraged by the resonance to my political action , both in the United States and elsewhere .	-2.2464
Citizens around the world and also senior officials - including the United States - have judged the revelations of a system of all-embracing surveillance that nobody owes accountability as a service to the public .	-4.4840
These spy revelations entailed many proposals for new laws and directives aimed at previously hidden abuses of public confidence .	-3.4511
The benefits to society from these gained insights are becoming increasingly clear , while at the same time , the risks that have been purchased have been clearly reduced .	-13.0612
Although the outcome of my efforts was evidently positive , my government continues to treat dissension as a fidelity and seeks to criminalise and prosecute political opinion .	-4.8563
But to speak the truth is not a crime .	-2.4785
I am confident that the United States Government , with the support of the international community , will take this disgraceful stance .	-3.6036
I hope that , if the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved , I will be able to participate properly and legally in the responsible investigation of the facts concerning statements made in the media , particularly with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports .	-5.1769
I look forward to a conversation with you in your country as soon as the situation is resolved and thank you for your efforts to uphold the international law that protects us all .	-3.7856

Kindergarten has found a private buyer .	-1.2040
" The building is in good hands " , says Winterlingen Mayor Michael Maier .	-1.8265
The former kindergarten in the Gartenstrasse has sold the municipality to a private person .	-3.6673
The municipal council agreed to this sale in its recent meeting in the non-public part .	-4.9536
The building changed its owner at a " reasonable " price .	-2.0780
" The municipality is satisfied , " emphasises Mai.	-2.7387
The budget was EUR 100 000 .	-1.6796
It is not yet clear how the new owner wants to use the former kindergarten .	-2.3665
The Mayor is right that Winterlingen has handed over responsibility for the building to someone else before the winter , and therefore no longer has to pay for the entertainment of the house , how to heat , look after the garden and clear the walking distance .	-6.8583

Report : Obama ’ s campaign considered replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton	-1.3834
President Barack Obama ’ s closest advisers secretly considered replacing Vice-President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton in the 2012 campaign , according to the New York Times .	-4.1029
The revelation is the most notable surprise of Mark Halperin ’ s long-awaited work on the 2012 election campaign , “ Double Down : Game Change 2012 . ”	-3.0539
The Times has a copy of the forthcoming book , and it reported on Thursday evening that the president ’ s top advisers had conducted “ extensive group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011 ” to find out whether it looks better for Obama ’ s diminishing hope of re-election if he dropped Biden .	-6.0274
According to Jonathan Martin , the Times ’ national correspondent , the book thoroughly follows the history of the efforts of leading campaign and White House staff , notably the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley , to measure the effect it has on the polls to exchange former Secretary of State Clinton against the Vice-President .	-4.8862
Potential change was a strictly kept secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office .	-2.2772
Only half a dozen of the president ’ s closest advisers – including Daley , Obama ’ s former campaign leader , Jim Messina , and the former White House ’ s chief adviser , David Axelrod , and David Plouffe – knew about the expected change .	-4.1656
“ Double Down ” claims that Daley has been at the forefront of efforts to exchange Biden despite her “ close , personal relationship , ” before finally opting for such a move , after the data showed that Clinton ’ s candidacy would not significantly improve Obama ’ s chances .	-6.1461
In an interview with Martin , Daley confirmed that the government was actually considering replacing Biden with Clinton . with .	-3.1490
“ I said a whole series of things to be considered , and that was one of them , ” Daley explained to the magazine .	-3.2448
It must be remembered that the president then had terrible polls , so we thought : “ For God ’ s will , what do we do ? ”	-4.2921
While Daley described the investigations as “ due diligence , ” Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN that considerable effort had been made during the campaign for re-election to find out whether such a move pays out on the ballot box .	-5.1096
“ In campaigns , not so much money is spent on surveys and focus groups if one does not think seriously about something , ” said Martin on AC360 .	-3.6946
But it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team thought about exchange .	-2.7227
Martin said to CNN that he asked Daley whether his boss had known about the potential change .	-2.8343
Although Daley declared that he did not believe that the president was “ aware ” of the possible change , the former chief of staff admitted that it was “ possible ” that Obama knew about it .	-3.6242
Martin added that “ Double Down ” does not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether the political explosions had reached Obama ’ s desk .	-2.9223
Cooper asked Martin whether he seriously thought Obama knew nothing about investigating whether to let Biden drop in the elections .	-4.1293
“ Possibly , ” Martin replied .	-1.4217
What happens on the way with my email ?	-2.3996
E-mail actually means electronic letters .	-1.9246
Was it technically implemented the letter secrecy when designing the Internet service ?	-6.2304
In the conception of early Internet services , the priority was to make communication possible .	-3.7650
Therefore , the basic technical protocols have not been careful to create a stable foundation for a heartfelt exchange of letters .	-4.8681
Therefore , a conventional e-mail corresponds to an open postcard rather than a sealed letter .	-2.7379
If user " Anna " sends a mail to " Benni " , are the machines of the two directly connected ?	-3.4408
The email program or browser of Anna will send the mail to your service provider in the first step .	-3.7227
For example , if you have a GMail account , it would be Google .	-2.7817
This mail server sends the content to the provider that Benni uses .	-2.1126
On the track , the mail may run via a number of other servers on the Internet .	-4.0375
Bennie can then call the content to his provider .	-2.4126
Will conventional e-mails be read through the network ?	-2.4985
Most mails are read several times by software robots .	-2.4818
The sender 's provider usually checks whether the mail carries a malicious program as an attachment .	-4.0171
A virus check is also carried out on the receiver systems .	-2.6993
The providers also check whether it is a annoying and unwanted spam mail that is deleted or at least removed from a spam folder .	-4.7813
Do the robots have another task ?	-1.6436
For systems such as GMail , the robot also determines the information Google needs to place context advertising .	-2.5336
If Anna and Benni communicate by GMail about their coming holidays , Google may display relevant links to holiday offers .	-4.3108
Read the mails of unknown people ?	-3.1598
The probability that unauthorized persons will read a mail is extremely low .	-3.5580
In theory , that is possible .	-2.0379
In companies , administrators often have the opportunity to read electronic mail .	-2.7591
The law enforcement authorities and secret services also have legal means of intercepting or taking note of emails .	-3.3847
Also possible illegal spawning actions .	-4.2515
Is it possible to protect emails against co-reading ?	-2.0342
Encryption according to the OpenPGP standard allows you to encrypt an email effectively against co-reading .	-4.2703
With a high technical effort , it is also possible to obscure the metadata of email communication , so that it is not even easy to know who communicated with whom .	-5.4856
How important is Yahoo and Google on the e-mail market in Germany ?	-1.5029
In the most privately used postal boxes , Yahoo and Google , according to an August 2013 investigation by Convios Consulting , play only a secondary role .	-4.2340
While the Yahoo Mail was last split , GMail from Google could clearly state it .	-6.3489
Mother in the Forest scarred and pensions cashe.	-5.2803
When his prayer died , a man from Wolfsburg forged a plan .	-2.5298
He buried the dead in a forest - and continued to cash her pension and caregiver .	-4.3915
A 67-year-old Wolfsburg buried his dead mother after the police investigation in the forest in order to be able to cash out further pensions and carers . a a and . and and .	-12.6313
First of all , he concealed the death of the 89-year-olds , then he cut the money for more than a year and a half .	-5.6520
Now , as a speaker said on Friday , the 67-year-old must be responsible for fraud .	-3.0810
So the man hidden the woman in a forest near Helmstedt .	-2.6059
The man was suspected in May : at that time , medicines were no longer needed for the mother in need of care .	-4.0538
Pensioners told the investigator that his mother had travelled to Spain .	-2.6971
Because the officials found this strange , they continued to investigate .	-3.5230
It was discovered that the two had lived in a common apartment for more than 15 years and that he had maintained it last .	-5.2826
The 67-year-old finally admitted the death of his mother .	-2.8424
Obduction , according to the police , provided no evidence of capital crime .	-3.6896
Do you like ice cream that shines in the dark ?	-3.4138
A British entrepreneur has developed the first ice shining in the darkness – using pains .	-3.9507
Charlie Francis exploited the fluorescent characteristics of marine animals and created a shining delicacy .	-4.0849
The idea came to him after having read a research on pains and persuaded Chinese scientists to produce the bright protein artificially .	-4.4771
The ice cream reacts with the tongue when eating , which increases the pH value in the protein and triggers the luminaire .	-8.7995
Chris explains that the ice-cream responds to the warmth in the mouth and shines – the more you lick , the brighter it becomes .	-5.3155
Charlie , founder of the ice cream company “ Lick Me I 'm Delicious ” says : “ The product is incredible , but still in a very early production phase , and so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds . ”	-3.6606
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH value .	-2.0124
When the mouth warms the protein , the pH value and ice shines .	-3.2551
We have tested it over the last few months and it seems to us ideal to launch it on Halloween because it has this wonderful lighting effect .	-4.0446
It is probably the most expensive ice cream I have ever made , because the quality lighting is quarterly more expensive than gold .	-3.7861
Each ball costs me about 140 pounds .	-1.7564
But there is a delicious taste for . . and . . and . and . . and . and	-6.8118
Charlies experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual flavours , including beer , cheese , beef and leaf gold .	-11.2732
But its latest creation is to become even more ambitious .	-2.4558
He says : “ I want to develop an invisible ice cream . ”	-2.3347
This is impossible in itself because of the light break caused by the ice cream made up of ice cream ; but I suspect we will find a way to create it .	-5.3380
The ice cream uses the fluorescent qualities of a Quale artificially produced by Chinese scientists .	-3.6008
After six days of playing the TSV Morsum is still without any point in the Handball Association League .	-3.2931
The team of Ingo Ehlers will be on the Derby against TSV Daverden tomorrow , celebrating his first victory last weekend .	-4.6202
With this game the season starts new for us .	-1.9358
" I hope that we finally have the head free , " Ehlers behaves optimistic .	-3.9028
He finally has his complete cadre at his disposal , except for the permanent Hendrik Blohme .	-4.9665
Daverden also relies on tempo play as we do .	-4.4106
We must therefore keep our error rate low .	-1.9936
But , above all , we need to increase the coverage that has left far from a certain impression .	-6.7052
Daverdens Coach Thomas Panitz won the first season against North Horn .	-4.3476
The game was obviously a house number .	-6.6551
But that is why we are far from favourite , because everything can always happen in the Derby .	-4.0773
However , Panitz now wants to start a series in Morsum .	-3.0079
Jan Malte Jodat will be missing .	-2.7604
For this purpose , the A-youth Joost Windsuss , who is active with double playing rights in the A-Youth League HC Bremen , celebrates his seasonal batch .	-6.5001
Whoever is not hot in such a game should stay at home .	-2.4519
Halloween 2013	-1.9490
When I was small , Halloween had some magic .	-1.2232
My sisters and I were allowed to eat sweets , to stay late and to deceive ourselves for the neighbourhood .	-3.8876
Today I became the Halloween Muffel .	-1.9707
Over the last two years I have not agreed to distribute from my home from sweets , and I do not think it will do so this year either .	-5.2070
But , according to statistics , I am a black sheep with regard to Halloween .	-2.4850
The majority of Americans – 158 million to be precise – celebrate Halloween this year , spending a total of $ 6.9 billion on sweets , costumes , and decorations , according to the US Retail Association ( NRF ) .	-3.4076
One thing I look forward to every Halloween then is the trend values .	-3.4841
The costumes will make up about $ 1.2 billion of the $ 6.9 billion spent , according to the NRF .	-2.3271
This year , appearing unknown items are the last cry .	-3.8193
Women no longer have to cover themselves in sexy clothing , they can now embody seductive food such as pizza , hamburgers or carrots .	-4.1729
As far as men are concerned , I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead and I bet that the Daft-Punk space channels will make it into the instagram feeds this year .	-4.0064
According to Google , the most sought costumes are zombies , batman , pirates and witches .	-2.5284
I suspect that there is nothing wrong with tradition .	-2.3750
Last year , I was surprised to see that we were not alone .	-4.6739
Indeed , Americans spend $ 330 million this year on pet costumes , according to the NRF .	-1.8808
This is a lot of hot dogs .	-2.2650
We are not fantastic about candy .	-3.4709
Americans will spend $ 1.9 billion this year , according to The Nielsen Company .	-1.5785
This is about 270 million kilograms of chocolate , lutchers , bonbons and rubber bears .	-3.7256
So good news for the 41 million people who , according to the US Trade Ministry , are calling “ sweet or saures ” through the quarter .	-3.7943
In fact , we will buy over 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and – let us not pretend – eat .	-3.3809
The only thing we do not want to consume is the sugar-sweet Candy Corn ; yet 15 million kilograms of it are sold around Halloween , according to the National Association of Confederate Producers .	-4.0063
That is about nine billion maize grains .	-1.9291
It is a mystery that I have not yet been able to resolve .	-2.1082
Nothing belongs more to Halloween than houses in which it haunts .	-2.3860
They have great names like “ Terror Behind the Walls ” , “ Howl-O-Scream , ” and “ The House of Shock . ”	-3.1256
Indeed , there are 1,200 officially recognized Spukhäuser in the United States who generate $ 500 million in revenue , America Haunts says , and that includes the wonderful photos on which to pink into the trousers and then put their friends on Facebook , where they are not released , and then the type of one that you stand on leaves a comment like “ nice face expression . ”	-9.3759
But we finally get to the shortcomings .	-3.7683
Charlie Brown was familiar to us with the Great Kurbi when we were children , and the cutting of a cutting-edge is like the decoration of the Christmas tree – something we have made from small .	-6.2491
Fortunately , the “ baby in the Kürbis ” trend only started last year thanks to Pinterest , so most of us grew up with cutting the shorbis rather than sitting there .	-4.0753
This year , Americans will spend about $ 106 million on cartoons , according to the US Census Bureau .	-3.6286
The cumbersome , slowly rotting in the pre-garden , probably comes from Illinois , where 245 million kilograms of artificial biscuits were harvested this year .	-5.5686
If you want to make the right points , call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa , California and cut a little bit of their 921 kilo heavy crafts .	-5.3381
Housing fire in Helm-Right : Rescue forces Mount Corpse	-6.1188
The fire brigade had to leave in helmet right on Thursday evening .	-2.8952
A three-family house in the district of Hof begins to fire at night on Friday .	-3.6625
The rescue forces have a cooled body from the house .	-3.1087
Rescue forces found a cool body in a three-family house at a fire in helmet right .	-4.3220
Whether it was a resident was still unclear , as a spokesman from the police in Bayreuth said .	-3.5755
Late Thursday evening it had burned on the ground floor of the house .	-2.4216
When the fire brigade arrived , the flames were already from a window .	-2.8983
The staff went to the apartment and found the body in a room .	-2.3836
This and another room burnt out completely .	-2.3587
The whole ground floor has been damaged .	-8.6799
All other inhabitants were not at home during the fire , the police spokesperson explained .	-3.8329
The building is unusable for the time being .	-3.7282
The exact cause of the fire was initially not clear .	-2.1114
Germany ’ s largest church has launched an offensive to promote the profession of pastor .	-2.8664
Background is a possible parish shortage : the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Hannover estimates that the number of its currently approximately 1,800 pastors will halve after 2030 .	-5.9244
For young people today , the profession is very attractive and offers good future prospects , said Pastor Mathis Burfien ( 43 ) in conversation with the Evangelical press service .	-3.6453
It is attractive to be able to determine the working and daily process itself .	-4.7575
With Burfien , the Landeskirche first commissioned a pastor on a full place to inspire young people for theology studies .	-4.6530
Currently , fewer and fewer young people are choosing by the Abitur to study theology .	-4.8007
Burfia leads this back to the process of deciration : " God 's voice is quiet , the world is loud " .	-3.7567
The profession is characterised by great freedom and diversity .	-2.8771
I am the master of my calendar and can set my priorities where I think it is important .	-3.9515
Pastors could be very close to people as a seal carer .	-4.2677
They earned as much as teachers and could live well .	-2.3070
To be sure , more is paid in the free economy , but for that , theologians would have a safe employer .	-3.2360
This is what today ’ s young people , who are not just about careers , but about meaningful work .	-5.1033
According to the National Church , which comprises three quarters of Lower Saxony , around 60 pastors are retiring each year .	-3.4355
At the same time , about 40 graduates from a theology studio begin their Vikariat .	-3.4681
In sparsely populated peripheral areas such as Harz , Emsland or Wendland , it will be difficult to occupy jobs in the future .	-4.0105
Burfien wants to organise studies days for young people and to invite celebrities who have studied theology .	-6.0671
The theological studies offer a broad education .	-3.1966
You can even become a federal president .	-2.2721
Land Rover Rally Series announced	-1.5445
The interior features race seats and six-point belts as well as a free speaking system .	-4.2584
The options range from strengthened brakes , a service package with support of bowler workmechanics and logistical support to vehicle storage between events .	-4.6580
Drew Bowler , Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport , says : “ The rally customers coming to Bowler have changed . ”	-2.8105
They are not all experienced racing drivers , but people who are looking for excitement and adventure , as well as for an attainable path to world class events .	-5.3074
We are pleased to open this path in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format opens up new possibilities for experiencing the various Rally disciplines in the United Kingdom and abroad and preparing newcomers for the straps and reality of Rally Raid .	-5.4060
We had really fun developing the Defender Challenge car – this is an entertaining championship .	-3.9070
In addition , the Defender Challenge has a training and test day in February and the option to participate in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East .	-3.2651
Called fire brigade to rescue a female female female captured 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rock front in a quarry .	-6.6574
Cockerspaniel Ruby was gone away after a smaller traffic accident .	-3.2970
Three days later , she was discovered by a walker in the quarry in her malicious location .	-4.3684
Firemen rolled off the rock wall and saved the dog from safe death .	-3.6838
The fire brigade succeeded in bringing safety to a fence that was on a rock wall at a height of 15 meters .	-6.7160
The nine months old cockerspaniel female Ruby was gone away after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived for three days before it was saved from a quarry on Wednesday .	-4.0612
Scott Alderson , 25 , and his girlfriend Becky Hall , 20 who belongs to the dog , came to the quarry of Flappit in Denholme , West Yorkshire to reception Ruby and thank the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service firemen .	-3.8577
They had desperately sought their missing female female female female husband and published requests for help in social networks after the small traffic accident in the quarry .	-14.8070
About 14 : 15 on Wednesday , a walker who executed his dog , saw the stranded Ruby at the 15 meter high paragraph in the quarry .	-4.7409
The Cleckheaton Fire Station technical rescue team rushed to replace Ruby , which was then transported upwards in a dog box .	-4.4406
Andy Clayton , the specialist in the technical rescue team , said : “ It was in a dangerous situation .	-2.7593
It was located in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and the ground .	-2.9499
She did not move a muscle during her rescue – she was like frozen .	-1.9711
But now it is doing well .	-1.9044
She then eaten a few dog cakes .	-2.1384
This was a rather unusual effort .	-2.5709
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible .	-1.1640
Peter Lau , the specialist in the technical rescue team , said : “ Ruby had a huge luck . ”	-3.1539
It was possible that it was very seriously injured or worse .	-2.2782
Ruby was investigated as a veterinarian , but he did not notice anything except exhaustion and dehydration .	-4.1865
Becky Hall from Halifax , West Yorkshire , said , “ Saving was frightening . ”	-2.5187
I could not believe that she really was there above .	-3.1123
It was wonderful to keep them back in the arms .	-6.5091
The veterinarian said that if the exhaustion had become too great and had collapsed , it would probably have crashed .	-3.6486
The fire fighters have done a fantastic job . . . . . and . . . . . . . and .	-9.5642
What they did was really bold .	-2.3676
We are simply so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible .	-2.0402
Scott Alderson from Keighley added : “ We were afraid it would fall , but it remained up . ”	-3.3083
The fire fighters were great .	-1.9238
I can hardly believe where she was .	-1.2068
Mick Jagger declared that he never worried Katy Perry when she was 18 .	-3.2275
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week , the pop star said that she was working as a background singer on Jaggers song “ Old Habits Die Hard ” from 2004 .	-4.4266
Perry explained that she had eaten with the aldryer in the evening , and that “ he told me when I was 18 . ”	-10.7313
She added : “ This has been a long time ago and he was very nice to me . ”	-3.3212
In a statement , a representative of Jaggers , 70 , said on Thursday that he “ categorically denied that he had ever tried to get closer to Katy Perry . ”	-4.1240
The representative added : “ Perhaps she confused him with someone else . ”	-2.6027
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest appearance on the Rolling Stones tour this year .	-2.9427
Their new album “ Prism ” landed on the top of 1 this week .	-4.3722
George Kerevan : European unbundling gives the Scottish election	-2.8824
A new day , a new story of independence .	-1.3851
This time , we are warned that an independent Scotland is needed to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership .	-2.2540
This is the key word for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a border secured with barbed wire along the Hadrian Wall .	-4.3159
Indeed , the Strathclyde proposal pointed out the possible economic benefits that would bring greater freedom of travel in the rest of Europe , but , as expected , this did not matter in the headlines .	-4.5560
Nor has anyone mentioned that EU member states often adhere to strict rules when it is more favourable to them .	-4.2118
As Scotland is not part of the Schengen area at the moment , continued non-compliance with Brussels would be a small concession in exchange for what the Scots really want .	-4.2329
So really no story .	-2.8090
And one that has already come in such a way that it is like a fossil : the first time I heard the ‘ independence means passport controls ’ duck at least 40 years ago .	-4.8644
An interesting point is lost in the constant repetition of this ancient history .	-2.9307
Why expect an independent Scotland to dance after the European pipe ?	-1.9562
Why trade the London yoke against that of Brussels , especially now ?	-2.7776
These are the real news of Europe : the large post-war plan to unite Europe has stalled .	-3.4920
With the euro crisis , the European project has officially died .	-1.5656
Throughout the EU , parties that are hostile to the EU or want to throw the euro over as a common currency are gaining ground .	-3.4491
Even in Germany , the Euroskeptic Party ’ s alternative for Germany – founded only this year – was able to gather nearly five million votes in the federal election in September , effectively expel Free Democrats ( the equivalent to the British Liberal Democrats ) from the Bundestag .	-5.8819
There has always been domestic resistance to the plan to create a federal Europe .	-1.6468
But the current economic crisis turns out to be a turning point .	-1.5174
Because of the tight austerity policy imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank in connection with the straightjacket in which the respective national economy is obliged by maintaining the single currency , many people believe that the European project has gone too far .	-5.1860
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments causing excessive budget deficits – only in Greece .	-1.8786
Instead , the Eurosystem has imprisoned its members on exchange rates that are beneficial to German exporters – and German politicians want to leave that .	-4.6182
Without the possibility of depreciation of the local currency , southern Europe will find a built-in productivity disadvantage over Germany .	-3.5673
The only way to cut wages and public spending – spurred by Berlin .	-2.0844
Behind the current budget and currency problems lies a deeper European productivity problem .	-2.3565
As a result of the “ green ” energy directives imposed by Brussels – a code for subsidising French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – European industry pays double for electricity and four times the price of gas compared to the United States .	-3.5952
This is a paralysing cost disadvantage , as we have already seen in Grangemouth .	-2.7995
All world wage fixes do not protect the European petrochemical industry from being pushed into the corner by cheap American shale gas .	-2.7743
As a result , a revolt is rising , especially in France , the EU ’ s former chief leader .	-3.0258
After the war , France ’ s political elite saw the EU as a vehicle to keep Germany in check and lift Paris to Washington .	-3.4212
But Berlin does not need more than a gateway to political legitimacy , and has expressed Europe 's own economic policy , struggling with the struggling French economy .	-10.3624
The result : Marine Le Pen ’ s right-wing anti-EU National Front has just won a decisive re-election , leaving the ruling Socialists at three .	-11.9599
The National Front is now the most popular party in France , with 24 % of the votes – a timely warning to the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that right-wing division would automatically benefit the left .	-3.6745
What is Le Pen doing with its newly won popularity among the white workers ’ classes ?	-3.2397
It would like to use the EU elections next year to forge an anti-EU , anti-common currency bloc in the European Parliament .	-2.6304
If the anti-EU parties perform well in these elections – and this is very well possible – such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament for the first time .	-3.6209
That is the point I want to make : in the not too distant future , the growing resentment against the EU and the single currency will come together to abolish the euro .	-3.4692
The EU will not disappear , but it will become more like the “ Europe of sovereign nations , ” favored by General de Gaulle .	-2.1730
Germany and some of its satellite economies may hold on to the euro , but France and Southern Europe will return to their own currencies .	-2.3108
I expect the United Kingdom to dissociate itself from this project in the hope of flattering in the United States .	-4.2912
But Washington ’ s growing interest in the Pacific region suggests that Britain will stand alone in the Atlantic rain .	-2.3094
Where is Scotland all this ?	-1.3027
We can decide to be a region of ( ultimately ) small England .	-2.2960
Or we can defend our own economic interests – including telling Berlin and Brussels what they can go where .	-3.0812
I suspect that Scotland could go well in a more relaxed European network , provided we keep our own currency .	-3.9450
Cooperation with other similar countries is easier in an unfederated Europe of nations .	-2.2002
Otherwise , we should consider equating Norway and maintaining our economic independence .	-2.6655
The SNP government in Scotland is – remarkably – the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe , and won a spectacular majority in 2011 , owing to the rejection of the proposed ( and made ) cuts that the Labour finance minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory Lib dem coalition .	-3.8555
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to opt for independence now , only to have austerity imposed on Berlin and Brussels .	-3.6773
Early Puberty : Growing Up Speed	-3.9755
African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white counterparts , as studies show .	-2.9973
Body Changes don ’ t mean immediate puberty .	-3.8135
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible .	-1.4916
Experts believe that epidemic obesity is a trigger of early puberty .	-1.3931
The trend toward early puberty is less pronounced among boys .	-2.3972
The former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specialising in child health and family issues .	-11.6040
Should a mother be worried if her daughter grows breasts and shame hair at the age of seven or eight ?	-2.6603
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics Association in Orlando , Florida this week , the paediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz stated that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and were a new standard .	-3.5948
“ I spend a lot of time reassuring parents – this is usually no sign that puberty is now fast , ” Kaplowitz explained .	-4.8965
Obvious indications of development , such as growing breasts , shame and axle hair , and body smell , are shown in girls earlier .	-4.1314
Nevertheless , there was only a slight shift in the age of the menarch ( occurrence of the first regulatory bleeding ) over the last 40 years .	-4.7880
In the United States , the average age is 12.5 , slightly less than 12.75 in 1970 .	-8.8354
“ When the development of the breasts begins , it takes at least two to three years to the menarch , ” said Kaplowitz , also author of the book “ Early Puberty for girls : the essential advisor to deal with this frequently occurring problem . ”	-4.8751
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty proceeds .	-2.0591
It is controversial what is actually the beginning of puberty , but it is “ early rip ” when breast increases are accompanied by a growth boost of eight years ago .	-5.2259
In most cases , the process is slowing or stagnating – something that a nurse can monitor closely .	-2.5502
Tests could be displayed by an endicronologist at a faster pace , so that serious problems such as tumors or cycles can be excluded .	-5.7530
There are treatments to delay early menstruation and defend a different consequence : the premature ageing of bones , which can ultimately lead to growth emittation and thus small body growth in adults .	-5.9694
The recommendations for medical or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child , the development speed , the growth rate and the emotional maturity .	-3.1927
Psychosocial aspects are also important .	-1.3122
Kaplowitz is cautious about medicines , but he admits : “ Oppressing puberty can mitigate behavioral problems and girls ’ feelings of being different from their age counterparts . ”	-4.2602
The other major problem is understandable : parents simply do not want their young daughters to have the period .	-1.9636
“ They worry about the risk of pregnancy or about how they handle the hygiene side , ” said Kaplowitz .	-2.8131
“ It was a shock , ” a woman remembers , whose daughter was given their days at the age of .	-4.6013
Although there were first signs and we had talked about menstruation , it was emotionally not prepared .	-2.9505
She arrived frightened and excited from school because she was the first in her friend 's circle .	-4.1930
There are many widely published theories about the causes of early puberty .	-1.6826
But there is no coherent evidence that hormones in milk or other food , chemicals in the environment , or sexual embassies in the media are causing .	-3.5702
Young get into puberty similar to girls in the past .	-3.5585
Kaplowitz believes that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of obesity .	-1.5367
He supported carrying out a study in 2001 on girls aged between six and nine , which establishes a link between body perfection and entry into puberty .	-5.1637
Other studies support this conclusion , but there are many other factors that have played a role .	-2.0274
In that country , African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white counterparts .	-2.8197
There are different explanations for this .	-1.0078
Globally , an early puberty seems to be influenced by all kinds of things , from economic conditions to climate to genes .	-2.9205
Another puzzle : Although boys have grown their face and shame hair sooner , the trend towards a full-fledged former puberty is not as strong as girls .	-5.2848
Other doctors at the AAP conference emphasized the complexity of the issue .	-2.0411
The emergence of acne and shame hair is also common in babies and infants .	-3.6155
“ We must be careful as we identify the real beginning of puberty , ” said Dr Lawrence Silverman , a pediatric endocrinologist at the Goryeb Children 's Hospital in Morristown , New Jersey .	-12.0197
Parents should not hesitate to get advised by their child 's doctor how to speak to their child .	-3.6933
“ This may mean that you have to talk earlier than expected , ” said Kaplowitz .	-4.1774
If you remain calm , the child usually reacts well .	-9.2906
Girls who flourish early need the insurance that the process is a normal part of life , even if it occurs earlier than intended .	-4.0720
Jumbo manufacturers argue in the face of large orders over seat width .	-3.1752
There has been a dispute between leading aircraft manufacturers over the width of tourist seats for long-haul flights , indicating the tone for a bitter collision at the Dubai Airshow this month .	-4.5079
The dispute is about the width of seats offered to passengers on long flights in the tourist class – not always those who are most concerned about airlines , but this identified space is the key to the efficiency claims of Airbus SAS and Boeing Co . ’ s latest aircraft .	-5.9786
This week , Airbus called for an industry standard requiring at least 46 cm ( 18 inch ) seats in the tourist class , but the American archrival Boeing says that the airlines should decide .	-4.8400
The controversy comes at a time when aircraft builders compete to sell even larger versions of their twin-engine long-haul flyers , and expect record applications at the event of 17 to 21 November .	-5.6295
As the rear part of the aircraft is designed – especially if there are nine or ten seats – is crucial to the economic results indicated , which will provide the new “ mini jumbo ” design .	-5.1872
Boeing claims that his modernized “ 777X ” comprises 406 people in tourist classes , which are more than 17 inches wide and thus allow ten per row .	-5.7922
Airbus declares that the competing version of the A350 carries 350 people in 18 inch wide tourist seats , with nine per row .	-3.1519
Aeroplane giants often share hooks about technical details by means of advertising in the trade press .	-5.2543
Now Airbus appeals to the public in front of the Dubai Airshow , where the 777X is expected to make the race with more than 100 orders .	-3.8670
Recently , the company presented an advertisement that could be the beginning of a new advertisement war and showed donors a picture in which three people are merged in a restaurant , and the title : “ Would you accept that ? ”	-5.9693
“ Boeing proposes long-haul flights in seats that are closer than regional turbo props , ” says Airbus sales chief John Leahy .	-3.2725
Given changes in eating habits , people are getting thicker , but aircraft seats have not changed radically .	-3.5140
Between the early 1970s , when Boeing 747 defined modern long-haul journey , and at the end of the century , male average American weight increased by 10 % between 40 and 49 years , according to US Department of Health data .	-3.7771
The average American male waist in the 21st century is 100.8 cm according to US health statistics .	-3.2177
Airbus says that its rival is in line with a 1950s seat concept , when the average body range of the freshly baptized “ Jet Set ” was narrower .	-10.1762
According to Airbus , investigations have been carried out showing that an additional duty ( 2.54 cm ) per seat increases sleep quality by 53 % .	-4.0081
Boeing disputes Airbus ’ seat figures and says that it is not the manufacturer ’ s discretion to decide how airlines shape the balance between flight tariffs and equipment .	-5.2124
The company also declares that , according to research , the aviation experience depends on more than the seat width .	-3.6112
“ It really amounts to giving airlines flexibility so that they can do what they think must be successful , ” says the flight cabin expert , Kent Craver von Boeing .	-4.5807
They do not want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable .	-1.0036
They know their business better than anyone else .	-1.6941
For passengers it is about more freedom of elbows , but for manufacturers it is increasingly an issue that can affect sales .	-5.3982
Behind the debate is a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least $ 700 billion after list prices in the coming decades , which could have a lasting impact on the US or Europe ’ s export balance .	-4.4188
As Reuters first reported in July , the seat layout is the driving force behind the battle over the new jets .	-2.7818
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest two-engine long-range designs than the market leader in this segment , the 365-seated Boeing 77-300ER .	-10.3290
The statements of Boeing on the results depend partly on the 777X being compared with its ten seats per row with the original design of nine seats in the 777 .	-3.2703
The increased costs per unit are still lower than those of currently used machines with ten seats per row .	-3.4530
“ Therefore , Boeing will squeeze more seats in his aircraft to make it more competitive with our products , ” says Kevin Keniston , head of European Airbus passenger comfort .	-5.1293
On the other hand , analysts say that full cabins with ten seats per row in existing 77s indicated that many passengers decided to arrange closer arrangements , which could be accompanied by cheaper fares .	-4.4109
“ Eighteen inch seats would be great for passengers , but the reality is : from an economic point of view , the Airbus offer is controlled by the threat posed by the 777 , ” says Mary Kirby , expert for cabin installation , founder and editor of Runway Girl Network .	-12.2914
Airbus and Boeing offer no seats , but a catalogue of suppliers from which the airlines can select .	-3.3641
The world-famous jet vendors even wear tape to measure the facility to compete .	-5.4275
Even if they afford comfort , all manufacturers also offer jets with highly compressed design for low-cost airlines and regional flights .	-3.4288
Airbus offers a 10-seat A350 but , according to its own statement , has not sold it yet .	-4.3637
Until recently , Airbus stressed the importance of increased cabin adaptability and offered large seats in the corridors for some jets .	-4.1657
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets , experts say that the call for a new industry standard would probably be vulnerable , but could distract from the wave of 777X sales .	-3.9131
A New Anti-Nicotine Vaccine could turn a blind eye to pleasure in smoking .	-4.6565
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could spoil the fun of smoking .	-1.8426
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine for a lifetime .	-2.4440
Before testing humans , more tests are needed , which may take a few years to come , but Professor Ronald Crystal of Well Cornell Medical College in New York said the first results were good .	-4.9161
“ We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can once help millions of smokers who have tried to stop and tried all the methods available on the market , but have experienced that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches , ” Cornell said .	-13.4296
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to include genetic information on the production of nicotine antibodies .	-3.2935
The virus selectively infects liver cells , which then produce a permanent stream of antibodies .	-2.1279
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain , leaving a smoker without a nicotine high .	-3.6676
In trials , vaccinated mice to which nicotine was administered contributed to its normal level of activity .	-3.6756
Mce without vaccination , on the other hand , would have taken a “ break , ” researchers said that a sign that the nicotine had reached its brain .	-4.4789
The experiments are described in Science Translation Medicine .	-8.7288
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies .	-1.8361
The vaccination had to be given so frequently to maintain the antibody level that they were expensive and impractical .	-3.6359
But the cost of the new vaccine is probably significantly lower , because it transforms liver cells into antibody factories .	-10.0489
As Professor Crystal said , a future vaccine could be administered to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette and thus prevent nicotine addiction .	-3.7268
More likely , smokers would use it to stop .	-1.2436
“ They know that when they start smoking again , they no longer feel fun because of the nicotine vaccine , and that helps them to break the habit , ” he explains .	-5.3794
British scientists said that the results were interesting , but at the same time warned that further research was needed .	-2.4330
Tripodi denies having been influenced by Obeid .	-1.6062
The former Labor Minister Joe Tripodi of New South Wales has launched an investigation by state corruption supervision .	-4.7082
The former NSW minister disputes having amended the rules on maritime leasing at the request of his political mentor , Eddie Obeid , who had hidden investments in three plots in state-controlled land .	-4.8368
The Independent Commission Against Corruption ( ICAC <unk> Independent Commission against Corruption ) expanded its investigations on Friday on whether Obeid had influenced various ministers in this regard , lending contracts at the Circular Quay , where the Obeids operated two restaurants and a café without calling for tenders to expire in August 2005 .	-6.1259
Now , due to the accusation that Tripodi knew of Obeid ’ s hidden interest in the plots after Tripodis ’ s former deputy chief of staff Lynne Ashpole announced on Thursday .	-5.8000
In many years of talks that started in 2005 , the government had pushed for public tenders for the leased contracts .	-3.8639
The plants were opposed to this and wanted longer runtime .	-5.7138
In 2009 , lending contracts for companies at the Circular Quay , which brought the obeids $ 2.5 million annually , were extended without public tender .	-4.4597
Tripodi , who was the port minister from February 2006 to November 2009 , was originally in favour of public tenders .	-3.6037
But he disputed having made changes to Obeid ’ s requests , which , as Tripodi confirmed , had pushed for a reorganisation of the government ’ s leased rules .	-5.4236
One of the ICAC ’ s telephone networks showed conversations from August to September 2007 between Obeid , Tripodi and Steve Dunn , a senior official who had moved to the port ministry after working under Obeid in the Fisheries Authority .	-5.4507
“ Was the issue discussed in these telephone discussions the drawing up of commercial leasing rules ? ” the deputy Commissioner , Anthony Whaly Tripodi , asked .	-4.8104
“ No , ” Tripodi replied .	-1.4025
I cannot remember what was discussed , but that was definitely not .	-1.8450
It is definitely not between me and Mr Obeid .	-2.4912
Israeli warplanes attack Syria ’ s targets , according to official sources .	-3.4005
Israeli hunting aircraft would have attacked a goal in the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday night , a senior government officer confirmed Fox News .	-3.7468
The official did not explain what the objective was , but said that it was at least one .	-2.5646
According to Associated Press , the goal was Russian SA-125 missiles .	-1.9498
At least twice this year , Israel has already carried out air strikes on missile supplies in Syria .	-2.2837
Foreign workers with 457 visas could be subjected to “ test of authenticity . ”	-3.0433
The government is considering advancing measures on a “ authenticity test ” for foreign workers with 457 visas .	-4.1215
If the test is introduced , it would be used through a criterion to prevent the 457 being used to fill unqualified jobs or as a back door for family and friends to Australia .	-4.5084
Today , a government discussion proposal has been published after the Labor Party ’ s former Labor MEPs , Maxine McKew , condemned the government ’ s comments with regard to foreign workers , because they could be considered an insult by Australia ’ s neighbors .	-5.1627
“ Volume explanations such as foreigners are supposed to backfire – and Australians first hit – are a very unpleasant backlash in times of trade unions demanding a protected labour market , ” she said to the Australia India Institute today .	-6.4342
Historically , white workers were to be protected – and if some in the region seize an echo of this historic artifact , I would not be surprised .	-3.9398
The proposal for a debate covers twelve measures , once considered by former Minister for Immigration , Chris Bowen .	-4.6132
Immigration Minister Brendan O 'Connor , who was here yesterday to talk about trafficking in human beings in Sri Lanka , has implemented five of the recommended changes , and others are still being considered .	-5.8775
If the “ criterion of authenticity ” is adopted , someone who applies for a visa could be checked to see whether “ the application is real in cases where the applicant is related to the holder or a relevant person of the supporting company or is personally associated . ”	-5.6938
Companies could also be obliged to account for the number of 457 visa holders after hundreds have finally ceased in the past , which was intended to support only a small number of workers .	-4.9060
Meanwhile , a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker probably died of a heart attack after arriving this week with a refugee boat on the Christmas island .	-4.1548
The disturbed nine-year-old son of the man who came to Australia with him has been cared for by an adult cousin on the boat since the death of his father on Wednesday .	-4.2040
Australian authorities brought the man to the Christmas Island Hospital where he died .	-1.5643
A study has been announced by the British Government to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland .	-2.2504
HS2 Ltd 's work proposes that high-speed connections between Scotland and the North of England be implemented as early as the beginning of phase 1 in 2026 .	-3.7986
Secretary of Transport Baroness Kramer said that the project “ will bring the UK closer together . ”	-9.3503
The Scottish Transport Minister , Keith Brown , said that he was very pleased to work with the British Government on this plan .	-3.3148
Phase 1 is a new high-speed rail link between London and the West Midlands .	-2.6904
After completion of phase 2 there will be links to Manchester and Leeds .	-2.5415
In June , the government corrected the estimated cost of building the high-speed road between London and North England from <unk> 32.7 billion to <unk> 42.6 billion .	-3.0565
The British Government , which is engaged in talks with Transport Scotland , has appointed HS2 Ltd to seek further route capacities and travel improvements for Northern England and Scotland .	-4.0711
This includes the possibility of travelling to London from eventually three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh .	-3.5742
Baroness Kramer said : “ Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network that brings Britain and its cities closer together . ”	-2.6012
We are moving forward with HS2 because it brings enormous benefits .	-2.3707
Without the capacity crisis we are facing in our railway network .	-3.5572
But it is also about the connection between 18 British cities , including Glasgow and Edinburgh , which is improved thanks to HS2 .	-2.5791
The Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael commented : “ Today ’ s announcement is good news for Scotland . ”	-2.2289
On behalf of the Scottish Government , Keith Brown Carmichael called for “ unequivocal ” Scottish integration into the HS2 network .	-2.9812
Brown said , “ High-speed rail connections have the potential of enormous economic benefits for Scotland , but at the same time Scotland ’ s economic power also provides an argument for rapid rail connections across the United Kingdom . ”	-4.9638
We are therefore pleased to work as a partner of the British Government and to examine the options for high-speed rail connections in Scotland , which creates benefits for all and supplements the Glasgow Edinburgh link , which the Scottish Government is already planning .	-5.0500
I look forward to examining the study report with the British ministers next year and to jointly adopting the next steps .	-2.9351
Regulations on electronic equipment in aircraft remain in force in Australia for the time being .	-3.0346
Australian air passengers must continue to shut off tablets and smartphones at startup and landing , despite efforts in the US to relax regulations for such equipment .	-4.3347
The US Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) enables US airlines to change their specifications so that passengers can read , view or play videos on their devices during critical flight phases if they are in “ flight mode . ”	-4.1348
During most of the flight , passengers are already allowed to do so , but many people find it annoying that they are unable to read their e-books at the start and landing .	-4.7431
Australian companies are observing the decision to implement which US airlines have to carry out vast amounts of work , but are not pursuing immediate plans to amend their rules .	-5.0632
The CASA Aviation Authority also declared that it would look at the announcement , but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic equipment remain in critical flight stages in Australia .	-4.7960
“ CASA currently has no specific regulations on the use of electronic equipment in the aircraft ” , has been reported .	-4.7437
The subject is subject to provisions that airlines must uphold safety at any time and passengers must comply with cabin crew safety instructions .	-4.2069
Virgin has already held talks with the CASA about extending its Wi-Fi entertainment system to flights and stated that it is open to change , but they should be initiated by the legislator .	-4.6610
“ We would welcome a review of the authorisation of electronic devices by CASA , because we are convinced that this would improve the customer ’ s experience after we offer ( wireless entertainment ) during the flight , ” said a speaker .	-4.5863
Qantas explained that it will remain with the current regulations until further notice .	-3.6053
“ Our current guidelines stipulate that electronic equipment must not be used when starting and landing , and we do not currently have any plans to change that , ” the company explained .	-4.6616
The FAA regulations apply to US airlines .	-1.8632
However , we are always interested in developments in regulations that benefit passengers , and I am sure that the FAA decision and the reasons behind it will be very careful .	-5.0158
The choice varies from age to age in US companies .	-8.6232
They must prove that their aircraft can tolerate radio disorders through mobile devices , and change manuals , training materials , hand baggage programs and customer instruction .	-4.0895
“ After an airline has confirmed its fleet ’ s tolerance , passengers can use portable , lightweight electronic devices such as tablets , e-book readers , and smartphones at any height , ” the FAA announced .	-4.9845
In rare cases , the crew will instruct passengers to turn off the devices during landing .	-4.2801
The group also recommended that heavier equipment be dumped safely under the seat or in the subjects above the seats when starting and landing .	-4.8535
Before the Revierderby against Schalke , accompanying BVB trailers with lighting missiles had provided ugly scenes in the Veltins Arena .	-4.6323
Borussia Dortmund then announced harsh consequences .	-1.8257
Before the Friday match of the football bond league against the VfB Stuttgart , the ultras responded with a silence - first .	-3.6897
It was an unfamiliar , almost donesy acoustic , that offered the viewer to take a closer look at the federal League match between the German Vice-Master Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart in the Signal Iduna Park .	-6.9470
The guest fans were mostly listening to their songs .	-5.6029
The southern gallery , on the other hand , where the most loyal - and loudest - BVB fans are , first presented themselves with extraordinary silence : no songs , no battle cries .	-6.1932
The capo ’ s podium , which otherwise coordinates joint fire , remained unfilled .	-3.6791
And at the very front of the gallery , a big flag was waiting on the label " Ban Stadium " .	-7.4232
Only as a goalkeeper , Roman Weidenfeller , as always the first BVB player to enter the place , branded up short-term jubilee .	-5.1566
When his fellow team members followed , there were vocals and wearing scarves - but not everywhere long ago .	-4.5442
There was nothing in the central blocks 12 and 13 of the southern gallery .	-2.8228
Also that stadium spokesperson Norbert Dickel recorded the positive experiences of recent days - derbysieg , victory over Arsenal , contract extension by Trainer Jürgen Klopp - did not provide a holiday holiday .	-5.2807
Only five minutes before the attachment the Capo exploded his podium - and until then , the tangible tension with hands escaped in a loud cry when thickness as usual asked the mood on the ranks in the stadium .	-7.3146
The last thing , as always , was the southern gallery - and finally the loudest place in the stadium was once again as usual .	-5.0040
And , no later than with the attachment from the southern gallery the loud call " Derbysieger stands on " came , everything was as always .	-6.3176
The silence earlier was probably a response to the events of the past few days .	-2.9383
Immediately before Revierderby at the FC Schalke 04 , some of the passionate BVB trailers had driven lighting rockets into the spectator bears and onto the square - almost torwatchers hit Roman Weidenfeller .	-7.7293
The game was delayed because of the chaotic scenes .	-2.4614
BVB Boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had received the tips of the Dortmunder Ultras in his office - and believes Watzke 's words , this was a rather uncomfortable date for the fan representatives .	-4.5810
" There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra movement , " the BVB Boss announced on Thursday evening at a panel discussion in Frankfurt .	-2.9515
As an immediate measure , Watzke banned the ultras a choreography for the home game against the VfB Stuttgart .	-3.0080
'I forbidden ' , he explained .	-2.4797
We cannot give up the zero tolerance policy on pyrotechnics .	-1.8956
In addition , the Ultra 's various possibilities of punishment have been shown - until Tuesday , they now have time to choose one .	-5.2270
Otherwise , Watzke said , the BVB will set a sanction by the end of next .	-4.5461
" This will be drastic " , insured cotton .	-3.7612
We can be curious about the reactions in the southern gallery .	-4.6800
Pfandhouses boom in Singapore , because the crisis has arrived in the middle class .	-2.9965
In a deposit house in the Bendemeer Shopping Centre in Singapore , Janani Amirthalinga exchanges a golden arm , ring and a pair of earrings to pay the school fees of their daughters .	-4.2888
“ My husband and I have just bought a house , there is my whole money in it , ” says Amirthalinga .	-2.8007
Although they earn 3,000 Singapore dollars each month ( approximately 1,730 euros ) as administrative staff and work their husband , monthly family income is not enough , they explain .	-5.3572
Indeed , demand in parts of South-East Asia – where household debt is growing – is so great that ValueMax , where it has made its exchange , became the third deposit house listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week .	-3.6120
Pledging jewelry is not only a quick way to get money – $ 1,300 Singapore in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also nearly as cheap as an unsecured bank loan .	-3.4225
Typically , Pfandhäuser in Singapore demand an effective 17 % annual interest rate , just above the 15.4 % that the United Overseas Bank demands , a local lender with a branch in the same shopping centre .	-4.1205
Pfandhouses , however , offer the advantage that there is no need to review credit rating or proof of income , which is why loans are faster than possible with banks .	-4.9363
For this reason , millions of people in the region are turning to deposits , as families feel the pressure from rising living costs and increasing household and consumer debt .	-4.3290
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap credit , owing to loose fiscal policies in the developed economies , families with lower and middle-income incomes are seeking deposit houses to compensate for the difference in the fattening economy .	-5.1698
This week , the rating agency Standard & Poor ’ s growing budget debt , mainly through rising mortgages , was a risk factor for Asian banks ’ credit rating .	-3.7763
Malaysia , Thailand and Singapore , according to the Agency 's assessment , have Asia 's highest budget debt relative to gross domestic .	-3.2676
Malaysia is at the top of the list , with 80 % of GDP , a 60 % increase in 2008 .	-2.5096
Economists are also worried about Thailand ’ s high consumer debt , which this week has just come out of a technical recession .	-3.6643
On Thursday , the data showed a continuing export weakening and a reduction in consumer demand .	-3.3664
“ Ultimately , this means that , with rising costs , middle-to-bottom ( the income scale ) people will try to supplement their income wherever possible , ” says Song Seng Wu , an economist at CIMB , a Malaysian bank .	-4.1304
Historical high levels of gold prices over the last two years have reinforced the trend towards pledging personal items , as people have taken the opportunity to turn family jewellery into cash .	-4.4841
In Singapore , about 70 % of pledged items are in the 200 deposits of the city state of gold .	-3.0706
People say : “ The gold price looks good , let us pledge gold chain and get back next month . ”	-3.8143
The largest Thai deposit house operator , EasyMoney , has experienced 20 % growth in its branches in recent months .	-3.3586
Growth in the deposit business is so strong that ValueMax , operator of the Bendemeer branch and 15 more in Singapore , wants to expand not only to neighbouring Malaysia – where the company operates four houses – but also outside Asia , according to Yeah Lee Ching , Managing Director of ValueMax .	-4.0268

Saving Package for Tasman ’ s Health Care	-4.6474
The Australian government insists on the harsh conditions linked to the rescue package of more than $ 325 million for the Tasmanic Health Systems to ensure that the federal government cannot waste the money .	-4.4447
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take “ immediate action ” to avert a crisis caused by an ageing population of the island state , a higher rate of chronic diseases and system constraints .	-3.8946
Funding for a period of four years was decided after government consultations with the independent Tasmanian Member Andrew Wilkie .	-3.7981
“ The government has drawn up an emergency rescue package that we believe addresses the unique challenges facing the federal state , ” Mr Plibersek today said .	-12.7336
The $ 325-million package includes $ 31 million instant electoral assistance .	-3.1755
Further 2600 operations , including orthopedic interventions and treatments for grey star , are to eliminate residues .	-4.0900
In addition , there is money for daily hospitals in Hobart and Launceston , better care after residence , professional training , mental health services , and the introduction of a system for electronic recording of health data in local hospitals .	-5.4483
“ These investments correspond to the ideas that clinical staff affected me said they were the best way to improve the Tasman health system , ” said Tanya Plibersek .	-4.5924
The minister insisted on the Tasman Government 's strict reporting and accountability .	-3.1293
The federal state must retain the current level of financing to obtain money from the Commonwealth , and report monthly on where the additional money was spent .	-3.9638
A three-man Commission is being set up and is intended to ensure that the federal state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible .	-3.4031
As Wilkie said today , the $ 325 million will be of little use if “ they are not accompanied by real reforms that bring the Tasmanian public health system on a more sustainable path . ”	-4.1935
Nevertheless , he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent aid , which he first expressed to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May .	-3.3681
“ I am confident that German aid will make a major contribution to removing the federal state ’ s public health system from the worries list , ” said Wilkie .	-3.8845
According to the government of the state , these electoral payments will largely make up for the recent cuts .	-3.6222
But the Federal Opposition ’ s Health Policy Speaker , Peter Dutton , believes that today ’ s announcement is just a “ pavement . ”	-3.8989
“ We are in a position today because the Labor Government has withdrawn $ 430 million from the health system , ” he said to ABC TV .	-3.3174
It is unacceptable for a government to take nearly half a billion dollars out of the system , and for the Commonwealth to pocket 300 million and then pretend to be good news .	-5.9218
Dutton called on Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the rescue package will be spent on additional bureaucracy .	-2.7096

Syria has destroyed its ability to manufacture chemical weapons , such as a monitoring group .	-2.6707
Syria has destroyed important chemical weapons and poisonous gas munitions , explaining the global chemical weapons surveillance group on Thursday , while severe clashes have occurred in the north of the country near one of the sites where allegedly toxic substances are stored .	-4.7461
Also on Thursday , a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people had been killed soon after three years since the start of the civil war .	-3.3513
The announcement of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons ( OPCW ) arrived one day before the deadline the day before the date .	-3.6860
1 November , which the organisation established in The Hague , Damascus , set up to destroy or make “ unoperable ” all chemical weapons manufacturing facilities , including all machines for mixing chemicals to toxic gas and filling ammunition .	-5.4920
The conclusion of this process , which is basically the first stage of destruction , is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable aimed at destroying all Syrian chemical weapons by mid-2014 .	-2.8627
The destruction of facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons .	-2.1143
But Damascus must begin to destroy existing weapons and stocks .	-2.2697
According to assumptions , there are approximately 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons in the country , including senf gas and nerve gas Sarin .	-3.4556
The announcement came at a time when fighting in the city of Safira took place on Thursday , from the experts say that there is a production facility for chemical weapons and storage facilities , as the Syrian Human Rights Monitoring Centre established in the United Kingdom announced .	-5.2974
On Thursday , 120.296 people died .	-2.7125
Of these , 61,067 civilians , including 6,365 children , are civilians .	-2.3382
On the government side , 29,954 of them belonged to the army of President Bashar Assad , 18,678 are pro-government fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militias .	-2.5669
Also among the dead are 2,202 army soldiers and 5,375 opposition fighters , many of them foreigners .	-2.1012
On 25 July , the UN estimated that the number of deaths in this conflict has been 100,000 since March 2011 .	-2.1563
This number has not been updated .	-7.7058
The conflict has forced about two million people to flee the country .	-1.3202
Assad ’ s troops have been fighting for weeks in Safira against the rebels , many of which have links to al-Qaeda groups .	-2.3046
The observatory said that there were losses on both sides on Thursday , but did not mention details .	-3.0192
The fighting underlines the danger facing the chemical weapons inspectors , because their mission to liberate Syria from its toxic arms arsenal is a race against the time in the midst of a dead civil war .	-4.2690
According to OPCW , which is working closely with the United Nations , the team “ is now convinced that it has seen and destroyed all the important production and mixing / filling facilities mentioned by Syria . ”	-3.9018
Therefore , “ no further inspection activities are currently planned . ”	-2.7494
Earlier this week , the inspectors said they had completed the first round of checks and visited 21 out of 23 of the sites indicated by Damascus .	-3.4689
The inspectors said that it was impossible to visit two institutions because of security concerns .	-3.3515
On Thursday , OPWC declared that , according to Syrian , the two sites were “ abandoned ... and the existing properties of the chemical weapons program had been shifted to other named institutions that were inspected . ”	-4.6034
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two facilities that the OPCW inspectors could not visit .	-2.7432
Syria has presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons , which will have to be approved by the OPWC executive committee next month .	-2.7701
“ I salute the bravery and courage you have shown to all of you in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever carried out by this organisation , ” said Ahmed Uzumcu , the Director-General of the Supervisory Organisation , in a comment published by OPCW .	-5.6771
For three years now , the main Sunni Muslim rebels have been fighting against Assad ’ s government and their security forces , which belong to many Alawites , in this civil war , to split Shia Islam .	-4.2965
With regard to further developments , the head of the observation group Rami Abdurrahman said that on Wednesday there was a strong explosion in an air defence facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia .	-3.6877
The cause of the explosion was not known , he explained .	-2.1555
Ancient Change for Bali Bombers	-4.0736
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who died during the Bali bombing in 2002 reacted annoyed by the judgment of the last of the incipients who were tried , because Umar Patek believed that it would be shot by law .	-6.6756
Patek , who was one of the most sought-after people in Southeast Asia , was condemned yesterday for his role in building explosives for the bomb attack to a sentence of 20 years .	-4.2790
It could be laid off after 15 years with a set of roads .	-4.3058
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder because of the attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta , where 202 people died , including 88 Australians , and many others were injured .	-3.3195
There were also a number of terrorist charges , including a wave of explosives in Indonesia on Saturday evening in 2000 .	-4.4712
The Public Prosecutor had called for a lifelong prison sentence , even if it could have applied for the man who , because of his reputation as a master bomber , is also called the “ demolition man ” .	-5.7802
The decision has awakened painful memories of June Corteen , a mother from Perth , who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the devastation caused by Patek and his co-conspirators nearly ten years ago .	-4.0037
Fighting tears she said that Patek should have been sentenced to death .	-2.3130
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys .	-1.9331
“ Taking him before a shooting command , ” Corteen said to AAP .	-3.7497
Every day I have to live with no more grandchildren and I will never see my daughters .	-4.3340
The Sari Club was aligned to the ground when , on 12 October 2002 , a huge bomb exploded in a small loader , parked in front of the nightclub , shortly after 23 p.m.	-7.0682
Peter Hughes was in Paddy 's Bar , where only 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber exploded a backpack filled with explosives .	-3.0260
He entered the coma for a month after the attack , and “ died ” three times when he went to a life preservation system .	-4.4686
Hughes said that Patek deserved the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cell Jemaah Islamiah – Amrozi , Mukhlas , and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the bloodbath and executed four years ago .	-2.3723
Really , this type should be given the death penalty above all .	-3.1063
Leaving him alive – no , there is no reason to keep him alive .	-2.4796
Getting 20 years after he killed 202 people and injured many hundreds is not much .	-1.9158
Patek is the last of the Bali-Bomber who was in court .	-2.7091
He escaped almost a decade of arrest , but was finally taken up in the city of Abbottabad in Pakistan in January 2011 , where US forces killed the former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden almost four months later .	-4.0888
During the negotiations , an FBI agent said that intelligence reports had indicated that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of rebuilding the link between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda .	-3.8291
“ He did not stand up , ” Corteen said .	-2.5904
Until recently , he did not show a reward for how much suffering he caused to other people .	-4.2790
The judgment was made before the ten-year anniversary of the attack this year , which is celebrated in Bali and Australia .	-3.8573
“ There will be many tears this year , ” said Corteen .	-1.2982
Patek may appeal against his judgment .	-2.0801
FAA : Passengers can now use electronic equipment in aircraft ( but do not have mobile calls )	-3.1225
Air passengers can now use their electronic equipment for reading , working , playing , music and watching movies from departure to landing , but not using the mobile phone , according to the new guidelines issued by Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) in the US on Thursday .	-6.0967
But passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately .	-1.1947
How quickly they would be implemented depends on the respective airline , Michael Huerta told FAA employees at a press conference .	-4.7063
The airlines must prove to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new directives and that they have updated the training manuals of the airline personnel and the regulations for dumping the equipment in accordance with the new rules .	-5.4144
The FAA explained that it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic equipment in aircraft .	-3.3591
Among these airlines were Delta and JetBlue .	-1.4443
“ Depending on the state of the plan , we could approve the extended use of electronic equipment very soon , ” the FAA announced in an explanation .	-3.6929
Currently , passengers must switch off smartphones , tablets and other equipment when the aircraft doors are closed .	-3.2248
You may not start it again until the aircraft reaches a height of three kilometres and gives the captain the green light .	-3.9739
When entering the landing flight , passengers must switch them off and must not reboot before the aircraft has landed .	-11.6295
According to the new guidelines , airlines whose aircraft are protected against electronic disruptions could allow their passengers to use the equipment even at the start , landing and on the rolling field , the FAA declared .	-5.3200
Most new aircraft and other aircraft converted to larger heights for the use of Wi-Fi should meet the criteria .	-3.6932
Laura Glading , President of the professional association of flight attendants , welcomed the changes .	-3.0151
“ If the new regime is safely implemented – and we work closely with the airline on this – both sides will benefit from it , ” commented glading .	-4.0571
We are honestly sorry to feel like watchers on this issue .	-3.6870
Nevertheless , Internet connections for surfing , exchanging e-mails , text messages , or downloading data under three kilometres remained prohibited , the Authority explained .	-4.1032
Passengers are asked to move smartphones , tablets and other devices into flight mode .	-2.8587
So still no “ Words With Friends ” , the scrabble similar online game that the actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 , when he had to leave a jet of American Airlines publicly , because he refused to turn off the device while the aircraft was on the bridge .	-4.8548
And heavier equipment such as laptops must continue to be stopped , because there is a risk of injury if they fly through the cabin .	-4.2142
Mobile calls during the flight remain prohibited as well .	-3.4585
The regulatory competence for telephone calls is with the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) , not the FAA .	-2.4072
FAA may lift the ban on certain electronic equipment starting and landing .	-2.9138
Last month , Mark Rosenker said from the National Transportation Safety Board , Security Expert on CBS News , mobile phones would still be viewed as a risk .	-3.7722
“ Mobile is really a problem , not only because they could potentially cause disruption in navigation devices , but because we know from the FCC that transmission from the air can also disrupt radio stations , ” says Rosenker .	-5.3080
Last month , an industry advisory committee set up by the FAA to examine this issue recommended that the government allow for greater use of personal electronic equipment .	-4.0614
In recent years , the pressure on the FAA has increased to ease restrictions on use .	-2.6818
Critics such as the Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri believe that there are no valid security reasons for the ban .	-3.0900
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce , because the use of the equipment has become pervasive .	-3.5375
Some studies refer to the fact that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore the device 's shutdown .	-3.9227
The FAA began in 1966 to restrict the use of electronic equipment by air travellers after reports of disruptions of navigation and communication equipment by passengers who were the latest technology trend .	-5.0916
New aircraft are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft , but they are also designed and approved by the FAA so that they do not have any electronic interference .	-4.1426
Airlines have been offering Wi-Fi passengers for several years now when the airline is reached .	-4.8914
Flyers adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also more unsensitive to interferences .	-9.4353
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for greater use of electronic equipment according to the new directives , said Huerta .	-12.1698
Today ’ s electronic equipment generally produces much less radiation than previous generations .	-2.9308
E-readers , for example , only make minimal radiation when you move around .	-4.0476
However , when downloading or sending data , the transmission values are stronger .	-2.1871
Among the advocates of relaxing device use restrictions by passengers is Amazon.com.	-3.3735
In 2011 , corporate employees invited a passenger aircraft full of Kindle E readers and made a test flight to identify problems but could not find them .	-4.1235
Members of the FAA Consulting Committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using devices .	-2.9166
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said that the disruption caused by the equipment is real , even if the risk is minimal .	-3.6521
Other committee members said that there are only isolated reports from pilots who call for aircraft systems to be disturbed by the devices , and most of them are very old . and . and are and .	-13.8346
The FAA committee , however , recommended that pilots be allowed to arrange for the dismantling of the devices by passengers in the case of instrument landing under poor visibility .	-6.1255
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and described them as a reasonable adaptation for travellers , who would now be well equipped with technology .	-4.2089
“ We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience does not conflict with security , ” said Roger Dow , CEO of the U.S. Travel Association .	-2.7006
Rereleased by air rescue service from North Sea Bohr Island	-4.3452
A bird flown to the coast by air rescue service , which had been found exhausted on a North Sea drill island , was redundant in nature .	-4.9444
The water rally was flown last month with a helicopter to Aberdeen , where it was plugged by the Scottish animal welfare organization SPCA into their rescue center in Alloa .	-4.5997
Colin Seddon , head of the centre , said : “ This water rally was probably a winter migratory bird from Northern Europe , stopped by the strong wind over the North Sea . ”	-4.2808
Apparently the exhausted bird sought refuge on the drill island .	-2.7826
He added : ‘ he could not fly anymore , so we were contacted with the request for help ’ .	-4.1815
When they were released , the water rall was again fit and healthy .	-2.5671
Is Europe ’ s elite ready to do business with Britain ?	-1.8883
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy to the table and defining what those in Britain who are seeking to change prosperity and work to our relations with the EU .	-4.6377
To this end , we have commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey among British business leaders and asked them what they think about Britain , the economy , and the EU .	-12.6356
YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 senior executives from the economy , representing about the British corporate sizes , sectors , and regions .	-4.7585
The results of the survey will surprise many .	-1.7321
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now exporting outside Europe and focusing on countries that modernise and grow while the Member States in the EU are stagnating .	-3.5451
They want new trade links to countries like China , India , and Brazil from the government side to be favoured , rather than stopping with the long and hard process of reforming the obscure EU institutions .	-4.6676
The majority of economic leaders believe that control over these key competences should be retracted to Westminster on certain legal issues – from the right to product legislation .	-5.1024
There was general discontent about the internal market , because , according to companies , the costs of Brussels rules would now outweigh the benefits of being part of Europe ’ s trade zone – even 40 % of large companies agreed that they were traditionally the most pro-European .	-5.1671
Finally , and probably most of all that says , our survey of economic leaders revealed that a clear majority of Britain wants a course of change to the agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade , not on politics .	-6.2193
This realization , which finds itself among companies of all sizes and leading corporations , shows that the economy is pushing for a “ meaningful change ” that brings the title of action back to Britain .	-5.7140
Much is at stake – an amendment to the agreement and better conditions for Britain would lead to a referendum at 16 % in favour of remaining in the EU .	-5.0468
The Prime Minister should have no doubt : this survey shows that the British economy is behind his plan to renegotiate British conditions for EU membership .	-2.7321
It also shows that companies expect a renegotiation of power to shift significantly back to Britain .	-3.9333
A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary now that the eurozone is moving toward a closer economic and fiscal union .	-2.3141
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK , as the result of our survey shows , which means more attention for businesses to trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to rules .	-3.9855
Alexei Miller of Gazprom refers to pipeline in Bulgaria as the beginning of a new Gazara	-3.5241
The construction of the South-Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the start of one of the largest European energy projects , stated by the Gazprom Board .	-3.3490
“ Today ’ s event is a milestone : building work on the Bulgarian section of the South-Stream gas pipeline , the largest and most important project in Europe , has begun , ” said the Chairman of the Executive Board of Gazprom , Alexei Miller , in a statement on Thursday .	-3.3090
The project is a key element in the energy security of the entire European continent .	-1.6281
South Stream is intended to provide more diversity in Russia ’ s export routes through Europe .	-3.2176
A dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine , in which most of Russia ’ s gas is stored for Europe , raises the risk of conventional routes , as is official .	-4.5086
Miller said that the direct connection to Bulgaria , a member of the European Union , means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are “ eliminated forever . ”	-2.4931
Bulgarian consumers receive gas from South Stream at reasonable rates when the entire 2015 project is in operation .	-3.3715
According to Gazprom , construction work in other subordinate countries is expected to begin at the end of the year .	-3.9223
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic metres of natural gas .	-1.7326

Germany ’ s real estate markets benefit from economic strength and the country ’ s favourable economic conditions , which are compared to good economic conditions in Europe .	-5.7449
This is what Christian Ulbrich , CEO Europa , the Middle East and Africa of Jones LaSalle pointed out on the 9th real estate day of the stock exchange newspaper .	-3.3503
As requested by German commercial properties , the view of the volume of transactions shows Ulbrich .	-3.5715
In the first three quarters of this year , it increased by 31 % compared with the previous year 's average .	-10.0416
In Britain , the plus was only 6 % , France ’ s 19 % .	-2.3983
" Real estate investments offer an attractive interest rate , " said Ulbrich .	-1.4977

Hearing before the Royal Commission : Two YMCA staff charged with accusations of Jonathan Lord for sexual crimes	-3.1716
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales ( NSW ) have been charged with sexual crimes in relation to children before accusations have been made in 2011 against Caringbah ’ s childcare Jonathan Lord , as the Royal Commission for Sexual Abuse of Children .	-5.9824
Yet , in the opening declaration before the Commission , the YMCA stated that ‘ there has never been an incident of sexual abuse in the organisation ’ .	-4.6511
Managing director Phillip Hare was consulted on a case where a YMCA employee was charged with child pornography , and another where a sports teacher from the YMCA Caringbah Hall in 1991 had been sentenced for the abuse of familiar children .	-6.7884
Hare said to Gail Furness , a lawyer assisting the Commission , that he knew of the first case but did not know the second .	-3.0037
He acknowledged that the YMCA ’ s opening declaration to the Commission was also inaccurate in claiming that “ there were external YMCA checks in which the YMCA was recognised as the forefront in child safety . ”	-4.8217
Instead , evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA has been informed that it has received the second-most assessment of four possible in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities ( Education Ministry ) in August of the year .	-16.8587
Hare , who started with 21 at the YMCA , acknowledged that the Management Board failed to recruit Lord from me and did not ensure that employees were aware of their obligations to report infringements of child safety directives .	-5.8481
Lord was sentenced earlier this year for sexual abuse of twelve boys during his two-year activity for the YMCA .	-4.0251
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison .	-1.3332
But Hare disputed that the YMCA would have a cultural problem preventing Lord ’ s employees from reporting infringements of children ’ s safety .	-4.5415
They said they had observed infringements , including that Lord was alone with children , serving them privately as babysitters , leaving them on his boss , saying that he loved it , and that children played with his mobile phone .	-6.2356
Danielle Ockwell , whose leader was Lord , who asked for a training on child protection because she was concerned about his behaviour , said that the Child Service Leader Jacqui Barnat , who was the leader of the YMCA Caringbah , was “ very intimidating and most of the time was very unacceptable . ”	-6.2647
The Managing Director declared that he would not accept statements by employees that they would not have dared to reimburse their superiors .	-12.5570
Instead , he said , her friendship with Lord weakened her judgment , which is why they would not have reported him .	-4.4958
Hare explained that he told the YMCA NSW Board that the lesson to draw the organization from the Jonathan Lord incident “ did not affect the report ” by employees , and the Board of Directors agreed to it .	-5.7225
Hare said that the decision to urge staff to sign secrecy obligations shortly after the allegations were made was taken by the YMCA Child Services Manager Liam Whitley .	-4.3226
He said that this should prevent contamination of evidence , but that was “ overzealous ” and badly implemented .	-4.0901
The YMCA NSW , when Jonathan Lord was employed there between 2009 and 2011 , was not a safe organization for children , explained Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University , the Commission 's expert in sexual abuse .	-4.0916
He explained that there were “ serious problems ” in recruitment , review , recruitment , training , and supervision of employees .	-3.3089
The hearing was postponed until 20 December .	-0.9554
Tony Blair declared that he would seize the opportunity to return as British Prime Minister – but admits that a comeback is unlikely .	-2.9013
In an interview this evening , on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his departure from office , the 59-year-old announced his views on various domestic issues .	-3.2604
Since his resignation in June 2007 , after a decade as Head of State , Blair has largely avoided expressing his views on British politics , and his comments have mostly limited to foreign policy and his role as the envoy of the Quartet of Peace People in the Middle East .	-5.1288
On the question of whether he would like to return to the Prime Minister ’ s office , Blair was quoted by the London Evening Standard : “ Yes , safe , but it is unlikely that this will happen , so ... ”	-4.7982
When the horse shoe experts invaded Cardiff to feed the horse of the year , they knew that there was a fierce competition .	-4.8555
But no one was prepared for the three years old Fenton Kirkland .	-2.9292
The Knirps , who is not even in kindergarten and only made its first steps a few months ago , and his Shetland-Pony Toffee went loose through the three rounds and won the first prize – leaving 30 adult opponents behind .	-5.8989
The inextricable couple , both equally large , were praised for their appearance , behaviour and style during the annual competition held by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff .	-4.3366
During his appearance in competition with men and women with elegant melons , he had put his plate cap in a cheeky angle and led the two years old caffee through the ring .	-6.9112
Fenton was praised by the jurors for his natural skills in dealing with the pony , which is well above his age .	-3.9308
And Toffee received best notes for his appearance and personality .	-1.8571
Toffee had been given as a gift to his third birthday last March and since then practiced with the Shetland pony every day .	-4.3402
His mother , Donna , 30 , said , “ Fenton and Toffee are a great span . ”	-2.7141
They had to compete against the entire field of participation and went off the course with gold pocal and rosette .	-6.1496
It was only the second time that he had participated in a competition with Toffee , and we were all enthusiastic when he won .	-9.9123
Fully strangers in the arena considered him so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him .	-3.6874
The young boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale , South Wales , follows in the footsteps of his Tante Sharon Howels , who has been showing horses for over ten years .	-4.6316
Howell said : “ The whole audience was like electricity and everyone has fired and lamented it . ”	-11.3933
He ran on sand the whole length of the arena and although he looked so tiny , he has done fantastic work .	-3.3760
Fenton is crazy for animals – he loves horses , tractors , and farms and has two chickens he takes care of .	-2.9743
As he has started , it will not take long before he is on the “ Horse of the Year ” show – and I am sure he will do well .	-4.1302
An annual horse show spokesman said , “ Fenton is only three , but he knows how to deal with his pony . ”	-3.0778
Together they are a great team .	-1.0131
The jurors evaluated Fenton and Toffee as to how well they had beaten and presented themselves in the presentation ring .	-5.3107
They pay attention to good cooperation between pony and leader – and Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring .	-4.0774
I am sure that Fenton ’ s sweet clothing has contributed its part , that really fits perfectly for the occasion .	-4.8328
China ’ s newspaper is to be “ reformed . ”	-2.5648
A Chinese newspaper that called on the front page for the release of a reporter charged for defamation should be reformed , explained a press regulator .	-4.1609
The New Express , based in Guangzhou , had printed a rare public call to release the journalist Chen Yongzhou .	-2.7150
But Chen later admitted on television that he had taken bribes to falsify reports of a part-state company .	-4.0563
Now the New Express is subjected to “ comprehensive rectification , ” the regulator said .	-2.4199
The “ Rectification Order ” was issued by the Authority for Press and Publications , Radio , Film and Television in Guangdong .	-2.2696
Preliminary investigation showed that the New Express , which belongs to the Yangcheng Evening News Group , published several inaccurate reports on the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013 .	-9.7576
“ The New Express ’ s editorial management was disordered , ” the regulator announced in a statement .	-2.7066
She said that it was decided to “ impose an administrative penalty for Chen Yongzhou and withdraw his reporting licence . ”	-3.7680
In addition , “ the Yangcheng Evening News Group has been instructed to complete the rectification of the New Express and recommended that the relevant New Express officials be identified and reviewed immediately the New Express leadership team . ”	-5.2060
Chen had written several articles for the New Express , reporting on alleged financial irregularities with a manufacturer of construction machines called Zoomlion .	-3.6693
After he was arrested , the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and behind his journalistic work .	-3.8969
But then Chen appeared on state television and admitted that he published false reports against payment .	-3.3837
“ In this case , I damaged Zoollion , as well as the entire news industry , and its ability to gain public confidence , ” he explained to the state news channel CCTV .	-4.7339
I did so primarily because I was on money and glory .	-2.7926
I realise that I was wrong .	-2.7444
Following Chen ’ s apology , the New Express published an apology on the front page and declared that it failed to verify the reports correctly . . and and . and and .	-12.6741
Various known suspects have recently held confessions on television .	-2.3275
Experts say that confessions are still routinely imposed , despite a legislative amendment earlier this year , in which the authorities were banned , to force someone to accuse themselves .	-3.5949
Discover Drug Tunnel with its own Railway between the US and Mexico	-2.6281
One of the most refined tunnels for drug smuggling between the USA and Mexico , fully equipped with lighting , ventilation and electric railway operation , has now been discovered .	-3.3406
The US authorities described the 120 times 90 centimetre tunnels as one of the most sophisticated passages they ever found .	-3.4242
The tunnel , which runs in zigzag pattern over a length of just six football fields , connects warehouses near Tijuana , Mexico , and San Diego , USA .	-3.6296
There are countless inconceivable warehouses in the area , which makes it easier to hide lorries loaded with drugs .	-10.8498
The tunnel was closed before drugs could be unrecognized , the authorities declared it .	-2.6151
When the tunnel was discovered , eighteen and a half tonnes of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were secured , according to the records of the court .	-4.2323
Three men who , according to the authorities , worked as drivers were accused of owning and selling Marihuana and Cocaine .	-3.5056
They face prison sentences for life between ten years and ten years .	-4.2495
In Nogales , Arizona , smugglers rely on a broad underground network of drainage channels .	-2.5078
The tunnel is the eighth large passage discovered in San Diego since 2006 .	-1.6016
Some of the biggest tunnels were discovered after the marijuana harvest in Central Mexico in October , which poses a challenge for drug cartels to quickly bring their product to consumers .	-4.1184
In 2010 , authorities found a narrow 640 metre long passage with rails that ran from a kitchen in a residential house in Tijuana to two storage houses in San Diego .	-4.9658
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love .	-1.6711
Actors Orlando Bloom and Model Miranda Kerr want to go separate ways in the future .	-1.5653
In an interview , however , Bloom said that he and Kerr still love .	-1.7666
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents of the two-year flynn .	-1.4655
Actor Orlando Bloom spoke about the separation of his wife , Topmodel Miranda Kerr .	-2.2869
In an interview with US journalist Katie Couric , which should be broadcast on Friday ( local time ) , Bloom said , " life is sometimes not exactly what we are planning or hoping for " .	-3.9944
Kerr and he still loved himself , emphasized the 36-year-old .	-2.7745
" We will support each other and love as parents of Flynn " .	-2.4807
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010 , and in 2011 they were born Flynn .	-2.4594
Veganism , according to Lexika , is different from vegetarianism , but it is quite different from that .	-4.1428
Because while vegetarians allow the consumption of cream , ice or a powerful Edam , these bad vegans are not on a vegan 's menu .	-7.0218
Milk , cheese , eggs , besides the renunciation of meat and fish , the vegan abandons all the consumption of animal products - honey is also denied .	-4.2466
What remains , one might ask , but the vegan diet is characterized by a remarkable ingenuity .	-5.2577
" Bread spreads are very popular " , explains Ute Henkelmann , the owner of the local reforming house , which provides a variety of special products for vegans .	-4.8013
Reuben Proctor is also happy to visit the shop at the Domgasse .	-2.9252
For 13 years the native New Zealand has lived vegan , in Lampertheim he finds ( almost ) everything he needs to live .	-14.6034
At the turn of the century , the next step took place and I became Veganer .	-2.4844
" The conviction came not only because of nutrition , but because of the choice of footwear " , says Proctor , who prefers artistic leather to normal leather .	-5.2241
He recognized that other everyday concerns are not included in animal products .	-6.1402
Most importantly , vegan is an ethics .	-2.2549
" I do not want animals to die for me " , Proctor speaks the maxim of vegans that extend to the entire consumption behavior .	-4.1648
Instead of mourning back burgers , stirrers or rubber bears , the vegan quickly discovered new products that grew enthusiasm .	-4.5494
" It is a double bonus " , says Proctor today , " actually vegan does not represent a waiver , no asceses , but an enrichment " .	-5.8324
And it is precisely these conditions that have led some even more well-intentioned attempts to fail .	-4.5918
" The addiction factor is a decisive factor that leaves many quick to give up , similar to smoking , " Proctor sets a comparison .	-5.1858
And applies : ' certain tastes are not to be found on the animal ' .	-4.5720
Often it is the spices or the type of preparation that make up the taste . with , , , , , , , and and . and . and . and	-9.5073
" You can also create the same effect in other ways , " explains the vegan .	-3.3705
Proctor brings aubergins , champignons and also some vegan spices to a barbecue festival .	-11.5513
He pays attention to a balanced , varied diet , where he should taste it very often .	-6.3730
Of course , you want to have something between the teeth , that is legitimate .	-3.0838
" It 's to taste , but that 's not just to reduce it to animal food , " Proctor says .	-10.1089
Health damage to eating disorders , another widespread assumption , he did not suffer .	-3.0907
For me , the changeover had a positive aspect .	-3.1367
I do not take a foreign cholesterol and I have an increased vitamin share .	-3.7363
There are high-performance athletes who eat vegan only .	-2.8305
" My blood values are best , I 'm often checking , " betrays Proctor .	-9.2926
Many vegansim critics warn , especially in the absence of vitamin B12 .	-3.6706
" Since animals are fed with feedingstuffs instead of grazing on pasture , it is questionable whether in the meat that you buy in the fridges , the vitamin B12 is high , " Proctor finds .	-5.6279
Vegans can also take the coenzyme in the form of tablets .	-3.5693
" My B12 values are fine , " he explains .	-1.9178
Food proctor should not go far .	-4.1647
After all , basic foodstuffs exist everywhere and every supermarket now has soyamil and other products .	-4.0618
I find everything I need locally .	-2.5329
Only from time to time I buy something special .	-1.8808
" Many people overlook the fact that only the finished products are expensive , but this is the way " ordinary " finished products are known to be " .	-4.4302
Without it , the preparation of vegan courts would be far cheaper and less time consuming than is commonly thought .	-4.3565
" There is much to discover in the house kitchen , with a few small cranes you can achieve good if not partially better results , " says Proctor .	-4.5666
Margarine instead of butter , a little more backpowder and carbon acid instead of eggs , with his vegan cheese cake , Proctor could also bring his swingers to the amazement .	-5.7789
Family festivals give the vegan a new spice .	-2.7922
This has a new role to play in cooking together .	-3.5744
" The situations that can arise are as different as the people themselves , " says Proctor .	-2.7419
He was , of course , already skeptical .	-3.1877
Do you no longer taste my meal ?	-1.6586
" Should I feel bad now , because I drink milk ? " - with such questions you have to act as a vegan with sensitivity .	-4.8337
" I do not reject people , I am a part of this society , " Proctor does not want to de-enclave .	-4.6459
And , more precisely , the everyday world does not seem as vegan as suspected - and the vegan does not seem to be as restricted as it is commonly assumed in every.	-6.3896
Also fast food is allowed .	-1.1480
Pommes exist everywhere !	-1.8479
" Many drone shops offer falafel , or just a vegetarian yuffka " , says Proctor .	-3.5364
In a pizzeria , it leaves out on pasta dishes , or orders a pizza without cheese , all a question of habit .	-4.8219
The restaurants are so slowly looking for it .	-3.4191
" When I started to eat me vegan 13 years ago , everything was much more difficult , " the New Zealand can find a development : " You have to talk to people , draw them to them " .	-5.1776
" If there are enough requests , they may be inclined to add the menu , " he hopes .	-3.8847
Vegane restaurants are evolving , such as the combustion buses in Mannheim or the Café Vogelfrei .	-13.8645
Proctor wishes that other restaurants at least have a vegan meal on the menu .	-3.8102
Basically , vegan dishes are available for all .	-2.8277
Everyone can eat them , so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive food .	-2.6562
" Meat courts are exclusive , in the truest sense of the word , because they exclude others " , Proctor notes .	-3.6438
" If we want to avoid food scandals , veganism is a safe way to make the most of the time impossible , " says Proctor .	-4.0038
But buying vegan products could be somewhat difficult at the beginning .	-3.3927
Especially if you learn to understand that animal additives can also contain in earth nuts as colour donors , you seem to be leaving the courage quickly with respect to ethics with so many hurdles and traps .	-7.2905
Not only for this reason , Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen have written a book : " Veganissimo - animal ingredients and their alternatives " explains the many ingredients that are supplied with food and cleaning products .	-4.0209
" Gradually one develops a scanner view and knows which characters and logos one has to pay attention to " It is sometimes better to do small steps than stumble or stumble " , Proctor knows .	-5.3610
Veganism , it is an important moral pointer that beats awareness .	-3.2271
Perhaps it does not entirely manage to put off its habits , but at least it can teach consumers to critically examine their habits .	-5.1643
Nasdaq OMX stock exchange operator keeps its customers breathing .	-3.1789
Trade on the Nasdaq Options Market was interrupted on Friday afternoon of German time .	-2.5593
In a communication the operator was responsible for technical problems .	-2.1536
The other eleven US option markets , including two of the Nasdaq OMX , continued their business unhindered .	-2.1455
The latest incident continues a whole series of smaller and larger pans with the stock market operator .	-4.3655
Only on Tuesday the Nasdaq indices were not calculated for an hour due to errors in data transport .	-3.4908
In August this year alone , there were two mistakes .	-2.8300
First , the US Investment Bank Goldman Sachs sent massive buying orders to the option markets because of technical problems .	-3.3683
As a result , stock market operators needed almost a whole day to watch and delete the orders .	-3.9716
Two days afterwards , half of total stock trading in the United States stopped for several hours due to a computer panel on the Nasdaq st.	-4.6861
Last year Facebook stock exchange was also promoted .	-6.0663
The Nasdaq systems had not grown the tide of purchasing and selling contracts , and later the SEC regulator detected and donated the company to a record fine of $ 10 million .	-6.6680
Constance : Cyclists drive 63 year-olds	-2.7230
According to the police , the accident occurred when a 26-year-old man on Thursday evening , at 22 p.m. , was on the left track from the station to the market place .	-6.1593
When a 63-year-old man suddenly came to the wall from a local , the bicycle driver , according to the police , could not slow down in time .	-6.2996
In the following collision , the pedestrian was pushed against the house wall , went further to the ground and raised a roughly 15 centimetre long headwinds .	-6.4206
A rescue team brought the injured to the clinic for medical treatment .	-2.4718
British police are placing Assange on an extradition certificate	-2.7378
The British police have today issued an extradition certificate to WikiLeaks founder , Julian Assange , who sought refuge and requested asylum at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London .	-3.5499
Scotland Yard declared that 40 years old Australians had been given a “ invitation to stand up ” that called on him to appear in a police guard , and added , if he failed to comply , threatening to arrest him .	-6.8568
Assange threatens extradition to Sweden because of the prosecution in a sexual offence , having exhausted its possibilities under British law , since the Supreme Court rejected his objection to extradition earlier this month .	-4.9067
As he fears that Stockholm will deliver him to the US , he sought refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on 19 June and asked the South American country for political asylum .	-3.6311
Scotland Yard has “ sent a 40 year old man a call to stand at a police guard at a time we have chosen , ” a speaker said .	-5.0462
He continues to violate the terms of his release for bail .	-1.9042
The message did not comment on the delivery of the police invitation .	-2.5703
Assange fears that he is being delivered to the United States from Sweden and charged with being accused of spy charges after publishing more than 250,000 diplomatic messages on the WikiLeaks revelation website .	-5.2383
Driver straight between legs with 210 km / h and hot drink receives 1,000 <unk> punishment .	-3.6626

Andrew How , 35 , from Tiptree , Essex , was stopped on May 27 with his Mercedes Benz on the A120 near Braintree .	-2.9048
After stopping him , the police discovered the beverage cup between his legs .	-2.9235
In front of the Colchester Court , Hohow was guilty without having to take due care and attention .	-5.7252
He received seven points and a six-month ban on driving .	-2.1262
It has also been condemned to pay 90 <unk> and a 100 <unk> victim surcharge .	-5.2648
Tax for foreign real estate owners against London ’ s speculation bubble	-1.8147
The Treasury has regularly calculated the CGT measure , but it is still waiting for the final decision of Chancellor George Osborne , who had imposed a 7 % stamp tax on housing in the 2012 budget , which cost more than two million pounds , and annual fees for buyers , housing as a company and not as individuals .	-5.8183
Already , revenues from the stamp tax on residential property in the Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea districts , which in the 2012 / 13 fiscal year exceeded GBP 708 million , earnings for Northern Ireland , Wales , Scotland , the Northeast , North-West , Yorkshire , and the Humber region .	-5.1344
Cook said : “ After the stamp tax increases on high-price housing and the introduction of the associated legislation against bypassing , one can hardly say that high quality real estate is too low taxed , regardless of the impact of the outdated community tax system . ”	-5.7804
“ But this move could make some foreign investors more cautious in purchasing property in London , or discourage owners from selling it , ” he added .	-3.3071
First-class real estate – the top five to ten % of the housing market by price – in the wealthy south-west belt of London , covering from Fulham to Wimbledon , has expanded by the record value of 1.8 % last year .	-5.1376
The prices in Central London have risen to an even annual growth of 5.6 % , but have been overshadowed by an emerging “ domestic market , ” in which the south-western part of the city , the north ( 7.4 % ) , and the east ( 6.5 % ) experienced an upward trend , such as an investigation of Savilles .	-5.4543
Scientists could shed more light on the connection of a dog ’ s tail ’ s mood .	-4.6635
Previous research had shown that happy dogs with the tail went more to the right ( from the point of view of the dog ) , while it was the left side of nervous dogs .	-4.2389
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive and respond to these subtle differences .	-2.2721
Professor Georgio Vallortigara , a neuroscientist at the University of Trento , said : “ In man , it is well known that the left and right brain half respond differently to stimuli that generate positive or negative emotions . ”	-4.2441
Here we tried to look at other species .	-2.6693
He also noted that in dogs , as in humans , the right brain half is responsible for the movement of the left side and vice versa , and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the feelings .	-4.8363
To learn more about how dogs respond to the lateral tail swapping of their artists , researchers monitored the animals while these movies looked at other dogs .	-5.3992
They measure the heart rate of the pets and analyzed the behavior .	-2.8267
Probably , we will soon understand why the tail is moving in one direction , sometimes in the other .	-4.2283
Professor Vallarorigara said : “ We have shown dog films with dogs – either a natural version or a silhouette to eliminate divergent other aspects , and we have managed the movement of the tail more to the left or right . ”	-4.6218
When the animals saw how an otherwise impossible dog moved the tail to the right ( seen from the perspective of the changing dog ) , they remained completely relaxed .	-3.9541
But if the tail was mainly to the left ( again from the perspective of the dog that wears ) , their heart rate rose and they looked quite disturbing .	-6.7646
According to Professor Vallarigara , dogs do not intentionally communicate with each other through these movements .	-3.5377
Instead , he is convinced that the dogs would have learned from experience in which movements they should be concerned about and when .	-4.3668
He said : “ If you have different encounters with other dogs and weather is linked to the tail in one direction rather with friendly behavior , and the right side rather produces less friendly behavior , then you react on the basis of these experiences . ”	-5.7852
Researchers say that the findings of dog owners , veterinarians and trainers could provide a better understanding of the emotions of their animals .	-3.5808
John Bradshaw , an expert on dog preservation and guest grants at the University of Bristol Faculty of Animal Culture , stated that this was not the first study to investigate whether left and right is important to dogs .	-6.0508
Last year , a team of the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their head to the left when they look at an aggressive dog , and to the right when it is a satisfied dog .	-4.0226
In another research at the University of Victoria in Canada , “ Dogs tend to go on a robot dog if they are wearing tail on the left and not on the right , rather than being troubled – exactly the other way around than in the Italian study . ”	-6.5040
According to his statement , the differences may stem from the fact that the dogs in the various studies did not interpret animals in the films or robot dogs as dogs .	-4.3426
A study on how dogs respond to real dogs could help , he explained .	-1.6506
“ While there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two brains are used for different purposes , many of the details still need to be determined – and dogs are no exception , ” Bradshaw said .	-3.6531
But as their behavior is simply recorded , it will probably not take long to understand why the tail is sometimes moving in one direction , sometimes in the other direction .	-4.6736
Arctic Monkeys Move Performance in Glasgow Due to Alex Turners Disease	-4.1867
The rock band Arctic Monkeys has moved an appearance in Glasgow after their lead singer is ill with throat inflammation .	-4.7185
The band from Sheffield was supposed to play at the Hydro on Friday .	-2.4793
Due to the illness of the leader Alex Turner , the concert must now be moved .	-3.5110
The announcement of the band came after she had already postponed a performance at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday .	-3.6212
In a statement on their official website , Arctic Monkeys announced : “ After the decision to cancel the show at the LG Arena in Birmingham this evening , and at medical advice , Arctic Monkeys must also cancel the show at Hydro in Glasgow on Friday 1 November . ”	-4.2806
“ At Alex Turner a warhead inflammation was diagnosed , which is why he cannot occur . ”	-4.3832

Pope Francis appoints first cardinals in February	-1.2503
On 22 February , Pope Francis will first invoke new cardinals of the Catholic Church , as announced by the Vatican on Thursday .	-12.4514
Cardinals are the highest clerics in the Catholic Church after the Pope , and they are also the ones who choose a Pope , so that Francis will appoint the first group of men who will ultimately participate in the election of his successor .	-11.3852
There are currently 201 cardinals .	-0.8125
However , a cardinal that reached an age of 80 can no longer participate in the Pope ’ s election – a group of 120 “ eligible cardinals . ”	-4.4150
In a statement in which the message was announced , Father Federico Lombardi , a Vatican spokesman , said that there will be a meeting of all cardinals before the ceremony was held to appoint the new cardinals , also known as the Consistorium .	-4.4489
“ Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision to convene the Consisterium in February in advance , so that other meetings that require cardinal participation from around the world can be planned , ” said Lombardi .	-10.2263
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of cardinals eligible for election would probably have fallen by February .	-2.5868
He explained that a Pope normally appoint as many cardinals as necessary , so that the number of cardinals eligible for election is 120 , and as many cardinals as he wants .	-4.5165
Next year , the Consisterium was important because it was the first since the election of Francis in March of this year , Valero said .	-4.5366
There is now a certain overhang on the part of Europe , and Italy in particular .	-2.6883
“ It will be interesting to see if the new Pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore the balance , ” he said .	-2.2705
Forty per cent of the Catholics live in South America , but they have only a tiny number of cardinals .	-2.3681
The cardinals will also be the first to be called since the formation of the Cardinal Council of Francis , a group of eight cardinals from all over the world who have the task of finding ways of reforming the Church .	-3.9947
In the past , the Pope decided everything alone .	-1.2961
“ Now Francis chose these eight cardinals to help him , ” said Valero .	-1.9855
He explained that it is “ good ” that Francis would ask for advice on the cardinals .	-4.3892
But , to date , we have not been able to do so – this is all very new .	-4.2740
Valero said that typically bishops from large places would call cardinals , but Francis is stuck with “ surprises – we do not know who he appoints . ”	-5.0204
GM is calling back new Pickup Trucks in the US to repair the US Seat Ban .	-3.9863
General Motors call almost 19,000 of his brand new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra Pickup Trucks with construction year 2014 to resolve a problem with the manually adjustable seat length , such as a communication from the US Authority for Vehicle Safety on Friday .	-5.4682
There may be a defect in the mechanism for relocating the front seat lean on some of the car. the the and the the the the . the and the .	-12.7932
For this reason , they do not comply with the German vehicle safety guidelines for headrests .	-3.8735
“ When the car is driven from the back , it is possible that the head restraint does not properly protect the inmates so that there is an increased risk of injury , ” the message was read on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ( NHTSA ) website .	-5.5848
The recalled models were made between 1 August and 10 September .	-2.3932
The delivery of GM trucks started in June and represents the most important model launch of the leading US car manufacturer since the insolvency restructuring in 2009 .	-4.0301
GM informed vehicle owners about the defect in the first half of October .	-2.8824
Due to the 16-day government shutdown , NHTSA could not check the notification letter , which had a negative impact on car purchases in October .	-4.2519

An Obama voter ’ s desperate cry	-2.1439
I have elected President Obama twice in the hope that change is possible .	-1.4795
He says Obama has made laudable efforts that the Republicans ’ blockade tactics have thwarted .	-3.9089
Blockade Policy does not excuse Obamacare ’ s website problems , drone attacks .	-3.5411
Obama ’ s memoirs about the 2008 election campaign were a sad reminder of what could have been done .	-2.6797
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second year student at the Harvard Medical School .	-1.8837
I am currently reading a terribly sad book .	-1.6207
It is a book that I believed would raise and give me hope during the stubborn second year of my medical studies .	-5.3281
It is called “ The Audacity to Win ” ( courage to win ) and describes the memoirs of Barack Obama as presidential election in 2008 .	-3.6800
When I finish my patient letters in the evening and go to bed , the book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions and could rob a speech .	-4.8403
The election became a landslide victory and news spokesperson to show the historic significance of this hour .	-4.0635
My classmates wept with joy and my parents collected all the newspapers they could find .	-2.6654
A young team of visionaries was on the way to the White House and the nation was ready for change .	-1.8982
When Obama took office in 2008 , he had 82 % assent .	-3.2167
And then I finish the book .	-1.4558
Switching back to the present is a malicious awakening as if you are swept away from a dream .	-4.0258
It is hard to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague memory , a sad reminder of missed possibilities .	-2.4026
In the years since I first voted , something has actually changed .	-3.0910
But it is simply not what I could have imagined .	-1.9123
I acknowledge the great and versatile things that Obama has achieved , from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for Health Insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq , the end of the forced silence of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden .	-3.5861
I agree that the party political blockade tactics have tipped too many efforts to bring our nation forward : immigration reform , a public health insurance option , and the closure of Guantanamo Bay , to name but a few .	-4.6701
But after countless defending the Obama administration to colleagues and acquaintances , I have ended up with my attempts to explain it .	-4.7331
I have reached a point of political despair .	-1.3000
Republican blockade policy cannot explain why foreign leaders are allowed to intercept or the killing of innocent children by drones overseas .	-2.8123
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data on American private life and why whistleblowers are punished to disclose government misconduct .	-3.2068
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki , an American citizen , was murdered without trial , and that is why public financing and spending limits will be circumvented during the presidential elections .	-5.8000
It does not justify the results of a report stating that the White House ’ s efforts to restore the media are the “ most aggressive ... since the Nixon government . ”	-3.3393
And recently , it cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website in more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act .	-2.4637
I do not know if that is what I should have expected .	-1.6856
Whether I should have understood by 18 that government work could contradict the political campaigns that preceded it .	-3.7890
Obviously , the Office of Deputies is not a predictable course , as an opposition party and accidental events such as the Newtown massacre shape public debate .	-4.3761
But looking at the above examples , they seem to be largely elected by the government itself .	-2.8986
And that bothers me most .	-1.5046
I voted Obama again in 2012 , not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy .	-2.0234
Mitt Romney was a confusing and unbalanced alternative , but he did not seem to be able to determine his direction and positions .	-4.2248
I had the impression that a second term for Obama , freely from the pressure of future elections , would fulfil the hope of which we have heard for so long .	-10.1509
But , with Obama ’ s degree of assent at below 45 % this week , the book ’ s return to 2008 has become even harder .	-6.0642
It awakens in me the desire for the many promises that have dissolved into air .	-4.0940
This week , I read a section in the book describing how Obama had to engage in a serious loss of Clinton in the preliminary elections in Pennsylvania .	-3.7726
In a meeting with the electoral workers after the decision , he told his employees that they should come back on track and follow the purpose of their business .	-4.9004

Clive Palmer claims that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has had a parental leave dispute .	-2.6997
The billionaire and honourable Member Clive Palmer says that Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in a conflict of interest in his parental leave plans , because his daughters may become pregnant and thus benefit .	-3.4801
The mining magnate , which is in a judicial battle over the payment of $ 6 million in CO2 tax , stated that when he wanted to break questions from the table whether he was in a conflict .	-6.1152
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate , which are important for deciding whether the CO2 and mining taxes will be cancelled or reduced .	-3.6056
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and that Abbott ’ s daughters would personally benefit from the law .	-2.5455
“ He is in a great conflict of interests when it comes to paid parental leave , because if one of his daughters becomes pregnant , he has a direct interest in whether or not to get a holiday , ” said Palmer .	-4.3688

Palmer also criticized the use of pencils when marking the ballot papers .	-2.6820
Is it used because you can wipe out the results if you don 't like it ?	-3.9518

RBS suspends two foreign exchange traders	-2.2961
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange department , so two people who are familiar with the situation ; this is another indication that global regulatory investigation into alleged manipulations in the currency market is rapidly taking off .	-5.1684
Some of the world ’ s largest banks , including UBS , Barclays , Deutsche Bank , and RBS , confirmed that they are working with the authorities to investigate the world ’ s largest financial market , where $ 5.3 trillion of owners change daily .	-3.9364
The two traders would be the first RBS staff to be suspended in the expanding investigation that entails the Libor interbank scandal .	-18.7024
The Bank , which did not comment on suspensions , confirmed this month that it had received information requests from authorities .	-2.4364
“ Our investigations on this subject go further and we cooperate fully with the FCA and other regulators , ” said the Bank two weeks ago .	-3.0042
Last month , people close to the situation indicated that the RBS forwarded the records of e-mails and instant messages sent by and to a former merchant to the UK Supervisory Authority , the Financial Conduct Authority .	-4.6089
This dealer , Richard Usher , had left the RBS 2010 and is now to have been assessed by his current position as European Head of Forex Spot Trade at JPMorgan .	-4.4839
Rohan Ramchandani , head of the European spot trading at Citi , was assessed this week and Matt Gardiner , former senior currency dealer at Barclays and UBS , was suspended this week at Standard Chartered .	-3.9955
None of these dealers have been accused of any misconduct .	-2.5632
Bankers at Barclays and the Citigroup belonged to the Instant Message Group of Usher , saying that the situation was close to the people . banwere banand . and and . and and .	-11.5735
UBS announced this week that it took steps against some of its employees after the Swiss regulatory authority Finma declared that it was investigating a suspected manipulation of the foreign exchange market in a number of Swiss banks .	-4.3044
At least six authorities worldwide – the European Commission , Finma , the Swiss Competition Authority Weko , the FCA , the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently dealing with allegations that bankers should have agreed on monetary transactions .	-4.4719
HSBC , Citigroup , JPMorgan and Credit Suisse also launched internal investigations or received information requests from authorities , said people familiar with the situation .	-2.8001
Banks embrace instant messages and e-mails from several years in search of cases of misconduct .	-3.7439
News about these investigations has put traders in turmoil in an area that has been one of the most profitable of the trading units of investment banks in recent years , but this year was under pressure because low volatility in currencies restricts speculators ’ chances .	-5.6508
Some bankers have tried to downplay the affair and said that it is almost impossible to manipulate the extended and highly liquid foreign exchange market , but leading vendors believe that this is not necessarily true .	-4.1443
A leading trader noted that , despite the enormous daily volume of foreign exchange trading , fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use of its own internal platforms by banks leads to “ the market can already be influenced by very low ticket prices . ”	-5.6202
The news came out on the same day when Credit Suisse announced that she cancelled a trader of her London Exchange Traded Funds office this week after he lost almost $ 6 million at the end of last year .	-4.2506
The Bank informed the relevant authorities promptly and cooperates with them .	-2.0094

Painting the Baufense on the Bechtle-Plot	-3.6787
A group of citizens ' initiative " Swiss Wiese " has embellished the building fence on the Bechtle plot on the spa promenade in Bad Herrenalb .	-4.1511
In addition , it cleaned and widened the foot , it says in a press release .	-4.3217
The planned coverage of the dismantling house in the rear part of the property was not permitted for security reasons , because the terrain threatens to slide down .	-5.0435
Alfred Abel , who currently manages the plot , had denied the beautiful action with his colleague Reinhard Domke from the BI .	-4.2572
Before the BI 's action , there was a transparency with the message ' We were in favour ' .	-3.4389
But that did not bother the approximately 20 members of the Citizens ' Initiative in its action .	-3.4914
Her motto on the big poster was " We are against Bauruinen " .	-2.8711
It wanted to point out the danger of even bigger ruins on the Swiss meadow - the giant project should one day fail .	-5.2130
In conversation with many passers-by before the " construction site " , it became clear that some citizens believe that the realization of the urban project will be much better , although few have the same questions to the dimension of the project presented as the BI .	-6.2494
But they are starting to resign because the city continues to delay these answers , it is said by the BI .	-3.9836
As we heard , the public statements of the Mayor also have an impact .	-4.0412
In May , the municipal meeting said that he feared the loss of the thermal bath , if the citizens decide to vote against the plans for a spa and wellness complex on the Swiss meadow .	-5.8267
Some therefore seem rather frightened , while others perceive them as " plumbing blackmail " to the population , as the BI press release continues .	-6.8477
The BI thanked the donors for the color and all helpers .	-2.0620
Shiris ’ s Rangnick King	-3.4918
As satisfied Ralf Rangnick is with the current high form of Federal League table leader Red Bull Salzburg , the sport director of the " Bullen " was disappointed by the referees .	-4.7969
" There is a dangerous trend that Mane and Alan are being pushed into the category of Schwabenkönige " , he took the two offensive bullets at a press conference in Salzburg on Thursday .	-4.4875
Recent reason for Rangnick ’ s critique was Yellow for Mane at 3 : 0 against Val Gardena last Sunday , when Senegalese became an alleged actress - which , of course , was not , as the television pictures showed . .	-16.8281
Rangnick , who referred to arbitrator Harkam as " totally overwhelmed " , said that a crass misdecision .	-7.4724
Harkam would also have contributed " his part " to the escalation between Salzburg-Coach Roger Schmidt and Val Trainer Adi Hütter after the game .	-3.3218
He defended his German compatriot : " I would have done the same in every single situation as Roger Schmidt " .	-4.0615
Schmidt himself wants to have had no contact with his colleague after the skirmish .	-3.3093
I would not know why .	-1.3418
" I am the offender , " said the 46-year-old .	-3.4512
But , given the course of success , Rangnick agreed to praise .	-3.8957
" There are only two words for this : good , " he said .	-3.9930
There is not much to suspend .	-1.7644
Especially the way the team plays is impressive .	-2.2223
That is to go on calmly .	-3.3305
Changes in the winter transfer time will hardly exist .	-4.6598
There are no great reasons to change anything .	-1.7679

Supreme Court confirms Obama ’ s Health Act	-1.1604
It is a great victory for the Obama administration : the US Supreme Court today decided that the health law closely linked to Barack Obama is constitutional .	-2.8339
With five to four votes , the judges judged that the individual mandate of the patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – it forces US citizens to take health insurance or pay a penalty by 2014 – is constitutional under the state ’ s tax authority .	-4.2029
The chief judge , John Robert , proposed to the side of the four more liberal members of the Chamber , while judges Scalia , Thomas , Alito , and Kennedy decided against it .	-4.3434
The Court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 2700 pages law , and also took the view that the prescription of the Health Act , according to which states would either have to extend the conditions of access to Medicaid or otherwise remove all state funding , would not be unconstitutional .	-6.7459
The proceedings against the law had been pushed by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business .	-2.7352
The law was firmly rejected by all Republican presidential candidates , including the ultimate challenge in Mitt Romney , in the pre-election campaign in 2012 .	-3.4887
Norway : Norwegian Place Lights Giant Mirrors	-3.1501
With huge mirrors , the inhabitants of a Norwegian village have brought light to their dark valley .	-2.9975
Due to the low degree of sunshine , the Rjukan , situated in the Vestfjord valley , is usually sinked in the shadow of the surrounding mountains from autumn to spring .	-5.4949
Three gigantic reflectors at 45 metres above sea level became a century space on Wednesday .	-4.3695

Some valleys got suitable for sun chairs , while others set sunglasses for safety .	-12.1921
Until now , sun-hungry people had to go to a nearby peak in winter with a cable car .	-3.2956

Post Empty Little Still Sunday	-8.0809
" Many citizens will not have noticed that the red points for Sunday clearance are still at various core city post boxes and districts , but read the small print on the yellow containers of Post AG , it is quickly discovered that Sunday and public holidays no longer take place " , the FDP states .	-7.7865
A request from the FDP confirmed this .	-1.8619
On Sundays and public holidays only in front of the post building in Ernst-Ludwig Street 36 and in Jakob-Müller-Stra<unk>e 1 in Hüttenfeld . the and .	-9.3270
Whether in Hofheim and Rosengarten will also be leaked Sunday will not be answered in the answer to the FDP request .	-4.6584
The FDP spokesperson for social and youth politics , Fritz Röhrenbeck , wants to reflect on this .	-5.0969
Sunday cleaning is an important postal service , especially at the time of appointment .	-3.6721
" This , despite the increase in the price of letters on January 2013 , thinks radically and unreasonably ' .	-3.5582
Thomas Bittner , the Liberal Group Chairman and Citizens ' Union , supports his group colleagues : ' What I am annoyed is the fact that the spatial periods are being changed or also cancelled here ' .	-7.8758
The post office is miles away from the hotel .	-3.3571
" At least the letter boxes in the Neuschlo<unk> and Rosengarten districts need to be cleaned again on Sundays " , says Bittner and tube beck unisono .	-5.2758
Also , the core town would have to be pressed , especially unmobile fellow citizens would have to be able to reach a mailbox with Sunday cleaning .	-9.3421
Röhrenbeck asked the town council whether the town administration plans to discuss this matter with the post office .	-5.3072
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the post did not communicate with Lampertheim .	-1.3947
His knowledge , however , is that there is also a Sunday empin Hofheim .	-4.3744

Frankfurt ’ s Parking Fees are to rise forcefully .	-4.4404
Parking in Frankfurt could become more expensive soon .	-2.1804
This morning , the city 's magistrat advises on a submission of traffic decorators Stefan Majer ( Green ) .	-4.4172
Parking fees will therefore be increased by 50 % .	-2.5961
For this purpose , however , it is not intended to increase prices , but to reduce the time interval of car clocks and parking ticket machines from 30 to 20 minutes .	-5.8376
In December , the City Regulations Assembly will have to decide .	-2.4330
The Retail Committee of the IHK Frankfurt believes this ' is not a good idea ' .	-3.8505
The parking facilities in front of the shop are " an undesirable advantage for smaller retailers " .	-5.9420
The German Transport Club believes that an increase after two decades is " reasonable and actually long overdue " .	-3.1788
Public transport will also be more expensive .	-2.8972
Freudenstadt : Challenge Hosts	-3.6691
With a narrow cadar , the men I of the TSV Freudenstadt took part in the Schiller Schuller-Schulturnhalle in Reutlingen against the TG Gönningen from the Schwäbisch Alb .	-5.2898
The elders stood on the other side with an experienced team .	-3.5092
It soon became apparent , however , that they were not able to keep up with the rapid actions of the joy cities .	-12.4481
The Gönningers were extremely difficult to do with the hard and placed set-up .	-7.5209
They repeatedly missed the passports and attacks promised by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz clean over the network centre and were not there for block defense .	-6.2928
Two high first sentence profits clearly expressed the superiority of the joy cities in all matters .	-4.0097
Given this overwhelming and playful performance , the third sentence was won slightly lax and lustless to the 3 : 0 end ( 25 : 13 , 25 : 14 , 25 : 22 ) .	-5.8884
On November 2nd , the TV Baiersbronn , which was able to get its way in Nagold , will be a far more powerful opponent in the field .	-6.1832
TSV Freudenstadt I : Dominik Bäuerle , Yannik Büchle , Sebastian Dölker , Felix Plälchen , Stefan Räller , Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz .	-1.5337
In the B-Class , the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt were in the Murgtal hall in Baiersbronn .	-4.0125
They delivered a hard-fought two-hour match .	-1.6334
Nervosity on both sides caused errors and points , in particular , in the ball acceptance ; the precision was sometimes deficient , and in some critical gambling scenes , the overhaul prevented the view of possible point gains .	-8.4796
In this highly balanced meeting , however , the TSV team of Marcus Blasutto coordinated the great physical commitment and a pleasant commitment of both teams .	-5.2693
Maintenance Day at the Low England Hut	-5.0289
A group of committed participants met at the small English cottage in Ibach in the the successthe N2000-upper Hotzen.	-6.9278
Due to popular suggestions , on that day in the area of the hut the view into the valley should be cut out , said Mayor Helmut Kaiser .	-11.3527
Many hikers , Kaiser said , described this area as the splendid piece of the gorge climb , where the landscape offers the ideal setting for wonderful views .	-5.2620
He thanked those present for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the Care Day was a suitable instrument for strengthening the connection between man and nature .	-4.9778
It offers every citizen the opportunity to place their own emphasis on nature .	-3.5659
At the same time , the tourist aspect can also be taken into account .	-3.7122
This ecological aspect explained Tribukait Friederike by the Natural Protection Department of the Freiburg Government following the welcome of Landrat Tilman Bollacher , who took over the auspices and wished for the action to be successful .	-5.9732
According to Tribukait , the tourist goal of the festival is to preserve the old Allmendweidfeld with its specific protected habitat types by opening and connecting to the existing pastures .	-6.8584
Certain species , such as rare butterflies and grass bulbs , cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest areas .	-2.6640
You need these free contacts to conservation .	-7.6770
Tribukait said she did not want to miss it at this point to break a lance for the planned biosphere area .	-3.8520
The current measure is not merely seamless in this planning .	-2.6532
A biosphere area also offers the opportunity for sustainable economic and ecological development on the basis of the internationally recognised Unesco status and , therefore , a continuous addition to what has been achieved with the Life project and the existing care days for the future .	-5.9508
Following these various speeches , Christoph Wehle and Life project manager Cornelia Bischoff divided helpers into groups .	-4.3141
The bigger trees had already been beaten in advance , and if need be , the forest trawlers are ready to call . with tretre. trees . trees .	-10.7305

Google , Samsung , Huawei sued Nortel Patents	-1.7232
On Thursday , the group , which owns thousands of previous Nortel patents , pushed an avalanche of complaints against mobile manufacturers , including Google , the company that was overthrown in the insolvency auction of Nortel .	-6.6491
Rockstar , the consortium bought the Nortel patents for $ 4.5 billion , sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd , HTC Corp , Huawei , and four other companies for patent infringements in Texas .	-4.6318
Rockstar is owned by Apple , Microsoft , BlackBerry , Ericsson and Sony .	-1.8163
Google is accused in seven cases of patent infringement .	-1.5285
The patents are technology that matches search terms on the Internet with relevant advertising , such as the lawsuit that meets the core of Google ’ s search engine business .	-4.4531
Representatives of Samsung , Huawei , HTC and Rockstar were not directly accessible .	-2.3665
Samsung , Huawei and HTC manufacture mobile phones that work with Google 's Android operating system , which is in sharp competition with Apple and Microsoft 's mobile products .	-3.1245
In 2011 , Google issued an initial imperative of more than $ 900 million for Nortel patents .	-2.4427
Google increased its supply several times and last offered $ 4.4 billion .	-2.6532
After overthrowing the Nortel patents of Rockstar , Google Motorola Mobility acquired $ 12.5 billion , a business that was also partly motivated by Motorola ’ s library of patents .	-4.2122

Egypt ’ s First Free Elected Presidents	-1.4841
Mohammed Morsi departs , but his triumph day is not likely to mean the end of Egypt ’ s political disputes .	-3.6472
Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised a “ new Egypt , ” when he was sworn in as the first freely elected president of the country , thereby taking over the succession of Husni Mubarak , who had previously been expelled from office 16 months ago .	-11.0318
With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court , Morsi became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and Egypt ’ s fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago . the the . the and the the . the the the the . the	-9.8759
He put the oath before the judges of the court , dressed in black robes , who have his seat on the nil and felt an ancient Egyptian temple .	-6.2028
“ We are striving for a better future , a new Egypt and a second republic , ” said Morsi at the solemn ceremony broadcast live on state television .	-9.8934
“ Today , the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom , genuine democracy , and stability , ” said the 60-year-old Morsi , an engineer trained in the US , and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood , a fundamentalist group that has been sharply targeted by the government since it was founded 84 years ago .	-4.7296
Hundreds of soldiers and police guard the building when Morsi arrived in a small autoconvoi shortly after 11 a.m. local time .	-3.0349
Only a few hundred followers had gathered before the court to cheat the new president , and unlike the presidential leap from the Mubarak period , traffic was stopped only in a short time so that autoconvoi could cross the usually lively street that connects the city centre to the southern suburbs .	-6.2605
As an uncharismatic “ replacement wheel ” of the Brotherhood , his personal prestige has increased since his victory and Friday speech , presenting himself not only as the Islamists ’ candidate , but all those who wanted to target the 2011 uprising against authoritarian Mubarak .	-5.2243
“ Egypt is now a civilian , national , constitutional , and modern state , ” the Morsi clothed in a blue suit with red coat to judges in the wooden chamber in which he took office .	-4.6504
Later , Morsi went to the University of Cairo , where he should give his inaugural speech .	-3.6054
He was officially welcomed by an army chapel that played the national anthem that he listened to in a rabbit position .	-4.3146
The military leader Feldmarshall Hussein Tantawi was present .	-1.9595
At his arrival , he was welcomed by hundreds of attendees in the biggest audience hall of the university with speeches by “ The army and the people are a hand . ”	-5.6473
Built in 1908 as a bastion of secular education , the University of Cairo developed into a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s .	-3.3658
On Friday , Morsi issued a symbolic oath on Tahir Square , the birthplace of the insurgency that led last year to the end of Mubarak ’ s authoritarian rule , and he vowed to reclaim presidential powers that the military council had assumed from the head of state chair.	-5.4005
But , by taking official ice before the court and not before Parliament as usual , it is bowing to the will of the military , which indicates that the power struggle will continue .	-5.1389
Morsi ’ s speech on Tahir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures .	-1.6593

Nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa , the perpetrator was sentenced on Friday to two lifetime .	-2.5281
This was reported by the SABC channel .	-1.6962
The victim died later as a result of serious injuries .	-2.3907
Johannes Kana was found guilty of crime earlier this week .	-2.5255
The act had sparked horror nationally .	-3.4142
The 21-year-old Anene Booysen was raped in February in an industrial area in Bredasdorp near Cape Town .	-3.0109
14 hours the doctors fought for the survival of the victim , but in vain .	-2.1454
The youth ’ s sight was so appalling that carers and sisters needed psychological assistance .	-2.5785
Kana admitted during the process to have been in a bar with booyses in a day night .	-5.4750
He also admitted that he beaten and raped them , but he denied being responsible for the death of the girl .	-3.4789
The police had initially been assumed by several perpetrators , but two suspects were released because the evidence was insufficient .	-5.4071
The Public Prosecutor also stressed during the procedure that she was convinced that Cana was alone at the time of the attack .	-3.0273
Rapes are already almost everyday in South Africa : there are about 64 000 advertisements annually because of sexual violence .	-11.8665
That is almost ten times as much as in Germany , but with 82 million people it is much more inhabitants than South Africa ( 50 million ) .	-4.0447
Police and women ’ s associations in South Africa , however , appreciate the figures for sexual violence 10-25 times .	-5.4240

You thought that travel agencies belong to the past thanks to the Internet ?	-2.0185
Flight Centre seems to be resisting the trend .	-1.4004
The company has increased its profit prospects for the whole year and expects record revenue from holidaymakers in Australia and the U.	-4.5250
The travel company now expects an annual earnings before taxes of between $ 325 and $ 340 million compared to $ 305 to $ 315 million in its earlier forecast .	-3.9442
If the current targets are met , that will mean growth of 12 to 17 % compared to the record profit of $ 290.4 million in 2011 / 12 .	-4.0954
As Managing Director Graham Turner announced , Flight Centre achieved eight percent profit in the first half of the year and took a strong start to the second half of the year , especially in Australia and British private businesses .	-5.1780
“ Since the beginning of the year , our ten countries have been profitable , and some of them are well in the direction of record annual revenue from interest and taxes , ” he explained .	-4.3617
These include Australia and the United Kingdom , which typically belong to our strongest earnings carri.	-2.5837
In Australia , the leisure industry has recovered in the second half of the year , making up a slightly weaker business travel market .	-3.6631
Similarly , it was good for the leisure business of Flight Centre in the United Kingdom , while business customers spent less here too .	-17.1342
The US business recovered from the seasonally weaker first half of the year , so a profit is expected for the third consecutive year .	-4.8332
Flight Centre shares rose yesterday by 3 cents to $ 38.20 .	-1.5665
Schools are encouraged to focus on mathematics , spelling , and grammar .	-2.2479
In courses of English literature , students will have to deal with at least one piece of Shakespeare , a nineteenth-century novel , romantic lyrics and contemporary British novels from 1914 .	-3.0513
The test also includes “ unseen texts ” input to encourage wider reading .	-4.4883
The combined course of English literature and language is abolished .	-2.1624
From 2015 onwards , students will have to pass an independent GCSE test for language , with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification .	-4.5387
Tomorrow , the Ministry of Education will publish the new curricula for English and mathematics – the first subjects that have been radically transformed .	-3.1316
Other core areas will be changed next year .	-1.6000
In a separate initiative , Ofqual , the supervisory authority for audits , will announce a reorganization of the GCSE structures , including a new notification system and fewer course work .	-3.9165
In a speech in the summer , Secretary of Education Michael Gove said that there is “ broad consensus , that we need to reform our audit system to restore public confidence , ” emphasising that the GCSEs will become “ challenging , ambitious , and stricter . ”	-4.5007
Studies show that less time is spent on mathematics in English schools – 116 hours per year or three hours per school year – than in most other countries .	-2.5996
By contrast , Australian schools teach an average of 143 hours a year , and students in Singapore receive 138 hours .	-8.4391
While there will be no formal requirement to provide more time for mathematics in the hourly plan , coalition prices suggest that comprehensive mathematical testing , combined with a stronger weighting of the specialist in rankings , will probably encourage schools to take more hours .	-6.1046
The curriculum focuses more on “ problems from the right life , ” including financial mathematics .	-2.2981

Salem : Johanna Rachner at the Ecumenical Talk Forum	-1.5654
The next Ecumenical Talk Forum on Monday , 21 October , at the New Museum of the Castle , is about the theme " Zur Hölle mit der Hölle - Theological reflections on how to deal with the last things " .	-6.3259
Referentin is Professor Johanna Rahner .	-1.4348
The Ecumenical Speaking Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Protestant church parish Salem , Salem Castle and the Cultural Office of the Lake Constance .	-8.7171
Johanna Rachner wants to examine in the forum how people now classify " last things " after death .	-3.5332
Had the people in the past centuries been too aware of this , putting on the images of heaven and hell , " which still characterize our ideas " , the contemporary prophetic teaching is more characterized by a certain embarrassment or even lack of language .	-7.5774
" The greater hope has been driven out by religious critique heartily by Christians , " says the referent.	-4.8334
They ' provided us with so many question marks that we seem to have lost the signs ' .	-3.8234
Johanna Rachner continues to say : ' But the crucial challenge remains the annoyance of death ' .	-3.3667
This brings the question of the desire ' which dreams that everything may be good at the end of the day ' .	-5.1367
Johanna Rahner , born in 1962 in Baden-Baden , studied Catholic Theology and Biology from 1982 to 1989 at the Albert-Ludwigs-University of Freiburg .	-2.2802
She graduated from Dr. theol in 1997 , also in Freiburg .	-3.0860
The Habilitation of Fundamental Theology and Ecumenical Theology followed in 2003 at Westfälische Wilhelms University .	-2.9792
Since 2010 , Johanna Rachner has held a chair for Systematic Theology at the Institute of Catholic Theology at the University of Kassel .	-3.3012

In the morning the group Laudato-Si , in the afternoon of the youth choir The Spirit , accompanied the divine service .	-4.3547
With the reception of the firmsacrament the young people said yes to their baptism and asked the power of the Holy Ghost .	-9.3811
Over the past few months , under the direction of Diakon Reiner Dehner and the help of many community members , the firmlings had prepared themselves for the big festival .	-6.3075
In various projects , they met various tasks of the Christian municipal plain and experienced the youth day in Untermach.	-5.0904
Lake Illmensee : Second Mountainbike races enthusiastically att.	-4.0651
In splendid weather , 214 cyclists came to Illmensee to overcome the tour course across the hills around the lake .	-4.7519
This is what Ulrich Knobel shares with the organising sports club Illmensee .	-3.2895
Among the participants , especially at the short-distance over 15 kilometres and 300 meters of altitude , there were also many people who wanted to practise their hobby once in a competitive atmosphere .	-6.4992
Two junior riders from the German top class were also at the start in this competition : Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came with the recommendation good placements at the German Championships .	-4.5208
These two were expectantly removed from the field .	-4.3474
As in the previous year , Felix Bader could save a little time lead to the goal and defended his title as the overall winner of the short distance .	-4.9868
Pascal Treubel was able to place himself again in square two .	-12.8981
At the ladies it was Theresa Duelli from the team nightmare , who managed to top it on the winner stairs .	-5.5218
In place two and three Anne Adel came from Illmensee and Leonie drivers from Owingen .	-2.4911
A pleasant development is the increasing number of drivers living or working in the municipality .	-2.5974
Not only in terms of capacity , the whole range of sportsmen was represented .	-4.4663
The age structure ranged from 10 years to more than 70 years with the oldest starters .	-4.1047
In the main race there were even more absolute topathletes at the start this year .	-3.9300
Four drivers were able to resign themselves from regional top riders .	-3.7573
Among them Philipp Pangerl , a mountain bike half professional from the Black Tusk Racing team .	-3.0460
Pangerl was the world champion for the twelve hour ride together with a team mate .	-4.7667
This year he became a European Champion in this special discipline .	-2.7562
Roland Ballerstedt , who already names two German master titles in the Duathlon , also own.	-3.9783
After 45 kilometres and 900 metres of altitude , a Wimperschlagfinale came to the finishing line in front of the three-lake hall .	-11.8470
Pangerl race first over the finish line .	-2.9353
The Routinier Ballerstedt was able to secure second place in the overall rating only one second after that .	-4.3688
At the same time , Hermann and Warthmann came to the goal as a third of overall evaluation .	-4.2427
Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest time in the main race in the ladies .	-3.8312

Dr. Georges Bwale brings free medical assistance to remote villages in Cameroon	-2.2473
Bwave and his team spend almost every weekend treating hundreds of patients .	-1.3682
In the West African country there are not many doctors , just one for 5,000 people .	-3.2425
Vote from here or with your mobile device .	-3.1689
Dr. Georges Bwale is one of the top 10 of the “ CNN Heroes of 2013 ” .	-2.4778
You can vote for him or one of the other heroes in the top 10 to choose the " CNN Hero of the Year " .	-2.9003
The winner receives $ 250,000 to continue his exceptional work .	-1.9301
For 21 years , Georges Bwale saw how his sick father repeatedly lost consciousness and traveled to hospitals that did not have the means to help him .	-3.4386
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near Yaoundé , the capital of Cameroon in 1981 .	-2.9990
First he had only a broken arm , but then an inflammation spread to his brain , causing a hematom that would affect him for the rest of his life .	-4.6386
“ There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon , ” says Georges Bwelle .	-2.1261
We would have brought him out of Cameroon if we had the money .	-2.4374
Instead , Bwale spent years accompanying his father in crowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer .	-3.1768
“ It ’ s not easy , ” Bwale comments .	-2.4510
You can leave the house at 5 a.m. and run to the hospital to be the first , and is not the first .	-3.6809
There are many patients .	-1.3915
Some people even die because they have to wait .	-1.3046
The situation has hardly changed since Bwell 's father died in 2002 .	-1.4554
In Cameroon , there is only one doctor per 5,000 , according to the World Health Organization .	-2.8375
On the other hand , the relationship in the United States is with a doctor for 413 people .	-2.7065
But even if there was a doctor for them , most cameroons could not afford to visit .	-3.0179
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line , and nearly three quarters of the country ’ s health expenditure is private .	-3.1841
“ The only problem they have is poverty , ” says Bwave .	-2.0924
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life .	-0.7885
His father and so many of his compatriots suffered to see in Bwale the decision to do something about it .	-3.2327
Dr. Georges Bwale and his volunteer conducted 700 free operations last year .	-2.4878
He was himself a doctor and works as a vessel surgeon at Central Hospital in Yaoundé .	-3.1606
In addition , he founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME , which travels in rural areas on weekends and offers free medical care .	-3.9017
Since 2008 , he and his volunteer group have helped almost 32,000 people .	-1.9664
Almost every Friday , he and up to 30 people are forced into minibuses and go to the villages that need help with the fused medical equipment on the roof over unfortified terrain .	-7.3178
It is not always smooth .	-1.9407
More than once they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud .	-3.3592
But when they arrive , they are received like heroes : a feast dinner , singing and dance and the best accommodation the place has to offer .	-3.9757
In these villages , free medical care is really a reason to celebrate and Bwave – with its broad smile and limitless energy – is happy to celebrate the celebration .	-5.1354
The next morning the team will start investigating hundreds of patients .	-2.3832
“ We treat 500 people per ride , ” says Bwale .	-4.0619
They come from a radius of 60 kilometres around the village – and on foot .	-3.0059
Each weekend clinic offers medical services in a number of areas .	-2.3918
Many people are treated for malaria , tuberculosis , malnutrition , diabetes , parasites and sexually transmitted diseases .	-1.1925
Others receive crutches , donated glasses or free birth certificates – a document that is necessary for school but many poor families simply cannot afford .	-3.2033
In the evening the team performs simple operations with local stunning .	-2.3624
The operations usually take place in a school , the town hall or an apartment ; after the intervention , the patients stand up and go to the recreation area to make space for the next .	-5.5313
The lighting for the OP and the disinfection equipment is fed by the group generator and so Bwale and his volunteers work until the early morning hours on Sunday .	-4.4766
It is an exhaustive pensum , but village musicians normally help to keep the team motivated .	-3.6767
“ You drum all night so we can stay awake and continue our work , ” says Bwale .	-3.8909
On Sunday , the team then returns to the city , tired but proud of the work done .	-3.2624
The group – a mixture of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students – conducted 700 free operations last year and knows that its work makes a huge difference for the people it helps .	-4.2331
One man explained that the free operation of a crash that he received now allows him to work again .	-11.1366
“ This changes the future of my family , ” said the man .	-2.5020
Besides weekend clinics and his work as surgeon in the hospital , Bwale also works at night in private clinics in Yaoundé .	-3.1006
With this second job , he finances 60 % of his non-profit activity , according to Bwale ; the rest come from private donations .	-3.6080
" I really do not know when he sleeps , " says Katie O 'Malley , who studied Philadelphia Medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia and voluntarily cooperates in Bwelles Group .	-4.0763
He is always either in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization to go to these campaigns .	-16.8097
For medical and health care students like O 'Malley , who come from the US and Europe and support Bwave , this is an opportunity to gain practical experience that they would never have at home .	-4.0086
" We can be involved in operations where we help decommissioning blood or holding the instruments for Dr. Bwale , " explains O 'Malley .	-5.9031
That would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year .	-1.6764
Students usually pay for their journey to Cameroon themselves and bring often donated sanity material .	-5.0831
But once in Yaoundé , Bwale takes care of accommodation , transport and instruction .	-4.1337
“ He is undoubtedly a hero , ” says O 'Malley .	-2.0669
He devotes his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroonian people knows no boundaries .	-2.9092
For Bwave , nearly permanent work is not a burden .	-3.5295
To help others to live a happier life and to fulfil a promise that he gave his father gives him great joy .	-5.3443
“ I am so happy when I do this work , ” Bwale says .	-3.1380
And I am thinking of my father .	-1.0153
I hope he sees what I do .	-1.3368
I do it to bring people back to laugh and to alleviate the pain .	-3.0541

The role of Santiago , the old man in Hemingway 's novel " The Old Man and the Sea " , Horst Janson cut to the body .	-3.5681
Janson is himself an old hare in his meter , the art of playing .	-3.9824
The old man of Santiago has no way to defy the fishing .	-5.2325
So the two simply complement each other fantastic . .	-8.2447
It is almost believed to be able to see the wrinkles in the neck of the old man of whom the fishing boy Manolo speaks .	-6.0532
When Santiago sits on the chair tired of life , that is true at Janson .	-3.6644
In addition , the role of the old fisherman is through and through a character role that Janson excellently masters .	-5.0388
Hemingway told the story of a fighter , a brave man who does not give up and ultimately wins the fight against fish through his knowledge and willingness .	-3.9702
Janson is the sole actor on stage in wide distance .	-4.8125
He manages to focus the attention of the audience , so his monologues are not boring .	-2.9584
Its efforts at finally pulling the fish to the surface of the water are so real that the spectators forget that the sea is made up of blue lit water bottles .	-12.8108
Director Jens Hasselmann lets the old man act in the boat in front of the fishing village .	-3.3547
During the performance , he highlights the respective active scene : the hut of Santiago , the bar of the singer Marie-Luise Gunst , who , with their songs and their wonderful voice , bears the feeling of Cuba ’ s life .	-5.6222
The four musicians play Cuba rhythm and are also guests of the bar .	-2.5162
Tourism : Deto the Rom. and . and and . and and . and and . and and	-7.5942
For about 120 meters in length a sanitation channel from the Roman period is preserved below Cologne .	-5.0066
Visitors to Cologne will not pass the Duomo .	-3.2272
About 157 metres the two towers rise into the sky and make it the second highest church building in Europe .	-4.3101
But only a few visitors , who admire the two filigrant church towers , anticipate that there is a lot to discover under the cathedral .	-6.1100
Rainer Schulze is an expert in the field of Cologne Unterworld .	-2.5144
Meeting point for its tours is the Service Centre of Cologne Tourism directly at the Duomo .	-2.8828
The tour starts quite unspectacular : " We start in the underground car park " , says Schulze .	-3.5569
In the seventies , the city fathers wanted an autogeneous city , and therefore the remains of the old city wall remained only that which was not too big .	-5.5034
Most users of the park house are now passing the Roman remains and only leave their car .	-5.5721
But if you look more closely , the D2 park deck discovers an archaeological site separated by metal grid bars .	-16.4016
There are about five meters high ruins made of handmade stones .	-11.2458
" There are remains of the Roman city wall built in the second half of the first century to Christ , " Schulze tells .	-3.8121
Before returning to daylight , Schulze lets the participants take a look at a dark , 15 metres deep shake at the upper parking level .	-7.3402
This is the fountain of the old cathedral , which unfortunately is hardly percei. the the and .	-5.7018
Next stop of the circuit is the pretorium , and here the participants are rising downwards .	-5.3222
Here we are witnessing the seat of the once most powerful man north of the Alps , the CCAA Pretor .	-5.4453
What CCAA means would like to know a visitor .	-5.2577
" The abbreviation stands for " Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium " , which means in good English as much as " City of Roman law and the City of Agrippines , founded under Emperor Claudius at the place of the Altar for the Kaiserkult " .	-4.9433
And the pretorium is the former Statthalterpalast , the power centre of the Roman Empire on the Rhine .	-3.6826
From the premise of the exhibition , a tunnel access to the Roman sanitation channel , which is preserved for about 120 metres in length .	-5.3825
" You can walk a piece quietly along the so-called Cloaca Maxima if you want , " munters Schulze the guests .	-4.2937
There is still a surprise .	-1.6265
After receiving the key at the box office , he leads the group to a 16-meter deep , accessible shaft .	-12.0911
" We are now in the mikwe , a ritual Jewish bath , " he explains .	-1.8889
The Jewish community built its bath deep into the ground to come to the groundwater , which was essential for ritual washing .	-4.1121
Until today , at the bottom of the mikwe , whose origins go back to the eighth century , different water levels can be seen by changing levels of the Rhine .	-5.1495
The Mikwe will be part of an archaeological zone on the Town Hall Square for which the construction work will soon begin .	-3.9882
But some years will go by completion .	-3.4927
Almost delicate : Rerun Rocker Process	-3.6227
A bloody attack in the rocker milieu is reopened after more than four years .	-2.6467
A trial of attempted assassination , dangerous bodily injury , and property damage against two 30 years old has begun before the court of Frankfurt ( Order ) .	-6.5780
It is accompanied by strict safeguards .	-1.6921
The accused remain silent about the start .	-1.8897
They should have been active in the rocker scene and at that time belonged to the bandidos .	-3.5165
The Public Prosecutor accuses them of joining in a car with unknown accomplices in Finowfurt in June 2009 .	-4.2782
All victims were seriously injured , and a man almost lost his leg .	-3.2466
The victims should have been listened to the competing group Hell 's Angels .	-3.0761
One senior member from Berlin is said to have been .	-4.0546
Apparently , precedence was a persecution hunt with several cars .	-4.7677

The Wedge Society is not Thinking	-3.5031
The night was long , the music loud and the mood good , but at some point it goes home .	-2.6143
But the hunger is noticeable in the trees of the people on the front-passenger and back seat .	-4.7025
Of course , one or two cocktails or champagne may be responsible for this !	-4.3449
What 's more closer than chilling to the next drive-in to get a little bit of fun ?	-5.3558
I admit that I am happy to be with it when it comes to fast food stores late or early in the morning .	-6.5754
A few pommes , a Cola , a burger - and then nix as from home and into bed !	-8.9399
But on the way home , the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco enthusiasts become apparent .	-3.7149
Because what do you have to miss by constantly throwing your fast food bags out of the car window ? !	-5.2215
Especially at the weekends there are thrown paper bags on the roads and parking spaces .	-4.4002
" Why ? " , I ask myself .	-1.7340
Are people too doof to take home the bags with respect to the next rubbish ?	-3.6198
It is not just the case that the paper tool is dismantling the landscape .	-3.0923
Tuts have already hidden transport facilities such as guidelines , causing accidents .	-5.0038
But what does not think about " disposable society " , she probably doesn 't even know what that word means .	-5.7968
If you are on the road again in the evening , especially with several people in the car , you know what a rear bank can look like after a celebrated night : clothes , bottles and other rubbish towers there .	-8.5198
A few bags would be more or less neat - unlike the street , where nobody wants to trample on the food remnants of others .	-5.8989
I can see the day when the towns and municipalities will have to bloom - and the fast food chains have to demand pound for their bags .	-6.3346
Obama ’ s Reduction in Health Policy	-1.9429
After heavy criticism , President Obama made a retreat yesterday in his frequently repeated , clear promise : “ If you like your health insurance , you can keep it . ”	-4.0482
Hundreds of thousands of their insurers have received a letter of termination , Republicans have accused the president in recent days of deceiving the American public .	-3.7281
Yesterday , Obama relative his original promise .	-1.7510
“ The vast majority of citizens who have functioning health insurance can keep them , ” he said in a speech in Boston .	-3.1369
In response to the numerous media reports on the redundancies , Obama asked those Americans who received such communications to look around the free market for a new insurance .	-4.1955
Most citizens could thus receive better , more comprehensive health insurance for the same price , or more favourable than forecast .	-4.1395
“ You get a better offer , ” he said .	-1.6578
The government said it was not surprising that the five per cent of the population who have completed an insurance should have a different rate , because their contract does not meet the new standards under the Affordable Care Act .	-6.4021
“ I would like to say to these Americans quite directly : they deserve better , ” says Sebelius at a hearing before the Energy and Trade Committee of the House of Representatives in Washington .	-4.0614

“ I am as frustrated and angry as all the others , ” she said .	-2.5435
I am determined to regain your confidence .	-0.9517
This plea of an enraged Sebelius to a chairman behind her , at yesterday ’ s hearing in the House of Representatives , was started after a dispute with Republican Missouri Billy Long , who asked whether she should be obliged to attend Obamacare .	-7.6360
After more than three hours of hearing , Long Sebelius repeatedly stressed the question of why the Affordable Care Act ’ s “ architect ” did not voluntarily renounce a state-sponsored insurance to finish a tariff at HealthCare.gov , which they now want to sell to millions of Americans .	-5.5343
Jerusalem ’ s government does not confirm the attack on Syria ’ s air base .	-8.4563
On Thursday , an American government officer wishing to remain anonymous , claimed to the American news channel CNN that Israeli warplanes had attacked an air base in Syria one day before .	-5.5843
The aim was ' missiles and equipment ' , which the Israeli Government feared was intended for Lebanese Hezbollah , according to CNN .	-3.7408
Syrian and Lebanese media , as well as the Arab channel Al-Arabiya , had previously reported that the base in the port town of Latakia was fired on Thursday at night , and the Israelis were blamed for it .	-5.1403
The Israeli television channel Channel 2 showed satellite images of the base point in Latakia where Russian defense missiles of type S-125 Newa and a battery of SA-3 missiles could be seen , according to Channel 2 , have a range of 35 kilometres and can transport explosives up to 70 kilograms .	-5.6176
Unsure The Jerusalem government officially has not confirmed the attack .	-2.7289
However , Reuters news agency quotes an equally anonymous Israeli government officer in the words that he believes that Israel has launched the attack , but is not sure .	-5.4192
In any case , a spokesman from the Israeli Ministry of Defence said : ' We do not comment on these reports ' .	-3.3840
The journalist Ron Ben-Yishai stressed in the daily newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth that Syria ’ s regime was already , in some cases successful , trying to supply ground air missiles to Hezbollah .	-4.0294
The Israeli government had repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to supply Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons would mean crossing a ' red line ' that would follow a military response .	-3.6910
John Kerry , in an unprecedented admission that US espionage has gone “ inadequately too far . ”	-3.4802
John Kerry , with an unexpected admission , suggested a softening of the US ’ s defensive attitude toward its surveillance programs by saying that , in certain cases , spying had gone “ inadequately too far . ”	-5.7530
The Foreign Minister also admitted that he , together with Barack Obama , bear the responsibility of switching to “ autopilot ” when the explosive revelations of the whistleblower Edward Snowden became public about NSA spying activities .	-4.5441
Through leaked information , the US government has fallen into a diplomatic storm of disarmament by its allies .	-3.3339
At the Open Government Conference in London , a speech transferred via a video connection , Kerry said : “ The President and myself and others in the government have heard of a number of things that were almost done by car pilot simply because of the ability to do what was still going on in the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War and , of course , 11 September . ”	-9.5266
He then admitted , as the first senior member of the US administration , that the US spy had crossed a border , but also stressed that no rights had been abused .	-5.2435
He said , “ In some cases , this has gone inappropriately too far . ”	-3.1580
The President is determined to clarify and is therefore carrying out a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel abuse .	-12.2232
I assure you that the rights of innocent persons are not affected in this process .	-2.0706
Kerry insisted , however , that the NSA was a force of good , and that many lives were saved by their surveillance operations .	-3.3353
He added : “ We are dealing with a new world in which people are prepared to blow themselves up . ”	-2.4429
There is a radical extremism in the world that is eager to kill people , blow up the air , and attack governments .	-2.7630
So what if you were able to intercept and stop this before it happens ?	-3.4862
We have , in fact , prevented aircraft crashes , attacks on buildings and the murder of people , because we have experienced such plans in advance .	-4.3868

Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said that he spoke to representatives of the European Parliament and other people this week and was concerned about their threats to cease participating in anti-terrorist organisations due to the frustration of the National Security Agency supervision .	-5.3120
“ It is very important for US national security interests that Europeans remain on board for our joint efforts against terrorism , ” said Murphy , who , as a democrat for the first time , is in the Senate and chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs and European Affairs , in an interview in Washington .	-5.2259
I also go to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism , regardless of their anger over the NSA programmes .	-3.3872
Media reports that the NSA has captured millions of telephone data in Europe have burdened relations with some US allies , although this week the head of the secret service stated that the reports are inappropriate and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and exchanged with the United States .	-4.7603

The names of the other participating Members will be published in the coming days .	-2.8777
He said that the exact itinerary is still being worked out .	-2.8276
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the trip was to improve relations , he also said that there would be some “ serious words . ”	-3.1787
He said that European governments should be honest with their people about the type of spy programs they have been using for years .	-3.2968
“ While we can change our surveillance programmes to better protect Europeans ’ rights , they must also accept the fact that we are not the only ones to spie , ” Murphy says .	-4.9509
Meanwhile , on weekends , John Kerry is planning a trip to the Middle East and Poland to address the resentment of America ’ s strategy in Syria , Egypt , and Iran , as well as US surveillance activities .	-4.4341

Australian is calling prison sentences in Thailand	-2.6559
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney who was sentenced to 15 days ' imprisonment in Phuket because she wrongly claimed to have been raped by a taxi driver has appealed against the judgment and was released to bail .	-3.6148
Stevia Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty by a provincial court in Phuket on June 15 , when she had told the Thai police that a local taxi driver raped them during the morning hours on Sunday 10 , while two other men held them .	-4.9632
Later , however , the photographs of a video camera showed that she had securely reached her hotel after she had been separated from her Australian friend .	-5.0467
The police in Phuket interrogated Bamford for two days until they confessed to imagine history .	-2.8550
Until the trial , it was in police custody on the ground .	-3.1571
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a low-security prison at the margin of Phuket , rather than in a prison for adult women .	-3.9251
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks , a former player of the Australian Rubgy League , who has addressed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra with the request for help for his daughter .	-3.9532
Tunks told Sydney ’ s Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was “ extremely worried ” about the well-being of his daughter and wanted to have them back in Australia .	-3.3442
“ Of course we are very concerned about it , but we hope it will be back home as soon as possible , ” said Tunks .	-3.4600
Bamford has appealed against the judgment and is opposed to a deposit of 50,000 Baht on free feet .	-3.6511
Australian reports reported that she is holidays in Krabi in South Thailand in the meantime .	-4.6159
On the part of the Court , it was heard that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and was warned that the appeal could also lead to the imposition of a higher punishment of up to two years in a prison for adults .	-3.9607
It is also possible , however , that Thailand , following the recent assassination of the travel merchant Michelle Smith in Phuket , might seek to improve his hit tourist image , and that is why there is no apology .	-7.3253
