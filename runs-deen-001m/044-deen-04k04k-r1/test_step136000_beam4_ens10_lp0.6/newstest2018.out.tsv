Munich 1856 : four cards that change your view of the city .	-3.2247
A mistaken institution where today young people are to meet .	-4.1519
A Grufftkapelle , where is now digged for the S-Bahn tunnel .	-11.0278
Small farmers manage the former cause of farmers .	-3.8975
The oldest official map in Munich promotes exciting stories .	-2.2444
It nerves if maps are not current .	-3.0659
Everyone who has had to get excited about this because the car navi showed a green meadow instead of a bypass road .	-5.2183
The historical maps of the digital Bavarian Atlas , an offer of the geoportal Bavarian state government , are far from current - but very revealing .	-5.3729
Especially when compared to current online cards .	-1.4800
Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the spread area of Munich ’ s Merkur since the 19th century .	-3.5604
The digital Bayern Atlas is a patchwork that is not recognized as such .	-3.7948
The large overview map has been incorporated into more detailed maps for towns and municipalities , so-called prior positions .	-5.9107
These were obtained according to the Bavarian survey administration between 1810 and 1864 and originated from the first survey of Bavaria .	-5.2810
Your client : Napoleon .	-1.1862
The French army leader has occupied Bavaria since spring 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .	-2.4283
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic reception of Bavaria for military purposes , of course .	-3.2377
Even though the French troops finally withdrew from the Lunéville peace of 9 February 1801 , it was today ’ s neighbors who created the idea of a comprehensive Bavarian card .	-12.3563
Kurfürst Max IV Joseph continued to push the project forward , founded the " Topographic Bureau " - and thus the Bavarian survey management . the and .	-10.2404
The Munich Urposition Journal dates back to 1856 and can be found on the website of the Bavarian National Library .	-5.6691
The comparison of earlier / today is the most impressive of the country 's capital .	-4.3847
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .	-3.3485
An example of this is Untersendling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856 .	-2.2424
Sendling was declared 21 years after the map was drawn up , in 1877 Munidistri.	-9.8134
Today , Untersendling is in the middle of the city .	-2.2847
The houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along the present Plinganserstra<unk>e , which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser only in 1878 , a leader of the Bavarian farmers ' insurgency against Austria in 1705 .	-5.0941
Where the West Park is today , nothing is seen as fields - at first glance : a small-piece card with dozens of lines and numbers appears : hand-numbered pieces of flowers from the so-called " primary " from which the basic tax was derived .	-7.3648
Small plots no longer occupy farmers there today - but small gardeners of the plant " Land in Sun " .	-4.6382
A large green area stands north of Untersendling .	-2.5802
The Theresienwiese , since 1810 the site of the Oktoberfest , was actually a meadow in the nineteenth century - not a concrete desert .	-3.2710
On the other side of the Isar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine .	-2.2002
In the Urpositionsblatt in the area of today 's Au-Haidhausen district you can read not only the street names " am Gasteig " or the altitude " Auf der Füffen " - but also in large letters " Irren Anstalt " .	-6.7102
Yes , here on the Auerfeldstra<unk>e you once blocked people with madness .	-3.4897
The Munich-Irrenstalt " Auer Lüften " was founded there in 1858 / 59 .	-3.9921
In 1872 Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the establishment - the psychiatrist who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .	-3.9578
" He was progressive for his time , for example , ending the chain of so-called mistakes .	-3.3225
He also prohibited the staff from using violence against the inmates , " says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Museum Haidhausen , who worked for an exhibition with the Institute .	-4.0779
There was initially room for 280 patients , later 500 seats were extended .	-3.9775
At some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the circular iron company in Haar 1905 .	-5.4762
Since 2006 , the Isar Amper-Klinikum München-Ost , one of Germany ’ s largest psychiatrics , has been located there .	-13.3321
Young people in the Munich Salesianum are now meeting on the site of the former Auer Anstalt .	-4.0890
The Order bought the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth home with training companies .	-3.9024
Westernly lies the football pitch of the TSV Munich East , eastern houses of the 1980s .	-4.3663
The " Casa Don Bosco " children 's house was built in 2015 , in architectural reference to the origin of the Irrenstalt , which was destroyed in bomb attacks during the Second World War .	-6.3794
The Marienplatz was recorded at 1856 as " Hauptplatz " , the Kaufingerstra<unk>e was called " Kaufinger Gasse " .	-5.0785
The Second World War also brought a decisive shift in the heart of Munich .	-3.0846
The Allied bombs risen in December 1944 many holes to the city centre .	-3.2069
A big thing remained today - at the Marienhof .	-3.3776
The English Institute , small business houses and a middle-aged Grufftkapelle once stood at the Marienhof , where these days the preparatory work and on 5 April 2017 the Spatenstich for the second S-Bahn route .	-6.5998
The slider can compare the old Munich card with today 's aerial image - and fill the hole at the Marienhof .	-3.7219
Citizens ' Rights Group publishes travel warning for Missouri	-2.3045
The National Association for the Promotion of Colors issued a warning for coloured people travelling to Missouri due to the discriminatory policies and racist attacks by the state .	-3.9741
" The NACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri , which is due to enter into force by 28 August 2017 , calls on African-American travellers , visitors , and missourians to pay particular attention and extreme caution when travelling through the state , since a number of questionable race-based incidents have recently occurred throughout the state and are recorded here , " says the group 's opinion .	-6.7069
A recent Missouri law , which makes it more difficult for people to gain discrimination claims , and the law enforcement authorities of the state , which are disproportionately targeted at minorities , prompted the group to issue the travel warning , said NACP . the . the the and .	-12.0431
" They have violations of the civil rights that people pass .	-3.2479
They are stopped because of their colour , they are beaten or killed , " said the President of Missouri NACP , Rod Chapel , Kansas City Star .	-2.9404
'We hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not heard yet . '	-2.6954
It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the US .	-2.7549
The group quoted incidents such as racist attacks against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders , 28 , a black man of Tennessee .	-2.7364
Sanders died at the beginning of the year in questionable circumstances , when he was no longer petrol during his trip to the state and was detained by the police of Missouri without being accused of crime .	-5.6387
The Council also refers to a recent report by the Office of the Prosecutor General of Missouri , showing that black drivers in the state are more often than white .	-4.3053
" The recommendation is that people are aware of what could happen in Missouri , " said Chapel .	-2.1719
" People have to be prepared to have deposit money or the relatives know they are travelling through the state . "	-4.9653
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FBI ’ s hate criminal program , which classified the state as the 16th rank in terms of the number of such injuries .	-4.2691
The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination .	-2.8318
Before that , the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states had passed immigration laws obliging local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for infringements of immigration , which , in the view of the ACLU , will contribute to further racial profiling .	-4.5432
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but lately , stakeholders have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends in the US .	-3.4478
Global Face Project Is Elementary	-3.7871
The Fischerbacher Weidezaun project is a success project and will continue next year .	-2.3633
The CDU members Peter White and Kordula Kovac have got a picture on site .	-3.8552
At the Schwentemann family ’ s right graveyard , representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU Ortsverband met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two Members .	-4.8967
Markus Schwendemann initially gave insights into his company where he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , provides 40 dairy cows , as well as many young animals and holds holiday guests in five apartments .	-5.1568
For him , " Black Forest milk " is the alternative way of marketing the milk of his cows , said Schwendemann .	-4.4472
On the table of guests comes exclusively regional .	-3.1480
Since he is also the BLHV chairman of Fischerbach , he called the Schweidezaun project " essential " .	-4.7439
I cannot make profitable economies in such steep areas .	-3.3961
The green landscape provides a lot of work , and a lot of work must be done with the motor senses .	-5.7139
" We have to fight with the conditions and topography here , " said Schwendemann .	-3.8854
In 2003 , he took over the parent company and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if it does not lead a bio-operation .	-4.7710
For Mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear that " the municipality recognized the importance of the grass-fence project and is glad about the promotion of leader " .	-5.0815
At the cost of EUR 3000 to 4000 per hectare farmers would have to be supported .	-2.9020
It is hoped that this could extend the reforestation of the land for a long time .	-9.8392
" The greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how to continue their business , " the Mayor stressed .	-4.3258
Farmers are often criticised for promoting them .	-2.7010
In 2013 , a total of 25 plots were fenced by eleven participants .	-10.4569
The disclosure area is 40 hectares , which cannot be forged by at least 2023 .	-4.1504
Of the total cost of EUR 71 500 , half was promoted through leader , a quarter wore the town of Fischerbach .	-4.2377
As a result , farmers have left EUR 12 610 , which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of pasture fence .	-3.9493
" The great advantage is the longevity of fences , " said Schwentemann .	-2.8709
Kordula Kovac stressed : ' You are doing a good job , without farmers and farmers it is not possible ' .	-4.8951
Peter White also said : " Here we produce best food " .	-4.4479
The Landscape Care Directive ( LPR ) Baden-Württemberg allows state support for willow fences .	-3.1112
The aim is to keep the Black Forest open .	-2.0297
The presence of a support background called by the LPR is a prerequisite .	-9.3074
In addition , the fencing area must not be slightly manageable ( slopes above 35 % ) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation .	-5.6409
For the Fischerbacher Weidezaun project in 2018 , the application for eight participants with 24 plots is currently under way , which want to build just under 16 kilometres of fence .	-5.7843
The openness surface corresponds to 35 hectares and the calculated cost is more than 112 000 euros .	-9.5610
Is nothing more sacred ?	-0.9216
Now the White House of Trump is taking the Statue of Liberty	-8.5188
The safest sign of regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .	-1.8680
The Americans appreciate it as much as any other - hence the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003 .	-3.6908
Stephen Miller , one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe to the status of freedom in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN on President ’ s proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration .	-3.7305
To remain fair , Miller did not attack the statue itself .	-2.1386
A Horde of boat owners and Liberty imitators would have liked him to have done so .	-9.7756
But he attacked their importance , and especially the importance that was attributed to it when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus was added to its base in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument .	-4.2578
When Miller Acosta summoned : " I do not want to go into a complete story here , but the status of freedom is ... a symbol of American freedom that brightens the world .	-4.9035
The poem you refer to , which was added later and is not part of the original Statute for Freedom ' .	-3.2145
Miller is factually right , but , as he himself put it , it is not really about history .	-3.1822
It is about the contemporary resonance to the upset words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state invites not only any old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : ' Your tired , your poor , your afflicted masses who yearn to breathe freely , / the miserable waste of your rich coasts . '	-5.8159
There was never a time when the " miserable waste " on our screens was better to see .	-2.7642
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump ’ s US .	-2.6756
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate : indeed , it is a conflict about America ’ s importance .	-3.2161
Lazarus - and their friends who committed themselves to placing their words at grassroots level after they died - knew very well that they did a highly political act .	-4.7560
The sculpture should show the links between French and American Republican by portraying the female embodiment of freedom in a worn classic image .	-4.0344
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem , the female figure is no longer abstract - she received a voice .	-3.0744
And she gives himself a very different name : mother of exiles .	-3.6538
The combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism .	-2.5144
And , just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , the right wing people wanted to change it long ago .	-3.8097
The great shrewd Rush Limbaugh , a kind of John of the Baptist for the coming of Trump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was not inviting anyone , but rather an early neo-conservative , bringing the American flame into the surrounded world : " Lady Liberty is moving forward .	-4.8250
It should bear the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .	-2.1134
The torch is not intended to illuminate the path to the United States . '	-2.9198
Limbaugh hit something quite unusual here .	-2.8003
The importance of the statue is quite a matter of the position of perception .	-3.3458
The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as seen by the exhausted , miserable , but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships .	-3.6090
The real point is to see the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and an opportunity to improve their lives .	-2.7434
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome that they must hear .	-2.5262
And that , of course , is not the prospect that Miller and Trump ever want to recognise .	-3.1387
Their torch is not to illuminate the path , but to ignite the hatred that is their only source of power .	-3.3295
World Cup 2017 : Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team .	-1.4064
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots belonged to the UK team .	-2.4303
The performance director of the United Kingdom Light athletics , Neil Black , says that the 16-person Scottish quota in the World Cup ' will make a massive contribution to the team ' .	-4.5465
A record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London in 2017 , which starts on Friday .	-11.1883
Black believes that " something special develops in Scotland " and the United Kingdom 's athletics have to learn something from it .	-11.9389
" We welcome it and we try to understand it , and we will continue it until we find it out , " said Black .	-8.1692
" I speak to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done .	-2.6015
Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .	-2.0180
British athletics : It has something to do with what they have done .	-1.6864
And also with the type on the road corner .	-2.6465
Whatever the combination of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . '	-1.6353
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal contenders , including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track , while Eilid Doyle was elected as a team .	-4.5645
" Eilidh is rather modest .	-1.5164
Her Captain 's speech was incredible , " says Black .	-1.5655
" A series of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and motivated .	-3.0601
The passion and real feeling that Eilidh brought about were great . '	-4.1412
The Commonwealth silver medal winner , who will take part in the 400-m-hurdles at her fifth World Cup championships , says that it is " incredible " that 16 Scots are in the British team .	-11.8996
Scotland ’ s top number of athletes at the World Cup was seven that were achieved in 1983 and 2015 .	-3.6721
The Muir route follows this path and drew up five British and two European records last year .	-3.5081
It will participate in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs .	-2.5046
Chris O 'Hare , who runs 1,500 metres , is another Scott that should be observed after a great season involving the victory of the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games .	-4.6761
Doyle is reminiscent of her first World Championships , when the only other Scot in team Lee McConnell was .	-4.5262
The team captain says that she is " enormously proud " to the fact that many of her fellow countrymen are not only part of the team but , in some cases , will be involved in the medals and finals .	-5.0030
" The special thing about being a team captain is that she was elected by the other members of the team so it was a great honour anyway , but knowing that my teammates voted for me and elected me , makes it a very special one for me " , she added .	-5.6329
" Obviously I am very proud of all the Scots that belong to the team .	-1.9286
It only shows how far we have come .	-1.2966
And they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to rise to podiums .	-3.3529
What is my speech as a captain ?	-2.4949
Yes , I think it went well .	-1.1055
I merely pointed out that we are very happy in this situation because we have a World Championship home .	-3.0488
So it is really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back in the Olympic Stadium .	-3.2346
I get a second chance to go out and compete there and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there . '	-3.7037
Block Critics on Facebook : Don ’ t buy a public office if you cannot bear the heating of voters .	-4.0878
The father of our country knew something of bad press .	-1.5895
Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long for the newspapers to beat him for everything , from domestic politics to its political principles .	-2.9906
He shouted in criticism , safely .	-3.5632
But he did not silence his critics .	-0.7641
Because in 1783 Washington said : ' Freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and silent we are led to slaughter like sheep ' .	-3.7134
This brings me to Maryland , Governor Larry Hogan , who must work to be more like Washington .	-2.0901
Hogan ’ s staff have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .	-3.1832
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for that reason earlier this week .	-1.8267
The governor staff dismissed the complaint as frivol , and the online comment was full of a backlash with " Na , and ? " .	-3.5447
" It is only Facebook " , said many people .	-2.1201
But it is important .	-0.8162
And it is particularly important when it is a type like Hogan .	-2.2443
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state that is amazingly popular .	-2.1729
He has the second highest consent of the 50 nation governors .	-2.3036
Hogan is not a reactionary heat .	-1.0225
He has shown a firm hand in guiding his state and in adhering strictly to the principles .	-4.0127
He was also very skilful in using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his constituents and playing his hairless head to chemotherapy on his side .	-4.0836
That is why blocking people who come to the governor 's side - a public forum that is officially described as being official and paid by staff paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .	-6.7183
In an interview with The Washington Post , Hogan ’ s spokesperson Amelia Chasse defended the governor ’ s actions , arguing that blocking comments is nothing more than moderation .	-2.6534
But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people who are wearing the stick online .	-3.5302
The post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan .	-1.9893
And these are just real people who talk to their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur , a priest , not a troll .	-3.1225
They all said that their comments were respectful , thoughtful and not profan .	-1.9931
The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan 's Catholic faith .	-1.7509
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie , Md . , was not hateful , but she asked for hate crimes .	-1.7561
" I commented politely that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other current news , " she wrote in the commentary section of the news broadcast " The Post " .	-3.3397
" I also do not appreciate this idea when a number of people are commenting on the same subject , then they are disregarded by some rather than a so-called collective commitment and not recognised as a large group of citizens affected . "	-6.3100
What the governor ’ s staff called a “ concentrated spam attack , ” others would probably call a “ Advocate Language . ” .	-5.4021
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment .	-1.8120
It is much cleaner than in previous times if you had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials , or to arrest and silence demonstrators .	-14.1131
But that is exactly what is happening digital .	-2.0541
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticised for using Facebook and other social media .	-2.7190
President Trump is sued by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed .	-2.0190
One of the first milestones on this issue fell in Virginia last week .	-9.1756
The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County violated the First Amendment , according to US District Court James C. Cacheris in Alexandria , when they banned a voter from their Facebook page .	-4.2951
And in Kentucky , Governor Matt Bevin ( R ) also received a visit from ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter .	-2.2677
This should not be so difficult .	-1.6666
At the time of Washington , the time of affordable porto had a similar effect to the Internet .	-3.1401
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800 , and anonymous letter writers proposed his leadership .	-2.1847
And even then , Washington had anonymous trolls .	-1.3743
The people who used pseudonyms such as " Juricola " , " Valerius " , " Belisarius " and " Portius " wrote all letters of newspapers that deleted Washington 's decisions .	-3.1492
Petitions that criticised his position on the Treaty of Amity , trade and shipping with the United Kingdom overwhelmed his position , according to the historical documents collected by the George Washington Project 's online papers .	-3.6417
But he did not silence them .	-0.9834
Freedom of speech , disagreement and discourse form the basis of our nation .	-1.8966
And real leadership means accepting that .	-1.9745
Ronan Rafferty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club .	-1.8767
The former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for domestic comfort over the next three days , as the Renaissance Club will host the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open in East Lothian .	-3.8670
The Northern Ireland , which , next to the Archerfield Links last year , led to the final round before he lost against Paul Eales , is linked to the new venue and acts as a tournament message on behalf of the founder and CEOs Jerry Sarvadi .	-6.4657
" I saw how the Renaissance Club was built , and we see how he reaches his glory with this event , " said Rafferty .	-3.2848
" Players will see this course from his best page , he is in a great condition .	-3.4319

He is a zealous advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here .	-2.4846

Gary Orr , who joined the European Senior Tour after his 50th birthday earlier this year , returns to the action on home ground .	-3.4230
This event will be its first Scottish performance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .	-1.5701
" It always means a bit more when you play at home , " said Orr , the man from Helensburgh .	-2.2703
" You want to do it well , but you also feel this extra pressure .	-2.8639
I really enjoyed playing it again and I played a solid golf .	-1.9155
I am glad about what has happened . '	-3.1410
With the trio on the field , the former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and the Senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst , Roger Chapman , Mark James and Mark McNulty are .	-9.1935

Passive Smoking	-3.1977
In the last two decades , fewer and fewer people have died of lung cancer because of passive smoking .	-2.0516
This is the result of a study by scientists at the University Clinic Hamburg Eppendorf ( UKE ) .	-3.3927
" According to our estimates , 167 lung cancer deaths per year are caused by passive smoking , " said Heiko Becher , Stu.	-3.9055
He compared his own 1994 study .	-3.6529
At that time there were 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking in Germany .	-2.8581
The new inquiry is published in the " International Journal of Public Health " .	-2.2757
Household connections are very complex .	-2.7885
The construction works in the Villinger Stra<unk>e are in full swing and " lie in time " , according to the head of the Bauhof Fred Heinze .	-4.9712
In the area of household connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected , because much is hidden underground , which is not included in the plans .	-5.6870
The traffic that constantly impedes the construction work is a major problem for the Stumpp construction force .	-5.1298
" The ignorance of drivers of red traffic lights and barriers is already enormous , " says Heinze .	-3.7182
The road is closed and only the buses are entitled to pass .	-5.6740
Angelo Caruso , Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from Stumpp have been working on the bridge for weeks .	-2.5185

Paniai has always been a trouble for the Indonesian Government .	-2.0504
The lack of meaningful development reinforces the discontent of the tribal seas , Moni , Dani and Damal living in the green highlands of Papua .	-3.2981
Many joined the " Free Papua Movement " ( OPM ) , the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of the Papua by launching sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers .	-2.7873
Some of the top OPM leaders are from Paniai , including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya .	-1.9202
In response , thousands of people have been arrested in Paniai in recent years and arbitrarily detained on the pretext of ' safeguarding national sovereignty ' .	-2.7629

Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua .	-1.9336
Moreover , restrictions on reporting remain tense for international media .	-2.1156
Earlier this year , French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua because of a lack of coordination with related institutions , despite the rare permission to film .	-3.4170

" There are new dangers to foreign journalists trying to report to Indonesia 's worrying eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua : visa refusal and a black list , " he said in a statement .	-3.1205
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian Government remains largely confined to Papua ’ s immediate neighbors .	-2.4941
In March , six Pacific states - Tonga , Nauru , Palau , Tuvalu , the Marshall Islands and the Salomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to examine the ' various and widespread violations ' in Papua , including the Paniai foundry .	-3.0466

Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua say that they will probably not vote for Jokowi again .	-2.2629
" Jokowi is a person who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai shots , " says Gobai , Chairman of the Tribal Council .	-12.3050
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people , apart from living under the constant threat of a predatory military , are in poor education and health services .	-3.3012
Gobai says that the Paniai people , like other Papua , consider their voice to Jokowi to be a " guilt " he has to pay back .	-3.6526
" They do not need money , they just want justice , " he says .	-2.5411
Despite threats and intimidation , the Paniai victims ’ families led a last symbolic act of defiance : the victim ’ s body was buried on a site precisely in front of the police and the military station .	-5.1444

Dubai 's civil protection authorities said that the fire fighting units were removing fire at 4 p.m. local time ( 00 p.m. GMT ) and cooling the building .	-4.6819
The government said it is working to provide accommodation for those affected .	-2.9384
The incident can revive questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high houses around the world .	-3.6401

No Davis Cup reform : Continue Best-of-Five	-1.9082
The president of the International Tennis Association ( ITF ) has gone through with his great Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly .	-11.2119
At the Ho-Chi-Minh meeting , the revolutionary proposal for this sport to play Davis Cup single only on two winnings was strongly not supported by the required two-thirds majority .	-5.7755
Thus , the Five Seat classics , which are often very long but also very much appreciated , remain in the tradition .	-8.1077
63.54 % of the Member States voted in favour of reform , so the goal of ITF President David Haggerty was barely missed .	-4.0096
" We respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members have not adopted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup .	-2.3752
We need a change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historical competitions , " said Haggerty .	-2.3922
We will continue to work on improving the candidate .	-7.5712
It was not until the vote that , after many objections , the proposal was made to carry out the final in a neutral place .	-5.4785
New from 2018 are only comparatively smaller details : the finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have host rights in the following year .	-5.1444

A survey among airline passengers found that more than 20 % consciously or unconsciously forbidden objects at the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration have gone past smuggling , including at least 6 % who entered the aircraft while accidentally carrying forbidden knives or other objects with blades .	-5.2773
Less than 1 % argued that they were delayed to discover that they were mistaken with guns , ammunition , or explosives .	-3.9859
The survey of more than 1,000 people - carried out by a jet charter service , the Stratos Jet Charters Inc . - also found that younger travellers were more disregarding the rules .	-4.2658
Of those respondents who admitted that they knowingly tried to fly with something prohibited by the TSA , 19.7 % of millennials , compared to less than 15 % , were members of generation X .	-3.3387
The most common items deliberately passed to TSA agents were food and liquids .	-3.0913
More than 3 % admitted that they knowingly carried items with blades through security control , while 2.2 % of female respondents and 3.7 % of male respondents also confirmed that they had deliberately brought forbidden drugs to the plane .	-4.3715
The company said that travellers throughout the country were questioning how many accidentally would have brought smuggling goods through airport security and how many would have deliberately done it .	-5.2405
It is no surprise that those who wear the most smuggling goods - knowingly or unknowingly - by safety were those who fly most frequently .	-4.5354
However , the company points out that the TSA directives are somewhat complicated and confusing .	-2.3800
People are often unsure what liquids they can take with them or how much of them .	-2.9761
So it is no surprise that the largest amount of objects confiscated by the TSA are banned .	-2.7787
For a while , people thought TSA could view books as smuggling goods .	-3.1194
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .	-1.4039
Elon Musk doesn 't care : Tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel order .	-2.4959
Elektro-thousand-sassa Elon Musk likes to announce the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla " Model 3 " .	-3.3199
To date , it has suggested that some of the customers have withdrawn their non-binding reservation .	-4.5645
In addition to the always triumphal figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tesla chief Elon Musk , in announcing the latest quarterly balance , has for the first time betrayed a different , less glamorous number : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 .	-6.7098
Musk had often advertised over the last few months with more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car , whose delivery is just beginning .	-4.4011
Now Musk admits : 63,000 of the 518,000 preorders in total have been withdrawn . 518,000 .	-11.7315
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations .	-2.7796
If cancelled , Tesla will pay the 1000 Euro ( in the USA 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds ) " Reservation Deposit " fully .	-6.7060
Currently , 455,000 such non-binding reservations were available , Musk provided a telephone conference with analysts .	-4.1855
However , the Tesla chief does not believe that the cancellation of around 12 % of all orders so far could become a problem .	-4.5175
His argument : the challenge of ambitious growth targets is not demand , but production .	-2.8977
Last year Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles .	-1.3372
In 2018 , all models will be 500,000 , and 2020 will be one million .	-3.4667
The demand for this is obvious .	-2.1629
According to Musk , there are currently 1800 reservations per day .	-1.8148
If you order a " Model 3 " today , you can expect extradition at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive its brand new production lines , which have never been tested in practice , without major interruptions with maximum utilisation .	-5.6498
Many experts doubt that is possible .	-1.2105
If there are greater delays , however , the impartiality of reservations could become the problem for Tesla .	-4.5637
After all , the company cannot prevent dissatisfied customers from running into shares .	-3.8626
EPA leader Pruitt is withdrawing to reduce emissions due to the delay in Obama Era ’ s rules .	-4.1803
One day after being sued by 15 states , Scott Pruitt , the head of the Environmental Protection Agency , withdrew his previous decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules to reduce emissions of smog pollutants .	-4.1068
Pruitt presented the change when his agency proved more responsive to the needs of national environmental authorities than previous administrations .	-4.2372
He did not mention the complaint that had been made against his previous post in a federal vocational court .	-3.6707
It is a deadline that took place on 1 October for states to meet the standards of 2015 for soil near ozone .	-4.7938
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by one year to give his authority more time , study the plan , and avoid ' interfering in local decisions or hindering economic growth ' .	-3.5218
Pruitt , who was President Donald Trump ’ s prosecutor of Oklahoma before he was appointed , has long been a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations .	-3.6212
Since his arrival in Washington , Pruitt has repeatedly moved to blocking or delaying regulations that resist the chemical industry and fossil fuel industry .	-2.9786
The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the latest legal setback for the Pruitts regulatory rollback agenda .	-2.0224
Last month , a federal vocational court in Washington decided that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration that obliged oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks .	-14.8003
In an opinion published on Wednesday evening , Pruitt proposed that his turnaround in ozone standards would simply strengthen the EPA ’ s willingness to cooperate with the States by the complex process of timely fulfilment of the new standards .	-5.3785
" Under previous administrations , EPAs often failed to meet the deadlines for carrying out and then waited to be charged by activist groups and others , and in an agreement set the deadline for carrying out , " said Pruitt , who sued the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job .	-5.4694
" We do not believe in judicial regulation and we take deadlines seriously .	-2.2484
We also take seriously the law and authority that exists . '	-2.2062
Nonetheless , the EPO 's opinion said that , at some point , Pruitt will use his " power to delay and all other legally available powers " to ensure that the rules are " based on sound policy and the best available information " .	-5.6305
Congressional Republicans urge a broader recast of the ozone rules .	-2.3319
A bill approved last month is intended to delay implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .	-1.9669
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate .	-1.5893
The New York Prosecutor General Eric Schneiderman , who chaired the coalition of the states that sued the EPA this week , said that the Group intends to maintain legal pressure .	-3.8556
" The reversal of the EPA - after our complaints - is an important gain for health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and over 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities , " said Schneiderman .	-4.5270
New York joined California , Connecticut , Delaware , Illinois , Iowa , Maine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Pennsylvania , Rhode Island , Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia .	-1.5964

Representatives of the public health system and environmentalists cheered about Pruitt ’ s surprising change of course .	-4.4285

According to the document , the Tumlinger Mountain , apart from the former parish church , also belonged to the church or the patronage law , and not the other way around .	-6.8448
They lived there as well .	-2.7579
As indicated by the description of the Oberamt Freudenstadt of 1858 , besides the village and the village of Oberdorf , which are still to be seen today in the picture of Tumlingen , the " mountain " of the third , the ruling settlement centre of the village .	-7.2370
Old maps of the year 1600 underpin these historical realities .	-3.4301
The patronage law was derived from the early medieval self-church law .	-3.5830
A Lord who built a church , equipped and occupied with a priest remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this church .	-3.9073
This was connected with the right to use a priest or to propose a new priest to the bishop .	-4.3079
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower .	-1.7176
The largest of the two crushed on Christmas 1673 .	-3.0374
The newly bought bell first sounded in 1692 , but later in the Second World War in 1942 .	-5.3416
In the 30-year-old war ( 1616 to 1648 ) window windows were beaten and the bell rope stolen .	-4.8761
The roof was leaky .	-1.9646
In 1796 French troops stood near the church .	-2.7345
They broke out the candle and church chairs and used them as a firewood .	-3.6958
The remnants of the church threatened to fall in 1809 .	-2.7342
Until 1869 , the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from hearing pigs .	-10.8183
In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Hilariuskirche was aborted .	-3.2850
Only the church tower one left .	-3.0427
In the New Year ’ s Night in 1834 , a storm split the church tower and half crashed .	-2.9129
To prevent an accident , the tower was aborted .	-3.0599
Only the tower that still exists today remained a witness to the 750 years old church history .	-4.2558
Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem from the " Schaffigen Pensioners " as successor to Dieter Dockhorn maintain the Hilarius facility .	-4.3648
On Sunday , July 16 , friends and sponsors will be invited to the sixth Serenade to the old graveyard to St. Hilariuskapelle .	-5.5526
It is designed by the combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis with .	-4.2466
Local chairman Hartmut Romann speaks the final word .	-2.6088
The programme starts at 4.30 p.m.	-1.4249
Admission is from 3.30 p.m.	-8.8331
At the end of the Serenade there is a stroll in front of the graveyard .	-3.8776
" Enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest " , the organizers present the fantastic view .	-4.8468
The serenade only takes place in dry weather .	-2.1485
The organizers hope that many supporters will support the preservation of the historic St. Hilarius facility , which is important for tumours and swings .	-5.9391
Friends and conveyors Tumlingens feel particularly committed to maintaining their home , as Serenade Organizer Walter Martini reaffirms .	-4.8256
Association wants to Check Windcycle Authorisation	-3.4965
" Boisheim defends himself " sees no legal precondition for construction and has therefore turned to the Land Council .	-4.1183
The association " Boisheim defends itself " has called on Landrat Andreas Coenen ( CDU ) to withdraw its permission for the construction of planned wind power plants in the Boisheimer net .	-11.5045
It should be unlawful .	-2.1160
The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Boisheimer Nette no wind power plants could have been approved , as at the time in Viersen only a wind power concentration zone existed at the border with Schwamtal .	-6.1175
Within this concentration zone , the construction and operation of wind power plants are fundamentally possible , but the concentration zone also eliminates wind energy use for the rest of the city .	-5.0894
Such zones are intended to prevent the landscape from being sparked .	-4.0673
The city of Viersen decided a second wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette just a few days earlier , but the district government did not approve Düsseldorf due to a form error .	-5.4937
" Due to the lack of a planning requirement , the authorisation certificate granted remains illegal and therefore also to withdraw " , Christoph Erkens said , Chairman of " Boisheim defends himself " .	-5.8851
Current state of affairs : before the summer recess , the City Council once again decided on the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette ; approval by the district government is still pending .	-6.2590
First of all , ' This excludes the granting of permission for the construction of wind power plants in planning ' .	-5.7841
The circle confirms the receipt of the request .	-1.3492
" The corresponding letters have been received by the District of Viersen since last week , " said a speaker .	-3.8572
The circle gives them the opportunity to re-examine the matter .	-3.5780
However , they are probably not leading to a stop to the procedure .	-3.4615
In view of ongoing procedures at the administrative court , the circle did not wish to express its opinion on Thursday on the substance of the argument of the association " Boisheim defends itself " .	-6.2830
The NEW Re , a subsidiary of NEW , plans the construction of four hundred metres of wind wheels on a surface of the Boisheim Nette .	-4.4639
Last year , the company in which the city of Viersen is indirectly involved had contracts of leased with the owner of the area of approximately 65 hectares .	-5.6823
With the construction of the four wind power plants , the electricity needs of around 11 400 households are to be met - approximately one fifth of the electricity requirements of all four households .	-5.2385
NEW Re wants to invest around 20 million euros .	-2.2728
Last summer , Viersen ’ s city council gave the green light to buy three wind turbines in the Linnich wind farm near Aachen and to participate in a wind turbine in <unk>bach-Palenberg in the Heinsberg district .	-3.9214
Car and tractor collapse : Woman dies in the event of terrible accident	-3.2317
A terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 a.m. on the L 333 between Lower Wallmenach and Bogel ( Rhine-Lahn-Kreis ) .	-10.3093
One woman was killed .	-8.0608
Two more people were slightly injured .	-1.0396
The Landesstra<unk>e remained closed for hours .	-2.3015
According to police statements , a 17-year-old young woman from Bornich passed the L 333 in the direction of Bogel with her 53-year-old mother .	-5.3423
Town and Traders Plan " Home-Shopping " Weekend	-3.5404
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region are expected to rediscover shopping opportunities in the city centre in September .	-3.9007
The trade association and the city administration want to use the weekend on September 8th and 9th to attract the inhabitants to the city centre .	-4.7237
As the chairman of the trade union , Christian King , announced , the " home shop " weekend is intended to raise awareness of the offers offered by his own city beyond the usual supermarket goods .	-5.8923
So a market with regional providers is planned , similar to the weekly market .	-3.5088
In addition , domestic companies with their training places should present themselves .	-3.6184
In addition , the shops of the city centre are invited to the " Mitternachts-Shopping " .	-4.3886
The action is not aimed solely at the inhabitants of the city and the neighbouring region .	-4.7431
In preparation are advertising spots in radio , an Internet video and printed bags pointing to the action weekend , according to Christian King .	-4.5742
Town administration and trade association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .	-2.3532
The business association and the city are thus entering another stage of the project " attractive city center " .	-5.4444
These include new offers such as the first " Active Day " to the Well Festival and Sunday sold , discussions with all traders and hosts to get them to active participation .	-5.3505
Also attractive offers for Saturday and the renunciation of parking fees on that day are part of the concept .	-3.7149
Furthermore , customer potential should be reopened or reopened .	-2.7143
These include guests and tourists .	-2.2607
But many locals , too , would have lost the city when shopping .	-4.5700
In the end , everyone should contribute to revitalising the city centre - to landlords , businesses of the whole city and clubs .	-6.3724
King said in the spring that he would overcome the lethargy with a network that had partly spread .	-5.8890
Birgit Streich , Head of the IHK Center in Mühlhausen announced that the nationwide third " home shops " day , for the first time five Thuringian cities participated .	-4.7175
Besides Bad Langensalza these are Weimar , Sömmerda , Saint City and Bleicherode .	-3.3081
The day should ' promote the appreciation of local trade and highlight its importance to the common good of our cities more strongly ' , says Streich .	-4.6925
The action under the auspices of the IHK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence their own direct environment with their purchasing behaviour .	-5.5016
Two Deaths and Several Injuries to the US School after the Explosion	-7.7289
During construction work there was a gas explosion in the school building .	-2.6968
New people were injured .	-0.9219
A gas explosion in the U.S. city of Minneapolis killed two people , and nine more injured , some of them .	-13.0636
According to the fire brigade , on Wednesday ( local time ) there was still a violator in critical condition .	-12.3327
A person died when part of a school building crashed during the explosion .	-2.5867
A missing person was also killed later .	-3.4323
The dead were employees of the school .	-1.5615
As an accident , the authorities suspected works on a gas pipeline .	-2.0602
At the time , only a few people stood in the Minneha Academy building .	-3.1999
Trump , after leaked transcripts of Mexico telephone calls , put pressure on paying the border wall .	-3.2136
Transcripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been published by the Washington Post .	-2.2089
On January 27 , Trump , in a telephone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto , asked to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall .	-2.8568
The US President abused him because he publicly denounced the Wall , and he said , according to him , ' You cannot say that to the press ' .	-5.8059
Trump launched his presidential campaign with a promise to build a wall on the southern border of the US , and swore to let Mexico pay for the project .	-3.0495
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and revealed a tense exchange .	-2.1473
Mr. Trump said to Mr. Turnbull that a trade for the US to take refugees emigrating to Australia is ' ridiculous ' , ' mies ' and ' stupid ' , and that the existence in trade that was conveyed by the Obama administration would look like a ' def ' after proposing a ban on refugees relocating to the US .	-5.9351
Mr Trump ended the call after he told Mr Turnbull , ' that is the most unpleasant call for the whole day ' .	-3.5335
Moores Ford Massacre : Activists are restoring racist lynchact as a call for justice	-3.7349
A 1948 Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in rural Monroe , Georgia , and trumpeted the Moore Ford Bridge .	-4.0220
Before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men weaponized to block his way .	-3.3576
The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man in a needle strip suit - took a long train on his cigar and looked through the windshield .	-3.9768
Drinks hovered the passengers in fear .	-3.9234
" We want this n --- r Roger ! " the man stuck .	-3.5466
'Get him out of the car ! '	-1.3500
Shrines crushed silence when a young black man was crushed by the front-passenger seat .	-4.4591
Fortunately , this terrible scene , which was played on 22 July , is just a copy .	-2.8115
But when a blade is thrown around the neck of " Roger " , nearly everyone in the audience encountered very real sights .	-4.9236
Since 2005 , civil rights activists have returned to Moore 's Ford Bridge to imitate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by Ku Klux Klan in 1946 .	-3.6344
No one has ever been charged for the murders .	-2.1795
" It is truly inconceivable that not one person has been arrested in all these years - although we see them in our communities , although we know who they are , " said Tyrone Brooks , who helps organise the repair .	-5.1388
" It is a dirt spot on a story , but it is a burden on our souls . "	-2.5367
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Congressman of the State of Georgia and a lifetime of civil rights activists .	-3.5643
For him , the compilation serves as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected .	-3.9276
'We want prosecution , we want the end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we need to get justice , ' he said .	-3.0467
'We cannot get healing and reconciliation until we get justice ' .	-2.2799
A court medical placed a cloth on the body of one of the victims of the Moore-Ford Lynch on 27 July 1946 .	-3.6764
According to FBI files received by the NBC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the lynch process .	-2.7299
But no one has ever been charged .	-1.9874
Although suspects have remained at large for decades , civil rights activists say that the dual motivation for lynch actions throughout the city has always been known : politics and sex .	-3.5600
In April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court allowed the black citizens in Georgia to vote for the first time on the pre-election campaign in the summer .	-3.4436
About the same time as the election , according to the FBI of Roger Malcom , a white landowner , Barnett Hester , stood down during a battle , supposedly because of a woman .	-4.3671
Brooks said that the rumor in the city was that Hester had slept with Malcoms Ms Dorothy , and that the baby she wore did not come from her husband .	-3.9400
On July 25 , 1946 , Loy Harrison , a prominent white landowner , paid $ 600 to liberate Malcom from prison , according to the FBI .	-2.7186
He was accompanied by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey .	-1.9768
But when they moved away from prison and approached the Moore 's Ford Bridge , a lynchmob surrounded the car .	-3.0510
" As it turns out , it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murders , " concludes a FBI report .	-2.5353
" It is also obvious that there was a plot between state and local prosecution , which was not only involved in the murders , dismantled evidence and concealed the identity of witnesses " .	-3.9139
Brooks put it even more concise .	-2.8675
" It was an electoral massacre , " he said .	-1.7559
'They have all been killed to send a message to black people in this community : ' If you register and if you vote , you will get it here . '	-4.5699
For almost a decade , Cassandra Greene managed the annual reproduction of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murders .	-10.1746
Their presentation is illustrative , seductive , and justified in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe that he no longer exists in America .	-6.3829
It is difficult to look and look away even more difficult , but Greene said that is the point .	-3.5461
" We do not want to talk about lynch , because we are faced with its hateful nature in all of us , " she said .	-4.6940
" But I cannot build a relationship with you if you do not want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have gone through " .	-3.3723
The samples for this year 's production started in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest of the black - pushed into a room and listened when Greene started a well-played overview of the piece .	-4.4562
Wade Marbaugh is director of Greenes Co .	-2.2303
He has played the role of Chef Clan for years , but he said that the role will never be easier .	-3.3734
" I feel dirty because I am not so , " said Marbaugh .	-1.6227
" But I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return at this time . "	-2.7604
On the other side of the room , actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona , who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester , saw their rows .	-4.5660
The piece begins with Malcom , who is shouting Hester and afflicting him , angry that he sleep with his wife Dorothy .	-4.1795
'I said n --- he disappeared from my property ! '	-2.4445
Rascona returns the fire .	-2.1125
There is a break .	-1.0016
And then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks into laughter .	-2.7991
Greene laughs the loudest .	-1.0766
" What ? " , Rascona asked .	-1.5842
It is alarmed and confused .	-0.8166
Was I too hard ?	-1.2987
" No " , Greene said , still sticking .	-2.6069
" I just do not think white people at the time have said ' n -- he ' .	-3.2370
" But " , joked one of the other black actors .	-2.7686
'You only have to meet the hard ' R. ' .	-2.3944
And that is where energy is shifting in the room , a feeling of camera replaces the unease .	-4.1309
Everyone is busy getting this right , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four people killed .	-3.3038
The scene starts again .	-1.3551
This time , when Rascona says the N word , he says it sharply and forcefully .	-2.0318
Absolutely no one laughs .	-1.3063
This repetition ends with violent and fast .	-2.3203
There are shouts , shots and then silence .	-1.8169
A woman , dressed with a sorrow , stands above the bodies of the actors and executes Billie Holiday 's saddening Lobrede " Strange Fruit " . .	-12.7855
Her voice breaks at any second word .	-2.8502
About a hundred meters behind it , a group of about four dozen spectators blows sweat and tears out of the eyes .	-3.8950
The audience is almost equally divided between black and white .	-2.3970
A couple arrived from Ithaca , New York , to see the performance , many just come down the road .	-3.0027
They experienced moisture pushing Georgia for almost eight hours when Brooks leads them to the tombs of Malcoms and Dorseys on a pilgrimage journey .	-4.9009
Until this point , the murders have remained anecdotes , but now , when you stand in the same country where the lynch killings took place , the air feels hostile .	-4.4987
When the last notes of the song end , Greene invites the amount to get closer and inspect the corpse name .	-3.0475
Children hook at their heads , register the counterfeit blood and the quiet body and whisper each other .	-3.3362
" They are not really dead " , mumbles a small boy as if he wanted to remember .	-3.5571
After a few minutes , Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it is over .	-2.7288
The actors throw away the lynch rope and wipe out their tears .	-3.3961
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh , the man who played the clan member .	-3.0174
Nick Rascona embraces two of his fellow players and then collapses in their arms , the emotional burden of performance breaks with him .	-4.6270
" It 's okay " , one of the women flourishes .	-3.0937
" We know that this is not in your heart .	-1.3888
You have done so for one reason ' .	-1.6109
Later , the audience comprises the actors for dinner .	-3.5500
On a table , a white pair of Atlanta is stimulated by the reproduction of a black pair that they have just met .	-5.2669
Denise Duplinski fought to find words that left the feeling of performance .	-3.2182
" It is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... from people who look like you and who do this because they look like you , " she said .	-3.0956
" What really does that with me makes me believe that the lynch is still going on " she added , " today it is only called the police foundry . "	-5.9074
In the same area , Tyrone Brooks Hof is holding his table , eating and reminiscent of civil rights .	-10.8030
He said he has already started to plan the performance next year .	-2.8900
" The reproduction is somewhat inspiring , because it describes the horror of what we have endured , but it is also a moment of learning , " he said .	-3.8504
" It 's so if we don 't learn anything from it , then it can happen again .	-7.8746
Those who do not study their own history , who do not know their own history , are condemned to repeat it . '	-2.6767
" Divine Dawn " reconciles the Wagnerians in Bayreuth	-3.3762
In the fourth part of Richard Wagner ’ s monumental work , director Frank Castorf also places on a bunt-fresh staging with a huge six-storey scene .	-5.3199
The rotary stage ( designed by Aleksandar Denic ) optionally shows a shabby street corner , including the Berlin Wall and Dönerbude , a " Plast and Elastic " logo from DDR times or the New York Stock Exchange .	-6.1257
Before that , an open Mercedes-Oldtimer parks in which the Rhine daughters are positioned as rock girls , or an isetta alternatively .	-5.5021
Stacked oil barrels remind of Castorf 's leitmotif - money , power and greed - which is drawn by his " ring " staging .	-4.6349
The three Rhine daughters - sang by Stephanie Hutzeel , Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize as already in the " Rheingold " .	-4.0769
Kess they seduced Siegfried ( Stefan Vinke ) , crush a corpse into the boot in Hollywood Manier and give the Krawallo Clique .	-4.6390
Stephen Milling sings the beautiful giant Hagen that surrounds the aura of a heavyweight boxer .	-4.2649
Brutal the scene when he beats Siegfried .	-2.3931
Gunther ( Markus Eiche ) later had to believe in it .	-3.6295
The audience thanks it to the ensemble with strong applause .	-2.7071
Stormically celebrated fosters , milling , vink and conductor Janowski , who modestly conceals his hands to the Merkel area .	-4.4463
The festival orchestra is a great applause , which is on stage for the first time - again in legendary leisure clothing in the face of the big heat .	-15.0599
The performance of Frank Castorf and his regional team was awaited with great anticipation .	-3.7072
In 2013 , if he had to make a yellow pipe concert , five years later , there was great anniversary in which the isolated " buh " calls were undermined .	-9.0495
Festival chef Katharina Wagner may have enjoyed this .	-3.1420
" You realize that the audience grew with the " ring " in a way , " she said just before the performance of the dpa .	-4.7391
Not only did the audience make a form of peace with Castorf , but it would also have grown an understanding of his vision .	-4.5798
I draw a positive response .	-2.1587

Very interesting .	-0.5524
And you had no fear of touching ?	-2.0458

Correspondents say that in recent weeks suicide bombings in Kabul have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , its policies , and in particular President Ashraf Ghani 's reputation .	-3.2676
EPA reverses decision to delay the smog rule after complaints	-3.4122
The US Environment Protection Agency has abolished a decision to delay the Obama administration ’ s regulation , whereby states are obliged to contain smog-causing emissions , one day after 15 states sued the Agency for step .	-5.9681
Late on Wednesday , the EPA announced the decision to advance the so-called ' ozone rules 2015 ' , and said it showed the Agency 's commitment to cooperate with states .	-5.0327
" We believe in dialogue with and in reacting to our state partners , " said EPA chief Scott Pruitt in a statement .	-9.5763
Pruitt announced in June the EPAs intended to delay the ozone rules - in which part of the country should measure pollutant emissions to determine where cuts need to be made to meet stricter air quality standards - by one year until October 2018 .	-4.4109
A group of 15 mostly democratic states , together with the Colombia district , filed a complaint on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .	-3.4960
President Donald Trump ’ s administration has tried to reduce a broad range of environmental requirements imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda to boost economic growth , according to Trump .	-4.0633
Efforts , however , have caused the Democrats and Natural Protection Groups to fear the effects of major emissions on public health .	-4.8835
The EPA website says that inhaling air containing ozone " can reduce lung functionality and increase breathing symptoms " such as asthma .	-11.9929
Community area	-2.2567
In the end , the decision was clear : in the case of two counter-votes , the municipal council of Fluorn-Winzel decided to set up a Community area in the future residential area .	-5.5406
Before the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase contract for the missing plot is signed , reports Mayor Bernhard Tjaden .	-5.0647
Although it will still take until the church parish is owned so far , there is no longer any planning obstacle to the project to be stemmed from a private investor .	-6.7854
There is a discussion on a Community area for this .	-3.1076
One of the two investors still in the boat has offered to meet the municipality .	-2.9329
On the ground floor it would provide a living area of approximately 55 square meters and an adjacent terrace with an area of 70 square meters for a special price .	-4.1748
The Administration and the majority of the municipal council are insisting that such a Community area should not be considered a meeting place only for the residents of the residents of the low-sensitivity , but open to the community .	-9.8010
As an example , the word of " Strickcafé " made the round .	-3.5597
The decision made last autumn by allocating funds to the current budget will be sweetened by means of support .	-5.2717
The building is located in the reconstruction area .	-2.6065
The establishment of a Community area , Tjaden says , would be eligible for 60 % of 30 % .	-4.9956
The proposal for a decision to signal to the investor that he is not going to be thrown between the legs in this respect , establishing that both saddle and pult roof , which would reduce volume levels and make construction more economic , would be possible .	-7.4456
Needless to say , not only Wilfried Sohmer says , this addition is .	-3.6730
When it 's helping : Unanimously he passes the board .	-4.4991
It is not as easy as the Community area .	-2.6350
Daniela 's reputation refers to the many own buildings with which we are not so much advanced , for which we are now leaning out of the window in the Community area , she says : ' I am hard to do so ' .	-7.2457
Yvonne Staiger is absolutely opposed to communal participation .	-2.9238
It sees this as a hidden subsidy to already assets or even foreign investors .	-3.1611
This is not the case , because the acquisition of the surface does not give a grant , but gets a real value , if doubtless marketable , is the counterpart .	-6.2730
Staiger ’ s request to split up the proposal accordingly has three supporters .	-4.6536
There are two opposing votes in the original programme , which Mr Haller summarises : ' If we take the decision in this way , we will make a huge step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure ' .	-5.6250
Collision with Car : Cycling on the street	-2.7700
On Wednesday in Garath , a 82-year-old cyclist was captured by a car and seriously injured .	-3.4892
As the police said , the 82-year-old Langenfelder had travelled by 12.20 p.m. with his bicycle on the road Black Way from the direction of Hilden .	-5.5711
The senior wanted to cross the cable car in the altitude of the Am Buchholzer Busch street .	-3.8678
A passenger car leader in the same direction granted him priority .	-8.4198
When the Langenfelder drove to the street , he obviously did not pay attention to counter-traffic .	-5.7279
He met a car that controlled a 66-year-old Hildener.	-3.1044
The man was smelled into the street .	-7.7274
He suffered serious injuries and was brought to a hospital with a bailout car .	-3.4417
FC Bavaria Munich must abandon David Alaba and Thiago in the Supercup against Borussia Dortmund .	-3.1994
The Supercup takes place without him : David Alaba must put the game against Dortmund .	-3.3890
With staffing care the FC Bavaria is going to Dortmund for the first duty game of the new season .	-4.0922
Seven professionals are missing the title defender in the supercup against the winner of .	-3.7338
The staffing concerns of the German football record master Bavaria Munich are getting bigger and bigger before the supercup on Saturday ( 20.30 am / ZDF and Eurosport ) at Pokalsieger Borussia Dortmund .	-5.1733
Trainer Carlo Ancelotti also has to do without David Alaba in the duel .	-11.1927
This was confirmed by the Italians on Fri.	-1.9156
Moreover , Munich 's Manuel Neuer , James , Thiago , Jerome Boateng , Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat are missing .	-2.9948
Ancelotti was responsible for the five defeats in the last six test games and the lack of balance in the game of his team .	-5.0130
" We know that we are not in the best physical constitution , " said Ancelotti and added : " The most important point is the balance in the team .	-2.5050
It was not good at the last ' .	-7.9218
However , the 58-year-old believes in an increase in performance in the first official season duty game .	-12.0822
" Football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation .	-1.2268
I have great faith in my team showing these qualities .	-2.4222
The team is ready .	-0.8625
We want to play intelligently , " said Ancelotti , who expects a " difficult , intense game " .	-2.3983
The duel of the two German football weights attracts the fans in their bands .	-3.4170
The game is sold out with 81,360 spectators , informed the German Football League ( DFL ) on Friday .	-3.5144
Walking from Star to Stern	-7.3661
The first " Star Trail " will be created in the Harz nationwide .	-5.6955
This is what the Association Starwarte Sankt Andreasberg plans to do .	-3.4354
A planet path exists in Göttingen - since 2003 .	-2.9156
A " Star Trail " would meet the information needs of many resin visitors , it said .	-5.0007
It combines nature , science , movement and sporting performance .	-1.6349
Members want to set up tables along the planned route and inform about stars and constellations .	-5.2220
In the first phase until 2018 , the association plans to " accessible installations in five to six places " in the upper resin .	-4.8004
Inquire St. Andreasberg , Braunlage , Hoheigeiss and Sieber .	-3.6011
The information on the tables should be supplemented via the Internet .	-2.7394
This is why a good mobile network reception is playing a role in the selection of location .	-4.7128
Freedom of accessibility is also a criterion .	-0.9845
Later , the Star Trail Trail should be extended by train .	-4.7341
" On the Star Trail , the viewers learn a lot of interesting things , for example , about the physics of the individual stars , " said the association .	-12.6071
They also learned why stars had different colors , or why a star shines stronger than another , though it is far further away .	-5.7662
It is also conveyed in which constellation a selected star is located and when it is best to see .	-5.4255
Since 2014 , the association has been operating the highest star wait in northern Germany in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg .	-5.3216
The location in the middle of the National Park Harz is one of the six darkest regions in Germany , according to the Federal Office for Nature Reservation .	-9.9031
Often there are the Milky Way and even the Andromeda galaxy with a mere eye .	-4.2474
Since 2003 , at the initiative of the Planetarium Göttingen Association , there is something similar to the planned Star Werke - the PlanetWerke .	-12.5414
Starting in front of Gebhards Hotel in the Goethallee , which forms the interior of our solar system , the Planetenweg with its steels leads up to the Hainberg and to the Starwart - as well as an " outside " site in Diemarden ( municipality of equals ) with the planet Sedna .	-6.2883
The steels with the individual planets - including the pluto degraded to the dwarf planet at the end point - are set precisely at the distance and scale of one to two billion .	-4.7212
The earth thus shrinks on a ball of 6.5 millimetres in diameter , while the exact 75 metres away sun measures 70 centimetres .	-4.5421
The entire distance of the planet route is about four kilometres .	-3.3936
Whereas light from sun to pluto takes about eight hours , pedestrians need a good hour to the steel with pluto .	-3.8713
Pedestrians are faster than light in everyday life .	-2.8881
The march to the next fixed star would take half a year .	-2.7074
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time , discuss a possible showdown .	-1.6100
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia , who should be in a collision course to staged the most exciting boxing campaign in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .	-4.7440
They were in separate rooms in ESPN offices in Los Angeles , until Garcia , the unbeaten World Boxing Council Champion , went down the hall to welcome Lomachenko , the World Boxing Organization Super-Federweight Champion .	-3.9892
After Garcia 's victory by unanimous decision on the former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday at Showtime , both fighters are members of the top five pound for pound list .	-4.3981
Garcia stretched the right hand and said : " How do you , Champion ?	-3.3221
I wish you good luck . '	-1.3102
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday evening at 7 p.m. on ESPN .	-2.2783
When the pair position for photos , Lomachenko manager Egis Klimes noticed that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the " perfect scale " .	-3.7617
" I 'm a former spring weight , " Garcia reminded me .	-2.2162
" I rose for Broner [ to 140 pounds ] , but I 'm not so big .	-3.2021
I am small for 140 .	-0.9134
I would like to come down to light weight .	-2.6486
And he must move on light weights [ 135 pounds ] and then we fight .	-2.8275
That is what fans are asking for .	-2.0290
Let us give them that . '	-1.0110
Lomachenko agreed .	-1.2019
'Boxes need this fight ' .	-2.5462
Climate asked whether it should be on Pay-per-View , part of a strategy that Lomachenko must fight with a 135 pound debut this year to agree with Garcia next summer ( 37-0 , 30 knockouts ) , which also has interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight title in the forum on September 23 .	-4.6927
" This struggle could take place in Pay-per-View mode , because all fans asked for it , " Garcia said and later expressed openly fighting the network that offers the best financial package .	-4.5174
We are the best .	-0.6105
No other name can generate this kind of attention .	-1.9724
Whenever they are ready ... "	-1.1188
Garcia said he appreciated Lomachenko as " an enormous fighter " , and he may be taking part in his Saturday battle .	-4.3245
But Lomachenko stayed with the generous praise for Garcia and said that he thought the triumph champion from Riverside look " very slow , sorry Mikey ... you wanted the co-out " .	-5.4278
Garcia said that the focus is to show shockness , then boxes .	-3.4404
Both said that they could feel the momentum that built up for their own battle .	-2.5168
" This is the struggle that must be undertaken .	-3.7653
No other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm .	-1.6570
I am more than happy to work on it , " said Garcia .	-1.8509
Lomachenko said : " I waited for the top fighters , and that is Mikey .	-2.0270
It will be a great battle ' .	-6.5628
Four Injured to Reifenplatzer	-1.9764
In an accident on the A7 , four people on Thursday afternoon were sometimes seriously injured .	-3.0204
After the first information , the driver of an Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle at 4.30 p.m. shortly before the market width port , probably after a tire placer .	-5.7388
The car went to the right into the evil , where it surpassed and then stayed on the roof in the green strip .	-6.0234
The four inmates - two adults and two children - were sometimes seriously injured in the accident .	-2.2328
During the first supply of the injured by the rescue service , the A7 was closed north for about an hour and then traffic could be passed on the left road at the accident site .	-5.4807
Fortunas Hoffmann : ' Triple works better '	-1.5166
After 2 : 2 , Andre Hoffmann hopes that the optimization of defense formations in Aue brings points to the start of the season against Braunschweig .	-5.3524
Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the first season game , with the result also , if not the two opposing gates at 2 : 2 were against Braunschweig .	-5.2608
" These were two opposing gates too much , and we need to be more careful in the eye , " says the defender of Fortuna Düsseldorf .	-4.6894
In the Erzgebirge , the three-chain should be further optimized .	-4.4958
And a gate after a free-cast does not want to capture the fortuns any more .	-9.9173
" For the future it will be so that no one will put himself on the line alongside Michael ( Rensing ) . "	-11.5824
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better able to handle than with the four chain , even after the experience of preparing the triple chain .	-5.7952
" I don 't know how we will act in Aue " , says his trainer Friedhelm Funkel , but Hoffmann is sure of his thing , " because we have just in the triple chain on the half positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gie<unk>elmann players who can build well , " said Hoffmann .	-5.1695
'It is a prerequisite , but that we harmonise even better and do not afford so many mistakes in the construction ' .	-5.8683
Of course , Hoffmann also runs to Aue to win the game .	-3.0021
" Whether you can speak of a failed start after a draw is not clear .	-4.7290
The performance could well be okay , " Hoffmann said .	-3.9882
" If we are on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the cup , we will certainly be able to speak of a proper start to the season . "	-5.3333
His trainer did not want to know about this .	-3.2278
" I judge the start of the season only after six to eight days of play , " said Friedhelm Funkel , who does not want to speak of an advantage vis-à-vis Aue just because the game of the Saxons in Heidenheim had to be cancelled prematurely because of a storm .	-6.1356
" Now they can start the season almost with a home game , " said Funkel and Hoffmann believed that Aue players could be even more fresh , because they would not have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against a promotion favorite in the bone .	-6.4918
" But they don 't know 100 % where they are , " says the interior defender of Fortuna .	-3.4035
It is true that guests from the Rhineland go into the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stage of Aue as a lighter favorite on Sunday .	-5.5599
" The fact that we are cutting them out just because we are entitled to come under the first six is utter nonsense , " says Funkel , whose balance sheet is very positive in just one defeat against Aue from nine games .	-8.2842
" There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga to beat from the start , " explains Fortunas Chefcoach .	-4.4012
'Such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant ' .	-1.8743
And so Funkel never wants to see his players on Sunday .	-9.1307
New Results of Swedish Asylum Evaluation Tests	-3.3413
The recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , which have undergone a new method of medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 % of the tested people are over 18 years old , but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .	-4.2259
The Swedish Authority for Forensic Medicine ( Councillor Market ) started testing last year .	-4.0366
They should be more precise during the asylum procedure after the Swedish immigration authority has been criticised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were inferior .	-5.3529
To date , migration sales have sent 6,880 cases to be tested , and the Forensic Medicine Agency has released the results of a total of 2,481 tests from the mid-March to 31st July 2017 .	-4.0465
Eighty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the person was " possibly 18 years or older " .	-3.0122
In 432 cases , the conclusion was that the person is ' possibly under the age of 18 ' .	-2.5440
The tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .	-3.3446
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency , the results have been consistent in recent months .	-1.9581
" We see no big difference in the statistics of recent months , the figures are fairly constant , " he said The Local magazine .	-2.6703
The high percentage of cases in which the person was judged over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has lied over his age .	-3.0153
In May , the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases that " propose that the person investigated be 18 years or older " .	-3.2567
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet investigated the 581 published results , it found that in 243 of these cases , the person had frankly said that it would be 18 years old this year .	-3.4740
The method of medical age assessment , where X-ray recordings are made of wisdom teeth and MRT pictures of knee joints , which are then analysed by dentists and radiologists , has also been criticised in some areas .	-5.1157
A skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute , whose work includes the assessment of the biological maturity of humans to see if , sooner or later , they were usually puberty .	-4.7029
" I had reason to think about this , and I do not believe that the type of measurement should be used .	-2.7940
Assessing biological age in this way is very uncertain .	-2.6923
If we cannot say it safely , we should not pretend we could , " he said the newspaper Metro .	-3.1915
Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of the tests : " In general , you can say that the risk of a child being incorrect as adults is low .	-10.9153
The biggest risk is if the person is just under 18 , in this case it is about 10 % ' .	-4.1037
Full in Plan	-1.5900
Work on the three bridges of the road 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well .	-2.5985
On Wednesday a seven tonnes of heavy concrete was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach .	-2.6224
" We are very good at the time , it runs super " , says Reinhold Leicht , building manager at the Road and Transport department in the government Presidency of Freiburg .	-5.2688
In April , the works began simultaneously on all three bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach , which were in need of renovation .	-3.8321
The construction end is scheduled for October and light is sure to keep to the timetable .	-4.5534
The first bridge , coming from Schramberg , leads across the Trombach .	-2.0955
It is a vaulted bridge made of concrete with red stone and has a total length of 4.80 meters .	-5.2232
It was built in 1900 .	-0.9580
Like the other two bridges , it has come into the years .	-2.8075
In order to ensure stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly refurbished .	-3.8579
The other two bridges pass through the Lauterbach .	-1.8645
They are made of red stone .	-2.7179

The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach has now received a bridge cap of 1.30 meters wide and seven tonnes on the north side on Wednesday morning .	-4.9047
This is a marginal fixing which is also used as a operating route .	-4.6629
On the southern part of the bridge a 2.20 meter wide bridge cap is to be used on Friday .	-3.9988
That is what the pedestrian route should be like .	-3.1146
Particularly because these are finished parts , a patent of the Schramberger company Dizwo .	-3.5451
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps .	-2.8262
The laying of lines by the construction in Lauterbach has made a special sense of finger .	-4.2359
Because there is also a glass fibre cable , to which many companies are connected .	-3.1312
The residents were informed about the project in advance of the work by hand papers .	-3.7181
In addition , fish and cancer first had to be fished .	-3.1328
For the bridges between the Bauhofbaum building and the gathering weight towards Schramberg , traffic is regulated by an traffic path .	-5.8389
For construction work on the bridge at the Lauterbach entrance , the street is fully locked in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels " Tannenhof " and " Sieben Linden " .	-4.8776
The cost of the three bridge sinks is EUR 700 000 together .	-9.5763
Financed by the country as a whole .	-2.7980
AfD in Gerolstein : Bunter Protest at German potato salad	-3.7905
It is not so often the case that parties are pulling together , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( AfD ) , something that is difficult to bring together otherwise .	-6.4496
The parties ( CDU , SPD , Green , FDP , FWG , Left ) represent a broad alliance that this day shows peacefully flag , because the AfD in the Gerolstein Stadthalle Rondell invites the " great campaign opening " .	-6.5184
And well-known names at the start - such as Alice Weidel , who , together with Alexander Gauland , forms the top duo for the federal election on September 24 , and the Deputy Chairman Beatrix von Storch .	-5.1933
But those who are on the spot hours before the event started do not want to listen to the AfD-lers , but to demonstrate .	-5.0487
The motto " The Eifel remains colorful " .	-2.0555

This is a colourful picture .	-2.9274
And what Christa Karoli , chairman of the Forum A World and one of the leading organizers , is really pleased : " Toll how many people have come together here " .	-4.3369
There is music and lots of food , including an " Urdeutsche Potato salad , which the AfD could also eat without difficulty " , says the woman who brought him .	-12.4051
The police have ordered a lot of officials to Gerolstein , especially at the railway station , which is only a few metres from the venues .	-5.3485
How did the AfD actually come to Gerolstein ?	-2.0911
Mario Hompes of the AfD Vulkaneifel reported that he has sought such an event and received the supplement .	-4.5032
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf initially asked Daun , but got a rejection there because of the already built Laurentiuskirmes there were not enough parking spaces .	-5.5999
Now the Rondell , Hompes is pleased that " we can have such a nice event here " .	-3.4424
In view of the event on the Rondellvorplatz he says : " This is the good right of people , the main thing , it remains peaceful " .	-3.8676
This is also true : at 8 p.m. , the Rondellvorplatz has a band for entertainment , in the city hall several speakers , including the Rhineland-Palälzische AfD chairman Uwe Young .	-5.8869
There are about 200 listeners waiting for the top candidate for the election , Alice Weidel , and the Deputy Chairman Beatrix of Storch to deliver their speeches .	-5.1565
The police presence is unchanged , but until now the officials have had a quiet evening .	-2.7703
The AfD event lasts a little more than an hour , the guests on the premises have a longer breath , but also there is a short time after 21 o 'clock .	-6.8732
The police can depart - not special events .	-3.1232

" Today I will tell you with many prayers and many reflections ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia , I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor . "	-3.5777
The rally broke out in Jubel .	-2.1117
" Tomorrow I will change my registration with the Republicans , " adds justice .	-2.1536
" As a trainer I would say that it is time to play another game . "	-2.5657
Mr. Trump promised a big announcement at the West Virginia Rallye .	-3.4144
Mr. Trump won West Virginia with 42 points , and justice did not approve the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton .	-2.1338
Justice , which , according to Forbes , is the only billionaire in the state , was elected in 2016 .	-1.7758
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states , and his father inherited a coal business .	-4.0613
It is worth about $ 1.59 billion .	-0.9739
Meanwhile , on Thursday evening , the Republican National Committee issued a declaration stating that ' Governor Justice 's Party Change is another blow to a Democratic Party that would hinder us rather than work to revive our country . '	-5.5051
" With only 15 governments and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Governor Justice is only the last rejection of a party that is out of the top to the bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive , unifying message , " said RNC Chairman Ronna McDaniel , in a statement , the CBS News .	-5.3935
Coe praises ' honest ' Russian apology for doping scandal	-2.4735
The global leader of the Athletics , Sebastian Coe , praised on Thursday , which he described as a blatant excuse from Russia for a doping scandal , but he reiterated that it was not the moment for the country to return to sport .	-4.8622
Russia ’ s athletic leader , Dmitry Shylakhtin , said during the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Championships that banning his country from sport was correct and that he was determined to combat doping .	-13.5782
He said he is sorry for " all athletes who were scarred from competitions of gold and silver medals " .	-4.0427
Despite his comments , the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia .	-2.9956
" I thought it was a very open response today , a very honest presentation , " said IAF President Coe to the reporters .	-2.1968
" The entire Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation recognised by itself that it had some fairly hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation was redesigned . "	-16.1512
Coe said he was also ' delighted ' that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction .	-3.2142
" I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been made , but the Congress supports the recommendations of the task force that this is not the time to re-use Russia , " said Coe .	-13.3758
" We must do everything in the coming months to normalise this situation .	-2.3894
The guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate clean athletes from the spoiled system , " he added .	-2.5961
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete as neutral actors at the World Championship in London on Friday , according to the strict IAF criteria .	-4.6782
The head of the IAF-Task Force , Rune Andersen , said on Monday that Russia must meet some of the criteria for recruitment .	-3.1967

Murious act for troops crashed in Mali	-3.2127
A grief celebration in Fritzlar , North Hesse , meant about 1000 people from the two soldiers who died in a helicopter crash in Mali .	-6.0594
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the Domstadt under high safety precautions .	-2.5270
Defense Secretary Ursula of the Leyen ( CDU ) said nothing about the crash that has not been resolved .	-5.4850
However , she called the two pilots who died as " Can their trade " .	-6.5431
" We are sending ourselves to this highest sacrifice they have made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany , " she explained .	-4.3781
The 33-year-old Major and the 47-year-old Northern Hesse staff died on Wednesday a week ago in West African Mali .	-3.0280
Their coffins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a federal defence guard in Fritzlarer Dom Sankt Peter .	-4.8845
In the afternoon only the members of the church took away .	-4.6925
Then the festival began in the circle of the family , close friends , representatives of the German armed forces and politics .	-5.4514
Among them were Hessen ’ s prime minister Volker Bouffier ( CDU ) and the general inspector of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker .	-3.2093
Traugers laid down roses , the relatives stood in arm at the coffins .	-5.3963
Fritzlarer and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a screen .	-3.0547
Defense Secretary of Defense of the Leyen described the surrounding soldiers as " highly decorated " and deployed .	-4.7049
The chief of staff have built up the aircraft operations of the Tiger combat helicopter in Fritzlar and had been one of the first six trained tiger pilots in his regiment .	-5.6817
Volker Bauersachs , commander of the regime to which the soldiers belong , also said : ' If this occupation could not avert the crash , it would not have been possible ' .	-5.1622
Doubts about the UN mission in Mali did not show Minister of the Leyen : deployment is dangerous .	-2.6807
But it is also of great importance ' for a country that we are only separated from by two states ' , she said .	-4.1602
After the ceremony , the coffins were taken from the cathedral .	-4.1569
When and where they are placed , the Federal Army did not provide any information about this .	-5.0689
Prince Henrik does not want a tomb next to his wife	-2.0548
The man of the Danish Queen Margrethe ( 77 ) , Prince Henrik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death .	-2.7115
The Königshaus announced this on Thursday .	-2.8739
Traditionally the Danish royal pair is buried in the Cathedral Church of Roskilde .	-3.8451
The sculptor Bj<unk>rn N<unk>rgaard already completed a sarcophagus for the two .	-2.0447
The Queen agreed to the decision of her husband , it was stated in the communication .	-4.0979
Where Prince Henrik is buried is still unclear .	-1.5313
But he does not intend to be buried in his French home .	-2.5347
Prince Henrik never made a saint of it that he was not happy with his title .	-3.4557
After the throne ascent of his wife Margrethe in 1972 he would like to become king .	-2.6628
In 2016 , he retired , placing the title " Prinzgemühl " .	-4.7997
Henrik did not get the title and function he wanted in Denmark , but he did not see himself as equivalent to his wife - not even after death , Lene Balleby , the chief spokesperson of the Danish Royal House .	-5.7147
Where the last retirement of the 83 age will eventually be unclear .	-4.0928
But he does not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .	-2.7073
He likes the country for which he has worked over the last 50 years .	-2.2442
Henri de Laborde de Monpezat , son of a French noble sex , had met Margrethe in London in 1965 .	-2.5598
He worked at the Thames in the French Embassy .	-2.0633
During his later wife , Prinz Henrik had a very difficult standing with the Danes in his almost 50 reign .	-7.1736
In an autobiography Henrik said about the first years in Denmark : " Few months after my arrival , everything I did was criticised .	-3.1133
My Danish was fluctuating , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk stocks instead of knocks , citro<unk>n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .	-3.1590
Even for the Gauloises I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation of being the brand of social-critical intellectuals , I could not hope for forbearance .	-4.9727
I was different .	-0.8495
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not to be ashamed .	-7.6718

Prime Minister Weil wants rapid re-election	-1.2001
CDU and FDP before a possible majority in Lower Saxony	-1.4683
Lower Saxony ’ s Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) , after the loss of the red-green majority of the government , is in favour of a rapid re-election of the land day , but he will not resign .	-4.7830
Because it was on Friday that Parliament should be disbanded .	-3.6635
Previously , the surprising departure of a Green MEP from her country group in Lower Saxony had plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .	-4.0185
Five months before the official date of the election , the Red Green Coalition in Hannover lost its scarce one vote majority in Parliament to the opposition from CDU and FDP .	-4.1346
The previous Green MEP Elke Twesten founded her step with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg ( Wümme ) .	-4.4251
" I see my political future in the CDU , " she said on Friday in Hannover .	-2.1306
CDU group leader Björn Thümler wishes to recommend that his group accept them .	-3.8594
This means that CDU and FDP together would have 69 seats in the Lower Saxony , SPD and Green Seats .	-4.4093
So far , the ratio has been reversed .	-2.3096
The new Landtag will be elected regularly on 14 January next year .	-2.8953
Thümler said that the red-green state government must now decide whether it can continue to govern without a majority in this situation .	-3.3929
However , Stephan Weil believes that it is vital that the Landday decides on its self-resolution as soon as possible .	-5.7472
The CDU Group is expected to decide on further action on Tuesday .	-2.3734
The national constitution also provides for the possibility that Landtag will deprive the Prime Minister of trust and elect a successor .	-4.7490
" Our Constitution offers several options .	-1.3782
These possibilities must be properly examined by law , " said Thümler .	-3.1066
'People will be discussing all questions in peace if they are legally sound . '	-5.4401
Thümler called Twesten step " but rather kurios " .	-2.8243
The politician himself said : ' I am not a traitor .	-2.2676
I feel very good ' .	-1.2546
She was a fan of black green .	-2.9942
The Greens asked the refused Members to return their country 's mandate .	-3.5001
" We assume , of course , that she returns her country mandate , which she received through the green country list , with immediate effect , " said the state chairman Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner .	-5.3631
The Group Chairman of the Greens / European Free Alliance Anja Piel said : ' We regret Elke Twesten 's decision extremely ' .	-3.7728
You have deliberately chosen not to have a debate in the group .	-2.4703
'Even against the background that there were no differences in substance , we cannot understand this step ' .	-3.7652
SPD Chancellor Martin Schulz condemns the resignation of the Lower Saxon Green Members Elke Twesten to the CDU as a betrayal .	-3.8831
" The behaviour of the former Green MEPs in Lower Saxony is not only a betrayal of the electorate , but also a betrayal of Red Green , " wrote to the Chairman of the Social Democrats on Friday on Facebook .	-4.6462
He supports Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) ’ s decision to quickly re-elect the country day .	-3.2289
Twedest 's exit costs Rot-Green in Lower Saxony the majority .	-4.1346
The politician ' in her injured vanity and in her frustration her personal interests before the country 's well-being ' , SPD Secretary-General Hubertus Heil criticized .	-4.7361
" It is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony is participating in this dirty intrinsic game and is trying to capitalize on it " .	-4.1668
In Lower Saxony , CDU leader Björn Thümler would recommend that Elke Twesten be included in the CDU .	-3.5023
The leader of the PPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Oppermann , accused Twesten of distorting the outcome of the 2013 election with personal career remembrance .	-4.6641
At that time , the CDU was the strongest force before the SPD , but the SPD and the Greens had a slightly thin majority of one vote in the land day .	-6.1206
Agriculture Minister in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from toxic pegs , Mr Schmidt ?	-3.4543
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs .	-1.0318
How did the scandal happen ?	-1.1188
How can consumers protect themselves .	-0.7953
Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt ( CSU ) is interviewed with the editorial network Deutschland ( RND ) speech and response .	-2.8774
Mr Schmidt , how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs ?	-1.5600
I can only encourage all consumers to look closely at the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp pressure .	-2.6222
In the Consumer Protection Portal www.Food Warnung.de , the federal states provide the latest information on the affected egg charges .	-4.7799
Eggs affected should be destroyed or returned .	-1.6855
Even if everything we know at the moment is virtually excluded from health risks .	-3.7495
Does Aldi now take on the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of supply - because the central role of the enlightener is not really perceived by the Federal Agriculture Minister ?	-4.2410
Food surveillance is the responsibility of the federal states .	-1.6734
Nevertheless , my House has switched on immediately and has been in close exchange with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of the concern of Germany .	-5.4718
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers .	-2.1491
Trade , like manufacturers , must ensure that the products sold are transportable and health safe .	-4.0926
If eggs have exceeded the maximum residue content of 0.005mg / kg , they are not transportable .	-3.5638
Unburdened eggs can be sold and eaten .	-2.8367
This time , businesses are not to blame .	-2.0945
Do manufacturers and consumers sit on the same boat ?	-2.6424
At the present level of expertise , production companies are not directly to blame .	-4.4105
Instead , they must face economic damage due to supposed illegal practices by service companies .	-3.6865
As always , there are too few controllers in the event of emergency .	-3.0712
Is it only the staff or the coherent competence ?	-3.2964
It was , after all , the official controls that revealed this .	-3.3425
The truth , however , is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 % excluded .	-2.4514
It is precisely for this reason that a consistent clarification of such events and the handing over to public prosecutors in cases where criminal offences are possible is crucial .	-6.1878
I have already made it clear on several occasions that I expect full information from the authorities responsible .	-3.4476
Is regular alarmism in food scandals really necessary ?	-1.9211
Consumers have the right to receive only safe and transportable food .	-2.9660
If an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly outraged .	-2.9182
The exchangeable means have put manufacturers , traders and consumers in a situation that is absolutely unnecessary .	-5.0415
Basically , it must be clear that the unlawful use of the insecticide Fronil in the attitude of food-supplying animals is unacceptable and must be brought to an end immediately .	-4.2347
We must work on this at all levels in a consistent and high-pressure manner .	-3.9536
I expect all the relevant authorities to inform the situation quickly and completely .	-4.4194
How the financial rules of the football affect Neymar ’ s move to Paris	-2.3343
The rules aimed at preventing unhindered expenditure from European football clubs will not disrupt Neymar ’ s World Record Transfer from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris saint Germain .	-10.5671
Something else will still have consequences for Paris Saint-Germain of UEFA , because the leader who supervised the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .	-6.0788
Financial fair play rules established by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will eventually have to prove that the transfer of Neymar was financed without great losses .	-3.9598
Barcelona has paid EUR 222 million ( $ 262 million ) to buy the Brazilian out of its treaty , and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to $ 10 million per year .	-10.5342
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar ’ s move to France .	-1.4046
PSG can certainly make the money easier to sign Neymar and bring him into a galaxy of other stars , given the financing of the team by the energy rich family of rulers of Qatar .	-4.5580
Associations may spend a lot of money on buying players , but they must counteract legitimate sources of revenue that allow them to make the break event point in their football business .	-6.2053
FFP was designed by Michel Platini in 2007 as a UEFA president .	-3.0036
The former French player believed that clubs that had taken huge debts in their quest for success were effectively cheating and risking ruining when banks or owners withdrew their support .	-4.8615
In 2011 , FFP shifted from concentrating on club debt to monitoring its losses .	-2.0337
The change meant that the business model originally used by Roman Abramovich in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested vigorously to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a tougher issue .	-3.9033
During the current three-year FFP investment period that runs until 2018 , clubs may accept a loss of EUR 30 million .	-3.2514
And , while Platini fell disgracefully from the presidency in 2015 , his UEFA successor , Aleksander Ceferin , continues to work to deter excessive spending .	-4.1511
" Certainly FFP is not dead and we will definitely strengthen the rules for the future , " said Andrea Traverso , who is responsible for FFP at UEFA , to The Associated Press last week .	-3.1148
Although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a flat rate , it can distribute the amount for the reporting of the accounts for the duration of its contract .	-4.8233
Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the five-year transfer fee for the next five years of EUR 44.4 million can be expelled in the annual accounts .	-4.6860
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 , together with Abu Dhabi , owned by Manchester City , hit the most severe sanctions .	-2.5707
The PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million ( then $ 82 million ) , which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season were limited to 21 players instead of the normal 25 players .	-4.6098
UEFA is in search of clubs that could try to overlist their financial supervision by inflating revenue from companies associated with the owners of a club .	-4.7841
Whereas a Catarian company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsorship was to exceed the standard market rates , UEFA would not make this a legitimate income .	-4.2522
This was precisely what happened in 2014 , when UEFA decided that the value of PSA sponsorship was blown up by the Qatar Tourism Authority .	-10.6993
It has been reported that some of the PSG payments to Neymar could come to Qatar on payments from the World Cup 2022 .	-12.8252
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar will become WM ambassadors and that such a manoeuvre could easily be found for UEFA regulators .	-3.4156
The previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules .	-3.2513
UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymar ’ s transfer , said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .	-3.3717
They spoke with The Associated Press on condition of anonymity , because they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation .	-3.0899
The last published reports show that PSG achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros in 2015 / 16 , with a turnover of EUR 542.4 million .	-3.8566
The accounts for the last fiscal year have yet to be published .	-2.3486
PSG expects Neymar ’ s arrival to be a blessing for sponsorship deals , merchandising , and trikot sales .	-1.9170
The association estimates that sales will increase by at least 30 % after signing .	-3.5208
The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players , and it tried to prevent Neymar ’ s move by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP .	-11.0032
" It is a clear case of " financial doping " with the club and the state , " said the President of La League , Javier Teba , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar 's last ownership of PSG .	-2.9301
Arsenal Manager Arsene Wenger , whose association is owned by an American sports tycoon , shares the reservations of La League against a state financing an association .	-2.6300
" It is the consequence of ownership and this has completely changed the entire football landscape over the last 15 years , " said Wenger on Thursday .	-3.0529
" Once a country has a club , everything is possible .	-2.2439
It is going to be very difficult to respect the financial fair play , because you can go different ways or have different interests when a country has such a large player to represent a country . '	-4.4572
Swiss is looking for a new Schoggi supplier	-3.4352
In recent years , Chocolate Frey Bord has produced chocolate for the Swiss .	-3.5598
Now sweet cooperation is coming to an end : the airline is rewriting the order .	-3.7240
Swiss-Speaker Meike Fuhlrott confirmed a corresponding report of the newspaper " Northwest Switzerland " from Friday on request of the news agency sda .	-4.2272
According to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .	-1.9781
The products would be checked every two to three years and subject to quality control .	-2.8132
" We are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolate Frey , " said the speaker .	-2.2268
About 17 million small red white wrapped chogging boards to 14 grams per year distribute the flight attendants to the passengers before landing .	-11.1674
Swiss did not want to provide information about the cost .	-3.3447
Industry insiders estimate the order volume according to " Northwest Switzerland " to 1.5 to 2 million francs - the Migros daughter generates annual sales of around one billion francs .	-4.9028
But the advertising effect is always more important : for a chog manufacturer it is a prestigious task .	-4.7009
The Swiss does not want to betray the number of applicants in the new tender .	-4.0728
But only Swiss manufacturers are eligible .	-8.3333
According to the newspaper report , Chocolate Frey wants to seek an overhaul of the Treaty beyond the spring of 2018 .	-3.1910
For the sda the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion .	-2.6806
Chocolate tables have been distributing the Swiss on board their flights since 2006 .	-2.3638
Before the Swiss concluded a contract with the Migros daughter , Barry Callebaut delivered the chocolate tablets in cooperation with Hug .	-2.8262
The possibility of placing the logo Swiss introduced two and a half years ago with the start of cooperation with Chocolat Frey .	-3.4500
The airline cooperates with various Swiss chocolate producers .	-2.0478
On long-haul flights , First Class customers are spoiled with delicacies by Confiserie Sprüngli , Business Class nasche passengers Schoggi von Lindt and in Economy Class Schoggi by Chocolat Frey .	-11.7434
Swiss Schoggi is also distributed by Chocolat Frey , both in business and in Economy Class .	-2.9375

The three-time world champion fights a medal in the final on Saturday .	-3.2973
His brother Christoph , Olympic Winner of 2016 , had failed in the national World Cup and could only look at the Diskus contest from the gallery .	-4.9604
Also with the first attempt , the Polish title defender Piotr Malachowski , who threw 65.13 meters wide , qualified for the final fight .	-12.3411
Nostalgia goes into the niche " Wet Hot American Summer " and " Comrade Detective " .	-2.8872
This repetition of history is nostalgic at the same time because of the glorious days of characters of the 1980s , for the 90-year-old grunge era ( when the thinkers David Wain and Michael Showalter showed the Sketch comedy " The State " for MTV ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , such as Elizabeth Banks , Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd , went to larger things .	-4.4468
As a cultural artifact , it is both a parody and a embodiment of our facebook-capable era of permanent memories .	-2.9877
But as a franchise it feels as if time was short .	-2.7477
" First Day of Camp " worked surprisingly well , not only because of its absurd humor ( it contained an original story for a speaking cane vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .	-2.8340
By fighting at the heart of the gag - middle-aged actors play horny children who will grow - they nevertheless created the impossibility of winning back the last part of the joke .	-5.5856
" Ten Years Later " , with its adults now playing adults , is less emotionally rooted , and his parody goes more to the scarf principle , including a reef on the Stalker movies of the 1990s like " The Hand That Rocks the Cradle " ( " The Hand that swings the cradle " ) .	-6.2116
At one point , a character crashes through an Apple Powerbook , some inline skates and " a number of other things from 1991 " .	-2.8668
Many of the central stories are the same .	-1.0709
The lovingly coop ( Mr. Showalter ) , now novelist , has not forgotten Katie ( Marguerite Moreau ) .	-3.5021
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost its virginity .	-1.9705
And there is another crazy malicious plot included in the Ronald Reagan ( also Mr. Showalter ) , now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good impression of Michael Ian Black ) .	-3.5963
As always , the excursions are the best part of the franchise .	-1.1354
It 's great fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rudd , the Matt Dillon 's underlip bard of " Singles " , whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old cracker .	-4.6485
They are the moments of accidental madness that this franchise could fuel like a kind of repetitive " Seven Up ! " series until he reaches what I take as his logical conclusion : " Wet Hot American Summer : Twenty Years Later " , whose last scene will show the band how she will visit the film premiere of " Wet Hot American Summer " .	-5.0131
" Comrade Detective " in Amazon now reminds of a different kind of nostalgia : the revival of the Cold War of " The Americans " , the film " Atomic Blonde " and even " GLOW " with its East / West Ringkamp-iconography .	-4.4681
The comedy with Rhys Thomas as director , created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka , indicates that he is a TV series found : a Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two police as friends , two Bucharest officers fighting for truth , atheism , and the path of Marxism-Lenism .	-4.7630
The main roles - a hard-saved Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici , whose dialogs are synchronized by Channing Tatum ( also an executive producer ) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English .	-3.8030
It is a brilliant idea .	-0.6480
But it is not much more than an idea .	-1.1605
There are some beautiful gags for reputation ( the police spend time watching chess on television , as Americans might do with soccer ) .	-5.0391
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate , Nick Offerman , Mahershala Ali and Chlo<unk> Sevigny - ensures a decent game of ' Find out the vote ' .	-2.7220
But Comrade Detective is so committed to the truth of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask - that it often plays like one .	-2.9541
In six long episodes , the comedy is not fast or frequent enough .	-3.1376
" Comrade Detective " , edited to a smaller length , could deliver its agitprop sairs better , as Gregor and Iosef always visit the American embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who swallow a bunch of Hamburg .	-5.6840
The message for the imagined Communist audience is that Western culture can make everything a feed for a gelage .	-3.7755
The fictious Romanian creators were not wrong : we are even doing it with our own recent history and with that of yours .	-3.7286
Battle against Drug Mafia	-1.9398
The police succeeded in attacking the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg .	-3.0989
On Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest Baar circle , Rottweil , Constance , Esslingen and Stuttgart , as the State Prosecutor Konstanz announced on Friday .	-3.7884
15 accused persons aged between 25 and 77 were arrested and arrested .	-10.3822
In addition , officials secured larger amounts of marijuana and cocaine , guns and hundreds of thousands of euros .	-3.2398
In the case of simultaneous raids in Italy two people were arrested .	-3.1058
German arrest warrants were issued against the two suspects of Italians .	-2.4235
The two are therefore probably delivered to Germany .	-2.4870
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action .	-1.7444
Over 300 police were in service .	-2.3863
The Mafia members are accused of organised drug crime , serious violence , tried murder and blackmail .	-3.7022
Since the summer of 2016 , the Prosecutor has been investigating Constance against organised drug trafficking in the south of Germany .	-4.0916
Between the public prosecutors in Constance and Palermo , there was a great deal of exchange and the investigators of Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .	-15.3568
That is why four Palermo officials accompanied the large-scale operation on Wednesday morning .	-3.8995
The studies were focused primarily on Italian citizens with close contact with the Italian mafia .	-5.0292
Also an incident in Hüfingen on 27 May , when several shots were fired in a restaurant early in the morning , will go to the band 's account .	-5.3275
The Way of Foreign Register	-3.6177
" Data from citizens who should not appear there " : According to a report , the foreign register in Germany has significant shortcomings .	-4.3744
This leads to some serious failure in asylum procedures .	-2.5384
The Federal Government 's Refugee Management Supervisor , Frank-Jürgen Würgen , has drawn attention to large gaps in the foreign central register .	-4.2647
Shortcomings in the data registered there could lead to some serious mistakes in asylum procedures and deportations , warning in an analysis submitted by the Southern German newspaper .	-5.2094
The register indicates that ten million people with foreign nationality , including some 5.7 million from non-EU countries .	-3.9938
The data is therefore managed by some 600 foreign authorities in Germany .	-3.5599
Because the data had not been sufficiently maintained , the quality of the data has not been good in parts .	-10.4011
In individual cases , data was found in 1921 , ' by people who have long since stopped alive , or by citizens who have become German citizens and who should not actually appear in the register ' .	-5.8678
" Faulty data input can slow down the return processes considerably " , says the report further .	-6.2179
Moreover , statistics on people who are expatriate have included EU citizens who do not have to leave .	-5.1340
However , such false allocations led to ' a distorted debate on the handling of expatriates ' , as the analysis states .	-5.7448
Meanwhile , the Federal Government appears to have begun to return refugee families with under 16 years of age to Italy when they arrived from there .	-3.8885
This is evident from an internal paper by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees ( BAMF ) , reports the " New Osnabrücker Zeitung " .	-10.5527
The paper therefore states that the BAMF is again conducting such procedures " concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and infants - to Italy since 1 June 2017 " .	-5.2763
Since the end of 2014 , this was practically no longer possible , as the newspaper pointed to the difficult situation on the ground .	-4.2029
Under the Dublin Agreement , refugees of the EU state are responsible for reaching them first .	-4.0605
When a migrant travels to another EU country , that state can return him to the country of entry .	-3.6329
To justify this , the office now writes : ' Meanwhile , the capacity to receive families with underage children in Italy has increased substantially ' .	-5.5560
Italy has made guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families .	-2.6562
Even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECHR ) considers these commitments to be sufficient .	-2.5684
Other EU countries would also send refugees back there under the Dublin Agreement .	-2.2165
The domestic spokesperson of the left-wing group in the Bundestag , Ulla Jelpke , criticised this decision : " Families with children are threatened by the shortcomings in the Italian asylum system of human rights conditions and a threat to child welfare " .	-5.5395
The Second Best Result	-2.2565
A total of 220 litres of blood from people living in Oberrienbach has already been provided by the blood donation service to others .	-10.0506
At least the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .	-3.2060
Jürgen Greule , who , with his 100 donations , now divided 50 litres blood .	-3.9715
Traditionally , the municipality appreciates the multiple willingness to donate blood at the meeting of the municipal council .	-3.6401
" It is brilliant how our body is designed for this and we pay tribute to the donors who make their blood available to strangers , even more unusual , " emphasized Mayor Karlheinz Kistner .	-5.4515
" A single donation helps several people " , explained by the German Red Cross Cross Circle Head , Holger Maisenbacher , because the conservatives are dismantled into their components .	-6.1072
As a result , three people could benefit from blood donations .	-3.2532
At the same time , Maisenbacher reported about the actions undertaken in Oberrienbach in spring .	-3.1899
" This year we achieved the second best result with 114 donors , " said the DRK chairman .	-3.5391
Obviously , a few years ago , the change to the theatre house led to higher participants .	-2.7394
Before that , Thomas Bockstadt , Susanne Reichle , Sandra Schöck , Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiple donors and were awarded for 50 donations each .	-3.4412
Half so many people use Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger , while Tamara Pflommer , Petra Schleeh , Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter gave ten times a 500 millilitres of their life juice .	-4.5069
The Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25 %	-1.3675
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and inflation weakening have dampened speculation over an rise .	-4.2823
The Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain " sluggish " when it maintained interest rates on family income in the middle of increased pressure .	-3.9152
The Bank ’ s Monetary Committee ( MPC ) policymakers voted , with 6 to 2 , to keep interest rates to 0.25 % , with fewer members this month seeking an increase , as weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase .	-3.7217
In its quarterly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts to 1.7 % in 2017 and 1.6 % in 2018 , warning that the pressure on household income would continue , with inflation expected to rise to just under 3 % in the autumn .	-3.2436
But it signaled that in the next few years , interest rate hikes would be needed to curb Brexit inflation , and she said that credit costs might have to rise more than expected in financial markets .	-4.2515
Members also voted to withdraw part of the Mammot stimulus package issued a year ago after Brexit .	-2.9932
It will demand time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources to banks from next February , although it has been said that it is now expected to provide GBP 15 billion more within the framework of this system , with GBP 115 billion .	-4.7528
Minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : " In the central forecast of the MPC , GDP remains weak in the short term , as the pressure on household real incomes continues to burden consumption . "	-13.1344
On interest rates , it reiterated that ' a certain tightening of monetary policy ' would be needed to cool inflation and a ' slightly larger ' scale than markets expect .	-4.3209
Markets are currently predicting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .	-2.2797
However , the Bank stressed that increases would be ' gradual ' and ' limited ' .	-2.3688
The downward growth forecasts of the Bank for this and next year are compared to the 1.9 % forecast in May and 1.7 % .	-2.9845
It maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .	-1.4595
The pound fell against the dollar and the euro following these news .	-3.6347
The pound fell by 0.5 % to $ 1.31 and fell by 0.4 % to € 1.11 .	-1.8127
The decision will not be amended after the recent disappointing growth figures have dampened the rising expectations of a rate hike and GDP rose to 0.3 % in the previous three months , from 0.2 % in the second quarter .	-5.2031
Growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , even though it will slightly recover by the end of the year after the Bank . .	-9.4155
The recent inflation report provided little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and minor salary increases , as the tightening becomes even worse before it becomes better .	-5.2374
It added that monetary policy cannot " prevent income fall " in the next few years , but it added that wages will " recover clearly " at the end of their three-year forecast .	-8.5672
The economy is also bolstered by rising demand for British goods , owing to the weak pound , which will compensate part of lower consumer spending .	-4.3330
The decision comes one year after the lowering of interest rates to 0.25 % last August , following the shocking EU vote that caused the pound to decline .	-3.4612
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years for this to fully achieve prices and the economy .	-2.3975
Before the Bank ’ s last judgment on interest rates , the call for an increase in interest rates grew , as inflation increased the pressure on hard-pressed households , with three policymakers demanding an increase to 0.5 % in July .	-3.9479
Last month , inflation fell from 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % , even though the Bank said that it was expected and would attract it again in the coming months .	-3.7975
The Bank said that exceeding in proportion to its 2 % target is " entirely " attributable to the weak pound .	-3.5975
Andrew Montlake , director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers , said : " With the recent fall in swap rates , the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again , as lenders loudly look for business and want to end the year in a positive way .	-4.3931
The market looks particularly good for those who are phasing out the existing deals and finishing the new mortgages , and many with free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . '	-4.4595
NHS ( National Health Service ) is supposed to prescribe 10,000 contentious HIV drugs .	-2.6533
Patients will have access to a " transformative " HIV prevention treatment from September after a fight before the High Court against financing the NHS medicine .	-4.6005
NHS England announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 % , will now be delivered by the health service through an estimated first three-year study of 10,000 people .	-5.5348
He agreed to finance the process after the appeal court confirmed last year a ruling by the Supreme Court that the NHS had the power to pay for the PrEP despite the claim that local authorities should finance it .	-3.8178
The move announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England-chief Simon Stevens as " important new intervention " , while the National AIDS Trust ( NAT ) called this a " decisive moment " .	-4.0993
Sexual health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool , and Sheffield will be among the first to enable people to register , and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 .	-3.4141
Pre-exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .	-3.2702
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission for infectious people .	-2.5935
Taking PrEP before sex means that there are just enough drugs in a person 's body to prevent HIV infection .	-3.7197
Such drugs can be taken every day or two hours before sexual intercourse .	-2.7272
Those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men , transsexuals and persons with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated .	-3.0021
Clinics identify suitable participants who agree with the study , including men , women , transgenders and individuals with a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment .	-3.0361
People who live in England and are registered with a house doctor can register for possible participation in their local sexual clinic .	-3.9335
The program will be <unk> 10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply medicines this week following international competitive procurement .	-3.3028
The study is intended to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence , as used , recorded and implemented on a large scale .	-4.6693
Stevens said : " This great new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .	-2.4575
It is another milestone in the progress made over three decades in tackling one of the greatest health challenges facing humanity . '	-3.7267
Deborah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National AIDS Trust ) , said : " This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .	-2.2432
PrEP , if targeted at people in need and at risk , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic .	-3.7792
From September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-financed attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is truly controlled individually and not subject to negotiation with a partner , which will improve many lives .	-4.6869
We warmly welcome this announcement . '	-1.2357
Ian Green , Chairman of the Executive Board of Terrence Higgins Trust , said : " The priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that nobody who has a HIV risk is left behind .	-3.8993
Now that the PrEP test medicine has been obtained , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people . '	-3.9797
Sharon Hodgson , the shadow minister of health , said : " The start of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and hesitant implementation by the government .	-3.4744
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection .	-11.0451
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP .	-2.1221
It is now important for this study to be carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country in order to protect people who are infected with HIV and to contribute to bringing us a step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society .	-5.0260
Living the Great Life : Intermediate Floor and Clevere Designer Tricks have transformed this small Earls Court apartment into a generous home .	-3.9247
Joanne Leigh , a former banker with a passion for real estate , diminished in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment .	-2.6053
It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold their bags .	-2.7177
" Before that I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room " , says Joanne .	-2.5420
" I was looking for something comparable to my price .	-2.0504
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and she had the same high ceilings .	-2.9278
I have fallen in love with her and made an offer on that day ' .	-2.5022
Since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely overtaken .	-2.7654
Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Joanne storage room and an intermediate floor wanted to make optimal use of the generous ceiling height . the the and the . the and the . the and the . the and the the and the . the and and . the and	-18.2615
" I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .	-1.1253
That was my request ' she says .	-1.3647
To this end , she commissioned the Architecture and Design Studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place for life for Joanne .	-3.5903
The ceiling was not large enough to place two spaces apart , so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor where you could stand .	-4.3511
Initially had to think creatively to solve the preset .	-2.7330
" The steel mill is rather complicated , " he explains .	-2.3220
" We had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked together without having to buck us .	-3.6945
It was not just a question of building a simple platform , but of creating the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . '	-4.1958
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms in full height – with a lot of additional drama .	-3.8072
For the intermediate floor , a classic copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous lounge area .	-4.1088
Mirrored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage serge mouille lighting set the style for the program .	-11.8772
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .	-1.5630
In both ends a short corridor is mirrored to make it work longer .	-3.2078
In the kitchen , the mirror feels like a window in another room .	-2.1118
At the entrance , mirrored units offer space for all cutlery and glasses of Joanne .	-2.7847
By perceiving a more glamorous room , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .	-3.0089
Folding kitchen is nothing new .	-2.8383
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door .	-2.5943
" A bit of engineering went into this " , explains Erfan from the steel reinforced MDF door .	-3.7125
'It is counter-weight , so when you push up the door , it slides very slightly ' .	-4.1847
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Joanne won an additional 16 m <unk> , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .	-3.5433
" At the end of the day you will sell the base - or how your property is estimated , " says Erfan .	-3.0836
" In a rudimentary form , a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the size of the ground " .	-10.0186
Here they have managed to increase the surface of the ground and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage .	-5.1590
" The materials are the things you touch and that therefore help create an emotional bond in a home , " says Erfan .	-10.8961
" You don 't fall in love with the electric sockets in the walls .	-2.8755
These are important , but they do not play with your heart . '	-1.9253
It shows that a flat can be transformed by good design and increased square meters of something by default into something quite astonishing .	-4.7491
In fact , as Joanne , you could choose not to leave them .	-2.9880
Brothers are fighting for a $ 500 million Real Empire	-2.5361
Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty , in a confrontation with one of Victoria ’ s largest real estate empires , worth more than $ 500 million .	-10.1403
The former director of the ' Carlton Football Club ' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul , who brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their business assets should be shared .	-3.7782
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp argument about the separation is taking place in the Supreme Court .	-3.6318
Together with her mother Anna , the brothers owned 38 real estate worth more than half a billion dollars since the family bought a business in Smith Street , Collingwood , in 1973 .	-3.2692
The Westco Jeans family founded there and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores .	-2.9566
It was sold for USD 85 million in 1999 .	-0.9314
This money has been invested in real estate , and the De Lutis portfolio now includes offices in the city centre , the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as suburban shopping centres .	-3.9182
According to an agreement with her late father , Colin - described by Paul as " chief operator and dominant personality " in the De Lutis family - possesses approximately two-thirds of the corporate wealth and Paul about one .	-4.4532
A court act says that this means that Colin owns $ 316 million worth of Paul and $ 176 million .	-3.1024
The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .	-2.5088
" The divisions proposed by Colin left him with what I thought the best objects , " he wrote in 2015 in a first affidavit .	-2.6531
Last Friday , after several failed conciliations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place .	-1.9123
The brothers are now also fighting for control of the existing business - Colin , as Paul claims , excluded him .	-3.7134
Colin argues that this is not true , but accuses Paul to manage some possessions incompetently .	-3.1071
In an early affidavit submitted by Colin , he says he hopes to resolve the dispute .	-2.3138
" My Italian legacy stipulates that the family is the most important priority , " he wrote .	-2.2019
In this case , hundreds of websites with affidavits , e-mails and reports by companies , including Deloitte , Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan Myers , QC , and lawyers held by both sides .	-4.4272
Mrs De Lutis and her late husband , Luigi , were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicatessen shops from the late 1950 ’ s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early 1970s .	-3.8504
They used the security to buy the Collingwood property where Colin opened the first jeans shop of the family .	-3.4252
Colin says that he started Westco there when he " was the High School in my last years when Paul was a small child ( about 10 years old ) . "	-13.3670
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass on their property to their sons amicably .	-3.5030
" Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to go to court , " she wrote .	-2.1638
Two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lutis group , Colin claims that $ 10 million was paid when the company left , and Luke 26 million was paid .	-4.0795
Both Lukas and Mark , says Paul " become bitter about the terms of their financial separation " .	-4.3106
Colin was a former AFL Board member and , after a biography of 2015 by Eddie McGuire , he was the best friend of the TV star .	-4.5183
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers .	-1.8293
Only Colin responded by SMS to say " I really can not say much " because the case is before the courts .	-2.8558
" It is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and pull our family name through the courts , " he wrote .	-2.3838
In mid-2016 , Colin wrote to the court that he tried to meet his brother ’ s demands .	-2.5226
" Our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end in our current dispute , " he said and added that he " still hoped for a solution " .	-2.7125
On Friday , this hope seemed to be over .	-1.6635
" Our affair will be resolved by the courts in the near future " wrote Colin .	-7.5460
Trump ’ s new chief of staff plans to limit presidential media abstinence .	-1.8552
Others have tried and failed .	-1.4088
Perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do so .	-2.0331
If so , it will be the first .	-1.1555
Politico reports that the White House ’ s new chief of staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump , including the news media ’ s reports , in the hope of keeping the boss on a more uniform course .	-3.5377
Here is a piece of Reporter Josh Dawsey :	-0.8107
" When John F. Kelly , the White House ’ s new chief of staff , met senior employees on his first working day , he presented a major problem in President Donald Trump ’ s White House , which he wanted to repair : bad information that gets into the president ’ s hands .	-3.9893
Kelly told staff that information about him should go - whether on paper or in Briefings - because the President would make better decisions if he had good information . '	-4.3491
Kelly ’ s diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet .	-3.0049
President Trump ’ s television relationship dates back decades – and now that he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong .	-2.7055
" If Trump was angered for unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting of posts that were to be convinced , " former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg said to Politico in February .	-4.4436
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that " the key to keeping Trump ’ s Twitter habit under control is , according to six former election campaign officials , to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady lobby . "	-3.7607
Okay .	-0.4601
But the idea that Trump ’ s Twitter habit has ever been “ under control ” is ridiculous .	-1.7011
Perhaps these campaign officials know something that we do not know others - that Trump ’ s tweets would have more fuel without their interventions .	-3.7048
We will probably never know anything about the tweets that Trump has not sent .	-2.1476
If his employees managed to keep trouble away from him several times , their efforts have been worthwhile .	-4.6617
But no one has consistently prevented Trump from engaging in controversy .	-2.2280
Part of the problem is that in a White House composed of competing parties , people are constantly trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views from the world .	-4.1907
Politico , which is dedicated to this story , reported in May on the preference of consultants to provide dubious information to the president for strategic reasons .	-4.6043
This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher :	-1.4588
" Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press sections , especially those with damaging leaks , and that he is fighting for where they come from .	-4.8220
This is exactly what happened at the end of February , when someone malignantly gave the president a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com , the website of the Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief Katie Walsh of being the source behind a bunch of lecks ' in the White House .	-5.0703
Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for harassment , or had not offered any concrete evidence , or has in the past voiced false accusations and revoked them .	-4.5371
Trump read the article and began to consult staff about Walsh . "	-3.0438
Goldmacher added that the then Chief of Staff , Reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House , Rob Porter , " tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper crash that Trump receives " .	-4.4202
How did this work ?	-1.9558
Kelly tried to do the same three months later .	-2.3683
Perhaps he will prove himself a more effective manager than Priebus , but Trump is still his impulsive self , and his advisers are still to . are . and to to . to to . to to to . to to to .	-10.0551
These unchanging factors make Kelly ’ s mission very difficult .	-1.6557
Post of Europol to criminEuropol	-3.4575
As the address is unknown , people will be asked for help and hoped for .	-4.1739
This summer , the police across Europe send out ( virtual ) postcards to dangerous criminals fleeing .	-3.3110
As the addresses of the serious criminals sought are naturally not known , references are hoped for and requested from the population .	-4.2431
Europol reported on Friday the action followed by the " EU Most Wanted " advent calendar of winter .	-3.4161
Experience would have shown that many refugees hid from holiday destinations , it was told by Europol .	-3.3311
21 postcards have been put together for sought criminals from 21 EU countries .	-2.7595
Since 2016 , the www.eumostwanted website has been viewed more than 2.5 million times .	-3.5550

Travellers negotiate a Ditch and return to the Millionaires series .	-2.2226
Some of the wealthiest house owners of the West Midlands are back with some determined travellers at war foot who negotiated a ditch taken by the municipality to reclaim a field in front of their mansions .	-6.6370
Travellers have parked their 20 caravans on a field outside a wealthy street of Solihull , called the " Millionaires series " .	-3.2417
They brought horses , babies and an army of transport after they were discarded in May without , however , being deterred from a ditch excavated by the Council in order to prevent their inconveniences .	-5.3087
The tactical group found a defence gap and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unhindered to find a way .	-3.5173
Ancient inhabitants have urged the Solihull Council to say that it is ' useless to deal with the problem ' .	-5.1758
An anonymous inhabitant said : " They went there on Monday evening after being sent back by Bentley Heath , where they thrown stones on the passers-by .	-13.2285
The Council must be forced into action by shame of implementation , as it was useless in dealing with the problem .	-4.0065
Travellers were there in May , moved on and are now back .	-3.1147
More came yesterday evening , probably more today . '	-2.0865
It added : ' The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with this by holding long instructions to protect their parks .	-2.6378
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my community tax if the Council cannot even stop it . '	-2.6459
A resident who did not want to be named said : " It is ridiculous , we have just seen the last round of those travellers just to be plundered by another round .	-3.9609
The figures have increased this time and you have even seen a horse in the parking area ' .	-3.5326
A Speaker from the Solihull Council said : ' We are aware of an unauthorised camp in the country beyond the Streetsbrook Road and work with the Solihull police , and we are taking the necessary legal steps to move forward as quickly as possible .	-5.4843
In order to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many people as possible report anti-social or criminal behaviour with the police by calling 101 .	-3.5741
This helps to create a picture of the situation in which the Court will have to examine when we will be presenting our case . '	-10.1370

This is good news for the city .	-1.5579
Because , with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente Fürbsgesellschaft mbH as of 13 April 2014 , around 30 000 overnight stays per year were lost and revenue from the tourist tax was also lost .	-5.8538
In the autumn of 2014 , with dramatically rising numbers of refugees arriving in the county , the hotel building was offered to the countryside as a collection accommodation , causing controversial discussions .	-5.0908
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a construction plan to ensure the area as a hotel location .	-4.1389
The decision at that time was not uncontroversial in the municipal coun.	-9.3727
But especially the Freudenstadt Oberbürgermeister Julian Oswald defended the hotel location and spoke back then of serious stakeholders in the house .	-5.2470
He should be right .	-0.9643
The group Luisenhotels with managing director Birgit Scherer , based in Bad Bergzabern , has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin , and wants to make it a home of the three-star Plus category called Waldhotel Luise .	-5.0974
The group has four houses with the Town Hall .	-2.6914
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb .	-1.2118
You are called Hotel Luise , Luisenpark , Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise .	-0.9164
The former Hotel Birkenhof has been in front of the entrance for a long time , and when you enter the house , you will see what extensive renovation work is going on .	-6.3645
The floors were erased , blankets partly dismantled , old bathtubs removed from the rooms .	-4.9324
The entire hotel building is a single building site .	-2.0520
There is still much to be done by March .	-1.4687
" It is actually a nice hotel " , says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper .	-2.9517
Everything is to be renewed in black forest style .	-2.2654
The rooms are equipped with large accessible showers , the entrance hall will be changed , new windows will be installed .	-5.2710
Everything should be " well connected to the people " later , as Thomas Scherer says .	-4.6529
'We want to make a jewellery out ' .	-2.3706
Swimming pool , spa and meeting room are all equipped .	-4.5848
You don 't want to position yourself at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad , but already at an up-to-date level , Scherer emphasizes .	-6.0291
The Waldhotel Luise , with its approximately 60 rooms , wants to vast , continues to explain Scherer .	-4.3560
Both individual holidaymakers , groups or businessmen should feel at home in the hotel .	-3.6911
He has already held talks with OB Julian Oswald and tourist director Michael Krause , said Scherer .	-3.1896
The ideas of the city are similar to those of the hotel group .	-7.8939
'We are on the same line ' .	-1.0115
Given the level of investment , Thomas Scherer does not want to be very clear .	-9.6541
Just under a million euros , he expects .	-2.4746
The outdoor facilities are also being brought to the forefront , and that is already clear .	-5.6379
A large terrace is created in a courtyard which will be accessible from the restaurant , which is public .	-4.1559
Thomas Scherer is optimistic : " Freudenstadt is a good market " .	-2.1228
Russia affair : US Special Envoy sets Grand Jury	-3.5126
In the Russian affair surrounding US President Donald Trump , special envoy Robert Mueller is expected to have set up a so-called Grand Jury after a report .	-4.2591
The board has been working in recent weeks , wrote the Wall Street Journal , invoking people who are familiar with the . and the and . and are and . and and . and and and . and	-12.3453
The newspaper valued the step as a sign that Mueller has expanded and intensified his investigations .	-3.4013
The CNN channel reported that there were already initial invitations from the body in connection with a meeting between Trump ’ s oldest son and a Russian lawyer .	-3.6618
US intelligence services have been accusing the Kremlin of being targeted in the 2016 presidential election campaign .	-2.7351
Mueller examines whether there were deals between Trump ’ s campaign team and Moscow .	-2.5526
The focus of the investigation should be on several men in the campaign as Republican advisor .	-4.3592
According to reports , Mueller also looked more and more at Trump ’ s private and business environment .	-2.0580
The Washington Post wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Investigator put Trump at the centre personally and investigated whether the president might have hindered justice as a result of the affair .	-5.7998
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine evidence in possible cases of crime and to decide whether charges should be made .	-4.3650
Grand Jurys are therefore called chambers of prosecution .	-4.1749
They are usually switched on when they are larger and controversial cases .	-2.9612
The procedure is always done behind closed doors .	-1.3480
The panel can also be activated by the Public Prosecutor to invite people to interrogate under oath .	-4.7798
According to the CNN channel , subpoenas have already been issued around the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer .	-3.6232
Those involved in the meeting were asked to make a statement , it was stated in the report .	-4.1244
They should also provide documents .	-0.7045
In addition to Trump Jr. , Trump ’ s advisers and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his then campaign leader , Paul Manafort , were also present at the meeting .	-4.5193
Legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the establishment shows that Mueller is not intimidating in his work and that he wants to act quickly if necessary .	-11.3248
It should not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be activated at the end to decide on the charge .	-4.9435
Nevertheless , the institution of the body is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Trump .	-3.7904
In the midst of the new revelations , the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents .	-9.4512
" The Russia story is a total invention , " said Trump .	-2.2111
The subject gives the Democrats an opportunity to feel good because they have nothing else they can talk about .	-3.8677
His special adviser Ty Cobb explained in a statement that he knew nothing about setting up a Grand Jury .	-3.1195
But he also usually works in secret , he emphasized .	-3.6312
The White House supports any measures that accelerated the work of the special investigator in a fair way .	-3.3491
Former FBI chief James Comey said three times that there was no investigation against the president .	-3.3558
There is no reason to believe that this has changed , as the declaration continued .	-4.6198
Mueller was only used after Trump had fired Comey .	-3.0354
Because of this discourse , accusations have been made against Trump that he wanted to impede justice .	-4.7034
Comey told a Senate committee in June that Trump asked him to stop investigating the national security adviser Michael Flynn at the time .	-3.8596
The President is under great pressure because of the investigation .	-2.4681
According to US media , the White House collected material against the special investigator and his staff .	-2.5339
This triggered speculation about whether Trump Mueller wanted to dismiss .	-3.1253
Unlike an independent Special Advisor to Congress , such as the Watergate affair by President Richard Nixon , who resigned later , Mueller has a position in which he could , in theory , be guided by the Ministry of Justice at the insistence of the President .	-4.8909
Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a move .	-2.9691
Two groups of Republican and Democratic Senators drafted legislation on Thursday , whereby the special investigator could no longer be dismissed so easily .	-4.8773
Antarctica ’ s Gigantic Iceberg Drives in Antarctic. and . and and . and and . and . and	-9.1501
In the Westantarctic , a giant iceberg has dissolved from Berlin ’ s barely seven times size .	-5.4644
The Bremerhaven Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research participated on Wednesday .	-2.3911
The colossus , heavy over a trillion tonnes and 5800 square kilometres , is now driving north and will probably take two or three years to melt .	-4.7552
With 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest iron giants registered by researchers over the past three decades .	-3.6621
He does not pose a threat to people .	-3.3063
The extent to which climate change has played a role in the collapse of the iceberg is unclear according to research statements .	-10.1829
Overall , however , there have been a series of unusual collapses of ice shelves in the region for some 30 years , the US research centre for snow and ice ( NSIDC ) writes in a factual background .	-4.6588
Many researchers believe that this can be linked to global warming .	-2.6066
The now aborted colossus has been part of the Larsen C shelf .	-4.3863
Schelfeis is swimming on the sea and is fed by large glaciers .	-2.6758
It therefore continues to grow into the sea and regularly breaks down .	-3.6539
The Larsen C Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula .	-3.2372
Northern this feeling was the balance of growth and abortion a few years ago .	-4.7731
A complete Schelfeis has fallen there , writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen .	-4.2087
There is much to suggest that the Larsen C shelf is in danger , because the front edge has never withdrawn as far as it is now .	-5.8354
In addition , the ice plate is tense and can fall down if a key breaks a piece .	-5.8252
The melting of Schelfeis and Iceberg does not increase the sea level as they swim on the water and displace ice as much water as it does after melting itself .	-5.5669
However , the loss of feeling causes the glaciers to flow directly into the sea and much faster than before .	-4.8788
This could perhaps increase marine levels , but only to a small extent , writes the British research project to observe Antarctica ( Midas ) .	-4.3753
The Larsen C shelf is the fourth biggest feeling of Antarctica , according to AWI data , with almost 50 000 square kilometres .	-5.8635
At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters .	-10.0910
It regularly breaks down there .	-2.5841
" Although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change , the ice shield is now in a more vulnerable position , " said Martin O 'Leary of British Swansea University .	-4.4507
" This is the widest withdrawal since the beginning of the records , " he also confirmed .	-3.4262
Among scientists , there is a dispute as to whether the Larsen C shelf will grow again or go back in the long term and possibly collapse , his colleague Adrian Luckman said and added : ' Our models say it will be less stable ' .	-6.5565
But this development will take decades .	-1.7101
Although these researchers are not the result of the collapse of this gigantic iceberg on climate change , in recent decades a great many icebergs of the Antarctic Peninsula have fallen .	-5.7511
This long tipple of Antarctica stretches towards South America .	-3.5906
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey research programme , the ice area of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950 ’ s .	-3.1288
The drop in temperature has contributed to the increase .	-3.9502
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed about three degrees over the past 50 years , and is one of the areas where the temperature rises fastest .	-4.7018

Now , once again , 17 trainees have their first working day .	-3.2291
The lessons in the circle are obviously very much sought .	-3.5297
About 620 applications were available for this year 's seats .	-3.2819
Nevertheless , the circle continues to lack staff to meet the increased requirements and tasks .	-4.1582
Currently , 50 unoccupied jobs remain in the Mettmann circle .	-3.6053
Amongst other things , doctors and engineers as well as general administration forces are being sought .	-4.5545
The CDU wants to take the initiative in Kreistag together with the FDP and the UWG and to confront the shortage of experts in the administration .	-5.1608
According to the wishes of the parties , the administration should ' develop a concept for recruitment and human resources development ' .	-4.2868
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs for skilled workers , but to counter the scarcity of applicants in the future , as it says .	-5.0408
The overall concept should be oriented internally and externally , show concrete measures for cross-country beginners and include training offensive , calls for CDU , FDP and UWG .	-5.4656
That sounds like a good approach .	-1.8292
Because the circle has to deal with personnel problems that were not known before .	-4.9890
Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .	-2.0321
We are talking about a fair ' competition between public employers ' .	-2.9296
There is also a large number of employees who leave the service for illness or age .	-4.2487
So it is high time to take action so that more jobs do not remain unfilled .	-5.0145
But Klaus-Dieter peoples , CDU leader , go beyond the joint motion with his party .	-3.1088

" If we do not reach a satisfactory solution in the short term , the district administration with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county cities - should aim for a domestic tariff , " says peoples .	-5.4849

Italy is exacerbating the tone of NGO migrant bailout boats	-2.5592
Italy has warned NGOs who use bailouts for migrants in the Mediterranean that they must not continue this unless they comply with new rules for their operations .	-4.3928
" If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , " Secretary of Interior Marco Minniti said in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa .	-3.9213
Minni ’ s warning came a day after the Italian authorities seized a boat from the German Youth Rescue Organization , because their team had effectively cooperated with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration .	-4.2895
The aid organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to comment on detailed accusations by the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio .	-3.0290
" For us , saving human life is and remains our top priority , so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , " said the organization in an opinion on social media .	-4.8227
'We can only assess all the accusations being made at the moment after we have gathered all the information and can assess the situation . '	-4.4902
The Italian authorities had monitored the boat of ' Youth Rescue ' , the Iuventa , since October .	-2.8086
It is suspected that his crew will take on board hose boat migrants , provided directly by human traffickers , and that smugglers will be able to depart so that vessels can be re-used . and the and . the and . the and the the . the the . the the	-15.0511
At least such a meeting was allegedly held only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the Prosecutor 's Act whose content was published by Italian media .	-3.4749
The occupation is suspected of overcoming the authority of the Italian coastguard , the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons , not for any other motives .	-3.4657
Under the Code of Conduct , boats such as the Iuventa must above all have an Italian police officer on board who supervises their activities .	-12.5607
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the code : Save the Children , MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain .	-2.9263
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable , because they would not entail ' major changes or disabilities ' of their bailouts .	-3.3122
Among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel Laureate Organization is Doctors Without Borders ( MSF ) .	-2.8269
Minniti has now said that the number of migrants arriving after the bailouts in Italy has fallen sharply in recent weeks , suggesting that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and cooperate with local mayors have borne fruit .	-4.0625
" In recent days we have started to see light at the end of the tunnel , " the Minister said .	-2.0265
He announced plans for further discussions with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives , and with Chad , Niger , and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants left in the hope of reaching Europe .	-3.7086
Increasing and Trials	-1.1878
Nine Weilermer Biker , the " Berlin Outpost " and two guest riders met in Wachenheim in the Nordpfalz to enjoy trials and sights for four days .	-3.1104
Three friendly guides were available for this purpose .	-2.4039
Accommodation in the Wachenheim Valley proved to be a good starting point for tours .	-3.1073
The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra .	-2.5781
The first tour led at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim .	-2.6489
It was followed by viewpoints , partly on towers , from which one could look well above the forest and the surrounding plains .	-7.0762
In the meantime , there have been repeated prolonged increases , for which long trials rewarded .	-5.3342
On the second day , Bad Dürkheim went to the Saline and the Volksfest sausage market .	-9.4866
Again the viewpoint ranged from a viewpoint connected with " flowige " trials and moderate increases .	-4.9913
Over the last two days many metres of altitude have again been .	-9.9873

Konsole instead of Rasen - Bundesliga Arms for E-Sport	-3.2951
In the future , are the sports stars sitting in front of computer consoles instead of being swept over the stadium grass during wind and weather ?	-5.5181
The fact is that e-sport has long since become a serious industry , becoming a lucrative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gains .	-13.6994
This has also been recognised by the first federal leagues that are increasingly involved in this area .	-10.3536
In 2015 , the VfL Wolfsburg started , later the FC Schalke 04 and most recently the VfB Stuttgart , which founded an e-sports department in mid-July and accepted two professionals for the FIFA 17 computer game .	-6.0674
" We hope to inspire new target groups for the VfB , " says Management Board Jochen Röttgermann .	-3.8994
He is sure that many clubs will rise on this train .	-4.0234
Next weekend , the FIFA World Football Association will organize the first " Interactive Club World Cup " in London , where the gamers of various clubs will compete against each other .	-4.5530
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint-Germain or the PSV Eindhoven have qualified .	-2.3398
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sport .	-1.8012
The former coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players .	-2.5264
" The real football must deal particularly with the 14 to 30 years of age , that young people will continue to go to stadium in the future " , says the 52 year old .	-14.5551
And : the associations tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian ones .	-2.9079
With prominent e-sportsmen under contract , you could be more present online than sending the Federal League Team to Asia once a year .	-4.7316
What exactly is this all about ?	-1.7544
In e-sport , computer games such as " League Of Legends " , " Dota 2 " , " Counterstrike " or FIFA 's football simulation are fought at competitive level .	-4.8922
As in normal sport , leagues have long established themselves in which professionals compete against each other .	-3.4893
And e-sport is already part of the official program at the Asian Games 2022 .	-2.6268
But is it a real sport ?	-1.8456
For many , the idea is certainly in need of accessibility .	-4.8606
Ingo Froböse has also long been involved in this issue .	-3.9878
For the professor at the Deutsche Sportschule in Cologne , E-Sport is a sport because it is competent and shows many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in classical sport - for example , increased heart frequencies , stress reactions , hormonal changes .	-5.0685
It also needs cognitive skills , technical and tactical understanding and rapid reaction capability .	-3.2275
Professional gamers should train not only the console , but also their bodies and respect the diet .	-3.5140
" The fitting player is a good player . "	-1.4571
Frobe also sees problems : " Doping is becoming more and more a theme " .	-3.7026
Controls are hard to perform in online games , and the structures of classic sports were lacking in the scene .	-4.6353
The scientist positively emphasises the high integrative effect of e-sport .	-4.5483
Players are travelling internationally , this is like a large global family , there are no intercultural barriers .	-3.3833
A study by Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software ( BIU ) advises E-Sport to grow rapidly .	-3.5601
In 2016 , it implemented EUR 50 million in Germany , mainly through advertising , sponsorship and major tournaments .	-3.5982
Sales will be 130 million in three years .	-2.6352
That is little against the almost EUR 2.4 billion of the football bond league .	-3.7403
However , e-sport is " not far from other established sports such as handball , basketball or ice hockey " , write the Deloitte advisor .	-4.3458
Many countries have gone further internationally .	-2.5544
Large markets are Asia and the USA , where Ex-Basketball players Shaquille O<unk>Neal and Baseballstar Alex Rodriguez participate in the US Team NRG eSports .	-2.6812
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSports Wetting Provider Unikrn .	-2.6077
There are also things that are happening in Europe .	-2.5223
In a Norwegian school e-sport was introduced as a subject of teaching , says Froböse .	-3.2004
In the Netherlands and France , the first football league clubs , according to Dutt , are now obliged to set up an e-sports department .	-3.4331
" Under European comparison Germany lags behind " , says VfB Board of Directors Röttgermann .	-3.4138

Michelle Carter condemns the texts urging Conrad Roy to suicide .	-2.2042
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls for suicide .	-2.5353
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of condemnation behind bars , and five years have been exposed to probe .	-3.2131
Carter was condemned in June for the negligent killing of Conrad Roy , who died on 13 July 2014 .	-2.7342
The father of Roy said at the hearing on Thursday : " My family is unpleasant .	-2.7120
My son was my best friend . '	-0.9348
Carter was allowed to remain free until his appeal .	-2.5002
She was faced with a maximum sentence of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from mental illness .	-3.0052
Clothes dressed in red trousers and a cream-coloured blouse , Carter stood in the eyes with tears , with folded hands and downwards eyes when she was convicted .	-4.4852
" Your actions killed Conrad Roy , " the prosecutor said to the court .	-2.7085
" She finished her life to make her own better .	-8.1381
She did not take responsibility , " she said .	-1.9338
" It did not show any reputation " .	-3.3256
But Carter 's lawyer said it was a ' terrible circumstance that she completely regrets ' .	-3.8147
Judge Lawrence Moniz , however , said that he did not find out that their ' age or maturity , or even their mental illness , have a significant impact on their actions ' .	-3.5441
A Public Prosecutor read a statement by Roy ’ s mother Lynn Roy , who said that there is no day on which I do not entrust the loss of my beloved son .	-4.4263
I would like him to be proud of me and to deal with everything , and I am trying to be there for his sisters despite all my pain we will carry for eternity .	-6.5111
Roy 's sister , Camdyn Roy , said that she would be " persecuted " from the realization that she would never participate in the wedding of her brother or be a penny for his children .	-4.5844
" Not having that only person with whom I have been together since my birth every day is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , " she said .	-4.1889
The case seems to set a legal precedent , because there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide .	-2.6787
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in 2014 by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle .	-2.0099
The case attracted national attention after Carter ’ s texts revealed that he had encouraged him to stop his life .	-3.5629
" Hang up , jump from a building , erase yourself , I do not know there are many ways " , she said in several messages she sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on holiday with his family .	-4.9843
In the moments before his suicide , she wrote : " You must do it , Conrad " and " All you must do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy " .	-3.8235
Judge Moniz said that Carter was looking for attention through the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from the case by any press .	-3.3522
The case divided the legal opinion .	-1.5915
Among the few who defended Carter , Amanda Knox , who was sentenced in 2007 for murder on her fellow British woman in Italy before being released two years ago .	-3.8787

Joshua Kimmich : Learning from the FC Bavaria ’ s New Mini Lahm .	-8.1299
That Joshua Kimmir was allowed to run as a captain at the Audi Cup is no accident .	-8.4232
The FC Bayern is relying on the Confed Cup winner to a large season - extra motivation is not harmful .	-5.9510
There was something different in his place in the cabin , Joshua Kimmich immediately saw , even though the additional clothing piece was very , very small .	-4.8134
But since , on the second day of the Audi Cup , of course , no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel Neuer was to be seen , he made the bind allocated to him to the arm .	-6.8474
" The trainer did not announce it " , the Confed Cup winner told afterwards , after his first deployment as Bavarian captain .	-4.6116
Well , the insistence could have gone better than the 0 : 2 against the SSC Naples .	-10.2585
But the sign of the coach could also interpret Kimmich so .	-3.3330

And at all , Kimmir looked like the one who can best take the ruder in his hand .	-6.2282
He gave instructions to try to steer the unplayed force .	-3.5693
He had a look at the whole , while many others were busy with themselves .	-4.2568
Vidal with overplaying his missing fitness ( scarcely folded ) ; Renato Sanches with attaching devil to the achievements of the Asian trip ( folded even conditionally ) ; and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Soul by not detecting negatively in their first appearance in the Bavarian trikot .	-6.2225
That , after all , worked very well .	-3.0383
Süle ran beside Kimmich , Rudy before the defense , both acted sovereign .	-3.1821
The renowned Napoli storm often went hard and soul also tried to build a few times .	-5.9249

Companies satisfied with the Rhineland-Palatinate minister : Economics praises knowledge pace .	-3.3625
It was often unusual , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when Eveline Lemke ( Greens ) was Minister of Economy of Rhineland-Palatinate .	-3.9458
This is evident after more than a year when the new Minister for Economic Affairs , Volker Wissing ( FDP ) , is in office .	-3.3248
Chambers and companies in the region speak on T V-request of a change in economic policy - and at the same time reprimand the old minister .	-5.4612
Frank Natus , Chairman of the Association of Trier Enterprises ( VTU ) , says : " Wissing addresses the wishes of the economy that Lemke has all blocked " .	-4.1740
Natus sees the biggest U-turn in infrastructure policy : the gap between Kelberg and Adenau is now high on the country ’ s list of priorities .	-11.5216
This year , the Ministry hopes for a planning procedure to be followed by construction law by 2021 .	-4.8490
The western circumvention of Trier , which is at the forefront of the Federal Transport Road , also plays a role in the country ’ s plans .	-4.5652
The aim is to start the route in December 2020 , says Minister Cornelia Holtmann .	-2.9107
Natus sees this as a signpost for supporting regional but internationally competing companies .	-3.3664

Audi is expected to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a backlash .	-2.6390
One day before the announcement of Audi BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles .	-2.2331
The BMW chairman said that the company believes that ' there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions ' and referred to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - banning or restricting diesel vehicles .	-4.4444
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe modified to reduce its diesel emissions .	-2.8478
None of the companies described the enterprises as a recall .	-8.9230
European car manufacturers have greatly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules on carbon dioxide emissions .	-2.6189
But the nitrogen oxides emitting diesel engines are considered carcinogens and may cause asthma .	-8.4277
The costs for automobile manufacturers to install plants to neutralise exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles are also increasing , making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .	-3.9851
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also charged with holding out powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem .	-2.3594
Companies are trying to avoid the errors of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so-called shut-off devices to comply with the rules when a car has been tested , but returns in normal driving conditions .	-5.8518
In the United States , several Volkswagen employees have been charged , while others are investigated on both sides of the Atlantic .	-2.6810
Last month , the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .	-1.8917
The former manager , Zacceo Giovanni Pamio , is Italians and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be tried in the United States .	-2.5510
Earlier this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen , after the Audi authorities accused of having installed a system to circumvent emissions regulations in Europe , and a question that focused on the United States has been extended .	-12.4542
Volkswagen ’ s involvement in the investigation could be difficult : the luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to the profit of Volkswagen .	-4.0149

Mordillos of Knollennase and the Laughter Against the suffering	-3.1764
Mordillo was sometimes one of the most published cartoon drawers , the Knollennasen of his figures are his trademark .	-3.9982
With 85 the Argentinian still draws and works on a film .	-3.5069
His message : laugh , ' for there is too much suffering in the world ' .	-1.7460
Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .	-1.4926
In the first years as an artist , he beat himself as a drawer for greeting cards , which frustrated him .	-4.9556
" The happiest day in my professional life was the day when my job lost , " he once said .	-1.9437
After stations in Lima , New York and Paris , he succeeded in breaking through at the end of the 1960s : publishing his cartoons in " Paris Match " and then also in " star " and other leading magazines around the world .	-4.3774
Even in China , Mordillo found many fans .	-1.1277
The artist was inspired by cities over and over again .	-2.5353
Large , round mordillo figures are commemorated in drawings with the slate tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .	-4.0889
In the early morning he says he is still at the drawing table today , working almost ten hours a day .	-4.6225
Through calendars , puzzles , books for adults and children , t-shirts , plushes and watches , his drulling figures continue to find much spread worldwide .	-5.6651
For six years he has also worked on a cartoon film and a TV series with his figures .	-4.0945
The main person in the movie " Crazy Island " is a giraffe - Mordillos most popular animal in his drawings - which has a thousand feet as an opponent .	-4.5667
For the first time , his figures speak in the 3D movie , which is to come to the cinema object in 2019 .	-4.6645
" I do not know exactly what they will say , it is strange for me , " says Mordillo .	-2.3418
The script is not written by him .	-1.5781
This is why he is more relying on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced worthless .	-5.1138
Provence ’ s Climate Change Lavender	-0.7613
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .	-1.7547
The lavender is declining because of drought conditions and because of diseases , causing great headaches to scientists and farmers trying to find solutions .	-4.2706
Eric Chaisse , the expert of the Agricultural Research Institute CRIEPPAM in Provence , said : " The lavender in Provence is effectively threatened , because in recent years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change , which brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn .	-4.9721
This affects the life of lavender .	-2.2604
There is also a small cicade , a microbacterium that transmits dwarf cicades , and in very dry weather there are many of them . '	-4.4255
The stakes are high .	-1.2264
Not only does lavender oil attract tourists , it is also highly sought for perfume and cosmetics .	-4.4859
Eric Chaisse said : " Instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , underdeveloped and either missing or weakened .	-2.9008
So we have fewer parts with essential oil . '	-1.8290
The solutions that are considered include better water distribution and the slowdown of evaporation from the ground , but also the spraying of plants with a protective mix of tone and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dry .	-4.9510
The town Geisa in the Thuringian Rhoen is celebrating its 1200th anniversary .	-8.9379

The murder of a journalist underscores Mexico ’ s growing threat .	-3.4110
The staff of the weekly Riodoce usually meet on Wednesday to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in Sinaloa by organised crime , corrupt officials , and constant drug wars .	-4.2257
But on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .	-1.5912
They were told that it is important to change their routines .	-1.4516
Two high-level journalists are discussing what is more secure : they are supposed to take their children to the office in 2009 , which were the aim of attacking grenades , or to leave them at home .	-5.8404
Security experts have written three words on a table on the front of the room : opponents , neutrals , allies .	-2.5880
You ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary , perceptions and belly feelings range .	-3.8906
There are drug smugglers , politicians , businessmen , journalists suspected of being on the government ’ s or cartels ’ pay list , a catalogue of criminals that make Mexico ’ s chaos dangerous .	-3.2760
There is no rest of the violence , and while the bodies are increasing throughout the country , there are more and more journalists : at least 25 , since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012 , 589 , following attacks and threats under federal protection , and so far there have been at least seven deaths in seven states .	-5.5971
Among the latter is her editor and inspiration of Riodoce , the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas .	-3.0805
" The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , " Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books about drug violence .	-2.4312
His absence is deeply felt , although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez , which shows his middle finger with the word " justice " , hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building .	-22.4579
The workshop takes place less than two months after its death , and the reporters discuss their divided themes , the trauma , their alpdreams , their sleeping , Paranoia .	-5.0847
Although a special lawyer was set up in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists , the latter , according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists , has only initiated two criminal proceedings .	-4.9776
As with most thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organised crime every year , journalists ' murderers are rarely tried .	-3.0829
In Riodoce , they are still insisting on treating Sinaloa 's violence , even though they are intolerable and even though the terrain is even more tragic .	-5.3659
Without information about the murderers , without justice , the meeting on security discussion has little use , says Ibarra .	-3.0339
" It 's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , " he says .	-1.5204
'Until we know why we all mistrust . '	-2.9411
On the morning of May 15 , Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in Culiacan .	-9.9890
He managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men , forced from his car and 12 shot on him , probably because of the name of the newspaper - translated with " twelfth river " .	-5.6374
The shooter dropped in his car and damaged it nearby .	-3.1104
Valdez was 50 years old .	-0.5935
He left one woman and two adult children .	-1.2316
Rumours tend to fly freely in Culiacan .	-1.7471
But on Valdez , there is virtually nothing but silence .	-2.2611
Since Guzman 's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January , Sinaloa has become one of the country 's most bloody battlefields , as rival groups are fighting here to fill the vacuum .	-3.1736
There is nothing that in Sinaloa every day someone or more people are shot in the streets or that the cemetery is full of decorated , two-storey mausoleums for drug kings that are larger than many houses for the living .	-5.4827
Forget for one minute that there is a state of ' calm ' when only one cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug traffic routes to the United States .	-3.5949
Nonetheless , and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work , Ismail Bojorquez ( 60 ) , a co-founder and director of Riodoce , has broken with the blame for not protecting his friend .	-3.6173
He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder .	-1.2329
First , in February , an interview with Damaso Lopez , a leader of one of the rival cartel factions in the war with Guzman ’ s sons , was published .	-3.6071
This release may have angered the sons , suspected gang members bought each copy of the issue once it was delivered to newspaper kioske .	-3.5191
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for its own security after the seizure of another newspaper that had published the same history .	-3.6674
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .	-1.8733
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there .	-2.4686
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 , joining with five colleagues to set up Riodoce and sold $ 50 investments .	-5.1097
In Sinaloa , " it was impossible to operate journalism without encountering the drug problem , " Bojorquez said .	-2.9469
Over time , the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .	-2.7786
Reporters loved to be able to publish tough investigations without fear of censorship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to treat .	-3.9989
Eight years after Riodoce was founded , she received the prestigious " Maria-Moors-Cabot Prize " for her coverage in Latin America .	-2.7519
In the same year , Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in pursuing Mexican drug history , wherever it was .	-3.4008
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid .	-1.3621
" I want to continue living " , he said at the time of the CPJ award .	-2.4381
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa " is a way of life " , he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV .	-2.3326
" You have to take over the task that happens to you as a journalist - either that or you play the stupid .	-4.1290
I do not want to be asked : ' What did you do in the face of so many deaths ... why did you not say what was going on ? '	-3.7264
The Riodoce team misses Valdez , the fun bird who was able to fly like a dock worker , the friend who was generous with envelopes and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .	-4.0780
They trusted in his routine .	-1.2643
He would always bear his hat .	-1.3646
He would always go to El Guayabo , the bar opposite the office , and always sit there on the same table .	-8.5809
Now they ask : Was his love for routine his ruin ?	-2.5206
His death has also forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their work and remain alive .	-3.2007
" You do not like it when you deal with your women , their children , their clean shops , their secret runways , " to move drugs .	-5.6516
" These things were not allowed , " said Bojorquez .	-1.2874
The result , even in the best times , is a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation .	-2.0348
Trust his own instincts .	-1.8775
If it smells wrong , it will remain away .	-3.1987
The trouble is , the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that " smell is a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing has happened to Javier . "	-3.7731
The old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as they are in Tamaulipas , Veracruz , Guerrero and other states where a poisonous mix of lucrative smuggling routes , weak institutions , and corrupt government officials are at home .	-4.0890
The landscape is constantly changing .	-1.3802
In the space where Riodoce ’ s employees met for security training , no cellular phones were suddenly allowed , and days before that , Spyware , sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .	-5.9081
Outside , two police seeked protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 <unk> C ) in the shadow of a tree .	-3.1618
They were instructed by the national government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a middle class district of Culiacan .	-10.8199
Half in joke , some of the reporters wondered whether these officers were one of the 50 % of the police who the governor himself described as untrustworthy .	-3.5498
It has been months since the reporters entered the mountain landscape , where drug gangs are de facto under control .	-3.4230
This week , Riodoce picked on three main stories .	-3.7593
There was the murder of the brother of the former known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa .	-2.5108
They also had an exposé on government expenditure , which focused on the governor ’ s home town .	-3.3082
And there was a group that kidnapped in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan , a block from the office of the prosecutor .	-2.8817
There was no official word about who was abducted or what happened , so caution was required when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favourite venue of drug traffickers and authorities .	-4.8448
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician , who belongs to the governing Institutional Revolution Party ( PRI ) , which dominated all political levels almost the entire century .	-4.1598
Recently , several PRI governors were accused of corruption for high-class cases .	-3.3172
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this place , including one in which a son of " El Chapo " Guzman escaped a military attack .	-2.9710
Only a few months earlier , readers would have seen the Valdez column as the best informed source of abduction .	-3.4969
" We already knew what happened " , said Villarreal , 46 , with the nickname " El Flaco " because of its slim body status .	-3.2735
" Now all channels of communication with our sources have broken . "	-1.9170
The office of Valdez has been converted into a storage space for signs and stickers protesting against the murders of journalists , because employees have become something they had never expected : activists in the name of the press .	-4.6864
Reporter Miriam Ramirez picked up a few signs and went to a demonstration next morning for another journalist to the Office of Public Prosecutor .	-4.2584
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed in the western state of Michoacan .	-1.8813
A burned body has been discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests that it is his .	-2.0930
Journalists have become more vocal throughout the country by writing " SOS Press " on walls and buildings in organized protests .	-4.0379
On that day , the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and is trying to gather international support for the judiciary in the Valdez case .	-3.8560
In a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa the day after the assassination of Valdez , Ramirez accused the authorities of spying and killing journalists because they told the truth .	-2.4724
She has since asked for it to be re-divided by the government , because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity .	-3.8182
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were " surrounded " by organised crime , government officials involved and an indifferent society .	-2.4329
In his last book , " Narco Journalism " , he wrote that reporters are killed not only by drug gangs , but also by command of politicians and security forces who were under a ceiling with organised crime .	-4.5809
The media guardian " Articulo 19 " attacked more than half of the attacks on police and civil servants last year .	-3.9327
" In Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth , " said Ramirez .	-2.0079
Obviously , the murders have a deterrent effect .	-1.5633
No one forgets the death of the bloggerin Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipa six years ago .	-2.4259
Your body was found together with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas Cartel : ' I am here because of my reports ' .	-3.3192
A computer keyboard and headphones were next to their separated head .	-1.7576
Some branches have chosen to close , as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March .	-2.8100
Others continue to do as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of her director in 2004 .	-8.7166
In 2010 , the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed to the drug cartels with an article on the title page entitled " What do you want from us ? " with on the ti" " .	-17.4779
Some journalists have fled their homeland or even from the country .	-2.6932
It is a painful decision .	-0.6490
It is hard to find work in exile and they are still watching the streets and looking for dangers .	-2.4205
And sometimes they are hunted , as seems to the photographer Ruben Espinosa , who in 2015 , together with four women , was murdered in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz .	-3.5223
For those who are lagging behind and continue their work , it is a daily dance with risky decisions .	-3.2789
Ibarra , who once wanted to be a poet , admits that drug trafficking alarms him .	-3.0295
" Mexico goes to hell , so I became reporters , " he said .	-2.2378
At midnight last Friday , when the last issue was finished , the editors of Riodoce sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and drink beer when all their phones started to sum .	-5.1659
A number of shootings with rivals and security forces near the seaside resort Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead .	-3.4625
The war continued to escalate , as promised by a series of Cartel messages in the region .	-2.6206
They published news on the Riodoce website about mobile phones from the Bordstein edge .	-4.8732
The title page had to be changed the next day .	-1.2134
Sirenen heralded near - another shooting in the area .	-4.1152
Bojorquez looked at the policemen who kept guard to see if they were ready .	-2.4877
If they were afraid at all , they did not show it .	-2.7788
Under the huge portrait of the founder of the newspaper , whose finger was visible throughout Sinaloa , the Riodoce staff followed his traces .	-4.8951
" How can you only think about closing , " said Bojorquez , " when the same day when Javier was murdered , the internship asked me to send her to the street for reporting . "	-5.5722
Dinosaurs used tarning to evade their enemies	-2.3629
At first glance , it looks like a statue , albeit a frightening one .	-1.7263
Now researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible nahorn of a Canadian mining worker were received so well that experts described it as " Mona Lisa of Dinosaurs " .	-3.8676
It was so well preserved that they even discovered that his scaly skin was reddish brown - and they said she had something of a " troubled past " .	-4.1829
The report in the magazine " Current Biology " described it as " the best preserved dinosaur ever found , and one of the best dinosaurs in the world " .	-4.1944
The fossil is a newly discovered type of nodosaurs who lived in the middle of the Circle Age between 110 million and 112 million years ago .	-3.3311
His incredibly well preserved state has astonished researchers who describe it as ' truly remarkable ' .	-3.0758
According to National Geographic reports , the most preserved fossil of its kind is the plant fresher .	-4.7739
It was found by Shawn Funk when he grew in the Suncor Millenium Mine on 21 March 2011 near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta , Canada .	-2.4714
He met something that seemed inappropriate from the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely .	-3.2275
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology .	-1.9153
They spent the next six years discovering the wild animal within the 2,500 pound ( 1,100 kg ) heavy earth clumps .	-3.3566
After all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .	-1.7522
" If you only blind a little with your eyes , you might almost believe it has sleep , " said the main author Caleb Brown , scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum , where the creature is to see .	-4.7935
" It will enter into science history as one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs . "	-3.4016
Researchers have discovered that , although it is covered with armor and resembles a changing tank , it was probably threatened by meat eating dinosaurs .	-4.1987
The strong armoured dinosaur used a red and white tanning to hide from predators , and used a shielding technique known as counter-shading , which is also used by many modern animals .	-4.8612
This would have allowed us to get better in his surroundings and escape his enemies , experts say , which suggests that major dinosaurs threatened it .	-5.7667
The 110 million years old creature from the family of nodosaurs made headlines in May and is now available in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology .	-3.0566
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum stechnik Mark Mitchell , one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours detecting it carefully .	-3.9922
Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists , patterns and shapes of scales and armor can be documented on his body .	-4.6596
They discovered the counter-shadow , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , meaning that the top of the creature was darker than its bottom .	-4.1320
Although the shadow is common , the results are surprising , as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of today 's animals .	-3.6452
It suggests that the dinosaur was hunted by enough pressure by flesh-eating dinosaurs that evolution favored confrontation veiling as a means of survival .	-3.8388
But most contemporary animals that use counter-shadow - think of Rehe , Zebras , or belt animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey , which signals that this nodosaurs was faced with a real fight for survival .	-5.3910
" Strong predatory behavior on a massive , strongly armed dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the Credit Age must have been , " said Brown .	-4.8050
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of dinosaur was red brown .	-1.8326
Scientists continue to examine the animal ’ s references to his life , including his conservated intelligence , to find out what it eaten as his last meal .	-4.9706
They believe that the dinosaur , when he died , was dragged into a river and driven out into the sea , where he sank on the back to the sea .	-5.3037
At that time , Alberta was as warm as Southern Florida today , and rivers and oceans were likely to spread much further landward than they are today .	-4.0748
" This nodosauris really remarkable because it is fully covered with conservative scaly skin , but also preserved in three dimensions and preserved the original form of the animal , " said Brown .	-4.7872
" The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as it was in the early Circle Age .	-4.3631
You don 't have much fantasy to use to reconstruct it ; if you just shoot a little with your eyes , you might almost believe that it is sleeping ' .	-5.8973
The Circle Age was a time when huge theropodes , carnivorous dinosaurs that stood on two legs pulled through the earth .	-5.5931
Although the King of them , Tyrannosaurus Rex , lived millions of years after Borealopelta , the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors .	-3.6836
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus , a 38 feet ( 11.5 m ) long , six tonnes of heavy monsters .	-2.3297
Scientists whose latest findings appear in Current Biology magazine believe that Borealopelta was sinked in the sea after death and mumified in the mud .	-3.7275
The creature was found by Shawn Funk on 21 March 2011 at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta , Canada .	-2.7021
According to the museum it is the best preserved dinosaur in the world , including skin and armor , and is complete from the snail to the hip .	-2.9501
The creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,300 kg ) .	-3.1347
It contained two 20-inch tips that ran from his shoulders .	-4.0096
The researchers believe that the armored plant fresher was flooded through the Western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea .	-4.7645
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur preserved his armor in exquisite detail .	-3.1080
The stuck remnants of this special copy are so well preserved that the skin trees still cover bulky tank plates along the dinosaur .	-4.9117
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic , such a level of conservation is rarely as a profit in the lotto .	-2.6561
The more I look at it , the more confusing it becomes .	-1.5926
Stonehed remnants of the skin still cover the bulky tank plates that bear the skull of the animal .	-4.9573
His right-hand foot lies at his side , his five fingers are stocked up .	-4.5634
I can count the scales on his sole ' .	-1.7761
In the Water : Mass Carambolage on A8 : Many Injuries	-3.2002
Great accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : barely 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carambolage .	-3.7497
There are many injured , kilometre-long congestion and gaffer .	-2.7556
On the Stuttgart-Munich motorway ( A8 ) about 20 people were injured on a mass carambolage on Thursday afternoon .	-3.6045
According to the police , at 5 p.m. between the connecting points Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen ( district of Aichach-Friedberg ) during a thunderstorm nearly 30 vehicles , including probably trucks , were collapsed .	-5.8022
The exact number of injured was not indicated at first .	-3.5131
It is light to medium-sized injuries , a police spokesman said .	-3.6574
A large number of rescue vehicles were on the site of the acciden.	-4.8101
The A8 was closed in full direction of Munich .	-7.9048
In the direction of the journey in Munich , about ten kilometres of redundant formformed . the the and the . the the and the .	-12.0511
As an AZ reporter reported , massive disabilities occurred on the opposite track - by a large number of gaffers .	-5.4506
The fire brigade listed the characteristics of the vehicle lenders , who now have to expect sensitive penalties .	-4.7813
Shortly after 18 : 45 , another accident occurred on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and Dasing .	-2.6404
There was a collision between a car carrier and a car .	-2.9153
A rescue helicopter was on the way to an accident .	-2.5006
Deutsche Bahn : Group tests " Comfort Check-in "	-1.2437
It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced before : Nothing suspected you are sitting in the train and sleeping .	-5.8162
Or you are deepened in your work and have just a brilliant idea .	-3.6098
And then : buffer .	-1.7957
Comes the creator and wakes an unsoft one or tears the passenger in the middle of the workflow .	-5.0669
Ticket control .	-1.0520
But the times of interruption are about to end .	-2.5087
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the future-free ticket control system .	-2.9051
You simply confirm by mobile that you take your seat and devalue the ticket .	-4.2769
A test operation is currently running on two routes .	-2.8748
" If the offer extends , we will extend it .	-3.2445
It will probably be available at the beginning of next year on many other routes in Germany , " said a rail spokesman .	-3.8234
" Comfort Check-in " calls the train the devaluation of tickets without Schaffner .	-3.9540
In order to be able to use these , however , some conditions need to be met : you need a smartphone or a tablet .	-4.4525
And you have to book an online ticket - which is what most passengers do anyway .	-3.9274
You also have to purchase it via the app of the railway , the DB Navigator , which is the most convenient way to book your ticket .	-5.4083
Last but not least , you need a seat reserv.	-2.4007
Because the " Comfort Check-in " works like this : you get up in the train , call your ticket under " My Tickets " .	-4.7709
For test customers a button appears for electronic devaluation .	-3.3998
The tractor receives a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and has taken the booked seat Y .	-4.9175
If the train accompaniment arrives in the ticket check at Y he knows that there is a passenger with already devalued online ticket .	-5.4961
So you can sleep further , work further , let alone .	-3.9187
The " Check-in " has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the railways - which in turn should be used by passengers .	-3.8495
" Who wants to travel without a ticket control by our train companion simply checks in the DB Navigator .	-5.7469
This allows passengers to make their travel time more personal , " says Michael Peterson , Marketing Board of DB Fernfahrt .	-4.3053
Second plus : " And our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs " .	-3.1717
Those who travel frequently know that besides delays and missed trains , ticket controls are one of the greatest troubles .	-5.7939
Because often you do not have all the documents you need to devalue online tickets yourself , but in any case one of the passengers .	-6.5905
Either the credit card or the identity card is missing , or any other document you need to provide .	-4.6700
The result is endless discussions between train companions and passengers , which leads to poor mood in the departure or spaces and delays in controlling your own ticket and ultimately takes the creator the time to deal with other concerns .	-6.4949
Only a small number of test customers can still use the new service .	-1.8469
And that even on ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart connections and ICE 912 Stuttgart Essen .	-3.1447
Other train numbers on the same route have not yet been activated .	-3.8944
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question : ' Whose Streets ? '	-1.4489
On 9 August 2014 , Brittany Ferrell was shocked to her core .	-2.0821
Only one day after she arrived in New York City , the born in St. Louis sat on the bed of an Airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone .	-3.0996
She stumbled over a post from someone from the High School .	-2.0861
" The police have just killed an 18-year-old child and it is still on the street " , it said there .	-3.4571
Confused because nobody else posted the information on their feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .	-2.6307
A user with the handle <unk> TheePharoah was constantly retweeted on their timeline .	-2.6176
The rapper from the area of St. Louis was killing live the death of Michael Brown , an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson , Mo . , .	-3.7019
He posted an image of Brown ’ s lively body that was stretched out on the street and would remain there for four hours .	-4.5682
" That is wild " , Ferrell thought of himself .	-3.4045
But death was nothing new for them and their community .	-1.6269
She departed her cell phone to return to tweets later on the Canfield Drive on .	-4.1505
There were photos of the police band and people who shouted , and of a man who claimed to be Brown 's father who had a sign with the label : " Ferguson 's police just killed my unarmed son ! "	-4.4488
She observed a live feed where a policeman stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a belling dog .	-2.9569
In another video , she said , another police shouted his gun and shouted : " I will kill you ... animals all . "	-3.5993
" This is not customary , " Ferrell recalled her statement .	-3.0644
'This is not the type of murder we have used to and we can call it typical ' .	-3.9864
At this moment I felt shaking frost .	-3.1805
I was angry and wept . '	-1.7247
They bought a return flight and went home the next day .	-2.3865
After landing at 23 p.m. , she picked her six-year-old daughter from her father ’ s house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson next morning .	-4.2228
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years is the theme of a new documentary , " Whose Streets ? " , in cinemas from the 11th .	-3.6905
It is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resilience that consists of people who live in the Community and who filled the streets to demand answers .	-4.0231
When Ferrell went to Ferrell with her daughter , who had a flower dress and a matching crown , they discussed a conversation that they had countless times before this morning » about the black experience and the black state <unk> .	-4.7196
" You remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe in ? " she remembered what she said .	-3.0553
" We are going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that was not right .	-3.0352
I couldn 't take it with her , " Ferrell later said .	-3.0227
" What happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .	-2.2887
It needs to know it and to see it and be drawn up in it .	-4.6131
It must be well developed , not only activism and organisation , but also know the various sections of the black experience and the black constitution and what we must do to get free to ourselves .	-4.2554
Although I am lucky to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience any blatant racism , she is no different from the next black women 's child .	-4.4219
I have the feeling that I would do her a bad service to keep them out of it . '	-3.5564
The first station when they arrived in Ferguson was at the South Florissant Road , a place opposite the police force , which became a campsite when the activists were waiting for the possible non-prosecution of Officer Darren Wilson .	-4.5986
Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch there .	-3.4720
They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators .	-2.1701
Slowly , a new type of activism for Ferrell shape began to be assumed .	-3.4928
" My activism changed totally after August 9 , " she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association , focusing on food justice and health inequalities in black communities .	-4.3621
" I had no experience in organizing .	-1.2603
Everything has happened . '	-2.0835
Weeks later , Ferrell met one of the co-directors of the movie during an evening demonstration Sabah Folayan .	-3.6388
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado Farrar just wanted to " document " what happened .	-2.2389
One question came to Ferrell : ' Want to document or try to find a story you can exploit ? '	-3.9582
This scepticism was fed by innumerable cases of people , often by white , in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience .	-3.5190
As Folayan recently said in an interview : ' We had heard that people born and grew up in Ferguson have not centred their votes and we wanted to do it differently ' .	-4.1470
Folayan had already worked with the then co-director Damon Davis , an artist from the field known for his activism around death ract inmates .	-3.4921
Ferrell 's commitment brought the project closer , together with six other locals , to the team of " Whose Streets ? " in the years after Brown 's shooting .	-5.1067
" This documentary is not someone who speaks to us or speaks with us .	-10.4064
'That was the main thing for me , as these people are presented , for so will I be represented ' .	-4.7632
The aim was not to focus on Ferrell 's experience - to show that the movement " is not a Messiah leader but a community that comes together , " said Folayan - she proved to be the most open participant in the film .	-4.2909
As a result , " Whose Streets ? " documents surprisingly show personal aspects of Ferrells 's life as she feels in love and married her wife .	-4.6331
" I felt like naked , " Ferrell said and laughed when she first saw the finished product .	-2.3129
" But I understood that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanisation of black people . "	-3.3382
Moreover , Ferrell ’ s history repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black Lives-Matter movement .	-2.8743
Two of the three founders of the movement that shaped the movie " BlackliveMatter " in social media after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 identify as gay .	-3.4706
" Black , gay women in management positions have carried the movement as a whole , " said Ferrell , " and so we are constantly fighting on various fronts .	-4.4604
Black , gay women must bear the brunt of everything ' .	-2.2649
Folayan agreed to note that ' the movement really is maintained by black women and many black women ' .	-2.4261
It insists , however , that " this is not an affirmative type of action , " when Ferrell was selected as the heart of the film because of her identity .	-4.2632
" She was the person who upset this energy , " she said .	-2.6517
" It is no coincidence , although it was at the forefront , because a life at these crossings is so much at stake as a black gay woman .	-4.3495
You can feel their energy through the screen . '	-2.0514
Meanwhile , Ferguson ’ s news cameras have long since disappeared , but racial links between the municipality and the police continue .	-3.3819
Ferrell is on probe for 2 <unk> years because of blocking a motorway at a demonstration .	-3.5351
It describes the area 's social and political atmosphere , which it calls its home : ' A chaos ' .	-4.0604
However , she clings to a vocal clinic and feels committed to this memory since she went to the street three years ago in Ferguson .	-5.6531
" It is our duty to fight for our freedom .	-0.7945
It is our duty to win .	-1.2654
We must love and support each other .	-1.0141
We have nothing to lose except our chains . '	-1.7919
From Dream to Grö<unk>enwahn : TV readers discuss Bit Gallery .	-3.6014
The Bit Gallery moves people even though it is far from being built .	-2.8744
But the idea of a shopping centre on the southern part of the pedestrian zone has split the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation 2009 .	-10.3863
Cold doesn ’ t let the theme down .	-5.0294
The subject is also discussed on our Facebook page " Volksfreunde Bitburg " .	-3.0958
Whereas some say on the Bit Gallery : " This would be a dream " ( Anja Becker ) or " That would be real class " ( Nicole Shouts ) , comes from the other side : " Don 't Man " ( Siggi Betzen ) or , quite simply , " Grö<unk>enwahn ! " ( Lars Scholz ) .	-6.4462
Whereas advocates rely on a gallery to attract more customers to the city , including the rest of the business , opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will bloom .	-5.8423
In addition , the gallery is planned precisely on the plot where the farm market hall stands , where 13 direct marketers offer their products .	-5.0688
This will end as the construction works begin .	-8.0193
The gallery makers want to incorporate a market hall into the new building - to the Beda Square with the possibility to sit outside .	-4.9094
Simone Rooms : " We have been buying in the farm market for many years almost weekly .	-3.1088
Mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the rural women , are always very happy .	-3.8307
We also discovered the butchery for us .	-2.2551
We would like to see an opportunity to maintain this offer even during and above all after the construction of the gallery .	-4.1709
Other cities do .	-2.8701
The small market hall in Frankfurt in particular is interesting . '	-2.6534
Gerd Densing : " Whether direct marketing operators are located in a market hall in the gallery , the rent is high .	-5.4262
The new project will probably not be very low . '	-8.8272
Eva Kilic : " What shopping palaces in Bitburg ?	-1.8336
Whether clothing , shoes , drug or supermarkets , I find this superfluous .	-2.8319
This is enough in our city .	-2.5599
You can see how many stores here are empty - some for months and years .	-3.0587
However , as there is not even a proper weekly market here , it is all the more important that we maintain at least the market hall .	-3.9264
After all , the goods offered there are fresh , mostly offered directly by the producer and are also inexpensive .	-4.8276
As you can see , stores in a shopping center are only rented by larger companies , because the rents there are often not sustainable for a retailer .	-5.6802
Sadly , special shops almost do not exist and what remains of them will probably disappear . '	-5.5690
Wolf Fandel : " A shopping centre with a market hall does not fit for me .	-1.8985
And the gallery doesn 't fit into Bitburg .	-1.4601
Above all , where should the Farm Market Hall go during the farming season ?	-5.1348
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run , if the bit gallery actually comes in .	-4.2208
Or does the spectre Bit Gallery manage to sell all shops from Bitburg before ? '	-4.9636
George Marquet : " This simply will not work .	-1.9452
And no one needs a shopping centre that is empty .	-3.0509
I think it would have been better to promote a real farming market instead of that gallery .	-3.2251
But there is no place for a farm market hall , thanks to the madness of many - I think - pointless construction projects in Bitburg .	-5.3343
When the farm market hall is broken , a piece of culture will disappear again ' .	-4.0257
A suitable similarity : Artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA	-1.6624
In the middle of the Fridman Gallery in New York , there are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which are almost imperceptible - that hang on cables from the ceiling .	-9.5548
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg of cheek tups and hair cuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning .	-4.0248
Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth , where the former intelligence analyst was serving a 35-year-old prison sentence after being classified as secret diplomatic news about WikiLeaks website .	-5.5920
The new exhibition opened on August 2nd is called A Becoming Resemblance .	-2.4640
She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg , whose discipline combined their expertise in technology , computer sciences and art , and Manning , a transwife and groundbreaking dissident whose condemnation was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in office .	-4.4182
Dewey-Hagborg , through the algorithmic analysis of the DNA extracted from Manning , created from 30 portraits , how someone could look like with these genomic data , has created a sharp , albeit somewhat intellectual comment not only on the form of DNA data - the many ways in which they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also on identity .	-5.8198
Manning , born as Bradley Edward , but has already spoken openly about women ’ s identification since her puberty , was condemned in 2013 for 20 charges , including six infringements of the Spionage Act , computer fraud , and theft .	-4.5917
Through the prison their image was oppressed , so much that there was only one photo - a grained , black and white selfie , in which manning clearly sits on a driver 's seat and bears a platinum piece - with which it was associated .	-6.4159
In 2015 , Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of her 2012 project ' Stranger Visions ' .	-2.3762
In it , the artist produced portraits of forensic artifacts such as cigarette stumble and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to make a picture of how these people could look .	-14.5773
That was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine .	-1.9211
" They interviewed Chelsea Manning while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , " said Dewey-Hagborg at a press review of the new exhibition .	-3.7255
And she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed , so contact Chelsea and ask her whether she wanted to make a DNA portrait .	-3.3887
The artist and her imprisoned museum became unequal letters who exchanged several letters over the course of two years .	-3.8534
They even created a comic " Suppressed Images " illustrated by Shoili Kanungo , which anticipated a future in which President Chelsea 's judgment would be converted and she would be able to see the exhibition personally .	-12.3610
Indeed , just a few days after the book was published , Obama ’ s call for Mannings to be released after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome kind of happy meetings .	-3.8281
There is also some depth and strength at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Trump is waging a war against officials from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new , tweetable ways to further escape the rigid divisions that he was supposed to fix .	-5.6596
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said that " things happen for a certain reason " .	-2.5037
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Manning demanded with her overwhelming signature ( the " i " in her family name is marked with a heart ) an end to " automatic fragmentation , the basis of which has been gender , race , sexuality and culture . "	-4.8269
On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand feet of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .	-3.5188
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show how astonishingly similar , at least in biological terms , we are all .	-2.7966
" What people will hopefully take with them is that our genome does not care about who we are and how open genetic data are for an interpretation and how subjective they are , " said Dewey-Hagborg , whose video work of 2007 , Spurious Memories , is also visible .	-4.0258
" DNA data can tell so many different stories , so these are 30 stories . "	-2.3952
The last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in its own room , is a page from the comic novel mentioned above .	-5.1226
It shows manning how it appears with a free phone from the United States disciplinary casers like King Kong .	-4.1809
" When they cold your speech , they won , " it says .	-2.9631
" So never put the mouth " . . ! and ! and ! ! and ! and ! !	-6.4465
" It came directly from a letter she wrote to me , " said the artist who greets Philadelphia .	-2.1578
'I still have goat-watching when I talk about it . '	-4.2204
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition personally - as was foreseen in the comic book - but if it should , it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks , by its own genomic simulacrs , which , like Horde , have been united by protesters .	-7.4795
This was also targeted , as in the exhibition , to the size ( 5 " 2 , Mannings Statur ) , where their genetic haplo groups were written with pencil .	-4.4930
" In the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , " said Dewey-Hagborg from the portraits .	-2.4076
" I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , such as the movement that was also behind its liberation . "	-3.7456
Professor of the University of Northwestern and an Oxford employee for killing	-2.4015
A country wide hunt is in progress for a professor at Northwestern University and an Oxford University staff who are seeking suspects after a man had fatally injured in a luxurious apartment in Chicago .	-6.4692
On Monday , Wyndham Lathem ( 42 ) and Andrew Warren ( 56 ) were issued arrest warrants because of their alleged participation in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau , as shown by the Cook County Court acts .	-3.7724
The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau , 26 , died after several stitches .	-2.1104
A Community warning system published by the Chicago police authorities says that the body was discovered on 27 July .	-2.9932
Officers received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries on his body .	-3.5607
Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead at the site of the event , and detectives investigate the stick as murder , while the police actively seek the two suspects , said officials .	-4.7456
Since 2007 Lathem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University .	-11.8845
Alan K. Cubbage , the Vice-President of University Relations , said in an email statement that Lathem has now been evaluated and excluded from entering Northwestern University campus .	-4.2438
" This is now a criminal matter investigated by the competent authorities , and Northwestern University cooperates in this investigation , " said Cubbage .	-2.9543
Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University .	-1.4914
A university spokesperson and Somerville College said in an e-mail statement that " we are in contact with the police in Britain and are prepared to help the US investigation authorities in every possible way . "	-4.6685
The statement added that Warren ’ s colleagues were shocked and want him to stand up .	-3.3619
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Authority , Anthony Guglielmi , said he urged suspects to face up to the authorities .	-2.8481
" The police have an idea of their place of residence , and our efforts to localize them reinforce themselves , " said Guglielmi .	-3.5906
Guglielmi said that local , regional and national authorities are helping to find suspects .	-1.9762
Guglielmi said that the police received a call from the property manager of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received a puzzling tip that said that something had happened in the apartment 1008 .	-4.4011
The police described the scene as very cruel .	-0.8619
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July .	-2.0900
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building .	-2.1574
" We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship , " said Guglielmi .	-1.6424
The management team of Grand Plaza issued a statement to the inhabitants : " The police are currently working on the timeline and the background of the victim and are exploring a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . "	-4.4915
'We will finish the WADA Roadmap in the near future ' - Russian Vice-Prime Minister Mutko	-2.8542
Russian Vice-Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that it will not take long for the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) to be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti-doping agency ( RUSADA ) .	-3.2037
" At a certain stage in meeting the criteria of the roadmap , RUSADA has been given the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD ( UK Anti-Doping ) .	-3.1528
The WADA roadmap was updated in this respect , " said Mutko on Thursday .	-2.4966
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA Roadmap to comply with the code , which describes the criteria for the reinstatement of RUSADA and was recently published on the organisation 's website .	-3.6856
According to Mutko , there is nothing that could cause Russia to be worried .	-3.3614
" Everything was announced , everything will be implemented .	-2.3012
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and WADA in the near future , " he added .	-1.7747
One of the criteria mentioned in the list , however , states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the results of the investigation approved by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on supposed state-sponsored doping in Russian sport .	-3.8647
On the matter , Mutko said : " We conduct the investigation , because our anti-doping system made a mistake .	-4.1542
All the measures have been implemented .	-1.2737
But there were no government programmes and we will not admit anything that does not exist ' .	-3.3163
Mutko ’ s words were in line with those of Vitaly Smirnov , the head of the independent Russian anti-doping Commission .	-2.6138
At the beginning of the day , Smirnov admitted problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organisations , but added : ' We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .	-4.9064
No one intends to unconditionally accept this report , " Smirnov added .	-2.4340
RUSADA was excluded from carrying out doping controls in Russia in November 2015 during the doping scandal .	-2.8392
However , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping ( UKAD ) .	-2.3486
After a visit to Moscow 's headquarters in July , WADA Director-General Olivier Niggli declared that RUSADA is moving in the right direction " to be reinstated .	-3.3373
Aldi is not selling eggs for the time being .	-2.1240
The group of companies included that .	-3.7984
It was a purely precautionary measure that no health damage could continue to be assumed in the communication .	-4.9782
From now on , only eggs will be delivered to Aldi , which have been proven negative on fitronil-containing antipillows .	-5.9571
Aldi wanted to make clarity and transparency among its customers .	-3.9944
The Start Ups that will help your company not to become the next Uber	-3.0664
Amy Errett wanted to measure luck with your staff in your e-commerce start-up , but the polls did not work .	-3.5714
Answers were often vague , unhelpful , or , worse still , fraudulent .	-2.9761
Even if you promised anonymity , some workers did not trust the process .	-2.2077
" There was simply never consistency and objectivity , " said Errett , who operates the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce Hair Care company Madison Reed .	-2.8338
She has called for help from outside .	-1.5330
A new breed of Human Resources start-ups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel .	-3.2724
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee involvement , it enables companies to conduct surveys , address specific groups and demographic groups , provide anonymity and complaints hotlines , and in some cases whistleblowers allow C suite managers to bypass and turn directly to the board .	-5.0713
" You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health , but where is the fitbit for your company ? " said Jim Barnett , co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employees engagement .	-3.5841
Save said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with glint .	-3.6794
In addition to the snap surveys and surveys from certain teams , it offers a heat card from the company , which shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which executives have low approval results - so you can take back to why .	-4.6146
Companies will come to realise that they must remain at the top of the workplace culture so that you do not become the next user involved in scandals since a former employee published a blog post describing an environment of harassment that punished those who spoke .	-5.6014
For start-ups like Glint , this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity .	-2.6495
Global governance , regulation , and compliance could hold more than $ 118.7 billion in 2020 , according to the financial website , Let 's Talk Payments .	-3.4223
Denver , Colorado , Start-up Convercent , which helps to prevent and detect bad behavior , saw a rising interest and activity early this year in the midst of the Uber case in discredit .	-3.8975
Convercent has almost 600 clients , including Airbnb , Microsoft and Tesla .	-1.3951
Uber recently registered as a client .	-1.8100
Like Glint , Convercent allows companies to send customized " pulse " surveys , collect confidential answers in real time , and view the heat maps of your problem areas .	-4.1437
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that enables employees to report bad behavior .	-3.2190
And if the main manager is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .	-2.7876
" The court of public opinion has captured the regulators , " said Patrick Quinlan , the founder and managing director of Convercent .	-2.7227
When a company is found that treats its employees badly or acts unethically , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycotts , worker fluctuation , and complaints , Quinlan said .	-4.5327
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations , has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have a simple way to reach their business centres .	-13.6131
Previously , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or e-mail for the company ’ s headquarters , submit a formal complaint , and hope that he was taken seriously .	-11.1262
It was often a intimidation and inconvenient experience , said James Vitrano , Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel , who said that there was no good way to track the complaints of employees .	-10.6218
Now that Convercent uses , problems previously hidden by executives in offices in cities or states can be identified and addressed more quickly , such as discrimination , harassment or unfair practices .	-4.1294
" I can get closer to this holistic 360 degree view in employment experience , " said Vitrano , who leads the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday .	-3.5068
'And we protect our shareholders against employment disputes ' .	-2.4370
Companies began to take ethics , values , and employees ’ engagement more seriously in 2002 , after Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical violations by the Enron scandal , Quinlan said .	-3.8202
But it took until the " social media came to their law " that companies realised that they could not prevent their dirty laundry going online .	-4.3808
" Before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , " he said .	-1.4567
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service and burden companies with recurring charges for the use of their products .	-4.1389
It is a business model and an opportunity to get the agreement of venture capital investors who supported both start-ups .	-3.3340
Convercent received $ 10 million in funding in February from firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital , raising the total capital to $ 47 million .	-17.3911
Glitzer secured $ 10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners and brought all its funding to $ 60 million .	-3.4692
These investments are hardly surprising , given the networked nature of companies , culture and venture capital .	-2.3742
There is a growing research complex that shows that today ’ s employees expect more from their jobs than they have done so far .	-3.9903
In competitive markets like Silicon Valley , high salaries and interesting projects are only wages .	-2.6828
Employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .	-3.8611
" If people are happy to be in a company that belongs to their voices , and that the work you do is worth doing , then they feel more committed to making this company successful , " said Nina McQueen , Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn , who uses both Convercent and Glint .	-3.7801
Investors get returns when their portfolio companies run well , and companies run well when employees are involved and committed .	-5.8134
If the Analytics tools of third parties promise to increase the commitment and deployment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .	-3.6878
Data on the involvement of employees according to the experts of the workplace culture important .	-4.7053
But the data are useless if a company ’ s manager does not take action .	-3.6202
Indeed , if a company asks employees for your feedback , it can expect that change is on the way .	-3.6184
And if change does not occur quickly enough , or not at all , it can breed disappointments and demotivate employees .	-4.1357
" If you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be ready to have 4,000 discussions , " said Russell Raath , President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kotter International , who has seen companies that are too dependent on data collection .	-4.3961
" For if you do not follow people will ask themselves , " Have you really heard me ?	-3.0716
Do you care about this ?	-1.7013
And whom do you not care , why should I ? ' ?	-12.3764
Madison Reed , who is now conducting monthly employee surveys , was able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported about glint , says Savior .	-3.9458
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees , it was through the speed of decision making and the quality of communication , able to reorganize multiple teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems .	-4.4251
At Ruby Tuesday , the company is getting more and more insights into its employees and hopes that in the long term this will lead to a better link between workers in an industry known for high sales .	-6.1694
" If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , " said Vitrano .	-2.0265
" And if you lose people , you lose customers too .	-2.2722
And if you lose customers , you will lose businesses .	-2.2669
NCAA eliminates the two day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins .	-2.8213
At 23 p.m. , when a lot of UCLA football players entertained on one side of the new training fields of the team on the campus .	-4.3529
Some have pulled out their tricot parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .	-10.5166
For a good part of the team , these idle minutes represent a lunch break .	-2.1259
Players who are registered for the summer courses will return to their final tests after the three-hour exercise before returning to the Wasserman Football Center at 6 : 30 am the next morning .	-4.5905
" This is a real pedal mill for the boys the next three days , " said Bruin trainer Jim Mora shortly before Tuesday 's Monday .	-3.8356
The NCAA eliminates two day exercises to facilitate the burden of players and has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .	-3.6077
Therefore , UCLA 's first three training courses should begin at 7 : 15 p.m. to meet the players ' already fully packed timetables .	-5.8397
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins postponed the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and carried out practical exercises during the summer school for the first time during Moras six games in Westwood .	-4.2006
They are expected to hold 18 exercises during August , 20 before the start of formal preparations for their launch against Texas A & M in September .	-5.6015
Mora said that he supported NCAA ’ s regulatory change , even when adding another point to the players ’ diverse routes .	-4.7568
" We put this enormous burden on them three or four days , and it is very challenging , " said Mora .	-2.3411
" And they simply pushed it through , they continue to plunge , they are great people .	-3.3365
I think that as soon as we get to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great ' .	-3.9179
UCLA will end its practices once the camp has finished , which will not be easy , given the clear sights of its fields , by an adjacent car park and the adjacent Luskin Center , a hotel of the upper class that has already been stocked with footballs that have a network of protection behind a goalpost .	-7.5853
Bruin players are expected to occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mora acknowledged that there could be a problem once these rooms are free during the season .	-4.5274
" We will use our security , " said Mora .	-1.8325
" This is a real problem , and it is not far removed to think that people rent a room there and then prepare to record an exercise there .	-4.8868
If you have the video volume of an exercise , it is a fairly good business .	-3.0402
But we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking lot 8 .	-2.3015
We will do the best with what we have .	-1.5758
I am not too concerned about that .	-2.3794
We have a plan . '	-0.9233
Facebook wants to intensify facts review in the fight against counterfeit news .	-2.6954
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false messages to third party factual auditors and their results will be shown below the original post , said the world ’ s largest online social network on Thursday , one of its efforts to combat so-called fake news .	-6.2162
The company said in an opinion on its website that it will start using updated machine learning methods to detect possible false messages and send them to factual auditors , which may show results of the factual examination from the original article .	-5.9693
Facebook was criticised as one of the main points for so-called fake-news , many of which believe that they also influenced the US presidential election in 2016 .	-3.2915
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with French voters flooded with false stories in the run-up to the presidential election in May , and Germany supports a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to eliminate hateful postings , as before the elections there in September .	-4.4637
On Thursday , in a separate statement in English , Facebook said that a test of the new facts review will be launched in the US , France , the Netherlands and Germany .	-3.6210
" In addition to knowing what stories are contested by factual auditors of third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , " said Sara Su , product manager for Facebook news in a blog .	-3.9723
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature to the " related article " and will work on other changes to his message feed to reduce false messages .	-3.4493
Creating a comic novel : A castle in the History of England	-2.0390
In his recent past , the Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s .	-3.1369
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cosy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become an inspiration for a graphical novel by Jamie Rhodes , a mophaarige Yorkshireman with a fondness for historical documents .	-3.8625
" I find it so beautiful to look at the manuscript of someone who has been dead for 300 years , " he says weird .	-3.7744
'What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . '	-2.2790
'A Castle in England ' stretches the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documented the families who lived in Scotney . was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz , Briony May Smith , William Exley , Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg .	-4.2074
It is not the first book of Rhodes , based on an archive : he wrote 2014 ' Dead Men 's Teeth and Other Stories ' , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly emotional .	-11.0482
" I just reacted to the thumb print on the page of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700s who worked for the Jakobiners , " he says .	-4.4112
" That is his thumb print !	-2.4373
And letters smelled always for smoke , because at that time a fire was raised because of the light .	-4.8864
For someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if it were there .	-3.4155
Oh , I love archives ! "	-0.8949
For someone who was so beaten with old papers that he was supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle almost four months ( " To be honest , I have overvalued my welcome greeting a little ) this seems too beautiful to be true .	-5.0772
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian " new " castle , watching the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle , such as the mounted heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch .	-4.6725
He walked through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle and talked with landscape care , gardeners and sometimes with artists working on the illustrations of his book .	-4.3043
Then at night drink he " whiskey and started to write " .	-7.7289
The intimate story of Scotney is relatively unknown , as the National Trust gained full access only in 2006 , when the last heir , Elizabeth Hussey , died .	-3.0523
When Rhodes arrived a decade later , employees just started to look after the archive he described as " hundreds of years in which aristocrats said " Oh , throw it on the attic " .	-3.9620
Diary books , letters from the time of English Empire , maps that show who had what : " You might think that land conflicts would be boring , " says Rhodes , " but there was a birch to fought the two families .	-4.7619
Guys , let everything go going ! "	-3.5702
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive into English history on a broader basis , including The Labour , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the 1381 farm revolt .	-4.3486
" There is a record of a turmoil in the castle in 1380 , in this book entitled ' Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex ' , says Rhodes .	-2.7406
" The farming revolt began in this area and I thought that a revolt was a good beginning .	-3.6527
Perhaps the two are linked ? '	-2.0360
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle , such as The Priest , which tells the history of the Jesuit pater , which the Darrell family hidden for seven years during the English Reformation .	-4.5601
Or ' The Smuggler ' , where the smuggler Arthur Darrell from the 18th century staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coffin was excavated ) .	-4.0813
The Darrells are Rhodes ' favorite family of Scotney : " The men seemed to be fairly tale , repeatedly make debts , and spend money on things they could not afford .	-4.1955
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marriing rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well-looking boys , with a talent to promote herbs . "	-3.8381
After the end of his operation in the castle , Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences .	-2.7717
He left a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämäki , the site of a sanatorium from the early 20th century , which has since been called back by nature .	-4.8765
But Scotney has a special place for him .	-1.2498
" I was sad to go again , " he says .	-1.0030
It was like ' Oh , now I have to finish with the Damned Life ' .	-3.8917
Started Campaign : Over 300 Years old Mary Chapel in Rhöndorf	-4.7677
With the covering of the 301-year-old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf , the city of Bad Honnef started its campaign on Friday to launch a new umbrella brand ( Thursday ’ s round show ) .	-5.0074
By Thursday Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and the slogan secret .	-2.7822
At the end of August there will be a feast on the island of Grafenwerth as the highlight of the campaign .	-3.2243

Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan 's Fear of the Army	-1.7458
Every year at the beginning of August , Ankara advises the Supreme Military Council ( YAS ) on pensions and promotions in the Officer Corps .	-4.1754
This week too .	-1.8111
At first glance a normal procedure .	-1.0127
But nothing is routine with the Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt .	-1.8954
The meeting was no longer held in the General Staff building , as was previously , but in the prime minister ’ s seat .	-9.5942
The five Vice-Prime Ministers and Ministers for Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs took part in the deliberations under the heads of the government .	-5.1741
The civilians in the YAS were in the vast majority .	-3.8693
The government is drawing reins in the military .	-2.5632
General Chief of Staff Hulusi Akar remains in office , but the army commanders , the air forces , and the navy were dismissed .	-3.9949
Since the failed coup , Head of State Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals .	-2.3272
More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the army 's ranks , mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the exile preacher Fethullah Gülen , who Erdogan sees as the wife of the coup attempt .	-4.2636
Ankara has been negotiating for 486 people who have been directly involved in the coup attempt .	-3.1215
Already the day after the coup Erdogan called the attempt to overthrow the god gift , since he gives him the opportunity to " clean up the armed forces " completely .	-6.5515
But is Erdogan really under control of the army ?	-1.9260
At the end of February , the newspaper " Hürriyet " published an article entitled " Unease in the military headquarters " .	-2.6117
In the General Staff , there are concerns about the increasing " Islamization " of the army , which , among other things , manifest themselves in lifting the ban on soldiers ' headscarves , the newspaper wrote .	-4.8238
The massive cleaning of the army and the security forces will continue .	-7.3418
In mid-July , Erdogan decreed another 7395 public servants , including 2303 police officers and 546 soldiers .	-3.2643
It seemed that Erdogan had tamed the military .	-2.2937
The generals used to be the real masters of the country .	-1.7369
Three times , they put on their role as the guardian of the secular order of state .	-4.8749
After his election victory in 2002 , Erdogan pushed step by step back the military ’ s power , not least on the basis of the European Union ’ s reform requirements .	-4.5085
Former officers say that Erdogan is pushing ahead with Islamization of the armed forces .	-3.6243
In the ' Vocal Europe ' magazine , a nominally unknown officer , who sought asylum after the coup attempt to persecute abroad , the Turkish army would be ' full of extremists and salafists ' in a few years ' time .	-5.2714
If that is the case , NATO could not get cold .	-3.1434
There is no doubt in the alliance that the Turkish army will be willing to deploy after the cleansing .	-3.9960
Leadership structures and operational capabilities are " weakened " , say NATO diplomats .	-2.1059
Washington Changes the Green Card Rules	-1.0314
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the Green Card rules , said President Donald Trump , quoted by the media .	-2.0864
It envisages reducing legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stricter rules on obtaining visas for temporary work permits and restrictions on family visas .	-3.8559
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President .	-1.8647
The bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .	-2.4953
" This law will reduce poverty , increase wages , and save billions of dollars for taxpayers , and will do so by changing the way in which citizens from other countries are spent Green Cards . "	-2.9480
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .	-1.1438
This new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English , who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , " said Trump , quoted by the American media .	-3.8505
Ministry wants to repair the track for racing shuttle .	-4.8288
Over the past few months , the future of the race-climbing shuttle has been contested - and now it is to be done very quickly .	-7.4242
Before the end of the year , the tourist railway will be built on the marod route .	-5.1275
In order to safeguard the future of the racetrack shuttle in the long term , according to the Ministry of Transport , construction work is to begin this year .	-4.4369
" With the decision to continue ordering and renovating the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route , the country acknowledges this link , which is particularly important for tourism , " said Secretary of Transport Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt .	-5.4013
The cost of repairing the route was approximately EUR 2.5 million .	-3.1153
Of that sum , the country accounts for 75 % .	-2.8269
The treaty on which the shuttle will continue to be ordered by the country will be finally voted , explained Sühl .	-5.3143
The Ministry and the South Thuringian Railway as an operator already agree on the technical details .	-11.5641
" This negotiates the roadmap , the vehicles used and the quality standards , " said Sühl .	-3.6271
The planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be concluded for eleven years .	-3.0745
This should regularly order the Rennsteig-Shuttle on December 2017 .	-2.9191
The Rennsteig-Shuttle is a popular railway link between the Ilmenau and Rennsteig railway stations .	-3.9515
Over the past few months , a pilot was tested to see whether the route is used by enough people to order it regularly again in the future .	-5.1129
The track is also heavily reliable in parts .	-3.7741
The rise of sex robots is real , and we should worry about it .	-1.4677
It was precisely when you thought that 2017 could not be even crazy that a new report on technological developments in the sex robot sector was coming .	-12.2898
Yes , indeed .	-0.9055
Sex robots are currently a big thing .	-1.7690
Recently , the Foundation for Responsible Robotics ( Foundation for Responsible Robotics ) ( FRR ) published a report on the development of sex robots over for the next five to ten .	-2.6231
According to Noel Sharkey , a professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR , we must begin to take her ascent seriously .	-2.5655
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the chest and the type of fingernail .	-2.9135
" People are funny about them , but companies deliver a lot of it , and we will see them much more frequently , " said Mr Sharkey when he published his new report .	-4.9350
Modern sex puppies have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with deliberately human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence .	-3.4529
The user can also " adapt " his robot to his convictions , choosing everything from the eye color of the robot to the type or color of his fingernails .	-4.4756
But it is even more worrying because many robots have the " personalities " that a stepford woman would look progressive .	-4.1382
Modern sex puppies have become robots with a silicone skin .	-1.8720
For example , the RealBotix robot allows users to customize their robots to the features they find appealing , such as shock .	-4.0260
And then there are the Roxxxy Gold Sex robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as " Frigid Farrah " , which gives the impression of shock and " Wild Wendy " with a " adventurous " personality .	-3.9086
" Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is as well adapted to your personality , " warms the True Companion website .	-4.0381
So she loves what you like , and she doesn 't like what you don 't like , etc .	-2.5214

It can be tired , fixed on conversation or it can be " in mood " .	-9.9165
There are many worrying aspects to this rise in sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subordinate female characteristics , the allegations of rape , when you move a step toward Frigid ( in other words , reluctant ) Farrah , worry the most .	-6.0059
On his website , True Companion Roxxxy compared with a vibrator , but for men .	-1.6365
" If women ( sic ) can have a vibrator , why can they not have Roxxxy ? " says the website .	-4.2623
However , these sex robots are not just a fetish , or just another sex toy .	-3.3636
Their emergence and their increasing refinement point to a little darker and deeper in our culture , to a withdrawal from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as optional additions .	-4.4052
Most men will not , of course , keep sex robots , and while the FRR notes its rising popularity , they remain temporarily on the edge of consumption culture .	-12.6220
But what leaks through the peripheral areas can be very instructive in the spirit of the time we live in .	-3.1441
And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission to do so .	-8.7000
There is a certain overlap that these sophisticated sex robots emerge at a time when women ’ s rights are under threat worldwide , when there is a president in the White House who boasted of having sexually attacked women .	-4.6458
The most dissuasive aspect of the television series ' The Handmaid 's Tale ' ( ' The Report of Magd ' ) are not the graphic images , the blurred bodies and the blurred eyes , but how realistic this vision works .	-4.5611
The Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap .	-2.5449
The goal behind these sex robots is to create physical similarity to actual women as realistic as possible ( though with pornostar proportions ) .	-3.3647
Their builders want them to feel human that they emulate the movement of a real body .	-2.4657
But , to the point when it comes to their " personalities " , robots are not real women .	-3.2098
You cannot separate yourself from your companion or simply leave .	-3.6970
They have no mediation or background history , nothing that suggests independence or anything that could disrupt the imagination of total submission .	-3.1263
In other words , they are happy slaves .	-1.7217
Or to put it in the 2017 speech : maid service	-3.8951
Trump ’ s Great Performance ?	-1.6809
He turns Mitt Romney into the embodiment of common sense .	-1.7298
It has become a binding wisdom of the Trump era that the political divisions that polarized the US electorate have also divided families in small format .	-3.4099
Around Christmas and Harvest Festival , US newspapers have had advice on how to deal with Trump ’ s horror of relatives .	-4.5891
We are all allegedly striving to place our filter bubbles .	-7.8884
Less observed is Trump ’ s power to bring families together .	-2.4957
I mention this because my cousin , a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working on the Republicans in our family , visited me this week in New York .	-3.2339
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .	-1.8542
With Trump in the White House , anyone who knows it , including the Republican relative with whom it fought for decades , is suddenly and strangely on the same side .	-3.9433
It is certainly a good thing about the dining table , but I find it in another context that this also entails significant risks .	-5.1493
The Left has been strengthened by Trump , but his presidency ’ s disadvantageous effect has the power to push us all right .	-5.8713
When we talk about ' normalisation ' and Trump , we are referring to the cruel possibility that one day his mothers will no longer deny us .	-5.5504
But there is an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump right-wing Republicans appear to be " normalized " , suddenly as an embodiment of rationality , relative to his standards .	-5.0444
I find myself nowadays affected by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney 's urcomic version of the crazy - the dog on the roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax declaration looked ) - which , in fact , have been a very mild crime compared to Trump .	-5.5483
When Trump goes , the Republicans ’ next candidate must be intellectual healthy only to qualify as an immeasurable improvement .	-3.6458
When my cousin was in the city , we brought our children to the Carousel in Central Park , the largest of the New York Carousel Park Department , and the best three dollars to spend in the city if you don 't need a caffeine .	-5.3430
The horses are enormous , the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are crushing and the animals are twisted to look at their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climbing music conveys this in a strange way .	-5.9416
So many clichés of a city disappoint : the views of high buildings are old , the skylines are too familiar to offer a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city is not fair to the dream .	-4.6039
Thirty-five years later , and I am still not quite out of the day when I discovered that Swiss Cottage is not actually a Swiss cottage - the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a big roundabout in northern London .	-4.8152
However , the Central Park Carussell is still a strange magical experience , as it can be two years old , one 11-year-old and two women in the 40 ’ s and all have a great time .	-6.4508
If I could have evaluated the carousel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately nobody asked about it .	-3.5724
On the other hand , I was forced this week in a department store to evaluate my " experience " with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card .	-3.9512
In the coffee house on the corner of my street , it is the same , plus the option to compare the evaluation with a 15 % tip money - this to buy something about the shop .	-5.3821
Not only does this lead to a slowdown in what should be a neutral exchange , but it also puts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no is required .	-3.9811
The poor woman in the department store was exceptionally grinning , while I tired the experience of extending my credit card with five stars .	-4.4412
Oscar Pistorius is moving chest from prison to hospital .	-3.2930
For the second time , Pistorius left the prison for a hospital visit .	-2.2693
Last year he was brought to the hospital for the treatment of cuts on his hands , which he claimed to have suffered in his cell after a case .	-5.5052
Pistorius was sentenced to a first death sentence for murder after a plea by the prosecutors .	-4.3524
He killed Steenkamp in the early morning of Valentine 's Day 2013 by shooting them several times through a door to the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria .	-3.9036
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a night intruder hiding in the cabin .	-3.2070
Public prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six-year prison sentence of Pistorius , which they say is too lenient .	-3.3853
The national law enforcement authority said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and that appeal could be heard this year .	-3.8411
Pistorius is in danger of increasing his penalty to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful .	-3.4031
There is no death penalty in South Africa .	-0.6161
Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg .	-2.9412
As the last of the Blumberg schools , the fourth plassers of feet and Epfenhofen were released in the holiday and in the secondary schools .	-11.6818
Three of the redundant pupils will go to the gymnasium in the future , four to the real school .	-4.1183
School director Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public in Biesental in Epfenhofen on Tuesday evening .	-3.8876
The 29 students of the four classes , led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder , chose a young eagle who grows up in the Heihnerhof , but then released into freedom .	-4.7577
In addition , the munderer Shar led a musical entitled " Der eagle im Heihnerhof auf " .	-4.9692
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg and caused it to erupt from his chickens .	-2.8542
Instead of a chicken , a small eagle came out .	-1.9154
But the hope to make him a chicken broke out , the eagle spread out and disappeared on a high mountain .	-4.3088
Then the classes three and four showed a chicken dance in the studying of Yvonne Frank .	-3.1467
The hens danced with the young gockels that wear cylinders to the bet .	-3.0336
The eagle stands for integration , said school leader Angelika Sitte .	-7.3533
The animal is different from the other animals ( chicks ) , but belongs to it .	-5.4937
He will never be like a chicken .	-1.4334
Its purpose is to be free .	-2.1598
She wanted every fourth plaintiff to feel accepted in her new school .	-4.0646
It followed the words of thanks to the colleagues , the former head of school Michael Müller , who continually jumps in teaching passports , and parents ' representatives .	-6.1473
The cows time is over , Sophia Schumacher explained .	-5.0593
After two years of teaching , they dismissed their students very reluctantly , unless they had been a really great time .	-10.9234
Finally , they have been able to rely on the fourth plaintiffs .	-2.9957
At the end all students released a song of summer time and holiday time .	-3.3811
At the same time , children were very happy .	-4.1832
Eight initial plaintiffs have already been registered for the new school year .	-3.6366
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece	-0.9410
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece , with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted by television .	-3.1547
On the morning of August 1 , the police arrested a group of illegal people , including the two Bulgarians .	-3.0703
On the same day they were released , while an investigation is currently under way .	-2.9619
The foreign ministry reported bTV that the Bulgarians were released later .	-3.9677
The Greek authorities have tightened control of the free camp and imposed substantial fines on anyone who is found in a place that is not intended for that purpose .	-10.9545
The controls will continue throughout the season .	-2.2605
The ministry said that the Court could impose a fine .	-2.1449
Software update for diesel vehicles : What the stakeholders need to know now ?	-3.8496
How exactly does the software update take place ?	-1.3641
Do Diesel drivers need to take part in the action ?	-2.4259
Overview of the most important questions and answers .	-1.7874
At the Diesel Summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars .	-2.5503
They are intended to improve the exhaust behaviour of cars of Euro 5 emissions classes and in part Euro 6 .	-4.0487
Euro 4 diesel or worse are exempt from this .	-2.2448
Anja Smetanin of ACE Auto Club Europa gives assessments :	-2.3434
Is the new action mandatory ?	-1.0757
No , the negotiated software updates are voluntary .	-1.3005
" The compulsory updates previously apply only to the vehicles that have fuel software , " says Anja Smetanin .	-3.6158
The KBA has arranged its retrofit .	-4.1571
How and when will customers be informed about updates ?	-2.5223
Manufacturers have announced rapid implementation in the coming months , but have not yet given a precise date .	-3.5121
Daimler has informed everyone concerned to write .	-3.4223
If an inspection is due anyway , it will be done within its frame .	-3.8826
How long will the overall conversion take ?	-3.2019
" Schwer to say " says Smetanin .	-3.4925
This depends on the commitment of the manufacturers and on political pressure .	-2.5276
'We have seen that car manufacturers are not acting voluntarily on the subject of the environment up to now ' . are . and are . and . and . and . and	-10.8526
How long should the update take ?	-1.1995
The conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .	-2.5190
Time expenses could be to get an appointment .	-3.0470
What are drivers who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?	-2.4826
The ACE advises you to wait .	-1.6006
Probably , foreign manufacturers would follow , so Smetanin said .	-3.8275
Is there a massive decline in the price of Euro 4 cars now ?	-3.0686
The ACE fears this .	-1.1381
But it is precisely in the regions where driving bans are at risk .	-3.3866
There has been no loss of value in rural areas for older diesel .	-3.0737
The ACE advises you to wait with a sale .	-2.1275
LL Cool J is awarded to Kennedy Center .	-9.2345
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington .	-1.6660
The first award under President Trump promises to be political .	-2.0986
One of the winners will not come - out of protest .	-2.0730
LL Cool J ( 49 ) is the first rapper to receive one of the coveted awards of the renowned Kennedy Center .	-2.9993
As the cultural establishment announced on Thursday , this year singer Gloria Estefan ( 59 ) , Lionel Richie ( 68 ) and the choreographer Carmen de Lavalade ( 86 ) and the television producer Norman Lear ( 95 ) are the honors .	-3.6799
The awards will be passed on at the beginning of December .	-7.9596
Traditionally , US President Donald Trump will host a reception and participate with his wife Melania .	-2.9324
The progressive TV series prize winner Lear has announced that he will not participate in the gala .	-4.8090
" The New York Times " said : " This presidency has decided to neglect the arts and human rights completely - even to remove the resources - and that is a burden on me " .	-6.3781
The 59-year-old Estefan stressed that she will use the discussion with Trump to clarify her view .	-3.3501
The Kennedy Centre , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital .	-2.5680
Previous winners include Meryl Streep , Aretha Franklin , Robert De Niro , George Lucas , Tom Hanks and Sting .	-2.0502
We Make the City Life	-1.9768
Roland Wacker , Haslach ’ s town master , will be retiring next year .	-3.4942
The job is already written out - suitable applicants are rare .	-4.1400
Wacker has been master of the city for 31 years .	-2.7661
And the work is still a great deal of fun for him in the press conversation .	-4.3634
He reports of varied but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor .	-9.0504
At the same time , it is surprising that no application so far fulfils the requirement profile .	-3.8817
The city is looking for an architect or construction engineer at the next possible time .	-3.9087
Thus , while respecting the regular deadlines for redundancy , there is still enough time to do so .	-5.7862
Since Haslach is a subcontracting authority for the management community , the applicant must provide appropriate qualifications .	-5.5376
It is this function that the city wants to keep .	-4.3940
If they were unable to fill it , citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice .	-4.1700
But closeness to the city and to its own citizens is important , says Wacker , who reports of a good working climate and a good mood between the authority and the citizen .	-14.8757
In more than 30 years in office , some important projects have accumulated , which Wacker has been proud of .	-4.4032
" We make the city viable " , he is secure by the building office and its employees .	-4.6538
But there are also varied projects on the agenda in the future : the reorganisation of the former Hukla-Areal and the Niederhofenparkplatz , for example , is under way .	-6.1343
The Kinzig Bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed , and the stadium renovation is still a topic .	-3.3331
The latter alone will beat around EUR 1.5 million if we do it right , Wacker estimates .	-4.5116
" All in all , great tasks await my successor .	-2.5297
The work here is fun . '	-1.6390
There is a lot of room for manoeuvre in a town master .	-5.0462
Haslach ’ s own Bauhof and gardenery can respond to a lot of things quite flexibly .	-5.4991
'You can move a lot ' , says Wacker , and the design of the green facilities is often praised by citizens and visitors .	-3.7603
Since the old town as an ensemble is under monument protection , it is important to " have an eye for what fits " when new buildings are approved , the outgoing town master emphasizes .	-5.9092
In any case , the town mayor bears a high responsibility .	-4.3390
He is a builder , " in the end everything is going through my table " .	-4.3459
He can count on many years of staff with care and coordination : Markus Neumaier ( Hochbau ) has been involved for ten years , Manfred Schöner ( deep) for 15 years .	-5.9740
Wacker also wants to see that his successor remains long : " We are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the job . "	-12.1084
Continuity is important not only for a good working climate but also for the further shaping of the city .	-3.3405
If you would like to inquire Roland Wacker , you should have a degree as a degree engineer or a Bachelor with a degree of architecture and have good expertise in the fields of construction and construction planning law .	-6.6764
The municipal office is subject to high and low construction , construction planning , basic employment issues , urban property management , urban factory with Bauhof and urban gardening as well as lower construction law authority including monument protection .	-8.6758
Cycling Roads : Locked Southern Railway Road	-9.2646
According to the police , the perpetrators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway crossing in the area of the Leobener Strasse ( B116 ) onto the lines .	-4.6593
These were damaged so much that the freight truck that was approaching had to be stopped .	-5.2868
The investigators go from two male perpetrators and look for them since night hours .	-4.0154
A pink scooter and bicycle driver had been observed by witnesses near the location .	-4.0514
" This goes far beyond a lausbook stroke , " said <unk>BB spokesperson Christoph Posch about APA .	-4.4951
The perpetrators would have put themselves at great risk and also threatened rail transport .	-3.9411
In addition to the damage to the lock and the plant , as well as the delay minutes and costs for rail replacement transport , phenomena from rail customers could also be attributed to the perpetrators .	-7.3419
Overall , the speaker said that it would be " substantial " sum . " " " " . " " " and " " " " "	-7.6168
The damage was fixed on Friday afternoon and rail transport on the southern railway route could be done without disabilities .	-5.4193
Almost ten passenger trains were on Friday morning , two of them on the road .	-4.5281
Freight trains did not expire , but they were delayed .	-2.8448
According to <unk>BB spokesperson Christoph Posch , about 200 metres of upper lines had to be exchanged .	-3.3242
Isolators and masts were also damaged .	-1.8458
Red meat , dairy products , and chocolate could help relieve IBD ( inflammatory disease )	-2.4115
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system .	-1.5054
But a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could relieve symptoms of patients with inflammatory diseases .	-2.8391
The incurable state of affairs , affecting around 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the United Kingdom , causes stomach and bloody diarrhea , weight loss , and extreme fatigue .	-4.3623
While those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products in order to alleviate their symptoms , researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid Tryptophan of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote tolerant intestinal intesti.	-4.8196
The senior researcher , Dr. Marco Colonna , explained that immune cells patrol in the intestine to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in eating do not enter the body .	-4.0433
Cells that are able to trigger inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without harming sensitive tissues . and the .	-13.6722
If the balance tends too far toward inflammation , it can result in inflammatory disease .	-4.1671
In experiments , it was discovered that a kind of tolerance immune cell occurs in mice , which carries a certain bacterium in its inhabitants .	-5.4460
And the bacterium needs Tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of cells .	-2.9033
Professor Colonna said : " We have established a connection between a bacteria species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbium and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .	-3.8860
The more Tryptophan the mice had in their food , the more they had of these immune cells ' .	-3.5551
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a nutrition rich in Tryptophan promotes tolerant , less inflammatory intestinal milieus , if the same system also works in humans .	-8.8389
The postdoctorate Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan investigated a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found that a group of student mines had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , but which was housed separately , did not .	-5.7611
She suspected that the difference was with mice intestinal biomes - the community of bacteria , viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract .	-4.4140
The noise of the mice was sequenced DNA and six types of bacteria found in the mice with the immune cells , but without them were missing in the mice .	-4.8229
Mce was raised in a sterile environment , so that they lacked a intestinal biom and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they gained the L. reuteri and immune cells .	-5.5965
To understand how the bacteria affect the immune system , researchers L. reuteri grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - to immune cells isolated by the mice .	-4.1649
Immune cells evolved into tolerance cells .	-2.3392
When the active component was cleaned from the liquid , it proved to be a by-product of the Tryptophan metabolism known as Indol-3 milk acid .	-3.6720
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice feed , the number of such cells increased by about 50 % , but if the Tryptophan values were halved , the number of cells fell by half .	-3.9482
Dr. Cervantes Barragan explained that people have the same tolerance cells as mice , and that most of us L. reuteri protect in our gastrointestinal tracts .	-2.2721
It is not known whether Tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes related to Tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory disease .	-3.9851
She said : " The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote , as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine .	-3.3175
Potentially , high tryptoph values in the presence of L. reuteri may lead to an expansion of this population . "	-4.5663
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has committed a " genius " with Nemanja Matic .	-2.1259
Manchester United signed a " Genie " with Nemanja Matic , Jose Mourinho believes that the midfielder had his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening .	-4.0574
The 40 million pound signature of Chelsea began with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super-Cup against Real Madrid starts on Tuesday , and impressed in the holder role when people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira advanced .	-4.0697
However , Matic was excluded from the Blues preparation Asia tour , and only 45 minutes of what Mourinho admitted he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season .	-4.5945
" He takes time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks soccer , " said Mourinho .	-1.8849
'We will help him to be ready sooner than later ' .	-2.0186
In addition to Matic , Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started in the Aviva stadium , when Mourinho formed his start XI for the beginning of the season .	-13.1435
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wished for another three commitments , but he insisted that the club had already done a " fantastic job " to fulfil three of its four primary commitments .	-4.4813
" Get three of four , for which I thank the association " , he added .	-2.9096
'I 'll be happier if they get four out of four for me , but they have made a great effort . '	-4.1988
Boeing " Malt " Dreamliners in the Sky	-2.0932
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner into the sky .	-3.3120
The pilots flew from Seattle in the US state of Washington , but the drawing began in Marquette in US state Michigan and moved to the US in the form of a Dreamliner , which is several thousand kilometres .	-4.4673
The action lasted 18 hours and one minute .	-1.5840
On the radar screens the shape of a Dreamliner was to be .	-3.5301
The whole thing was an endurance test for new engines .	-1.9037
Boeing had already made such advertising earlier .	-2.1136
So the number " 787 " and the Boeing logo was painted into the sky .	-2.2687
New Deep Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem	-3.2910
As the wind turns , when Sigmar Gabriel was SPD chief , social-democratic prime ministers always looked to Berlin with some concern before the elections .	-4.3035
No disturbance from the party centre , just no headwinds from the federal government - that was the main desire of the electoral campaigners .	-6.4627
Since Martin Schulz led the party , that has changed fundamentally .	-1.8457
Since then , the employees of the Willy Brandt House have been growing horribly watching events in the SPD ruled state capitals .	-4.7137
What Schulz has got from there since the beginning of the year is not even described in the approach .	-4.2713
They were depths .	-2.8391
One by one .	-1.9282
After the surprising end of the Red Green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CDU sees a general signal against coalitions between the SPD and the Greens .	-3.5210
" This shows once again : Red Green simply cannot govern reliably , " said CDU Secretary-General Peter Tauber to the editorial network Deutschland ( RND ) .	-3.4953
The surprising departure of a Green MEP has brought the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .	-3.7385
Five months before the election , his red green coalition lost its one vote majority to the opposition from CDU and FDP .	-2.7176
The Green Managing Director Michael Kellner has asked the breakaway Dutch Green MEP Elke Twesten to return their mandate .	-4.9124
Transferring to the CDU is a clear distortion of the will of the electorate .	-3.1674
Elke Twesten must immediately return her mandate , " said the federal manager and campaign leader of the Greens to the editorial network Deutschland ( RND ) .	-3.9320
" All this must not be true , " a SPD campaign blows when , on Friday morning , the new Hiobssight reaches the party centre the new Hiobssig.	-6.9557
Stephan Weil , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands for the CDU without a majority of his own government following the resignation of the Green MEP Elke Twesten .	-5.2371
It is the provisional highlight of a series of major and small crises in SPD national associations .	-3.6828
And no one knows what comes next .	-1.8394
The misery began with the unexpected significant defeat in the Saarland election in March .	-2.2442
A blue eye , no longer , the connoisseurs reassured .	-3.6712
After the general elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia , everything will be different .	-2.9366
It became all the worse .	-3.9535
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to the thundering , the Düsseldorf default smoothly moved the party .	-4.4847
The costumers raped again in the weeks after .	-4.8660
Then , when they had just created new courage , the G-20 Summit in Hamburg came .	-2.3053
And with him came the next low strike .	-1.8364
Mayor Olaf Scholz , the last strong SPD leader , lost his nimbus on that weekend because he was in the Elbphilharmony while his city burnt .	-3.8631
And because he made so many wrong things in crisis communications afterwards . . .	-10.8029
Since then , Scholz has struggled for his political survival .	-2.6320
Now Stephan Weil .	-1.8250
The Dutch Prime Minister has been criticising for a long time now because of the VW exhaust and his role in the supervisory board .	-5.0438
Miese polls were added .	-2.7346
Nevertheless , or perhaps precisely because of this , we have tried to put more and more emphasis on the federal system over the past few weeks .	-13.2321
The efforts of the former mayor of Hannover to expand his power in Berlin were also not hidden in the environment of Martin Schulz .	-4.7437
They allowed it to be granted because they promised to stabilise the party .	-3.3099
The exact opposite could happen now .	-1.9495
Because of the partisan condemnation of the Lower Saxon Greens is basically not guilty of this .	-5.1553
And Schulz not at all .	-2.3477
For now , the connoisseurs are trying to keep their own ranks closed .	-4.5378
Their anger is directed at the Greens , and especially to the dissenting parliamentarian Twesten .	-3.9289
" It is intolerable and damaging to democracy , as Mrs Twesten puts her own career interests above the interests of everyone else , " says Matthias Miersch , Chairman of the Party Left in the SPD federal group , the editorial network Deutschland ( RND ) . and the the the and the the the . the the the and the the .	-11.2485
Mrs Twesten was elected to Parliament not because of her person as a direct candidate , but through the list of the Dutch Greens , as the Lower Saxon Member continues .	-5.9054
The logical consequence would be for it to return its mandate .	-7.5849
Thomas Oppermann , head of the SPD Bundestags Group , complains of an ' undemocratic manoeuvre ' .	-3.1551
" The will of the electorate four years ago was clear : the people made Stephan Weil prime minister , " says Oppermann , who leads the Dutch SPD into the election , the RND .	-4.2538
" Now the personal career of a future CDU MEP distorts the election result , " Oppermann continued to say .	-3.7970
He called for the background to be cleared up .	-2.1028
I want to know whether there has been more or whether there have been further commitments from the CDU in Lower Saxony .	-3.5633
Money for Local III	-2.3164
Anyone who wants to refurbish their homes over the years can soon receive support from the country .	-9.8260
Albert Schindler informed Mayor and three representatives of STEG city development on Wednesday in Keiningen .	-4.3590
At the beginning of the information event , Schindler returned to what has happened so far .	-3.7578
Since 1991 , reception areas have been in place .	-3.0512
Baden-Württemberg then , in the reconstruction area I from 1991 to 2004 , took over two thirds of the funding .	-10.5935
In the recovery area II from 2005 to 2016 , the grant was at least 60 % .	-3.5558
For shindlers , the existing renovations are a " success project " - it is also important to promote internal development and not just to open up new construction areas .	-6.7744
On 4 April , the Presidency of Karlsruhe informed us that there will be a recovery area III .	-3.8916
The sum of funding amounts to EUR 833 333 , of which EUR 500 000 would come from the country , the rest of the municipality of .	-3.7275
How does a recovery area arise ?	-2.5591
As Schindler said , one will examine where the ' really old ' houses are .	-5.0566
It also plays a role , however , as to whether there is any interest in the planned area , to refurbish .	-5.2144
If necessary , the territorial borders could also be changed again .	-4.7822
STEG represented Martin Keller , Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening .	-1.6460
Keller presented the contents of the federal state program " Social City " , in which the sanctions would then be performed .	-4.5935
The core of the programme is the revitalisation of inner cities , the improvement of housing and labour relations and the maintenance and development of infrastructure .	-4.9673
The measures would be implemented objectively , i.e. per plot of land . .	-8.2577
The recovery area would then be defined as statutes .	-3.0431
Since 1 January 2017 , the allocation period for funding is still running until 30 April 2026 .	-3.8300
However , until September of this year , the inventory would first be carried out , in which those involved in the rehabilitation area will receive a questionnaire to fill out .	-6.6462
In November or December , the statutory resolution is to be adopted so that the sanctions can begin next year .	-6.1558
Pietzschmann then declared that each municipality had to carry out the said prior investigations .	-4.2616
It is a question of assessing urban maladministration and deciding when it will be refurbished and to what extent .	-4.0549
A reconstruction note is also included in the property register for the respective plot .	-4.9104
Pietzschmann himself will come back to reception and get a picture of the situation she promised .	-3.3889
Gotzel stressed that a key success factor for the project was the participation of the parties .	-4.3146
There will therefore be questionnaires that will be sent to the public in the coming weeks and can be filled in until the end of the summer holidays .	-4.6191
The yellow questionnaire is the " arc of buildings and land " , which deals , among other things , with the state of the building and the reconstruction intentions .	-4.6920
In the grey questionnaire , the household and housing arc , information can be made about the size , division and residents of a residential area .	-4.5308
The blue " operating sheet " can only be filled in if the building operates premises .	-5.6897
However , it should be noted that a completed questionnaire is not simultaneously a request for funding .	-4.0076
Moreover , new construction measures would not be eligible for promotion . new .	-4.3188
Schindler stressed that the distribution of funding works according to the ' greyhound principle ' - who first comes first warns .	-5.9888
You cannot ' reserve ' money for later .	-4.3714
Finally , photos of the project " Ortskern II " have been shown to make a refurbishment " tasty " for the present .	-13.6574
British inventor sets himself a microchip to come home with a hand-movement and car .	-3.5497
A British inventor is the first in the country to be equipped with a microchip to open his doors , enter his office , and even start his car with a hand-moving .	-7.2364
Steven Northam , 33 , had implanted the tiny chip between thumbs and fingers and now offers services for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology by his company BioTeq .	-3.9360
He has joined Dr. Geoff Watson , a consultative anaesthesist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester , Hants , to ensure that the implant process is conducted according to medical standards .	-4.2381
The technology resembles a cat and dog implanted microchip and lasts only 30 seconds .	-2.0077
The company of Mr Northam also wants to change the castles of houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip , all at an additional cost of <unk> 300 per lock .	-3.6778
The married father of one has now installed at home and at his BMW Z4 technology that starts when his hand is at the wheel .	-4.0067
White House advertising costs thousands of taxpayers	-2.2767
The White House ’ s decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South Lawn for an event highlighting American manufacturing last month costs taxpayers up to $ 24,000 according to the military ’ s data left to the TIME magazine .	-4.2256
The green and white Sikorsky VH-3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on 17 July in the White House with American building programs .	-3.4911
President Donald Trump , Vice-President Mike Pence and White House officials made a tour of products from all 50 states .	-2.8775
The helicopter manufactured in Connecticut was exhibited besides a yacht from Maine , a Wisconsin fire brigade car and a forklift truck from Mississippi .	-3.4756
The White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO , hardly 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn , according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One ( HMX-1 ) , the unit responsible for operating the helicopter .	-3.6930
" I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , " wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event his superior , the deputy naval commander for aviation .	-3.8138
The news indicated that the helicopter arrived at 3 p.m. on the South Lawn on 17 July at 7 a.m. on the event , and until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 this evening .	-5.3597
The note adds that if the departure from the White House were to be delayed , a second team would be required for the return flight due to the restriction of hours of service .	-4.7689
The original flight crew was the helicopter during the event , while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time .	-4.1222
The records provided by the TIME did not make it clear whether a second flight crew was needed in the end .	-3.7042
The Hatch Act prohibits federal workers from using state property for political purposes .	-1.9236
Records indicate that HMX-1 asked whether the event could violate the provision .	-3.0456
" One question we asked was whether it was a breach of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case , " wrote the commander .	-2.7071
" Sounds as if you are locked , " the Deputy Commander replied .	-3.7312
The " Made in America " event was described by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act .	-2.7149
But official events also have political upper tones .	-1.8572
At the event , the President initiated the reform of the Senate ’ s health reform , and promoted efforts to curb government rules .	-4.7963
The use of the aircraft known as the Marine One or Air Force One for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon .	-2.3365
Presidents are obliged to use them for their journey .	-2.6135
But requesting their use only for a photo OP is unusual .	-3.1613
Trump conducted an investigation in February when the presidential aircraft performed in Melbourne , Florida , a taxi service against the background of his first campaign rally , and his Twitter account is full of reports complaining about the use of the presidential aircraft by his predecessor .	-4.8686
" The White House is enthusiastic about the show " Made In America " - which shows products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials " , said Deputy Secretary of the White House , Lindsay Walters .	-3.6787
HMX-1 cuts frequently carry out training flights in the area around Washington and South Lawn to settle the US president in the White House with precise cement rates .	-4.7812
When Trump was in Germany at the G20 summit in early July , HMX-1 held 58 training landings in the White House .	-10.9297
The flight for the " Made in America " event counted in the training needs of the flight crew for the month , a civil servant said .	-3.6650
Helicopter units also flew 11 hours on that day for ' non-presidential support missions ' .	-2.7705
The White House said that taxpayers took over the burden of none of the other requests presented at the event .	-3.1042
A speaker from Sikorsky said that the company had not been involved in displaying the helicopter on the South Lawn .	-2.9175
HMX-1 does not have any budget records for presidential flights , and it is difficult to identify the exact cost of the event .	-3.1454
According to student tariffs of the US Department of Defence for the 2017 fiscal year , however , the VH-3D reimbursement rate is USD 24,380 per hour .	-3.8035
The unit records the aircraft ’ s flight time as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia .	-3.6804
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is well below that rate .	-1.9391
" Setting the costs for taxpayers on the basis of estimates for reimbursement is highly misleading , " said Walters .	-4.1639
" These estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds . "	-10.6968
According to a 2015 RAND study , DoD refund rates do not include personnel costs , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and contract conclusion .	-4.3608
At that time , the White House ’ s former press spokesperson , Sean Spicer , defended the use of the helicopter for .	-12.2822
" The idea is to present things that are produced in America this week , " said Spicer .	-2.2501
" And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not thousands , depend on it .	-2.6620
And I think , like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly .	-2.1278
It is , of course , appropriate to emphasise this . '	-2.1939
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event , but he placed himself in the driving seat of a fire brigade car .	-3.9227
In the White House , Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and swore with the media about his own fleet of company products .	-2.9429
" I know Sikorsky very well " , the President said , " I have three of them . "	-2.0249

Leader of the Second Tennis Bond League performs at the table third Suchsdorfer SV .	-19.3970
The TC Blau-Weiss Neuss starts tomorrow at 11 a.m. at the table third Suchsdorf SV .	-3.3214
Despite five parties , the top runner of the Second Tennis Bond League still gained sense of reality .	-5.9689
In any case , Team Chairman Marius Zay has respect for the opponent .	-2.4635
" This is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formations .	-2.7898
It is precisely on the back positions that I find the team very good . '	-3.3440
Class and stability at Suchdorf SV are the primary concern of imports from the high north .	-5.4063

If it is not enough for the 18-year-old Hungarian , who was number one of the junior world rankings in January 2016 , someone from Trainerstab around Marius Zay is filling up the cadre .	-5.2372
How America Damage OMV	-1.5244
Indeed , Donald Trump was not happy when he signed his signature on Wednesday evening under the law to tighten sanctions against Russia .	-3.4143
" In his hast of passing the law , " Congress wrote a few " unconstitutional rules " , he estimated .	-4.3927
The response from Moscow , too , was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels was ashamed of the US advance .	-3.9788
After all , the draft provides for punishing European companies that help the Russians build gas pipelines into the EU .	-3.2730
Accordingly , investors from domestic OMV have since been worried about the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea elite Nord Stream 2 , together with other European companies .	-5.1474
The drought is huge .	-2.5870
Nevertheless , it is too early to assess the consequences , the official statement of the oil company .	-4.2049
Indeed , Donald Trump would have to bring the sanctions to life by executive order .	-2.8320

Narcos Staffel 3 Trailer : Without Pablo Escobar , the Cali Cartel will be brought to the center of the Netflix series .	-3.5276
Despite the second Narcos season , which unveils Pablo Escobars Killer , the Netflix series is far from over .	-3.2830
The battles three and four were already confirmed by the streaming service , the first received their first trailer and showed the latest bad weight of the show .	-4.3284
With the third season , the DEA has focused its attention on the richest organization of drug trafficking in the world : the Cali Cartel .	-3.0382
Led by four powerful patents , they operate " like a Fortune 500 company " only with more state bribes and violent actions .	-3.5560
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela ( Damian Alcazar ) is the leader of the cartel , Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , Pacho Herrera ( Alberto Ammann ) commands the Mexican link , and Chepe Santacruz London ( Pepe Rapazote ) is in New York .	-2.7108

Role backwards : The city provides 46 aid kitchens	-3.7545
The city organizes the Kita lunch table itself .	-4.6937
With fixed contacts for the children and a team attachment .	-4.6767
The clock is rotated back in urban children ’ s day-care facilities .	-10.6341
On September 1st , Krefeld takes over food supplies in the urban children 's daytime facilities ( Kitas ) .	-5.3989
For Sonja Pommeranz , Deputy Director of Youth Help , this is a good news : " We were all very pleased " .	-11.9177
Cooking continues to be taken out of the house : a caterer takes over this task and delivers fresh cooking cooked .	-5.4840
The town operates 46 babies in the Krefeld area , and in 44 children receive a warm meal at lunch .	-12.4615
In the last kita year , 2800 children each sat at the tables , and demand is growing steadily .	-5.0099
" Meanwhile , not only eat children who are cared for 45 hours a week , in the kita at lunch , " explains Pommeranz .	-5.0426
" The offer is also valid in 35-hour care if children stay until 2 p.m. "	-4.4173
46 part-time workers have kitchen service from September 1st : they heat up the delivered meals , supplement them with salad , raw food and fruit , portion the meal individually , deliver the food , cleanse and purify the kitchen .	-7.2374
" Employees are permanently assigned a kita " , says Pommeranz .	-3.6822
The size - there are two groups as well as seven groups - decides the amount of time .	-4.5927
" The kitchen workers are now firmly part of the kitchen team " , says Pommeranz satisfied .	-3.8410
" Thus they are much more involved and it is easier for capital to implement educational concepts " .	-4.4720
It is also a question of healthy nutrition and cooking . . and . and . and . and . . and . and	-7.0180
" Children should help prepare food " .	-2.7446
The direct connection of the kitchen power to the team makes sense .	-3.1452
Also for the children .	-1.8885
" They have a known power in the kita , a person who is familiar to them , and not constantly changing people " .	-3.2408
This continuity is important for children .	-1.1666
The cleaning of the kita rooms - so far also the task of the kitchen forces - will be done by special cleaning staff in the future .	-5.1040
This variation - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - besides the quality improvement of the kitchen performance , also has the charm that it has proved to be the most economical in comparison to the cost between ownership and lending for the city , it is said in the press office .	-7.5069
And that , even though 46 part-time workers are recruited .	-4.1072
" But these hours do not get so much weight for around 750 people in the educational field , " says Sonja Pommeranz .	-4.4093

GMB senior organizer Drew Duffy said : " The fact that we cannot gain clarity from the General Site Manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross is deeply affecting our members .	-3.6223

That is why , from the perspective of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the background of Brexit , rising living costs and chronic production decline , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a prosperous production presence at McVitie .	-10.9179
A Speaker from Pladis said : " The Tollcross branch manager received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday , and the company will react directly to it as we appreciate the continuous commitment of employees and trade union representatives .	-4.7348
Two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross , where some questions were discussed openly .	-2.8681

Has the PSG Barcelona warned three years ago of Neymar ?	-8.4759
The League side may regret its interest in Marco Verratti .	-2.2049
Paris Saint-Germain will not relax in her persecution of Neymar after giving an offer of <unk> 189 million to trigger his release clause , but did she warn Barcelona three years ago before the World Record Overdue ?	-4.5722

After completion , Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athlete in the world .	-13.1330
Barcelona is angry about the way Neymar has forced his way out , although a source near the Catalan Management Board insists that the club has always done its best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013 .	-4.5519
But was the PSG president warned about this prospect three years ago ?	-2.0804
When Manchester City expressed interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014 , Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for each club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PSG .	-3.2503
" I 'm not concerned because they know that if they touch one of our players , then we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , " said Al-Khelaifi .	-3.1307
" We respect all clubs .	-1.0103
But if you try to sign one of our players , that will have consequences . '	-3.6745
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish Association expressing interest in the PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer .	-12.7396

It would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret at their own omissions or their miscalculation of what happened at that time .	-4.6842
The Vatican newspaper " Osservatore Romano " , on the other hand , criticised the ' double standards ' in reporting on violence in the cathedral .	-4.6582
With regard to the attacks in Regensburg , no one doubts that these are ' disgraceful and shameful acts ' , which should be punished and prevented in the future ; but striking is the ' degree of media manipulation ' , according to the author Lucetta Scaraffia , historian and member of the Italian National Bioethics Committee .	-5.4307
" The habit of calling the Catholic Church a source of all evils is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to consider it normal , " writes Scaraffia .	-3.6212
Fürstin Gloria of Thurn and Taxis also said in the interview with the Bavarian broadcast : " You like to go to the church and this is a founded freshness " .	-5.5069
In addition , she pointed out that in her youth " beats were a normal pedagogical means " to deal with cheeky children , as I was one , " .	-13.5577
They would find it unfair to apply today 's standards to previous decades , because the world has changed .	-8.4460
Pope Broder Georg Ratzinger often appeared in connection with the reports of abuse cases .	-11.1529
Unjustly , author and historian Michael Hesemann , who wrote the album " My brother of the Pope " ( translated into 12 languages ) with Ratzinger .	-4.5739
" I must defend Georg Ratzinger " , Hesemann says , " because all this had nothing to do with him , " he values the results of the final report .	-4.0837
What exactly is stated in the 440-page report presented by the lawyer , Ulrich Weber , who is appointed by Bistum Regensburg with the Enlightenment ?	-4.4933
A total of 547 Regensburger Cathedral Squares were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990 's with high plausibility " victims of attacks , 67 dom spats .	-6.2323
The final report refers to Georg Ratzinger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : " In summary , it can be said that Domkapellmeister R. used forms of physical and mental violence in many cases .	-5.1641
The punishment for punishment for punishment , especially with high emotionality , has also been more severe .	-6.1749
Nonetheless , contrary to many other accused , many victims estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore , in many cases , even in spite of violence , have positive memories of him . '	-6.2653
In the interview , Hesemann explains why he believes that the final report on the scandal of abuse at the Regensburg Cathedral , Georg Ratzinger .	-4.9781
Mr Hesemann , the 440-page report on the ' incidents of violence to defenders in the Regensburg Cathedral Spatzes ' gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger .	-4.8665
On the one hand , many students highlight its " humanity " .	-2.7591
On the other hand , he also appears as choleric and perfectionist , who often became handy when a domspatz musically did not deliver top performance .	-5.8102
How do you as his biographer value this final report ?	-2.4700
Michael Hesemann : If you are going to take the trouble and read the entire 440 pages of a report from the front to the back , you need to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is actually there .	-6.2254
He has just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly free of any suspicion of complicity or co-knowledge in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .	-5.1225
Violence trials at the pre-school also occurred outside its sphere of effectiveness .	-4.4900
At best , he can be accused of being too late or of not taking seriously enough initial suggestions .	-4.8056
The Cathedral Gymnasium on which he worked was perceived by practically all respondents as " redemption " , " sky " and " better world " .	-4.9640
For example , the vast majority of his students , Georg Ratzinger , is an excellent testimony , describes him as " warm-hearted " , " popular " , " competent " and " understandable " , as a very good teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes , biscuits and bonbons and " always surrounded by children 's grapes " .	-6.1594
Only a minority complains about its perfectionism and its high emotionality , which has already led to outbreaks .	-4.1804
He admitted , deeply regretted and apologized for , not only with chairs , but also ear figs , and too cheeky gu, . and . and . and and . and . and and . and . and . and and . and and .	-18.4385
In his honour , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread among parents and teachers in the period in question , the 1960s and 1970s .	-4.2657
Do you also know such breeding methods ?	-2.8437
Of course , I think each of us who was born before 1968 .	-2.0063
I have experienced this in a secular school , a state gymnasium .	-2.5912
Compared to what this report is actually about , namely the appalling sexual abuse and the acts of violence at the pre-school level , these are , of course , b.	-11.0523
One wonders whether it has to do with his fame and role as a brother of Benedict XVI that many media have just plunged to him .	-5.7940
Many people who have never understood him are still working on the Bavarian Pope .	-4.2454
But the truth is : the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect !	-2.7704
A great deal has been reported in the media in connection with the report on abuse in the Regensburg cathedrals .	-4.6079
Will Georg Ratzinger , in the final report , also bear some burden on sexual abuse ?	-4.0949
Michael Hesemann : No .	-2.4267
None of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claim to have entrusted themselves to the Cathedral Master .	-3.0707
Not even parents were admitted .	-1.6499
" I 've never dared to talk to my father or mother about it , " said one of the stakeholders on behalf of the other , " I was very embarrassing . "	-16.5206
The real problem with the enlightenment of sexual abuse was , and still is , that most victims remain silent .	-10.8472
If they do not even entrust parents and siblings , then certainly not a choir leader who would have been a professional member of the perpetrators .	-4.4682
How do the Domspatzen-Schüler assess the role played in cases of abuse ?	-5.4150
Michael Hesemann : A survey student put it like this : " Regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he ( Georg Ratzinger ) would have had timely insights and could have stopped the perpetrator .	-4.3396
I think it is also quite absurd to assume that it has opened up a lot of dollars more forcefully or clearer than to their parents , boarding managers , trust teachers , etc .	-7.8595
That he is talking about sex ... - unthinkable . '	-2.3134
Thus , the report comes to the very clear conclusion : ' the entry of pupils and / or their environment in advance could not be confirmed within the scope of the investigation ' .	-5.9456
So , as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg Ratzinger must be free from any participation .	-3.5894
Thus , he cannot be accused of not preventing or displaying him .	-4.0885
There is therefore no reason to link his good name to these reprehensible crimes , as unfortunately happened in some cases .	-4.0857
The media read a lot of " violent texts " at the Regensburg cathedrals .	-4.5932
The former Cathedral Master Georg Ratzinger is accused in the report ' Wegsigen ' .	-5.0201
Does he have to live with this accusation ?	-1.8838
Michael Hesemann : This is the big problem that everything has been mixed in the reporting and confused into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence processes and somewhere in the middle of Georg Ratzinger .	-5.2410
Yet that , in turn , is an abuse of the report .	-2.9197
There is a clean separation between the pre-school and the Gymnasium of the Cathedral , between sexual abuse and violence processes and , let us say , other accusations .	-5.3266
The report also deals with incidents from the time since 1945 , also from four decades when Georg Ratzinger was not the head of the cathedral .	-4.7468
All the terrible teaching , the cases in which bones of Sadistic teachers were regularly harassed and painted and suffered appallingly , all took place at the preschool school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen , where really scandalous conditions had to prevail .	-7.0698
But the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with them , because he got the boys to face when they were already on the Cathedral gymnasium .	-5.0347
On this , as most witnesses emphasize , the topic " pre-school " was taboo .	-3.6826
One was only happy to escape her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even " paradise " conditions .	-3.3176
What was different on the Cathedral gymnasium ?	-2.3493
Michael Hesemann : There was discipline , but no sadistic violence .	-3.0857
This also applies to Georg Ratzinger , where the report concludes that ' many victims estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore , in many cases , despite violence , even positive memories of him ' .	-5.2844
At most , that remains the accusation of having looked away .	-4.0005
Despite all the efforts , however , the report has defined only two periods in which it has been reported by the pre-school conditions .	-4.8033
The first time in 1970 / 71 , when he just started to establish himself and heard nothing of what happened at a school where he was not working and responsible ( the witness ) , and then again around 1993 .	-6.6415
Georg Ratzinger closes the ears consistently before the conditions ?	-3.0600
Michael Hesemann : No , since since 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Cathedral Gymnasium , which the report even reproduced .	-2.9651
In this report , he points out that ' the penalty of caning continues to be applied in the sch' .	-6.5231
In view of the danger of negative press releases , it recommended urgent intervention .	-3.9498
This was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed when caning penalties in Bavaria were long banned .	-4.0983
Before that they were in a legal grey area , as everyone knows .	-2.9411
It was also difficult for him to assess where the persons concerned had perhaps been exaggerated or dramatised and where the limit was really exceeded .	-5.9913
Nor can one say that he has always looked away .	-3.2126
That is simply not true .	-1.1757
It was only in 1980 that the caning penalty at schools was officially abolished in Bavaria too .	-3.1293
Prince Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today ’ s pedagogical standards to that time .	-3.7474
How do you see that ?	-1.3386
Michael Hesemann : We historians are talking about the " trap of anachronism " , i.e. the danger of assessing past by today 's moral standards .	-3.9393
The Prince is right about that .	-2.7574
This does not , of course , apply to sexual abuse , which was abhorrent at all times , nor to what was broken in the preschool school of repression and violence at innocent children 's souls , which goes far beyond the usual .	-7.2457
That is all very terrible and I am glad it is finally being worked out .	-3.5180
At the same time , however , I must protect Georg Ratzinger , because all this had nothing to do with him .	-3.4342
His means of disciplining and punishing , i.e. ear figs , and hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .	-4.7703
When physical punishment was then prohibited , it was strictly adhered to it .	-3.1709
What image of his rainburger time has Georg Ratzinger reproduced in talks with you for the book " My brother of the Pope " ?	-3.8848
Is the subject of caning also raised ?	-3.4425
Michael Hesemann : Well , the book is about the life of his brother Joseph , i.e. Pope Benedict ’ s XVI , tells from his perspective , since the cathedral plays only a side role .	-4.5820
Nevertheless , I do not conceal that he had a strict regime there .	-3.8879
But that , too , must be said : without this perfectionism , without the appeal of imperative discipline , it would have been hard to make it possible , from the so far more nationally known Regensburg cathedrals , to form an institution of world class , true European cultural messenger and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the United States ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .	-8.3468
With biscuits and bonbons alone , you won ’ t be a big singer and a success , no matter what area , but always discipline , passion and self-overcoming .	-6.4907
As what kind of person did you experience Georg Ratzinger during the talks on her book ?	-3.8618
Michael Hesemann : Through the work on the book and beyond , I met Georg Ratzinger very well and again experienced Georg Ratzinger as wonderful , humorous , deeply believable and heartfelt people , who cannot be imagined that he could only suffer a fly .	-7.3024
I regularly get to know how many former domes still live today , 23 years after his emotion , regularly contact him , visit him , read him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family .	-5.6339
Those who have not yet forgiven him that he was tough to them are clearly in the minority .	-5.1204
Most of the cathedrals today are grateful to him for enriching their lives and for bringing the world of music to them .	-5.1358
And that he was always a good fatherly teacher - a tough father , certainly that may be - but also a loving spectator to whom they are still looking at today and whom they are worshipping .	-7.9241
I would like to make it quite clear once again that everything accused him is education methods that were on the agenda at the time .	-5.4422
We can be glad that we have long overcome this time .	-2.4580
But it is highly unfair to turn a man just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to the media scapegoat .	-2.9123
That is all too obvious the evil intention behind it .	-8.1846
The report that has just been published relieves it .	-2.2155
Now it would be a decency to let a 93-year-old man who has earned a great deal of merit without knowing those outside Bavaria , and maybe even Germany ’ s , the Regensburg Cathedral , finally be in peace .	-8.5839
