Munich 1856 : Four maps that change your view of the city	-2.8759
An Irren institution where young people today should meet .	-3.9212
A floating chapel where now you can dig for the S-Bahn tunnel .	-3.6883
Small farmers are managing the former cause of farmers .	-4.7842
The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories to days .	-1.7732
It is annoyed if maps are not current .	-7.5054
Everyone knows this because the car navigation showed a green meadow instead of a bypass .	-4.7216
The historical maps of the Digital Bavarian Atlas , an offer made by the Geoportal Bavaria of the State Government , are anything but up-to-date - but that is precisely why they are very revealing .	-6.4495
Especially when compared to current online cards .	-2.4857
Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the distribution area of Munich ’ s Merkur since the 19th century .	-3.5597
The Bavarian digital atlas is a patch carpet that is not immediately recognized as such .	-3.9688
In the large overview map more detailed maps for cities and municipalities were added .	-5.4916
According to the Bayerische Versicherungsverfahrung ( Bavarian Versicherungsverhätung ) , these were formed between 1810 and 1864 and resulted in the first survey of Bavaria .	-8.6958
Your client : Napoleon .	-0.8748
The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .	-2.6331
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographical recording of Bavaria for military purposes , of course .	-3.5791
Although the French troops finally withdrew from Lunéville 's peace on February 9 , 1801 , it was today 's neighbors who created the idea of a comprehensive Bavarian map .	-4.5433
Kurfürst Max IV Joseph continued to push the project forward , founded the " Topographic Bureau " - and thus the Bayerische VersicherungManagement .	-11.0968
The original position sheet for Munich dates from 1856 and is available on the website of the Bavarian State Library .	-4.4797
The comparison of the former / Today is the most impressive of the capital of the country .	-6.2004
The city has expanded in every direction and has grown together .	-2.8310
An example of this is Untersendling , which still appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856 .	-2.9836
Sendling was considered a Munich district 21 years after drawing up the map , i.e. 1877 .	-4.2746
Today there is an underground station in the heart of the city .	-3.8636
The houses of Untersendlings concentrate around 1856 along the current Plingansstra<unk>e , which was named only in 1878 after Georg Sebastian Plinganser , a leader of the Bavarian peasant against Austria in 1705 .	-4.1157
Where the Western Park is today , there is nothing but a field - at first glance : a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears : hand-written numbered blocks from the so-called " original take-up " from which the property tax was derived .	-7.3644
Small plots no longer show farmers - but micro-growers of the ' land in sun ' facility .	-5.1660
A large green area stands north of Untersendling .	-3.1211
The Theresienwiese , since 1810 the Oktoberfest , was in fact a meadow in the 19th century - not a concrete desert .	-3.9575
On the other side of the Isar , the historic map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine .	-2.6413
In the Urpositionsblatt area of today 's Au-Haidhausen you can read not only the street name " at the Gasteig " or the hill " at the Lüfen " - but also in large letters " Irren Anstalt " .	-7.0567
Yes , here at Auerfeldstra<unk>e people were once locked in with insanity .	-4.8327
In 1858 / 59 the Munich Kreis-Irrenalt " Auer Lüfen " was founded there .	-5.1124
In 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the establishment - the psychiatrist who was taken in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .	-3.9874
" He was progressively for his time and ended , for example , the chaining of the so-called errors .	-4.6344
He also prohibited the staff from using violence against the occupants , " says Hermann Wilhelm , Head of the Haidhausen Museum , who worked for an exhibition with the Institute .	-4.7268
There was room first for 280 patients , later it was extended to 500 places .	-4.4900
At some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the circle in Haar 1905 .	-4.3616
Since 2006 , the Isar-Amper-Clinikum München-Ost , one of the largest psychiatrics in Germany , has been located there .	-4.0038
The area of the former Auer Institute now hosts young people in Munich Salesianum .	-4.6298
The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth hostel with training establishments .	-3.2383
West lies the football pitch of TSV München Ost , east residential houses of the 1980s .	-4.3173
In 2015 , the “ Casa Don Bosco ” children ’ s house was built in architectural reference to the origins of the Irrenalstätte , which had been destroyed in bombing during World War II .	-5.9451
The Marienplatz was recorded as " Main Platz " at 1856 , the first street known as " Kaufinger Gasse " .	-5.3340
The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .	-3.1156
The Allied bombs in December 1944 ripped a lot of holes into the city centre .	-3.9272
One big remained to this day - at Marienhof .	-3.2986
The English Institute , small shops , and a Middle-Age chalet once stood at Marienhof , where the preliminary works and the second S-Bahn straight-track were carried out on April 5 , 2017 .	-7.9682
With the slider you can compare the old Munich map with today 's aerial image - and fill up the hole at the Marienhof .	-4.2532
Citizens ' Rights Group publishes travel warning for Missouri	-2.2527
The National Association for the Promotion of Colors has issued a warning for colourful people travelling to Missouri on the basis of discriminatory policies and racist attacks by the state .	-4.7227
" The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri , which is due to enter into force by 28 August 2017 , calls on Afro-American travellers , visitors and Missourians to pay particular attention and caution when traveling through the state , as a number of questionable , race-based incidents have recently occurred and are recorded throughout the state , " says the Group 's opinion .	-6.9803
A recent law of Missouri , which makes it more difficult for people to take action against discrimination , as well as the law enforcement authorities of the state which are disproportionately targeting minorities , prompted the group to issue the travel warning , NAACP said .	-4.6527
" They have violations of citizens ' rights that happen to people .	-3.0975
They are stopped for their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , " said the President of Missouri NAACP , Rod Chapel , Kansas City Star .	-2.9550
'We hear complaints of this kind that we have not heard . '	-2.9184
It is the first such warning that the organization issued for a state in the US .	-2.2472
The group cited incidents such as racist offences against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders , 28 , a black Tennessee man .	-2.7683
Sanders died in questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no petrol during his journey through the state and was detained by the police of Missouri without being accused of crime .	-4.9742
The Council also draws attention to a recent report by the Missouri Office of Public Prosecutor , which shows that black drivers in the state are 75 % more often than white .	-4.6074
" The recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri , " said Chapel .	-2.8801
" People must be ready , whether they bring cash or let their relatives know that they travel through the state . "	-5.0351
In 2015 , Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes , according to the latest figures from the FBI ’ s Hasscrime report program , classifying the state in terms of the number of such injuries to the 16th rank of the country .	-4.6411
Travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company for discrimination in housing or employment .	-2.9785
Previously , the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states had passed immigration laws obliging local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for violations of immigration , which , in the opinion of the ACLU , will contribute to further racial profiling .	-4.5560
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to other countries , but recently stakeholders have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US .	-3.3260
The wheat project is elementary	-9.5952
The Fischerbacher Weidezaun project is a success project and will continue next year .	-1.6815
The CDU members Peter Wei<unk> and Kordula Kovac got a picture on the ground .	-3.6007
At the Schwendemann family ’ s right-wing court , representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU local association met with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members .	-5.8397
Markus Schwendemann first gave insights into his company , in which he managed 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , supplied 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and accommodates five residents .	-4.9944
For him , the " black wood milk " is the alternative marketing route for the milk of his cows , according to Schwendemann .	-4.3290
On the table of guests there are only regional dishes .	-4.4725
Since he is also the BLHV chairman of Fischerbach , he called the pasture project " elementary important " .	-3.9168
I cannot make a profit on such steep land .	-2.4554
The green land area provides a lot of work and a great deal needs to be done with the motor senses .	-5.8394
" We are here to fight with the conditions and with the topography " , Swendemann stressed .	-4.7260
In 2003 , he took over the parent company and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if he does not run a biometer .	-4.9366
For Mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear that " The municipality has recognized the importance of the pasture project and is happy about the leadership promotion " .	-4.9453
At the expense of EUR 3000 to EUR 4000 per hectare , farmers would have to be supported .	-3.1377
It is hoped that the reforestation of the surfaces will be extended for a long time .	-4.8229
" The greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how to continue their business , " stressed by the mayor .	-4.5160
Farmers are often criticised for supporting them .	-2.2983
In 2013 , a total of 25 plots were fenced by eleven participants through the promotion of willow fencing . were .	-5.3627
The openness area is therefore 40 hectares , which cannot be expanded by at least 2023 .	-4.2870
Of the total cost of EUR 71 500 , half was funded by Leader , one quarter was borne by the municipality of Fischerbach .	-4.0843
So farmers have left EUR 12 610 , which they have had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of pasture .	-3.6322
" The big advantage is the longevity of fences , " said Schwendemann .	-2.8420
Kordula Kovac stressed : " You are doing a good job without farmers and rural women it is not possible " .	-4.3017
Peter Wei<unk> also said : ' The best food is produced here ' .	-4.9071
The Landscape Care Directive ( LPR ) Baden-Württemberg enables state funding of wheat fences .	-3.2190
The aim is to keep the Black Forest open .	-1.9266
This requires the presence of a backbone , known as the LPR .	-6.2229
In addition , the area to be fenced must not be slow-management ( catchment over 35 % ) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation .	-5.1272
For the Fischerbacher Weidezaunprojekt 2018 , eight participants with 24 plots are currently working on the proposal to build just under 16 kilometres of fence .	-5.3206
The openness area is 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than EUR 112 000 .	-4.1215
Is nothing more sacred ?	-1.4303
Now the Trump White House is on the Statue of Liberty	-2.7623
The safest sign of regime change is when they start attacking the statues .	-1.8910
Americans like any other – hence the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein at Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003 .	-3.1737
Stephen Miller , one of the Trump regime ’ s key ideologues , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN about the president ’ s proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty .	-3.3398
To remain fair , Miller did not attack the statue itself .	-1.8610
A horde of boat owners and liberty imitators would have lynched him if he had done so .	-3.1652
But he attacked their importance , and in particular the importance that was attributed to her when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus was added in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , to his base .	-3.8864
When Miller Acosta claimed : " I do not want to go into a whole thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that the world enlightens .	-4.4908
The poem to which you refer , which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . '	-2.7636
Miller is quite right , but , as he himself said , it is not really about history .	-3.3588
It is about the contemporary resonance of the uprising words of Lazarus , the only country in which a state invites not only any old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : ' Your mothers , your poor , / your afflicted masses , who seek to breathe freely / the wretched waste of your rich coasts ' .	-6.0339
There was never a time when the ' miserable waste ' was better visible on our screens .	-2.8063
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people were not welcome in Trump ’ s US .	-2.6342
This conflict over the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural dispute : it is indeed a conflict over the importance of America .	-3.6368
Lazarus - and their friends who worked to place their words on the ground after their death - knew very well that they were doing a highly political act .	-4.2268
The sculpture was supposed to show the links between French and American Republicanism by representing , in a depressed classical picture , the female embodiment of freedom .	-4.3573
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she received one voice .	-2.5277
And she gives herself a very different name : mother of the exiles .	-2.8062
The poem ’ s combination with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism .	-2.3445
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , people from the right wing wanted to change it long ago .	-3.6567
The great shreihal Rush Limbaugh , a kind of Johannes of the buyer for the coming of Trump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is not inviting anyone , but rather an early neo-conservative , bringing the American flame into the surrounding world : " Lady Liberty is moving forward .	-5.1012
It is intended to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .	-2.8142
The torch is not intended to clarify the way to the United States . '	-3.6963
Though quite unusual , Limbaugh has found something here .	-5.9160
The importance of the statue is in fact a question of the point of view of perception .	-3.6385
The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as seen by exhausted , miserable but hopeful people after long and often terrible trips on the decks of ships .	-3.5996
It is , in the truest sense , about seeing the world from the perspective of people , seeking refuge , and an opportunity to improve their lives .	-4.2834
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they must hear .	-2.4465
And that , of course , is not the prospect that Miller and Trump ever want to recognize .	-3.3033
Their torch is not intended to illuminate the path , but to inflame hatred , which is its only source of power .	-4.4821
World Cup 2017 : Neil Black Look Scottish Team of the UK	-3.9079
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots were part of the British team .	-2.8770
The performance director of the UK athletics , Neil Black , says that the 16-headed Scottish quota in the world championship squad will ' make a massive contribution to the team ' .	-3.9431
A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which was launched on Friday .	-2.4915
Black believes that ' something special is being developed in Scotland ' and the UK ' s athletics have to learn something from it .	-4.4765
" We welcome it , and we try to understand it , and we will continue it until we find out , " said Black .	-2.4639
" I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think that it has something to do with what they have done .	-2.5297
The Scottish athletes think that it is something to do with what they have done .	-2.1054
British athletics : It has something to do with what they have done .	-2.7251
And also with the type on the street corner .	-1.8901
Whatever the combination of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant ' .	-1.5566
Several of Scottish athletes are medal contenders , including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track , while Eilidh Doyle was elected a team captain .	-4.0214
" Eilidh is pretty modest .	-2.4825
Your speech on captains was incredible , " says Black .	-2.3845
" A number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and very motivated .	-3.7120
The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh naturally brought was great ' .	-4.1107
The Commonwealth Silver Medal winner , who will compete at the 400-m hurdles in their fifth World Championships , says that it is " incredible " that 16 Scots are in the British team .	-5.1987
Scotland ’ s best total of athletes at the World Cup has been seven achieved in 1983 and 2015 .	-2.3944
Muir , a middle-class runner , is leading the way and last year set out five British and two European records .	-5.2562
It will participate in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs .	-2.9808
Chris O 'Hare , 1,500 m running , is another Scot to watch after a great season involving the victory at British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games .	-4.3285
Doyle remembers her first World Cup when the only other Scot was in Team Lee McConnell .	-2.7598
The team captain says that she is " enormously proud " of the fact that many of her compatriots will not only be part of the team , but will , in some cases , also participate in the medals and the finals .	-5.7981
" The special thing about being a team captain is that she was elected by the other members of the team , so it was anyway a great honour , but to know that my team members voted for me and elected me makes it a very special for me " , she added .	-5.2019
" Obviously I am very proud of all the Scots who are part of the team .	-2.6401
It only shows how far we have come .	-1.4449
And they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to rise to podiums .	-4.2294
As regards my speech as a captain ?	-2.1051
Yes , I think she went well .	-1.4382
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation because we have a World Cup .	-3.1446
So it is really important to rely on this support for homes and to benefit from being in the Olympic Stadium again .	-4.0447
I get a second chance to go out there and compete , and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there ' .	-4.6067
Block critics over Facebook : Don ’ t worry about a public office if you cannot afford to hedge voters .	-4.7828
The father of our country knew something of bad press .	-1.8185
Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long for newspapers to beat him for everything , from domestic politics to political principles .	-2.3557
He was clashing safely with criticism .	-4.8880
But he has not silenced his critics .	-1.0033
In 1783 , Washington said : ' Freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and mute , we are being slaughtered like sheep ' .	-3.7136
That brings me to Maryland as Governor Larry Hogan , who must work to be more like Washington .	-2.6815
Hogan ’ s staff have blocked and deleted contributions from at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on its official Facebook page .	-3.4000
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him earlier this week .	-1.6135
The staff of the governor dismissed the complaint as frivol , and the online commentary was full of a backlash with " Na , and ? " .	-3.1362
" It 's just Facebook , " said many people .	-1.5423
But it is important .	-0.5762
And it is especially important when it is a type like Hogan .	-2.1493
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state that is astonishingly popular .	-2.1071
He has the second highest approval of the nation 's 50 governors .	-2.5688
Hogan is not a reactionary heat head .	-0.8972
He has shown a firm hand in leading his state and strict adherence to the principles .	-2.9439
He was also very skilful in using Facebook as a primary means of connecting with his constituents and playing his hairless head for chemotherapy on his side .	-3.8309
Therefore , blocking people who come to the side of the governor - which is a public forum called official and paid by employees with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .	-4.3361
In an interview with The Washington Post , Hogan ’ s spokesperson , Amelia Chasse , defended the governor ’ s actions , arguing that blocking comments is nothing more than modernization .	-2.6632
But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people who swing the stick online .	-3.5139
The post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan .	-1.4664
These are just real people who speak to their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur and a priest , not a troll .	-3.8752
They all said that their comments were respectful , reflective , and not profane .	-2.4646
The parish quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan ’ s Catholic faith .	-3.0143
Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie , Md . , was not hateful , but she asked about hate crimes .	-2.0859
" I commented politely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news , " she wrote in the commentary area of the message " The Post " .	-3.1113
" I do not appreciate this idea , either , if a number of people take a stand on the same subject , some people disregard it as a so-called collective effort and do not recognise it as a large group of citizens affected . "	-6.0002
What the governor ’ s staff called a “ concentrated spam attack , ” others would probably call “ advocacy . ”	-4.4942
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment .	-1.7688
It is much cleaner than in previous times if we had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorial articles or to arrest and silence demonstrators .	-4.1668
But that is precisely what is happening in digital terms .	-2.4684
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticised for challenging Facebook and other social media .	-2.3645
President Trump is sued by Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed .	-1.4129
One of the first milestones on this issue fell in Virginia last week .	-1.5381
The President of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County violated the First Amendment , according to US District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria , when she banned a voter from her facebook site .	-5.5719
And in Kentucky , governor Matt Bevin ( R ) also received a visit from ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter .	-2.2828
This should not be so difficult .	-1.5750
At the time of Washington , the affordable porto had a similar effect to the Internet .	-3.2836
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800 , and anonymous letters suggested his leadership .	-9.9190
And even then , Washington had anonymous trolls .	-0.7390
The people who used pseudonyms like " Juricola " , " Valerius " , " Belisarius " and " Portius " wrote all letters to newspapers that settled Washington 's decisions .	-2.7764
Petitions that criticised his position on the Amity Treaty , trade , and shipping with Britain overwhelmed his office , according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project .	-6.0344
But he did not silence them .	-1.1739
Freedom of speech , disagreement and discourse form the basis of our nation .	-1.7118
And true leadership means accepting that .	-1.5556
Ronan Raffty Hopes for Household Comfort at the Renaissance Club	-3.1279
The former European No. 1 Ronan Raffty will hope for domestic comfort over the next three days , as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian will host the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .	-4.1562

Gary Orr , who came to the European Senior Tour this year after his 50th birthday , returns to the action on the home floor .	-4.1992
This event will be its first Scottish appearance since Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .	-1.3567
" It always means a bit more when you play at home , " said Orr , the man from Helensburgh .	-2.0891
" You want to do well , but you also feel this additional pressure .	-2.6867
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .	-1.8644
I am glad about the way this has gone . '	-3.6129
The trio in the field is the former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and the Senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst , Roger Chapman , Mark James and Mark McNulty .	-3.3114

Less Lung Cancer by Passive Smoking	-2.4053
In the last two decades , fewer and fewer people have died because of passive smoking in lung cancer .	-1.9514
This is the result of a study conducted by scientists at the University Hospital in Hamburg-Eppendorf ( UKE ) .	-4.4435
" According to our estimates , 167 lung cancer deaths are attributable to passive smoking per year , " tutor Heiko Becher said .	-4.4143
In comparison , he drew up his own study on the subject of 1994 .	-4.1081
At that time , there were 400 lung cancer deaths per year due to passive smoking .	-2.7586
The new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health .	-2.1723
Household connections prove very complex .	-2.3759
The construction works on the Villinger Stra<unk>e are in full swing and " are somewhat in time " , says the head of the building house Fred Heinze .	-5.3364
In the area of domestic connections , the situation is more complicated than expected , since there is much hidden underground which is not included in the plans .	-5.3801
The traffic , which is always hampering construction , is a major problem for the Stumpp construction team .	-5.5557
" The ignorance of drivers in front of red traffic lights and shutters is already enormous , " says Heinze .	-4.4967
The road should be closed and only bus lines are allowed to pass through .	-4.9879

In their wooden house in Enarotali , the capital of the Paniai Regency in the troubled Indonesian province of Papua , the housewife usually puts a sweet potato - locally called " nota " - directly into the fireplace .	-4.4279
After half an hour , the cooled knees are taken and swallowed with diligent , unwashed hands .	-5.0412

It is a rare insight into daily life in the Papua Highlands , a former Dutch colony that was inaugurated in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,026 elders had to vote in front of the occupying forces by a public rally .	-5.4207
An existing movement that stirred up independence against Dutch rule quickly turned against the Jakarta government , which maintains control of the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers .	-4.3941
In 2003 the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua , with the independent part Papua New Guinea encompassing the eastern part of the island .	-3.0379

Papua is Indonesia ’ s poorest province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and some of the worst rates of child mortality and literacy in Asia .	-2.6142
But it is also Indonesia ’ s Goldland .	-1.5901
The largest and most profitable Goldmine in the world , Grasberg , owned by Freeport McMoran from Phoenix , is located just 60 miles from Paniai , a high land province in the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants .	-3.6903
In 2015 alone , Freeport , worth $ 3.1 billion , cut gold and copper .	-2.4608
Moreover , Papua has an estimated $ 78 billion of wood resources .	-2.2892
But these wealth is a source of misery for the Papua , ensuring that Indonesia ’ s powerful military retains a suffocating presence .	-3.1830
A 2005 study in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid nearly $ 20 million to local military and units between 1998 and 2004 , including up to $ 150,000 to a single officer .	-2.9648
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden gains and are treated mercilessly .	-2.9226
According to activists , more than 500,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been raped , tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969 .	-1.9151

" The migrants have begun to sell chickens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua , " explains Abeth You , a 24-year-old Paniai indigenous who went to the provincial capital of Jayapura .	-6.2143
" It has cost the indigenous Papua - the mamama mama [ women ] of Papua - their market . "	-7.2781
Indonesian President Joko Widodo , known as Jokowi in the popular mouth , promised to address inequalities and infringements in Papua during his 2014 campaign .	-3.6317
The former carpenter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua - including Paniai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jakarta .	-2.6172
But little has changed in Papua , and today the locals feel cheated .	-1.7905
" Our hearts have broken because we voted in favour of Jokowi in 2014 , expecting him to live up to our hopes that justice will be restored , " said You .	-3.6239
Indeed , just two months after Jokowi ’ s inauguration in October , Paniai suffered a low point .	-2.8521
On December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children was out and sang Christmas songs in front of a campfire in Enarotali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorbike .	-5.1492
The shocked children told them they should turn on their headlights .	-2.8208
One of the soldiers was kicking at their sound and later came back with four soldiers , so the local pastor Yavedt Tebai .	-5.3487
The soldiers who had drunk chased and beat the group with their guns , said victims and witnesses .	-2.3688
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .	-1.4561
A child 16-year-old Yulianus Yeiko was so hard beaten that he fell into coma .	-4.0121
A few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set fire and things escalated the next day .	-2.1328
About 1,000 young Papua men , women and children gathered in a football field in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice .	-3.7395
They wore ceremonial hunting arches and presented the Waita dance - continuously in the circle and imitating a bird singing - by Papuas Mee Pago-Stamm . . . with . with . . . with .	-6.7603
Some demonstrators started to wipe stones on police and military posts .	-3.1596
When the mood was heated , a command was sent to the soldiers via an internal radio : " When the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , " said in an official document by TIME , which was not released to the local media .	-4.7167
Yeremias Kayame , 56 , the head of the Kego Koto Quarter of Enarotali , saw the imminent danger and called for peace and for the crowd to return home .	-4.4027
No one was listening to the mood .	-1.1819
" When I turned around , I was suddenly shot into my left wrist , " he said TIME on the veranda of his colorful wooden house .	-3.3276
Kayame still doesn 't know who led , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here .	-3.6239
" It was overcrowded , many shots were fired , " he adds .	-2.2316
The local man Alfius Youw was struck three times , according to his cousin , who witnessed the shooting .	-3.4906
" I ran to him and studied his body to make sure he was , " said Yohanes , who like many Indonesians bears only one name , the TIME in dark mood .	-3.8223
" I saw that he was dead ... I knew him " .	-2.6563
The Papua police chief inspector , Yotje Mende , told reporters that his officers wanted to only " secure " their station because they were attacked .	-3.5198
'We must defend ourselves when people are threatened to kill us , ' said the Papua police spokesman , Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo , in 2015 .	-2.9195
'It is about life and death ' .	-1.6712
According to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstrators were killed and many more injured .	-2.0421
The news about the killings came only the following day ' filtered ' to Jakarta .	-2.4339
Three weeks in Jayapura , Jokowi made a passionate speech expressing sympathy for the victims ' families and swore to address the historical grievances in Papua .	-3.8879
" I want this case to be resolved immediately , so that it will not happen in the future , " he said .	-2.6766
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he set up an extrajudicial mechanism to settle historical human rights violations .	-2.9478
But the excuses began almost immediately .	-1.0453
" Most of the injuries have occurred a long time ago .	-2.0780
Some were in the 1990s and early 2000 's .	-1.6876
The point is that we have committed ourselves to tackling these violations , but there are processes that must be undertaken , " he said .	-3.6249
Then Wiranto withdrew when he spoke to TIME in Jakarta on 5 June and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua .	-3.0591
Instead , " everything is regulated by law , " he said .	-2.3551
Wiranto , accused by the UN of ' crimes against humanity ' , who claimed more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor 's bloody 1999 vote , said that 11 cases of human rights violations have already been settled in Papua , including the Paniai incident .	-3.7173
Families of the Paniai victims received such claims with grim disbelief .	-2.8995
" I have been interviewed four times over the last three years , but there has been no progress , " says Yohanes .	-2.4084
'I am tired . '	-0.8985
He says that he still lives in fear years later .	-1.8711
" I am afraid , " he says .	-1.1102
'I am afraid of being arrested by the military , I fear being shot . '	-8.1360
His brother Yacobus repeated the view that the people of Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident .	-2.3720
He says that he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims .	-1.8558
" After burying the bodies , the military sought me , " he says .	-2.0896
The shootings have not stopped .	-1.9860
On Tuesday , the Indonesian police shot villagers in Paniai ’ s neighborhood Deiyai .	-2.8113
During a confrontation between villagers and a construction company ’ s manager , who refused to bring a conscious man to hospital , one person died and 17 others were injured , including children .	-3.4564
The man who was 24-year-old Ravianus Douw , who drowned when he fished in a nearby river , died on his way to the hospital .	-3.3940
Successful villagers protested at the site office of the company .	-3.7115
The police said that the villagers threw stones on officers responding by firing warning shots .	-3.3636
But locals say that the mobile brigade ( Indonesian paramilitary police ) began to shoot on the crowd and killed one .	-2.1730
" We were so panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , " says the 29-year-old Dominggu Badii , who lives near the hospital and witnessed the injured here quickly , according to the TIME .	-4.6546
'I hid in my house two days ' .	-2.7762
The Deiyai parliament has called for the officers to be held accountable and for the police to withdraw the mobile brigade from the area .	-4.0641
Paniai was always an unrest for the Indonesian government .	-2.5025
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the discontent of the tribal members Mee , Moni , Dani and Damal living in the green Papua highlands .	-2.5912
Many joined the Free Papua Movement ( OPM ) , the rebel army that claims to defend the Papua ’ s rights by initiating sporadic attacks and kidnapping of Indonesian soldiers .	-3.3659
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai , including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya .	-1.4410
In response to this , thousands of people have been arrested and arbitrarily detained in Paniai in recent years , on the pretext of ' safeguarding national sovereignty ' .	-2.6607
Some never appear again .	-2.1205
Among the people of Papua , Paniai is known as " a tragic forgotten place " .	-1.7234
Poverty strengthens discontent .	-1.1595
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals .	-1.9056
Bread is just as beyond reach .	-3.3740
The people here are building everything they eat : nota , fruit and vegetables .	-4.5914
Agriculture is the job of women , each of whom four or five fields of sweet potato can work .	-4.3171
They retain most of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market .	-1.8969
Ten Nota pieces cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees ( 75 cents ) .	-1.5244
Over time , economic inequalities have grown between the indigenous Papua and the new migrants , who have increased since the opening of new routes to Nabire Airport .	-3.7405
The few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the more educated and prosperous migrants .	-2.6663
Papua seldom has the capital or the necessary skills to keep their own businesses competitive .	-3.8751
" Young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money here , " says John Gobai , Chairman of the Paniai tribal council .	-3.8456
Isolation holds the eyes of the world far from Papua .	-1.7869
Moreover , restrictions on reporting international media remain tense .	-1.4610
Earlier this year , French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua for lack of coordination with related institutions , even though they were given rare permission to film .	-3.2041
According to Phelim Kine , Deputy Asia 's Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch , Jokowis ’ s campaign to lift reporting restrictions to promote transparency and development was not realized .	-4.4055
" There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia 's most troubled eastern provinces of Papua and Western Papua : visa refusal and a black list , " he said in a statement .	-3.4540
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely confined to the immediate neighbours of Papua .	-3.1753
In March , six Pacific states - Tonga , Nauru , Palau , Tuvalu , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the ' various and widespread violations ' in Papua , including the Paniai shooting .	-3.4320
The same countries have historically supported OPM .	-1.1552
The speaker from the Indonesian Foreign Ministry Arrmanatha Nasir reiterated the accusations of the group and said journalists in Jakarta : ' In Indonesia there is still a democratic system and there is free media so that it is difficult to conceal the evidence of human rights cases ' .	-5.0411
The local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .	-1.5470
When an official delegation from the Netherlands visited Jayapura on 4 May , under the leadership of the human rights servant Kees Van Baar , locals broke their silence and pressured him " We want freedom " , according to a source that also participated in the meeting but wants to remain anonymous .	-5.0814
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua say that they will probably not vote for Jokowi again .	-2.5872
" Jokowi is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Paniai shots , " says Gobai , the chairman of the tribal council .	-4.3287
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people , apart from being living under the constant threat of a predatory military , are in poor education and health services .	-2.8501
Gobai says that the Paniai people , like other Papua , consider their voice to Jokowi as a " debt " he must pay back .	-3.6594
" They don 't need money , they just want justice , " he says .	-2.3895
Despite threats and intimidation , Paniai firefighters ’ families carried out a last symbolic act of comfort : the body of a victim was buried on a single site just opposite the police and the military station .	-4.9829
They know that they may never be given justice , but at least let those responsible not forget their crimes .	-3.4374
" A member of our family was killed , " says Yacobus , with a lowered head .	-3.0241
'What else can we do ? '	-0.8990
Fires capture Dubai ’ s Torch Closer for the second time	-7.5024
A fire took place on Friday in one of the highest residential towers in the world in Dubai and forced hundreds of inhabitants to flee from the 337 meter high 79-floor building .	-4.3729
It is the second fire that feeds through the high house in just two years , which is accidentally called the torch tower .	-4.9366
The building was evacuated , injuries were not reported and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .	-2.6121
" We slept and we stood up with the fire alarm and the cries of the people .	-3.1869
We ran down the staircase and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor " , told a resident who called his name as George Reuters .	-4.0579
Dubai 's civil protection authorities said that the fire fighting units at 4.00 p.m. local time ( 00am GMT ) deleted the fire and cooled the building .	-4.1570
The government said it was working to provide accommodation for those affected .	-3.1518
The incident may revive questions about the safety of materials used in outside areas of high-rise buildings around the world .	-3.7895
An inquiry by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage came from the panelling , the external panel for decoration or isolation .	-5.7979
In Britain , the police said that the plates ’ system of isolation and panelling could have contributed in June to the rapid spread of a fire in which around 80 people died .	-5.0224
No Davis Cup Reform : Further Best of Five	-2.1266
The President of the International Tennis Association ( ITF ) disappeared at the General Assembly with his large Davis Cup coup .	-3.8208
At the meeting in Ho-Chi-Minh City , the revolutionary proposal for this sport to play Davis Cup single on only two winning rates was haunted by the required two-thirds majority .	-5.1561
The classics , which are often very long , but also highly valued , are thus preserved in the traditional bid .	-7.9886
63.54 % of member countries voted in favour of the reform , so ITF President David Haggerty ’ s goal was scarcely missed .	-4.2009
" We respect this decision , but we are disappointed that our membership did not adopt the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup .	-3.0419
We need a change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historical competitions , " said Haggerty .	-2.5165
We will continue to work on improving the candidates .	-2.5495
After many objections , the proposal to hold the finals in a neutral place had not just been put to the vote .	-5.8085
New from 2018 are only comparatively minor details : In future , the finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have host law in the following year in the first round .	-4.3864
In order to reduce costs for the organizers , the training seats requirements will be made easier and players will have to complete less official media events before the Davis Cup .	-6.1875
More than 1 out of 5 US travellers bring forbidden items into the aircraft , finds a survey .	-3.3440
A survey among airline passengers revealed that more than 20 percent of items deliberately or unconsciously forbidden were smuggling past the US Transportation Security Administration ’ s checkpoints , including at least 6 % that entered the plane , while accidentally carrying banned knives or other items with blades .	-5.9608
Less than 1 % claimed that they were delayed to find that they had mistakenly travelled with firearms , ammunition , or explosives .	-4.3148
The survey for more than 1,000 people - carried out by a jet charter service , Stratos Jet Charters Inc . - also found that younger travellers tend to disregard the rules .	-4.2627
Of the respondents who admitted that they knowingly tried to fly with something banned by the TSA , 19.7 % of the millennials were members of Generation X , compared to less than 15 % .	-4.8766
The most common items deliberately passed to TSA agents were food and liquids .	-2.2779
More than 3 % said that they knowingly carried objects with blades through security control , while 2.2 % of the female respondents and 3.7 % of male respondents also confirmed that they had deliberately brought banned drugs into the plane .	-5.3979
The company said that it interviewed travellers throughout the country to find out how many accidentally smuggled goods had been brought through airport security and how many had deliberately done .	-5.0284
It is no surprise that the people who are the most smuggling goods - knowingly or unknowingly - carrying through security were those who fly most frequently .	-5.6848
However , the company points out that the TSA directives are rather complicated and confusing .	-2.4847
People are often uncertain about the liquids they are allowed to take with them or how much of they are .	-3.8199
So it is no surprise that the largest number of TSA seizures are banned liquids .	-2.8524
For a time , people thought that TSA could view books as jewellery .	-2.9896
liquids are permitted on domestic flights , but not on international flights .	-2.0300
Elon Musk doesn ’ t care : Tesla ’ s tens of thousands of customers cancel order .	-2.7952
Elon Musk is happy to announce the huge number of preorders for his new Tesla " Model 3 " .	-3.0517
He has so far suggested that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation .	-5.2106
In addition to the ever triumphant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tesla ’ s chief Elon Musk , announced the latest quarterly balance sheet , betrayed a different , less glossy figure for the first time : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 .	-7.7553
In recent months , Musk had often advertised the more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car , the delivery of which is just beginning .	-4.7319
Now Musk admits : Of the 518,000 preorders , 63,000 have been withdrawn .	-3.2934
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations .	-2.3717
If you cancel your reservation , Tesla will pay back the 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1000 and UK $ 1000 ) .	-5.5056
Currently , 45,000 such non-binding reservations were made , while Musk admitted in a telephone conference with analysts .	-4.1527
But Tesla ’ s chief does not believe that the cancellation of the order could be a problem of some twelve percent of all orders .	-5.8061
His argument : the challenge to ambitious growth targets is not demand , but production .	-2.7058
Last year Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles .	-1.0009
In 2018 - all models taken together - it will be 500,000 , in 2020 a million .	-3.2229
There is an obvious demand for this .	-2.1687
According to Musk , there are currently 1800 reservations per day .	-1.6398
If you order a " Model 3 " today , you can expect extradition in the second half of 2018 at the earliest . If Tesla manages to drive its brand new production lines , never tested in practice , without any major interruptions of maximum utilisation .	-6.4616
Many experts doubt that this is possible .	-1.0959
If there are any major delays , however , the unconditionality of reservations could become a problem for Tesla .	-4.5797
Because then , the company cannot prevent unsatisfied customers from running away in droves .	-4.5785
EPA boss Pruitt is withdrawing due to the delay in the Obama Era rules to reduce emissions .	-3.9929
One day after being sued by 15 states , Scott Pruitt , the head of the Environmental Protection Agency , withdrew his previous decision to delay implementation of the Obama era rules in order to reduce emissions of smog-causing air pollutants .	-4.3831
Pruitt presented the change when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administrations .	-4.1402
He did not mention the action taken against his previous post in a federal appeal court .	-8.6986
It is a deadline for states to comply with 2015 standards for ground-level ozone on .	-3.7520
In June , Pruitt announced that he would delay compliance by one year to give his authority more time to study the plan , and to avoid " interfering in local decisions or impeding economic growth . "	-3.6462
Pruitt , who was Oklahoma ’ s prosecutor before he was appointed by President Donald Trump , was for a long time a reliable opponent of more stringent environmental legislation .	-3.9512
Since his arrival in Washington , Pruitt has repeatedly gone to block or delay regulations that the chemical industry and fossil fuels industry are resisting .	-3.1777
The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the recent legal setback for the Pruitts regulatory rollback agenda .	-1.8071
Last month , a federal appeals court in Washington decided that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he attempted to delay the implementation of an Obama administration rule requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks .	-4.4810
In a statement published on Wednesday evening , Pruitt proposed that his turnaround in ozone standards simply reinforce the EPA ’ s willingness to cooperate with states through the complex process of timely fulfilling the new standards .	-4.3205
" Under previous administrations , the EPAs often failed to meet the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be charged by activist groups and others , and in an agreement to set the date for implementation , " said Pruitt , who sued the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job .	-5.4352
" We do not believe in regulation by court proceedings and we take deadlines seriously .	-6.2533
We also take seriously the law and the authority that exists . '	-1.9888
Nonetheless , the EPA 's opinion stated that Pruitt will eventually use his ' prerogative to delay and all other legally available powers ' to ensure that the rules ' are based on sound policies and the best available information ' .	-5.4400
Congress Republicans are pushing for a broader recast of the ozone rules .	-2.5481
A draft law approved last month is intended to delay implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .	-2.0967
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate .	-1.1611
The New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman , who led the coalition of states that sued the EPAs this week , said that the group intends to maintain legal pressure .	-3.5158
" The reversal of the EPAs - after our complaints - is an important gain for health and safety from these 6.7 million New Yorkers and over 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog that floats into their communities , " said Schneiderman .	-4.9124
In this case , New York joined California , Connecticut , Delaware , Illinois , Iowa , Maine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Pennsylvania , Rhode Island , Vermont and Washington and the District of Columb.	-1.9816
Soil ozone occurs when pollutants from cars , power stations , oil refineries , chemical plants and other sources respond to sunlight in the atmosphere .	-2.5770
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people and every year contribute to thousands of premature deaths .	-3.2671
Public health professionals and environmentalists celebrated a surprising change of course over Pruitt .	-4.2326
" It is worrying how much pressure it takes to get this sensible step from the responsible for protecting the air we breathe , " said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity .	-3.3125
'We must continue to fight against the Trump administration 's ideological crusade to pander to polluters and their special interests ' .	-3.5075
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church	-1.7381
750 Years of St. Hilarius Church : On the occasion of the anniversary of the Bergkirche , the old Friedhof area in Tumlingen is invited to a Serenade on Sunday , 16 July at 16.30 p.m. .	-4.7581
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historic St. Hilarius complex is a popular place to stay .	-3.9550
Visitors to the sixth Benefit serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place .	-4.5774
The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the town have made Tumlings friends and promoters their concern .	-4.9897
Walter Martini stresses : " It is a unique local jewel " .	-2.7658
In 1267 the St. Hilarius chapel was first mentioned in the Württembergische Verkundenbuch : Count Hermann von Sulz sold the mountain with the parish church on Tumlingen and the Vogbei " an Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver .	-6.2191
According to the document , the Tumlinger Mountain , apart from the former parish church , was also a dominant courtyard , of which the church or the Patronage Law belonged , not the other way round .	-7.7345

Patronate law emerged from the early medieval law of own church .	-5.1724
A lord who built a church , furnished and occupied with a priest , remained the owner of this church and inherited this church .	-5.3613
This was the right to use a priest or propose a new priest to the bishop .	-4.0583
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower .	-1.9196
The largest of the two broken on Christmas 1673 .	-3.2677
The newly acquired bell was killed for the first time in 1692 , but then had to be handed over in the Second World War in 1942 .	-6.1621
In the 30-year war ( 1616 to 1648 ) the window discs were inserted and the bell ropes were stolen .	-4.5680
The roof was opaque .	-1.7053
In 1796 French troops camped near the church .	-1.8390

Until 1869 , the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery also served as the last resting place for the deaths of hearing boys .	-3.9397
The cemetery was enlarged in 1823 and the Hilarius church was abandoned .	-3.6996
Only the church tower was left standing .	-2.1759
In the New Year 's eight in 1834 , a storm split the church tower and half collapsed .	-4.1219
In order to prevent an accident , the tower was broken down .	-3.2523

Club wants to have the approval of wind wheels checked .	-5.1220
" Boisheim defends itself " does not see any legal precondition for the construction and has therefore contacted the Country Council .	-5.0726
The association " Boisheim defends itself " called on Landrat Andreas Coenen ( CDU ) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind power plants in Boisheimer Nette .	-5.1117
It must be done unlawfully .	-3.3673
The Association argues that , at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 , no wind turbines could have been approved at the Boisheimer Nette , since at the time in Viersen there was only a wind power concentration zone at the municipal boundary to Schwalmtal .	-6.2041
Within this concentration zone , the construction and operation of wind power plants are basically possible , but at the same time the concentration zone eliminates the use of wind power for the rest of the city .	-5.3307
Such areas are meant to prevent a " parachute " of the landscape .	-4.5814
Although the city of Viersen decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette a few days earlier by changing the land use plan - the district government of Düsseldorf had not approved it due to a form error .	-6.0526
" Due to the lack of any planning requirement , the authorisation granted is still unlawful and therefore to be withdrawn , " said Christoph Erkens , chairman of " Boisheim defies himself " .	-6.1525
The current state of affairs : before the summer recess , the city council again decided on the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette ; the district government has yet to approve it .	-5.8906
Erkens : " This means at this point the granting of permission for the construction of wind turbines is excluded from planning law " .	-6.9607
The circle confirms the receipt of the request .	-2.0591
" The corresponding letters have been received at the district of Viersen since last week , " said a speaker .	-4.1774
The circle takes them to re-examine the matter .	-3.1178
However , they are not likely to result in a halt to the procedure .	-6.2457
With regard to ongoing proceedings at the administrative court , the group on Thursday did not wish to comment on the content of the arguments of the association " Boisheim defends " .	-5.7151
NEW Re , a subsidiary of NEW , is planning to build four wheels per 200 metres high on a surface on the Boisheimer Nette .	-5.3083
Already last year the company , in which the city of Viersen is indirectly involved , had closed leased contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land .	-4.5876
The aim of the four wind turbines is to meet the demand for electricity of around 11 400 households - roughly one-fifth of the electricity needs of all four-person households .	-6.2205
NEW Re wants to invest around EUR 20 million .	-2.6437
Last summer , Viersen ’ s city council gave the green light for the purchase of three wind power plants at the Linnich wind farm near Aachen , as well as a participation in a wind power plant in <unk>bach-Palenberg in the district of Heinsberg .	-5.7624
Auto and tractor crash together : Women die in the event of terrible accident .	-3.5347

City and retailers plan " Homeland Shops " weekend	-3.4271
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region are expected to rediscover shopping in the city centre in September .	-3.4461
The trade association and the city administration want to take advantage of the weekend on September 8 and 9 to tempt the inhabitants to shopping in the city centre .	-6.1242
As the chairman of the trade association , Christian König , announced , the " Homeland Shops " weekend is intended to raise awareness among customers about the offers offered by their own city outside the usual supermarket goods .	-6.9550
Thus , a market with regional suppliers is planned , similar to the weekly market .	-4.3038
Moreover , domestic companies with their training places are to present themselves .	-3.3288
In addition , the shops of the city centre are to be invited to the " midnight shop " .	-9.7804
The action is aimed not only at residents of the city and the nearer region .	-3.7157
In preparation , advertising spots are on the radio , an Internet video and printed bags pointing to the action weekend , says Christian King .	-4.6541
City administration and trade association cooperate with the Chamber of Industry and Commerce .	-3.1094
This brings the trade association and the city to another stage of the project " Attractive downtown " .	-4.2667
These include new offers such as the first " Active Day " to the Brunnenfest with the Sales open Sunday , talks with all traders and hosts to make them participate actively .	-6.4417
Also attractive offers to Saturday and the renunciation of parking fees this day are part of the concept .	-3.4994
In addition , customer potential should be reopened or reopened .	-3.0887
This includes visitors and tourists .	-3.0375
But many locals would also have lost sight of the city ’ s shopping .	-3.2147
In the end , everyone would have to help revitalise the city centre , to lend to landlords , to the businesses of the whole city and to associations .	-6.9066
It is true to overcome the lethargy with a network that has partly spread , King said in spring .	-6.7668
Birgit Streich , Head of the IHK-Center in Mühlhausen , announced that , for the first time , five Thuringian cities participate in the nationwide third " homeland shops " day .	-5.3043
Bad Langensalza include Weimar , Smömmerda , Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode .	-3.4492
The day should " promote the appreciation of local trade and highlight its importance to the common good of our cities " , said deletion .	-5.0489
The action under the auspices of the IHK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his or her direct environment by purchasing behavior .	-4.3271

Trump pressured Mexico , following leaked transcripts of phone calls , for paying the border wall .	-3.2308
The Washington Post published transcripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia .	-2.2268
On January 27 , Trump , in a telephone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto , asked Trump to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall .	-3.2851
The US President insulted him because he publicly denounced the wall , saying to him : ' You cannot say this to the press ' .	-4.8156
Trump launched his presidential campaign , promising to build a wall on the US southern border , and swore to let Mexico pay for the project .	-3.5080
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull have also been published and revealed a tense exchange .	-3.2942
Mr. Trump said that trade to the US emigrating refugees to Australia would be ' ridiculous ' , ' mies ' and ' stupid ' , and that the existence of the trade that the Obama administration has traded would make it look like a ' dump ' after proposing a ban on the resettlement of refugees to the US .	-7.5115
Mr Trump ended the call after saying to Mr Turnbull , ' that is the most unpleasant call for the whole day ' .	-3.6013
Moore ’ s Ford Massacre : activists return to racist Lynkhack as a call for justice .	-3.8749
A 1948-er Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in rural Monroe , Georgia , and rumped to the Ford bridge of Moore .	-9.2705
Before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men came up with guns to block his way .	-3.5012
The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man in a needle strip suit - took a long train on his cigar and looked through the windshield verifiably .	-4.8126
Inside the occupants flowed into fear .	-3.9918
" We want these n -- r Roger ! " crumbled the man .	-3.1657
'Get him out of the car ! '	-1.5520
Shrieve the silence when a young black man was torn apart from the front-passenger seat .	-3.2724
Fortunately , this terrible scene , played on 22 July , is just a replica .	-2.7525
But when a blade is thrown around the neck of " Roger " , almost everyone in the audience experienced very real buckets .	-5.2910
Since 2005 , civil rights activists have come back to Moore 's Ford Bridge to emulate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by Ku Klux Klan in 1946 .	-7.4498
No one has ever been charged with murders .	-2.1559
" It is really incomprehensible that not one person has been arrested in all these years - although we see them in our communities , although we know who they are , " said Tyrone Brooks , who helps organise postage .	-5.4626
'It is a dirt on a story , but it is a burden on our souls ' .	-2.4154
Brooks is a 71-year-old former congressman of the state of Georgia and a lifelong civil rights activist .	-3.4003
For him , the reproduction serves as a dramatic call for action and constitutes an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected .	-4.1558
" We want prosecution , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must get justice , " he said .	-3.0545
'We cannot get healing and reconciliation until we get justice ' .	-1.9931
A court doctor loves a bed over the corpse of one of the victims of the Moore Ford lynch on 27 July 1946 .	-4.6263
According to FBI files received by the NBC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the lynch process .	-2.5126
But no one has ever been charged .	-1.7932
Although the suspects have remained at large for decades , civil rights activists say that the double motivation for the Lynch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex .	-4.0964
In April 1946 , a Supreme Court decision enabled black citizens in Georgia to vote for the first time during the summer election campaign .	-3.3154
At roughly the same time as the election , according to the FBI of the black farmer Roger Malcom , a white landowner , Barnett Hester , died down during a battle , allegedly for a woman .	-4.9166
Brooks said that the rumor in the city was that Hester slept with Malcoms Mrs Dorothy and that the baby she was wearing did not come from her husband .	-3.7645
On July 25 , 1946 , Loy Harrison , a prominent white landowner , paid $ 600 to release Malcom from prison , says the FBI .	-3.4325
He was jailed by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey .	-1.8223
But when they moved away from prison and approached Moore 's Ford Bridge , a lynchmob surrounded the car .	-2.7267
" As it turns out , it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murders , " excludes an FBI report .	-2.5766
" It is also obvious that there was a plot between state and local prosecution , which was not only involved in the murders , eliminated evidence and concealed the identity of witnesses " .	-3.9671
Brooks worded it even more concise .	-2.4116
" It was an electoral law massacre , " he said .	-1.8357
'You have all been killed to send a message to black people in this community : ' If you register and when you vote , then you will be here . '	-4.0935
For almost a decade , Cassandra Greene guided the annual reproduction of Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murders .	-3.5957
Their representation is graphic , graceful , and founded in a kind of deep racism , many would like to believe that it no longer exists in America .	-5.8105
It is difficult to look and even harder to ignore , but Greene said that this is the point .	-3.3117
" We do not want to talk about the lynch , because we will then be confronted with its ugliness in all of us , " she said .	-4.8663
" But I can 't build a relationship with you if you don 't want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have done . "	-5.4963
The samples for this year 's production started in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest of black - entered a room and listened when Greene started a well run overview of the piece .	-14.9058
Wade Marbaugh is here Greenes Co-director .	-2.0626
He has been playing the role of chief clan member for years , but he said that the role would never be easier .	-3.2748
" I feel dirty because I am not so , " said Marbaugh .	-1.9418
" But I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return to these times . "	-2.7454
On the other side of the room , actors Darius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona , Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester , tried their lines .	-3.1309
The play begins with Malcom , who cries to Hester and afflicts him , angry that he slept with his wife Dorothy .	-3.4227
'I said , n --he , disappear from my property ! '	-6.7666
Rascona responds to the fire .	-2.3372
There is a pause .	-1.0189
And then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in smile .	-2.5384
Green laughs the loudest .	-1.6995
" What ? " asked Rascona .	-0.8438
It is alarming and confused .	-1.0895
Was I too harsh ?	-0.9938
" No , " Greene said , still kicking .	-3.0719
'I simply do not think white people then ' n -- he ' said . '	-3.4239
" But " , " quipped one of the other black actors .	-2.1583
'You just have to meet the hard ' R. ' .	-2.2260
And that is where the energy shifts in space , a feeling of comradeship replaces the unease .	-3.7112
Everyone is busy getting this right , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four people killed .	-2.5915
The scene starts again .	-1.8696
This time when Rascona says the N word , he says it sharply and forcefully .	-2.1076
Absolutely no one laughs .	-0.9488
This repetition ends violently and quickly .	-3.3365
There are cries , shots and then silence .	-1.5047
A woman dressed with funerals stands above the corpses of the actor and performs Billie Holiday 's mourning praise " Strange Fruit " .	-4.5749
Their voice breaks in every second word .	-2.5125
About a hundred meters behind it , a group of about four dozen spectators sweat and tears wicked their eyes .	-4.7631
The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white .	-1.5822
A couple travelled from Ithaca , New York , to see the performance , many come down only the street .	-3.1049
They have experienced Georgian depressing humidity every nearly eight hours when Brooks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tombs of Malcoms and Dorseys .	-4.9761
Up to this point , the killings have remained an anecdote , but now , when you stand on the same country where the Lynch murders took place , the air feels splendid .	-4.6673
When the last notes of the song end , Greene invites the amount to come closer and inspect the song name .	-4.2687
Children hock at their heads , register the fake blood and the quiet bodies and whisper to each other .	-3.3742
" They are not really dead , " a small boy murmurs as he wants to remember .	-3.5214
After a few minutes , Greene thanks the amount - and suddenly it is over .	-2.8706
The actors cast the lynch out and wipe their tears .	-2.0865
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh , the man in suit who played the Clan member .	-3.0030
Nick Rascona embraces two of his actors and then breaks up in her poor , the emotional burden of the performance breaks through him .	-5.2991
" It is okay , " whispers one of the women .	-2.0651
" We know that this is not in your heart .	-1.8358
You did it for one reason . '	-1.6872
The audience later meets with the actors for dinner .	-2.7140
At one table , a white couple from Atlanta chatted about the reproduction with a black couple that they have just met .	-4.7723
Denise Duplinski fought to find words that left the feeling of the performance .	-4.8129
" It is difficult to hear these terrible words and deeds ... from people who look like you and who do it because they look like you , " she said .	-3.2148
" What this really does with me makes me believe that the lynch is still going on , " she added , " today only police shooting is called . "	-6.0732
In the same room , Tyrone Brooks Hof stops at his table , eating and reminiscent of civil rights .	-3.6463
He said he had already started planning the performance next year .	-2.4849
" The posture is somewhat inspiring , because it describes the horror of what we have endured , but it is also a moment of learning , " he said .	-3.3449
" It 's so , if we don 't learn anything from it , then it can happen again .	-3.9531
Those who do not study their own history , who do not know their own history , are condemned to repeat it . '	-2.7778
'Gods Dawn ' reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth .	-2.2213
In the fourth part of Richard Wagner ’ s monumental work , director Frank Castorf also relies on a colourful staging of gigantic , six-storey scenes .	-4.6978
The rotary stage ( designed by Aleksandar Denic ) features either a shabby street corner with Mauerrest and Dönerbude in Berlin , a " Plaste und Elaste " logo from DDR times or the New York Stock Exchange .	-5.8843
Before this , an open Mercedes-Oldtimer parks in which the Rhine daughters position as rocker girls , or alternatively a Isetta .	-4.6525
Spelled oil barrels remind us of Castorf 's guiding motif - money , power and greed - which is drawn by his " ring " staging .	-6.3462
The three Rhine daughters - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel , Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonise just like in the Rhine gold .	-3.9434
Kess seduced them Siegfried ( Stefan Vinke ) , crumble into the trunk in Hollywood style and give the Krawallo Clique .	-5.6873
Stephen Milling sings the wonderfully fixed slope that surrounds the aura of a heavy weight boxer .	-3.7930
Brutal the scene when he beat Siegfried .	-2.8396
Later , Gunther ( Markus Eiche ) still has to believe in it .	-8.1086
The audience thanks the ensemble with a strong applause .	-2.6185
Stormy celebrations include Foster , Milling , Vinke and conductor Janowski , who humbly and formally hides hands to Merkel-Rate .	-5.3214
There is a great applause for the festival orchestra , which is on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat again in a more legitimate recreational dress .	-6.8325
The appearance of Frank Castorf and his team were awaited with excitement .	-3.4320
In 2013 , if he had yet to undergo a yellow pipe concert , there were five years later great celebrations in which the isolated " buh " reputations were caught .	-7.5323
Katharina Wagner is probably delighted with this .	-3.3023
" One realizes that the audience has grown together with the " ring " in a way , " she said shortly before the performance of the dpa .	-5.3486
The audience has not only made a form of peace with Castorf , but has also grown an understanding of its view .	-3.4529
I draw a positive balance .	-2.0025
Max Menge works as a Voluntary	-1.1115
They work in several locations in their volunteer year .	-4.1498
Where anywhere ?	-1.2285
Menge : Normally in Steinfurt in the furniture exchange , once a week I help in Greven in the furniture bridge .	-4.4324
And I have already worked at school in the open whole day .	-3.9303
What are your experiences with this ?	-2.1006
Menge : It is a beautiful , broad spectrum I see here .	-3.3024
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .	-1.9415
They are now 26 years , that is , a late volunteer .	-4.1946
How will this come about ?	-5.7544
Men : I did Abitur .	-2.1419
And then , let us say , a study of construction engineering that has successfully broken down . . . . . . . .	-9.9350
I realized for me that for me it is wrong and I want to do something else , work with people .	-3.6004
And then I wondered what do you do .	-1.9152
Make a social year , there is an insight where you can see how it is on the ground , perhaps at the focal point .	-4.8900
And was it ?	-1.6224
Menge : I have collected great impressions .	-2.9488
I will start my studies in the social field in the winter semester .	-3.2342
I will study dual , probably in Herne , at the Herne youth office , and I will study at the University of Applied Sciences in Hamm .	-6.5388
Is it not something unusual to have several different volunteer sites ?	-3.7320
Men : Yes , it is very variable .	-2.3359
It 's probably always a question of where to do your FSJ .	-3.9609
It can be done from age to youth work in all possible facets of social work .	-3.6172
In my case it was very varied .	-2.5333
I was also partly in the OGS , that is to say in the afternoons .	-3.3786
For me , that was exactly what I had heard .	-3.9875
I was able to see my own strengths and see how it really works . .	-3.4811
Unlike in construction engineering studies ?	-2.4703
Keep in mind that this is not about calculating statistics .	-3.6081
We keep on heading other people , who have a completely different history behind them .	-5.5622
Whether a refugee , a young person who has been taken out of the family , we must always address it individually .	-4.3375
Very interesting .	-0.9687
And you had no fears of touch ?	-1.9135
Sum : I am not the guy for this .	-3.6148
It is an area that gives you a lot .	-2.4815
Love , good friendliness .	-2.6795
There are negative moments , too , but so life is simply .	-2.7999
Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs , cutting the dividend to revive business .	-1.9824
The British Pearson educational group said on Friday that it will reduce another 3,000 jobs and cut its intermediate dividend by 72 % , because another restructuring program will be launched to overcome the pressure that the company faces .	-3.9435

According to the United Nations , there were at least 1,662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , some 20 % of them in the capital .	-2.8881
At the end of July , a suicide bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shia district of Kabul .	-1.9946
The Taliban said they had carried out this attack .	-2.0398
On May 31 , a massive bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the country ’ s deadliest militant attack since the US-led troops displaced the Taliban from power in 2001 .	-3.7414
The violence underscores the precarious security situation in Afghanistan , as US President Donald Trump considers to increase the number of US troops supporting the country ’ s military and police .	-7.9885

EPA Returns Decision to Return the Smog Rule	-2.6344
The US Environmental Protection Agency has suspended a decision to delay the Obama administration ’ s regulation , whereby states are obliged to contain smog-causing emissions , a day when 15 states sued the Agency for taking the step .	-5.6919
The EPAs announced a decision late on Wednesday to advance the so-called ' ozone provisions 2015 ' and said that it showed the Agency 's obligation to cooperate with states .	-4.3772
" We believe in dialogue and in responding to our state partners , " said EPA chief Scott Pruitt in a statement .	-3.1958
In June , Pruitt announced the EPA 's intention to delay the ozone provisions - in which pollutant emissions are to be measured in one part of the country to determine where cuts need to be made to meet stricter air quality standards - by one year until October 2018 .	-5.3846
A group of 15 largely democratic states , together with the Colombia district , complained on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .	-3.1932
President Donald Trump ’ s administration has tried to reduce a wide range of environmental constraints imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that Trump has said will boost economic growth .	-4.0715
However , efforts have sparked the setback of democrats and nature conservation groups who are worried about the impact of greater emissions on public health .	-5.0106
The EPA website says that breathing in air containing ozone can " reduce lung function and increase breathing symptoms " such as asthma .	-3.7825
Local Council wants Community area	-2.6196
In the end , the decision was clear : in the event of two votes against , the municipal council of Floorn Winzeln decides to set up a Community area in the future residential population .	-6.4506
Before the discussion , there is an important information : the contract for the missing property is signed , mayor Bernhard Tjaden reports .	-4.4893
Although it will still take until the area of community ownership , which had previously been owned by the church , there is now no obstacle to planning the project to be run by a private investor .	-6.4760
There is a discussion on a Community area for that .	-3.0020
One of the two investors still in the boat has offered to meet the community .	-3.0376
On the ground floor it would provide a living area - around 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a surface area of 70 square metres , at a special price .	-5.1077
The administration and the majority of the municipal councils intend to include such a community area not as a meeting point only for the inhabitants of the high-profile housing , but openly into the community .	-7.9195
The word " Strickcafé " was used as an example .	-3.0393
The decision made by allocating funds to the current budget as early as last autumn is being overtaken by means of support .	-5.0273
The building is located in the reconstruction area .	-2.9486
According to Tjaden , the creation of a Community area would be eligible for funding at 60 % of 30 % .	-3.4779
The resolution proposal provides for a signal to the investor that he is not going to throw a bug between his legs in this regard , that it would be possible to establish that both the saddle - which is linked to the environment - and the powder roof - which reduces the amount of grapes and makes the construction more economic .	-10.2796
Needless to say , not only Wilfried Sohmer says , this addition is unnecessary .	-3.3053
If it helps , it happens unanimously .	-3.0330
It is not so easy in the Community area .	-2.8441
Daniela Ruf refers to the many own buildings with which one does not really make progress , for which we are now rejecting ourselves in the common room from the window , says : ' I am hard to do with it ' .	-7.4886
Yvonne Staiger is absolutely in favour of the Community area - but totally against local participation .	-4.2470
It views this as a covert subsidy for any asset or even foreign investors .	-4.5330
That is not the case , because the acquisition of the area does not give a grant ; instead , it gets a real value that can be marketed in the event of doubt , is the counter-speech .	-7.1476
Staiger ’ s request to split the decision proposal accordingly is in favour of three .	-4.0842
So there are two votes against the original programme , which Stefan Haller summarises as follows : ' If we take the decision in this way , we will take a huge step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure ' .	-5.0478
Auto collision : Radler Getting Road	-3.5491
When crossing the road , an 82-year-old cyclist was captured by a car on Wednesday in Garath and was seriously injured .	-3.7819

The Supercup takes place without him : David Alaba must have the game soaked against Dortmund .	-3.1757
With personal care the FC Bavaria will travel to Dortmund for the first compulsory pilot of the new season . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .	-10.5967
Seven pros lack the title defender in the supercup against the Cup winner .	-3.2438
The staffing concerns of the German soccer recorder Bavaria München are getting bigger and bigger before the Supercup on Saturday ( 8.30 p.m. / ZDF and Eurosport ) at Pokalwinger Borussia Dortmund .	-6.2169
Trainer Carlo Ancelotti also has to do without David Alaba in a duel with the BVB .	-3.5547
That was confirmed by the Italians on Friday .	-0.8842
In addition , the Munich communities lack Manuel Neuer , James , Thiago , Jerome Boateng , Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat .	-3.2240
Ancelotti was responsible for the five defeats in the last six test games for the physical condition and lack of balance in the game of his team .	-3.8923
" We know that we are not in the best physical constitution , " said Ancelotti and added : " The most important point is team balance .	-2.7721
It was not good at the end of the day . ' . . . . . . . . . . .	-5.0395
However , the 58-year-old believes in a performance improvement in the first official mandatory game of the season .	-10.8485
" Football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation .	-1.1547
I have great confidence that my team will demonstrate these qualities .	-2.6800
The team is ready .	-0.8067
We want to play intelligently , " said Ancelotti , who expects a " difficult , intensive game " .	-2.2048
The duel of the two German football showweights pulls the fans into their bann .	-4.8605

Hiking Stars in the Harz	-2.0873
In Harz the first star path is to be established nationwide .	-4.4296
The association Sternwarte Sankt Andreasberg plans to do this .	-3.3080
There is a planetary path in Göttingen - since 2003 .	-2.8466
A " star trail " responds to the need for information from many visitors , it said .	-5.3702
It combines nature , science , movement and sporting performance .	-2.4165
The members want to set up panels along the planned route , informing about stars and constellations .	-4.9543
In the first phase until 2018 , the association plans to have " well-reachable installations in five to six locations " in Oberharz .	-5.1590
Infrage would be St. Andreasberg , Braunlage , Hohei<unk> and Sieber .	-2.8227
The information on the panels should be added via the Internet .	-3.0505
This is why a good mobile network reception plays a role in the choice of location .	-4.1849
Accessibility is also a criterion .	-1.6532
The Star-Trail is to be extended by train later .	-5.8216
" On the Sternenfad , the observers learn much worth knowing about , for example , the physics of the individual stars , " the association explained .	-11.1273
In addition , they learned why stars had different colors or why a star shines more than another , although it was far further away .	-5.2989
It is also mediated in which constellations a selected star is located and when it is best to see . star . . star . . star . . . . . . . .	-11.4355
Since 2014 , the association has operated the highest hotel star in northern Germany in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg .	-4.7711
According to the Federal Office for Nature Protection , the site in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany .	-3.6615
From there you can see the Milky Way and even the Andromeda galaxy with just one eye .	-4.1855
In the Uni-City there has been something similar in the Planetarium Göttingen since 2003 , on the initiative of the Förderverein Planetenweg - the Planetenweg .	-5.9232
Starting from Gebhards Hotel in the Goetheallee , which forms the interior of our solar system , the Planetenweg with its steles leads up to the Hainberg and Sternwarte - as well as an " alien " site in Diemarden ( Municipality Einen ) with the planet Sedna .	-5.6506
The stells with the individual planets - including the pluto degraded for dwarf planets at the end point - are positioned at a distance of one to two billion .	-6.2707
The earth thus shrinks to a ball of 6.5 millimeters in diameter , while the exactly 75 meter away sun measures 70 centimetres .	-4.7634
The entire distance from the planetary route is about four kilometres .	-3.9680
While light from the sun to the pluto takes about eight hours , pedestrians need a good hour to stele with pluto .	-3.7897
Thus pedestrians are faster than the light in the universe .	-2.5938
But the march to the next fixed star would take half a year .	-2.7166
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time , discuss a possible showdown .	-1.7702

After Garcias victory by unanimous decision on the former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday at Showtime , both fighters are members of the top five Pound-for Pound list .	-5.2189
Garcia stretched the right hand and said : " How do you , Champion ?	-2.6217
I wish you luck . '	-4.2358
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga at ESPN on Saturday evening .	-2.4968
When the couple put photos , Lomachenko-Manager Egis Klimas noted that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the " perfect order of size " .	-4.6527
" I am a former spring weight , " reminded Garcia .	-3.1383
" I went up for Broner [ to <unk> 140 ] , but I 'm not so big .	-2.6587
I 'm small for 140 .	-0.9198
I would like to go down on light weight .	-4.5313
And he must move on lightweight weighters [ 135 pounds ] and then we fight .	-2.3593
That is what fans demand .	-1.5845
Let us give them that . '	-0.8035
Lomachenko agreed .	-0.7160
'Boxing needs this fight ' .	-1.7666
Climate asked whether it should be on Pay-per-View , part of a strategy that Lomachenko has to fight with a 135 pound debut this year to agree a date next summer with Garcia ( 37-0 , 30 Knockouts ) that also has interest in fighting the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight title fight in the Forum on 23 September .	-4.2492
" This fight could take place in pay-per-view mode because all fans asked for it , " Garcia said , and later expressed openly , to fight with the network that offers the best financial package .	-4.9525
We are the best .	-0.6766
No other names can generate this kind of attention .	-1.6249
Whenever they are ready ... '	-1.2134
Garcia said he considered Lomachenko to be " a huge fighter , " and he might be taking part in his Samstag struggle . , , , , .	-9.2776
But Lomachenko held the generous praise for Garcia and said that he thought the trio champion from Riverside " look very slowly , sorry Mikey ... you wanted to co-out " .	-5.1706
Garcia said that the focus is to show starch , then boxing .	-3.1045
Both said they could feel the momentum that built up for their fight .	-3.6263
" This is the battle that must be pursued .	-2.5506
No other fight attracts so much attention and enthusiasm .	-2.0808
I 'm more than happy to work on this , " said Garcia .	-1.7212
Lomachenko said : " I waited for the top fighters , and that is Mikey .	-2.6146
It will be a great fight . '	-1.8741
Four Injuries to Reifenplatzer	-2.4956

According to initial information , the driver of Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle at 4.30 p.m. shortly before the connection point of market wide , probably after a tire plate .	-11.4414
The car slipped to the right into the roof , overflowing and staying on the roof .	-7.1861
The four occupants - two adults and two children - were partly seriously injured in the accident .	-1.8807

Fortunas Hoffmann : ' Three-chain works better '	-2.8678
After 2 : 2 , Andre Hoffmann hopes that the optimization of the defense formation in Aue points as the start of the season against Braunschweig .	-5.3824
Andre Hoffmann was happy with the first season game , with the result also , if not the two opponents were against Braunschweig on 2 : 2 .	-6.2321
" These were two opposite too many , and we need to be even more careful in Aue , " says Fortuna Düsseldorf 's defensive player .	-4.2007
The three ridges are to be optimized further in the arched mountains .	-5.2722
And a gate for a free kick will not want to capture the fortress anymore .	-5.2913
" It will be the case for the future that no longer alike with Michael ( Rensing ) . "	-4.8956
Hoffmann is convinced that his team can manage better after the experience of preparing the triple chain than with the four riding chain .	-6.0924
" Still I don 't know how we will act in Aue , " says his coach Friedhelm Funkel , but Hoffmann is sure of his thing , " because we are on the semi-posts in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Giesselmann players who can build well , " said Hoffmann .	-6.5210
" However , we must harmonise even better and we do not accomplish so many bugs in the setup " .	-6.6569
Of course , Hoffmann also goes to Aue to win the game .	-1.9755
" But it doesn 't know whether you can talk about a failed start after a decision .	-5.1224
The performance could well be okay , " said Hoffmann .	-3.3844
" But if we can live with four points on Sunday and concentrate on the Cup , we will certainly be able to talk about a proper season start . "	-6.3552
His trainer wanted to know nothing of that .	-2.9304
" I judge the start of the season only after six to eight days of play , " said Friedhelm Funkel , who does not want to speak of an advantage over the Aue , just because the game of things in Heidenheim had to be cancelled prematurely due to a storm .	-5.2789
" Now they can start the season almost with a home game , " says Funkel and Hoffmann , saying that the players from the outside might be even more fresh , because they would not have a tough and complete game like Fortuna against an uprising favorite in the bones .	-6.9744
" But they don 't know 100 % where they are at present , " says Fortuna 's interior defender .	-3.8710
Although the guests from the Rhineland go as a light favourite on Sunday to meet in the final ( almost ) finished stadium of Aue .	-4.1929
" It is stupid that we get them off the ground just because we are entitled to come under the first six , " says Funkel , whose balance is very positive for only a defeat against the Aue from nine games .	-7.0652
" There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga to beat from the start , " says Fortuna 's chief coach .	-3.2440
'To make such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant ' .	-2.0961
And so Funkel doesn 't want to see his players on Sunday .	-4.0012
New results of Swedish asylum age assessment tests published	-2.0708
The recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , which have been subjected to a new method of medical evaluation of their age , show that more than 80 % of those tested are over 18 years old , but not everyone believes the accuracy of these results .	-4.5336
The Swedish authority for Forensian Medicine ( Rättsmedicine sales ) started carrying out the tests last year .	-5.4560
They should make the assessment of age more accurate during the asylum process , after the Swedish Migration Authority ( Migration Sales ) was criticised for failures in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were minors .	-5.3068
To date , migration sales sent 6,880 cases to be tested , and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from the period from mid-March to July 31 , 2017 .	-4.9378
Eighty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in a further 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the person was " possibly 18 years or older " .	-3.4540
In 432 cases , the conclusion was that the person " may be under the age of 18 " .	-2.9033
The tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is called into question .	-2.7715
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency , the results have been consistent in recent months .	-2.9218
" We see no big difference in the statistics of recent months , the figures are fairly constant , " he said The Local magazine .	-3.2869
The high proportion of cases in which the person was judged over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has lied over his age .	-3.3599
In May , the agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases which " suggest that the investigated person is 18 years or older " .	-3.4347
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results , she found that in 243 of these cases the person had frankly said that it would be 18 years old this year .	-3.8718
The method of medical age assessment , in which x-rays are made by knee teeth and MRT photographs , which are then analysed by dentists and radiologists , has also been criticised in some areas .	-5.1593
A skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute , whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of humans to see whether they went through puberty sooner or later .	-3.5303
" I had reason to think about it , and I do not believe that the type of measurement should be used .	-3.6322
To assess the biological age in this way is very uncertain .	-2.5147
If we cannot say it safely , we should not pretend to be as if we could , " he said the newspaper Metro .	-3.1778
Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of the tests : " In general , you can say that the risk of misjudging a child as an adult is low .	-3.5789
The biggest risk is when the person is less than 18 , in this case this is about 10 % . '	-4.3544
Full in the Plan	-1.2975
Work on the three bridges of Landstra<unk>e 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well .	-2.6267
On Wednesday , seven tonnes of heavy concrete was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach .	-3.0094
" We are very good at the time , it runs super , " says Reinhold Leicht , Director of the Department of Road and Transport in the President of Freiburg .	-4.8395
In April , work began simultaneously on all three bridges in need of renovation between Schramberg and Lauterbach .	-3.7601
The construction end is scheduled for October and is sure to keep to the schedule .	-4.5595
Coming from Schramberg , the first bridge crosses the Trombach .	-3.1798
It is composed of concrete vaulted arched bridle with red buntsandstone and has a total length of 4.80 meters .	-6.4328
It was built in 1900 .	-1.2963
Like the other two bridges , it has come into the years .	-2.6500
In order to guarantee stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are now being thoroughly refurbished .	-4.0110
The other two bridges cross the Lauterbach .	-2.0453
They are made of red buntsandstone .	-2.3455
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve , or 10.60 meters long .	-2.3796
On Wednesday morning on the north side , the bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach received a 1.30 meter width and seven tonnes heavy bridge cap .	-6.7725
This is a marginal fastener which is also used as operating route .	-3.9839
On the southern part of the bridge a 2.20 meter bridge cap is to be used on Friday .	-4.4735
That is what the pedestrian route is supposed to follow .	-3.1990
The most important thing is that they are finished parts , a patent of the Schramberg company Dizvo .	-3.8091
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridges .	-1.7873
Special sensitivity has been the laying of lines by the building in Lauterbach .	-3.7944
There is also a glass fibre cable connected to many companies .	-3.6015
The residents were informed about the project in advance of their work .	-3.3564
In addition , fish and cancers had to be fished out first .	-3.7243
Traffic is regulated by a traffic light for the bridges between the Bauhof building and the saddle wheat towards Schramberg .	-5.0189
For building work on the Lauterbacher Ortsingg bridge , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels " Tannenhof " and " Sieben Linden " is fully closed .	-5.5732
The total cost of the three bridges is EUR 700 000 .	-2.5834
The whole thing is financed by the country .	-2.5563
AfD in Gerolstein : Bunter Protests in German PoSalad	-2.8521
It is not so common for parties to pull together , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( AfD ) , it comes together , which otherwise is difficult to reconcile .	-5.2344
The parties represented in the Kreistag Vulkaneifel ( CDU , SPD , Green , FDP , FWG , Left ) belong to a broad alliance , which on this day shows a peaceful flag because the AfD invites Rondell to the " big campaign launch " at the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle .	-6.4696
And known names start - such as Alice Weidel , which together with Alexander Gauland is the top duo for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and Deputy Chairman Beatrix of Storch .	-5.1867
But those who are there hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the AfDs , but to demonstrate .	-4.0595
The motto " Eifel stays colorful " .	-1.9816
Originally the city picnic was planned under the motto " All at a table " on the well square , but now takes place on the parking lot below the Rondell - and therefore directly in front of the eyes of those who attend the AfD event in the city hall .	-5.9702
A colorful picture there .	-2.3520
And what Christa Karoli , Chairman of Forum A World and one of the leading organizers , really pleased : " How many people have met here " .	-4.8719
There is music and lots of food , including an " original German potato salad , which the AfD could eat without any problems " , says the woman who brought him with him .	-4.6514
The police have ordered many officials to Gerolstein , and they also show presence at the station , which is only a few metres from the venues .	-5.5659
How did the AfD actually come to Gerolstein ?	-1.7692
Mario Hompes from the AfD Volcanic Eifel reported that he tried to get such an event and received the bonus .	-7.4296
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had initially asked for something in Daun but got a cancellation because of the already built Laurentiuskirmes there were not enough parking spaces .	-6.6810
Now the Rondell , Hompes is pleased that " we can have such a nice event here " .	-3.6444
With a view to the event on the Rondelvorplatz he says : " This is the right of the people , main thing , it remains peaceful " .	-4.5335
This is also true : At 8 p.m. , a band for entertainment is arranged at the Rondelvorplatz , in the city hall of various speakers , including Uwe Junge , Chairman of Rhineland-Palatinate .	-7.5727
There are about 200 listeners in the room waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag elections , Alice Weidel , and Deputy Chairman Beatrix of Storch to deliver their speeches .	-4.9136
The police presence is unchanged , but so far the officials have had a quiet evening .	-3.0507
The AfD event takes a little more than an hour , the guests on the ground have a longer breath , but there is also a clean room shortly after 9 p.m.	-6.4748
The police can go away - not special events .	-3.7750
Trompets Meet Trompet	-3.9188
A listening to the Wolffer Posanist Frederic Belli can be found in the Hasacher Monastery concert tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 p.m. in the monastery church .	-6.2809
Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov he gives a concert under the slogan " Schwarzmeer meets in the Black Forest " , or even " Balkan folklore " meets a classic German training with roots in the Blasmusik .	-4.1090
Both soloists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have solo positions in European top orchestras .	-3.2978
Petkov Solotropeter is the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is a solo sauna of the SWR Symphony Orchestra .	-4.0819
Both combine the desire not only to cross the borders on their instruments , but also to merge the limits of the various genres .	-3.1104
For example , Johann Sebastian Bach plays with the two as in a new guise , Daniel Schnyders " Weltmusik " combines with Bulgarian folklore , and in the " Exchange Suite " of the jazz echo author Nils Wogram , mixing classical , jazz and free games into a fascinating work of art .	-7.2157
This core of the programme was set up only this spring with huge success in Freiburg .	-3.4106
The renowned composer Nils Wogram has written it for the two musicians and more : the Hasacher Monastery Church with its special acoustics is deliberately included in the concert .	-4.6118
Crisis Stewart Speeches Bisexual	-2.8956
" Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives .	-1.6221
But I want to try everything , " said Kristen Stewart quite openly about her bisexual nature .	-2.8357
" Once I go to grilled cheese , I think : ' Oh that was cool , what comes next ? ' .	-4.3215
The best known relationship of the Hollywood star was that of her Twilight colleague , Robert Pattinson , who ended up bitterly divided .	-5.3594
Despite this , the brinette performer assures the " Harper 's Bazaar " magazine : " I was seriously in love with every one I thought .	-6.0961
Or does she think I would have played it ? ' ?	-3.5732
After their separation , crises admitted that it was bisexual : " I have always lived dualism and seriously believed it .	-4.2086
So I have never been confused or obstructed .	-2.9286
I never liked it to be taken seriously . '	-1.8029
In particular , she suffered under " Bang Showbiz " but in school time when she preferred to wear a bub : " Not all girls are typical girls .	-5.0077
That really has hurt me .	-2.8186
When I was 11 the children told me that I would look like a bub .	-2.3828
I felt really attacked , scared and humiliated .	-1.7564
Now I look back and think : ' girl , be proud of you ! '	-3.1077

Where Prince Henrik will be buried is still unclear .	-2.0811
But he has no intention of being buried in his French home .	-3.3204
Prince Henrik never made a secret of the fact that he was not happy with his title . .	-2.7056
After the throne of his wife Margrethe in 1972 , he would like to become king .	-3.4927

My Danish was fluctuating , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk stockings instead of Stricksocks , Citro<unk>n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .	-2.9487

Prime Minister Weil wants Rapid Reelection	-2.0046
CDU and FDP by a possible majority in Lower Saxony	-1.7897
Lower Saxony Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) , after the loss of the red green government majority , is in favour of a rapid re-election of the country , but he does not want to resign .	-4.2583
Because on Friday the dissolution of Parliament was expressed .	-3.6650
Previously , the surprising departure of a Green MEP from her country faction in Lower Saxony had plunged Prime Minister Stephan Weil ’ s government into a severe crisis .	-4.0512
Five months before the official election , the red green coalition in Hannover lost its narrow one-vote majority in Parliament to the CDU and FDP opposition .	-4.1909
Up until now , the Green MEP Elke Twesten justified her move with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg ( Forge ) .	-4.5343
" I see my political future in the CDU , " she explained on Friday in Hannover .	-1.6689
CDU Group Chairman Björn Thümler wants to recommend to his group that they should be taken up .	-4.6644
Thus , CDU and FDP together would have 69 seats in the Lower Saxon country day , SPD , and Green 68 .	-4.3977
So far , the relationship has been the other way around .	-1.8010
The new country day is regularly elected on 14 January next year .	-3.3838
Thümler said that the rot-green state government should now decide whether to continue governing this situation without a majority .	-3.7482
However , Stephan Weil considers it essential that the day of the country decides its self-resolution as soon as possible .	-4.7171
The CDU Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .	-2.2909
The national constitution also provides for the possibility that the country 's parliament will withdraw the confidence of the Prime Minister and elect a successor .	-6.1393
" Our constitution offers several options .	-1.8221
These opportunities must be properly examined by law , " said Thümler .	-3.7132
'You will discuss all issues calmly if they are legally sound . '	-4.6747
Thümler called Twesten 's move " but something kurios " .	-2.5580
The politician himself stressed : " I am not a traitor .	-1.8798
I feel very good ' .	-0.7925
She was known as a follower of Schwarz-Grün .	-4.4473
The Greens called on the dissenting Members to return their land today .	-3.7993
" Naturally , we assume that she returns with immediate effect her country mandate from the green country list , " said Chairman Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner .	-6.0751
The Group Chairman of the Greens , Anja Piel , said : ' We regret the decision taken by Elke Twesten exceptionally ' .	-3.8061
You deliberately decided not to have a debate in the group .	-2.7739
'Even in the light of the fact that there were no differences in content , we cannot understand this step ' .	-3.3619
SPD Chancellor Martin Schulz condemns the transfer of the Dutch Greens Elke Twesten to the CDU as betrayal .	-3.7561
" The behaviour of former Green MEPs in Lower Saxony is not only betraying the electorate , but also betraying the Rot-Green , " wrote the Federal President of the Social Democrats on Friday on Facebook .	-4.7166
He supports Prime Minister Stephan Weil ’ s decision to reelect the country quickly .	-8.0734
The exit of Twesten costs the majority of Rot-Green in Lower Saxony .	-3.0254
The politician " in her injured vanity and in her frustration place her personal interests before the welfare of the country , " criticized SPD Secretary-General Hubertus Heil .	-7.2355
" It is scandalous that the CDU is contributing to this dirty intrigue in Lower Saxony and is trying to make it political capital " .	-4.3977
Lower Saxony ’ s CDU Group leader Björn Thümler intends to recommend his MPs to include Elke Twesten in the CDU .	-3.8395
The Group leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Oppermann , accused Twesten of falsifying the result of the 2013 election with personal careers .	-4.5267
The CDU was strongest before the SPD then , but the SPD and the Greens had a thin majority of one vote in the country .	-4.8415
Agriculture Minister in the interview - How are we protecting ourselves from poisonous , Mr Schmidt ?	-2.9298
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs .	-0.6461
How could the scandal happen ?	-1.1260
How can consumers protect themselves .	-0.9447
Agricultural Minister Christian Schmidt ( CSU ) stands in the interview with the German editorial network ( RND ) speech and answer .	-3.3303
Mr Schmidt , how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs ?	-1.4257
I can only encourage all consumers to look carefully at the eggs in your refrigerator and to check the stamp pressure .	-3.0255
On the consumer protection portal www.Food Warnung.de , the Federal States provide the latest information on the affected egg charges .	-5.3380
Issued eggs should be destroyed or returned .	-1.9914
Even if , after everything we know at the moment , a health hazard is practically excluded .	-3.3157
Is Aldi now taking up the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the enlightener is not really played by the Federal Agricultural Minister ?	-4.1183
Food surveillance is a task for the federal states .	-2.7363
Nevertheless , my House immediately turned off and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since it became known that Germany has been in with .	-13.9907
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers .	-1.6720
Trade , like manufacturers , must ensure that the products sold are efficient and safe from health .	-4.3414
If the maximum residue content of 0.005mg / kg is exceeded in eggs , they are not operational .	-4.1203
However , unloaded eggs can be sold and eaten .	-2.2546
This time , farms are not to blame .	-1.8270
Are manufacturing companies and consumers sitting in the same boat ?	-2.6515
According to the current state of knowledge , production companies are not directly to blame .	-3.9982
Instead , they have to face economic damage as a result of allegedly illegal practices by service companies .	-3.8575
As always , in the worst case there are too few inspectors .	-2.8995
Is it only a lack of personnel or of coherent competence ?	-2.6342
It was precisely the official controls that revealed the process .	-3.0127
The truth is , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 % excluded .	-2.6379
It is precisely for this reason that a consistent investigation of these events and the handover to public prosecutors in cases where crimes can be committed are crucial .	-6.4785
I have already made it clear on several occasions that I am expecting full information from the responsible authorities .	-3.1605
Is regular food scandals really necessary ?	-2.3160
Consumers have the right to have exclusively safe and accessible food .	-3.1613
If an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly indignant .	-3.0850
The panned funds have put manufacturers , traders and consumers in a situation that is absolutely not necessary .	-4.7213
In principle , it must be clear that the illegal use of insecticide Fipronil in the attitude of animals delivering food is unacceptable and must be brought to an end without delay .	-4.9405
This must be done consistently and with great pressure at all levels .	-3.2264
I expect all the competent authorities to clarify matters swiftly and in full . . . . . . . . . . with . . . .	-8.0785
How the football ’ s financial rules affect Neymar ’ s move to Paris	-2.3151
The rules aimed at preventing the free expenses of European football clubs will not disrupt Neymar ’ s world record transfer from Spain ’ s Barcelona to France ’ s Paris Saint Germain .	-3.7992
Any consequences will come from UEFA for Paris Saint-Germain , because the leading organisation that oversees the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champion League tournament .	-4.6075
Financial Fair Play rules launched by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will eventually have to prove that the transfer from Neymar was financed without great losses .	-3.8578
Barcelona has paid EUR 222 million ( $ 262 million ) to buy Brazil out of its treaty , and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several $ 10 million per year .	-3.3945
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar 's move to France .	-1.3874
PSG can surely ease the money so that Neymar underwrites and brings him into a galaxy of other stars , given the financing of the team through the energy-rich Katar family of rulers .	-6.0916
clubs may spend a lot of money on buying players , but they must compete with legitimate sources of revenue that allow them to break even points in their football related business .	-5.0521
FFP was designed by Michel Platini as president of the UEFA in 2007 .	-2.0049
Former French player believed that clubs that had borrowed huge debts in their quest for success were effectively cheating and risking ruining when banks or owners withdrew their support .	-3.9438
In 2011 , FFP shifted from focus on clubs ’ debt to monitoring their losses .	-2.1304
The change meant that the business model that novel Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a tougher issue .	-3.5110
During the current three-year FFP survey period , which will run until 2018 , clubs can accept losses of € 30 million .	-3.7966
And , while Platini disregarded the presidency in 2015 , his UEFA successor , Aleksander Ceferin , continues to advocate discouraging excessive spending .	-3.7162
" Certainly FFP is not dead and we will certainly strengthen the rules for the future , " said Andrea Traverso , who is responsible for FFP at UEFA , to The Associated Press last week .	-2.8832
Although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a flat rate , it can allocate the amount for accounting over the duration of its contract .	-4.4202
Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the cash transaction amounts can be earmarked for the next five years of EUR 44.4 million in the annual accounts .	-5.6723
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 , together with Abu Dhabi , owned by Manchester City , hit the most severe sanctions .	-2.5559
The PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million ( then $ 82 million ) , which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and it was ordered that the team members remain limited to 21 players for the 2014 / 15 Champions League , instead of the normal 25 players .	-4.8789
UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outlist their financial supervision by blowing their revenue through companies associated with club owners .	-5.4680
While a Catarian company could sponsor PSG if sponsorship value exceeds standard market rates , UEFA would not consider this to be a legitimate income .	-5.0509
This was what happened in 2014 , when UEFA decided that the value of PSA sponsorship was bloated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .	-2.4833
It has been reported that some of the PSG payments to Neymar on payments to the World Cup 2022 Organization Committee could come to Qatar .	-3.2739
But PSG and Qatar 2022 denied that Neymar will become World Cup ambassadors , and that such a manoeuvre could easily be found for UEFA regulators .	-3.6743
The sanctions against PSG so far mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules .	-2.3752
UEFA had no preliminary discussions with PSG on Neymar ’ s transfer , telling the people who are familiar with the situation on Thursday .	-3.5936
They spoke with The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity , because they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation .	-3.1013
The most recent reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 , with a turnover of EUR 542.4 million , has achieved a profit of more than EUR 10 million .	-4.3069
The accounts for the last fiscal year are still to be published .	-2.1862
PSG expects Neymar ’ s arrival to be a blessing for sponsorship deals , merchandising and trikot sales .	-2.5343
The association assumes that sales will increase by at least 30 percent after signing .	-2.6540
The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players go , and it tried to prevent Neymar ’ s move by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP .	-3.8184
" It is a clear case of " financial doping " with the club and the state , " said the President of the La League , Javier Tebas , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar ultimate ownership of PSG .	-3.8969
Arsenal Manager Arsene Wenger , whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon , shares the reservations of La League against a state that finances a club .	-3.2786
" It is the consequence of ownership and this has completely changed the whole landscape of football over the last 15 years , " said Wenger on Thursday .	-2.7409
" As soon as a country has a club , everything is possible .	-2.2267
It will be very difficult to respect financial fair play , because you can take different routes or have different interests when a country has such a big player to represent a country . '	-4.7262

Nostalgia goes to the niche in Wet Hot American Summer and Comrade Detective .	-9.3899
This repetition of history is simultaneously nostalgic because of the glorious days of the 80s characters , for the 90-year-old grunge era ( when the supporters of David Wain and Michael Showalter turned the Sketch comedy " The State " for MTV ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 before their stars , such as Elizabeth Banks , Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to major things .	-5.7574
As a cultural artifact , it is also a parody and a embodiment of our Facebook capable era of permanent memory .	-2.7887
But as a franchise it feels like time is running out .	-1.9370
First Day of Camp worked surprisingly well , not only because of its absurd humor ( it contained an original story for a spoken can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .	-3.5221
By sticking to the core of the gag - middle-aged actors play horny children who will grow up - they created the impossible to win back the last part of the joke .	-5.6397
" Ten Years Later " , with his adults now playing adults , is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more according to the candle principle , including a riff to the Stalker movies of the 1990s like " The Hand That Rocks the Cradle " ( " The Hand that swings the cradle " ) .	-6.4865

And there is another crazy plot in the Ronald Reagan ( including Mr. Shower ) , which is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good impression by Michael Ian Black ) .	-3.7877
As always , excursions are the best part of the franchise .	-1.5074
It is especially fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rudd , the Matt Dillon Unterlippenbart of " Singles " , whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old knacker .	-4.3184
They are the moments random madness that could fuel this franchise like a kind of repetitive " Seven Up ! " series until he reaches what I accept as his logical conclusion : " Wet Hot American Summer : Twenty-Years Later " , whose last scene the band will show how to visit the film premiere of " Wet Hot American Summer " .	-4.7606
" Comrade Detective " at Amazon is now reminiscent of a different kind of nostalgia : the revival of the Cold War of " The Americans " , the film " Atomic Blonde " and even " GLOW " with its east-opposite iconography .	-4.2978
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as director indicates that he is a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two policemen as friends , two officers from Bucharest who are fighting for truth , atheism and the path of Marxismus Le.	-4.7264
The main roles - a hard-sounded Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici , whose dialogues are synchronized by Channing Tatum ( also an executive producer ) and Joseph Gordon Levitt in English .	-3.9163
It is a brilliant idea .	-0.6688
But it is not much more than an idea .	-1.1980
There are some nice gags to be seen ( the police spends time watching chess on television , as Americans may do with football ) .	-4.3914
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate , Nick Offerman , Mahershala Ali and Chlo<unk> Sevigny - is a decent game of ' Find the Vote ' .	-3.2776
But Comrade Detective is so committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask is included - that it often plays like a single one .	-3.4446
With six long episodes it is pulling , and comedy is not fast or frequent enough .	-8.2186
" Comrade Detective " , which has been edited for a smaller length , could provide its agitprop satire better , because Gregor and Iosef are always visiting the American Embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men devouring a pile of hamburgers .	-6.3930
The message for the imagined Communist audience is that Western culture can make everything a gelage .	-3.6579

The members of the mafia are accused of organised drug crime , serious acts of violence , attempted murder and of robbery and blackmail .	-4.4114
Since summer 2016 , the Public Prosecutor 's Office has been investigating Konstanz against organised drug trafficking in southern Germany .	-4.0188
There was a great deal of exchange between the prosecutors in Konstanz and Palermo and the investigators of Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .	-3.8294
That is why four Palermo officials accompanied the large-scale operation on Wednesday morning .	-3.5353
In particular , Italian citizens with close links to the Italian mafia were looking at the investigations .	-5.7221
An incident on May 27 in Hüfingen , where several shots were fired in the morning in a restaurant , will also appear on the band 's account .	-4.9733
Wide gaps in the Foreign Register	-2.4593
'Data from citizens who should not appear there ' : according to one report , the Foreign Register in Germany has serious shortcomings .	-4.5515
This leads to partially serious discrepancies in asylum procedures .	-2.7574
According to a media report , the Federal Government ’ s Refugee Management Officer , Frank-Jürgen Weil , drew attention to large gaps in the Central Register .	-4.6076
Defects in the data recorded there could lead to ' partially serious misjudgements ' in asylum procedures and expulsions , warned in an analysis submitted by the ' Southern German newspaper ' .	-6.0067
The register indicates that ten million people have foreign nationality , including some 5.7 million non-EU countries .	-4.2901
The data are therefore managed by some 600 foreign authorities in Germany .	-3.3645
Because the data have not been properly maintained , data quality has not been good in parts up to now .	-3.9263
Data was found in individual cases in 1921 , ' from people who have long since stopped living or from citizens who have become German citizens and who should not actually appear in the register ' .	-5.1791
'Flawed data input can significantly slow return processes ' , the report goes on .	-3.7937
Moreover , statistics on people who are subject to travel are recorded by EU citizens who do not need to leave .	-5.7042
Such false allocations , however , led to a distorted debate on the handling of expatriates , " the analysis says .	-5.4452
Meanwhile , the Federal Government seems to have begun sending refugee families with under 16 children back to Italy once they have arrived .	-4.0161
This is evident from an internal paper by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees ( BAMF ) , reporting the " New Osnabrück Zeitung " .	-4.3790
The paper therefore states that the BAMF is carrying out such procedures ' concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and infant children - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . '	-6.0632
Since the end of 2014 , this has been practically impossible , according to the newspaper referring to the difficult situation on the ground .	-4.1565
Under the Dublin Agreement , refugees are the responsibility of the EU state , which they reach first .	-4.4826
If a migrant travels to another EU country , that state can return him to the country of entry .	-3.6143
As for the explanatory statement , the office now writes : " Meanwhile , absorption capacity for families with underage children in Italy has increased substantially . " in , .	-6.4088
Italy has provided guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families .	-2.5680
Even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECHR ) considers these commitments to be sufficient .	-2.6221
Other EU countries would also send refugees back to Dublin under the Dublin Agreement .	-2.4518
Ulla Jelpke , the left-wing spokesperson for domestic politics in the Bundestag , criticized this decision : " Families with children are threatened by the shortcomings in the Italian asylum system of non-human rights reception conditions and a threat to child welfare " .	-6.6205
A Second Beat Result	-1.6731
A total of 220 litres of blood of people living in Oberrichenbach has already provided blood donation service to other people .	-3.9595
At least the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .	-2.2640
First of all Jürgen Greule , who now shared 50 litres of blood with 100 donations .	-4.2918
Traditionally , the municipality at the meeting of the municipality acknowledges the multiple willingness to donate blood .	-4.3763
" It is brilliant how our body is designed to do this and we give respect to the donors who provide their blood to strangers , and also unselfless , " mayor Karlheinz Kistner pointed out .	-7.4468
" A single donation helps several people , " explained the head of the county of the German Red Cross ( DRC ) , Holger Maisenbacher , because the canned are crushed into their components .	-5.9500
Three people could benefit from donating blood .	-3.3139
At the same time , Maisenbacher reported on the actions undertaken in Oberrichenbach in spring .	-3.2294
" This year , we achieved the second best result with 114 donors , " said the DRK team leader .	-3.5316
Obviously , a few years ago , the switch to the theatre house led to higher numbers .	-3.9520
Before that , Thomas Bockstadt , Susanne Reichle , Sandra Schöck , Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiple donors and were awarded for 50 donations each .	-4.0263
Half as many Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger have lived , while Tamara Prommer , Petra Schleeh , Stefanie Stoll , and Uwe Vetter spent ten times each 500 millilitres of their life .	-4.9866
The Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25 % .	-1.0987
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and inflation weakening have dampened speculation about an increase .	-3.9785
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain " sluggish " when it maintained interest rates on family incomes amid intensifying pressure .	-3.2834
The Bank ’ s Monetary Committee ( MPC ) policymakers voted 6 to 2 to keep interest rates to 0.25 % , with fewer members pushing up this month , as weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase .	-6.2609
In its quarterly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts to 1.7 % in 2017 , and to 1.6 % in 2018 , warning that pressure on household income would continue , with inflation expected to rise to just under 3 % in the autumn .	-3.3683
But it signaled that interest-rate hikes would be needed in the next few years to rein in Brexit-fueled inflation , and it said that borrowing costs might have to rise more than expected in financial markets .	-5.3763
Members also voted to withdraw part of the Mammut stimulus package issued a year after Brexit .	-2.1388
It will call for time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financing for banks from next February , although it has been said that it is now expected to provide GBP 15 billion more under this system - with GBP 115 billion .	-4.9730
Minor minutes after deciding on the interest rate , the Bank said : ' In the MPC ’ s central prognosis , gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak in the short term , as pressure on real household income continues to burden consumption . '	-5.9385
Among interest rates , it reiterated that " a certain tightening of monetary policy " would be needed to cool inflation and a " slightly larger " scale than markets would expect .	-4.4352
Markets are currently predicting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .	-2.0632
The Bank stressed , however , that increases would be ' gradual ' and ' limited ' .	-2.9398
The downward corrected growth projections of the Bank for this and next year are compared to the 1.9 % and 1.7 % forecast in May .	-2.7627
It has kept its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .	-7.5122
The pound fell against the dollar and the euro after these news .	-1.6233
The pound fell by 0.5 % to $ 1.31 and fell by 0.4 % to € 1.11 .	-1.7139
No change comes after the recent disappointing growth figures have dampened rising expectations of an increase in interest rates , and GDP rose from 0.2 % in the second quarter to 0.3 % in the previous three months .	-4.5851
Growth is expected to reach 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will recover slightly towards the end of the year after the bank .	-9.1755
The latest inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and low salary increases , as tightening first becomes worse before it gets better .	-3.8735
She added that monetary policy in the next few years cannot " prevent " income breakdown , " but she added that wages will " clearly " recover at the end of their three-year forecast .	-5.7483
The economy is also strengthened by the rising demand for British goods , owing to the weak pound , which will compensate for some of the lower consumer spending .	-5.6486
The decision comes one year after lowering interest rates to 0.25 % last August , following the shocking EU vote that caused the pound ’ s decline .	-3.0851
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years to fully achieve prices and the economy .	-2.6915
Before the Bank ’ s last judgment on interest rates , the call for an increase in interest rates increased , as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households , with three policymakers demanding an increase to 0.5 % in July .	-4.1424
Inflation fell from 2.9 % last month in June to 2.6 % , even though the Bank said that was expected and that it would resume in the coming months .	-3.9037
The Bank said that exceeding the target of 2 % was " quite " to the weak pound .	-3.6194
Andrew Montlake , director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers , said : " Given the recent decline in the swap rate , the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again , as lenders loudly seek business and want to end the year positively .	-4.4646
The market looks particularly good for those who are phasing out existing deals and completing new mortgages , and many with free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . '	-4.9261
NHS ( The National Health Service ) is said to prescribe 10,000 disputed HIV drug .	-2.8785
From September onwards , after a fight before the High Court against financing the NHS drug , patients will receive access to a " transformative " HIV prevention treatment .	-3.5733
NHS England announced that a pre-sexual predisposition prophylaxis ( PrEP ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 % , is now delivered by the health service through a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people .	-4.8975
He agreed to finance the trial after the Court of Appeal confirmed last year a ruling by the Supreme Court that the NHS had the power to pay for the PrEP despite the claim that local authorities should finance it .	-4.0855
The chess announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England Chairman Simon Stevens as " important new intervention , " while the National Aids Trust ( NATO ) called this a " decisive moment . "	-5.0283
Sexual health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool , and Sheffield will be among the first to enable people to register , and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced to the whole of England in April 2018 .	-3.4333
Preexposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .	-3.1820
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission for infectious persons .	-2.3958
To take prEP before sexual intercourse means that there are enough drugs in a person 's body to prevent HIV infection .	-3.8692
Such medicines can be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse .	-3.2749
Those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men , transsexuals and people with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated .	-2.8762
Clinics identify suitable participants who agree to the study , including men , women , transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment .	-3.2151
People who live in England and are registered with a house doctor can register for a possible participation in their local sex clinic .	-4.3372
The programme will be signed by <unk> 10 million and NHS England a contract to supply the medicines this week following an international competitive procurement .	-3.7154
The study is intended to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence , as used , recorded and implemented on a large scale .	-4.2531
Stevens said : " This great new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .	-2.3194
It is another milestone in the progress that persists over three decades in addressing one of humanity 's greatest health challenges . '	-3.7089
Deborah Gold , Chief Executive of NATO ( National AIDS Trust ) , said : " This is a decisive moment in the fight against HIV .	-1.9946
PrEP , aimed at people in need and at risk , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic .	-3.5726
From September onwards , people with high risk of HIV will have access to this NHS-financed attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is truly controlled individually and not subject to negotiation with a partner , which will improve many , many lives .	-4.6382
We warmly welcome this announcement ' .	-1.0945
Ian Green , Chairman of Terrence Higgins Trust , said : " The priority now has to be that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk to HIV is left behind .	-3.9610
Now that PrEP has been acquired , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 people infected with HIV ' .	-9.7017
Sharon Hodgson , shadow health minister , said : " The start of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delay and hesitation by the government .	-2.9386
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can stop transmitting this life-changing infection .	-3.1614
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of PrEP .	-1.7773
It is now important that this study be carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected with HIV and that it will help us to bring a step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society ' .	-4.6827
Live great life : Between the floor and smart designer tricks have transformed these little Earls Court apartment into a generous home .	-4.2322
Joanne Leigh , a former real estate banker with a passion , diminished in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment .	-2.9378
It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags .	-2.9068
" Before that I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room , " says Joanne .	-2.0472
" I was looking for something comparable to my price .	-1.5127
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings .	-1.9281
I loved them and made an offer on that day ' .	-2.4233
Since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot large apartment has been completely overtaken .	-3.6335
Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne space and an intermediate floor to make the most of the generous ceiling .	-4.7027
" I wanted high ceilings , big windows , lots of light .	-1.4040
That was my requirement ' , she says .	-1.8621
To this end , she commissioned the Architecture and Design Studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development , but also a place to live for Joanne .	-4.3421
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms apart , so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor in which one could stand .	-5.1051
Erfan had to think creative to solve the preset .	-1.8138
" The steel mill is rather complicated , " he says .	-2.8867
" We had to arrange the rooms so they were stacked together without us having to sit down .	-3.7547
It was not just a matter of building a simple platform , but of creating steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . "	-4.7482
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional drama .	-4.3582
A classic copper light window from Retrouvius overlooks the glamorous living area for the downstairs .	-4.5041
Pinched gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style of the program .	-3.0943
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .	-1.6635
A short corridor is mirrored at both ends to allow it to work longer .	-3.4029
In the kitchen the mirroring feels like a window into another room .	-3.0292
There is room for all the bricks and glasses of Joanne at the entrance .	-3.4392
By perceiving a more glamorous room , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen unless it is used .	-3.1976
Cutting together kitchens are nothing new .	-2.9585
What is special about this is that it is a garage door .	-3.1228
" A bit of engineering art went into it , " explains Erfan of the steel reinforced , veneered MDF door .	-3.8859
'It is opposite , so when you push the door , it slides very easily . '	-4.2677
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Joanne could gain an additional 16 m <unk> , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .	-3.4104
" At the end of the day you will sell the base area - or how your property is valued , " says Erfan .	-3.3205
" In a rudimentary form , a real estate agent will enter and calculate based on the ground size " .	-3.9674
Here they have been able to widen the floor while at the same time using high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage .	-5.6092
" The materials are the things you touch and which therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home , " says Erfan .	-3.1804
" You don 't fall in love with the electric sockets in the walls .	-2.3814
They are important , but they do not play with your heart . '	-1.7088
It shows that an apartment can turn from something standard into something quite amazing things through good design and increased square meters .	-4.9792
Indeed , like Joanne , you could decide not to leave it .	-2.3410
Brothers Fight for a USD 500 million Real Estate Imperial	-3.4677
Two brothers find themselves four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty , in a dispute over one of Victoria ’ s largest real estate empires worth more than $ 500 million .	-4.0190
Former director of the ' Carlton-Football Club ' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak , just three doors away from his younger brother Paul , who brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business will be distributed .	-4.7758
Paul has wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp dispute over separation takes place in the Supreme Court .	-3.7466
Together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars since the family bought a business at Smith Street , Collingwood .	-3.8375
The Westco Jeans family founded there and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores .	-2.6581
It was sold for $ 85 million in 1999 .	-1.0359
This money has been invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the city centre , the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller , as well as shopping centres in the suburbs .	-5.3654
According to an agreement with her late father , Colin - described by Paul as " chief operator and dominant personality " in the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of the business wealth and Paul about one-third .	-4.5536
A court act means that Colin owns $ 316 million and Paul worth $ 176 million .	-3.4823
The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .	-2.6779
" The divisions proposed by Colin left him with what I thought were the best objects , " he wrote in 2015 in a first affidavit .	-2.7878
Last Friday , after several failed mediations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place .	-2.1680
The brothers are now also fighting to control the existing business - of which Colin , as Paul claims , has ruled it out .	-4.3504
Colin argues that this is not true , but accuses Paul of incompetent management of some possessions .	-3.5703
In an early affidavit submitted by Colin , he says he hopes to settle the dispute .	-2.3775
" My Italian legacy prescribes that the family is the main priority , " he wrote .	-2.2976
The costs increase in the case , with hundreds of affidavits , e-mails and reports by companies , including dots , pitcher partners and charter Keck Cramer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan Myers , QC , and mutual law firms .	-5.3589
Mrs De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants , who were engaged in dairy bars and delicate shops from the late 1950 ’ s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970 ’ s .	-4.5936
They took advantage of the security to buy the Collingwood property , where Colin opened the first Jean lord of the family .	-4.2793
Colin says that he started Westco when he was " high school in my last years when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) . "	-4.4043
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to hand over their property to their sons .	-2.5444
" Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to go to court , " she wrote .	-2.9266
Two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lutis group , with Colin claiming that Mark was paid $ 10 million and Luke $ 26 million when leaving the company .	-3.3068
Both Lukas and Mark are , according to Paul " have been bittered by the conditions of their financial separation " .	-5.8528
Colin was a former member of the AFL Board and , following a 2015 biography by Eddie McGuire , the best friend of the TV star .	-4.2239
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers .	-1.9042
Only Colin replied by SMS to say " I can 't say much , " because the case is in front of the courts . .	-3.8085
" It is very , very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and to draw our family name through the courts , " he wrote .	-5.9062
In mid-2016 , Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to meet his brother ’ s demands .	-2.3969
" Our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end in our current row , " he said and added that he " still hope for a solution " .	-2.9044
On Friday , that hope seemed over .	-2.0877
" Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future , " wrote Colin .	-1.7472
Trump ’ s new chief of staff is planning to limit the president ’ s media abstinence .	-2.0375
Others tried and failed .	-0.9544
Perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it .	-1.6575
If so , it will be the first .	-0.9993
Politico reports that the White House ’ s new chief of staff is planning to limit the flow of information to President Trump – including news media reports – in the hope of keeping the boss on a more equal course .	-3.5297
Here is a piece of Reporter Josh Dawsey :	-1.1572
" When John F. Kelly , the White House ’ s new chief of staff , met senior officials on his first working day , he presented a major problem in President Donald Trump ’ s White House , which he wanted to repair : bad information that comes into the president ’ s hands .	-4.3987
Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the President would make better decisions if he were given good information . "	-4.3377
Kelly ’ s diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet .	-1.9571
President Trump ’ s relationship with television dates back decades – and now that he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong .	-4.0120
" When Trump candidate was annoyed for unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting of positions to be persuaded , " said former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg in February to Politico .	-5.2032
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that ' the key to keeping Trump ’ s Twitter habit under control is , according to six former campaign officials , to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise . '	-4.2770
Okay .	-1.0169
But the idea that Trump ’ s twitter habit was ever “ under control ” is ridiculous .	-1.8300
Perhaps these campaign officials know something we do not know others - that without their interventions , Trump tweets would have had more fuel .	-4.6684
We will probably never know about the tweets that Trump did not send .	-2.6064
If his staff managed to keep his anger away from him several times , their efforts would have been worthwhile .	-5.5848
But no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump from provoking controversy .	-2.4797
Part of the problem is that people in a White House , composed of competing parties , are repeatedly trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views from the world .	-4.4058
Politico , which deals entirely with this history , reported in May on the preference of advisers to provide the President with dubious information for strategic reasons .	-4.9176
This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher :	-1.2820
" Recent and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press cuts , especially those with damaging leaks , and that he can find out where they come from .	-4.3761
That is what happened at the end of February , when someone maliciously gave the President a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com , the website of Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson , accusing the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh of being the source behind a pile of lecks in the White House .	-5.8904
Although Johnson has been permanently banned from Twitter for harassment , or has offered no concrete evidence , or has voiced and revoked false accusations in the past .	-4.2343
Trump read the article and began to inquire about Walsh staff ' .	-4.7862
Goldmacher added that then-chief of staff , Reence Priebus , and White House Secretary General Rob Porter , " tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper cram Trump receives . "	-4.6681
How did it work ?	-1.2904
Kelly tried to do the same three months later .	-1.6741
Perhaps he will prove more effective than Priebus , but Trump is still his impulsive self , and his advisers are still striving for influence .	-3.4156
These unchanging factors make Kelly ’ s mission very difficult .	-2.0569

Travellers negotiate a gap and return to the Millionaires Series .	-3.1901
Some of the wealthiest house owners of the West Midlands have returned to war with some determined travelers who negotiated a divide drawn by the community to reclaim a field in front of their houses .	-5.8460
Travellers have parked their 20 caravans in a field outside a wealthy street of Solihull called the " Millionaires series " .	-3.6169
They brought horses , babies and an army of transporters with them after they were thrown out in May , but without being deterred by the Council to prevent their inconvenience .	-5.5300
The tactful group found a gap in the defense installations and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unimpeded to find a way .	-4.0914
Killing people have pressured the Solihull Council , which said that it is ' useless to deal with the problem ' .	-5.1818
An anonymous resident said : " They were pulled there on Monday evening after being forwarded by Bentley Heath , where they thrown stones onto the passers-by .	-4.6984
The Council must be forced into action by shame for its implementation , as it was useless to deal with the problem .	-4.0132
Travellers were there in May , were moved further and are now back .	-3.8759
More came yesterday evening , probably today more . '	-2.9803
She added : ' The Burmingham Council knows how to deal with this by holding long instructions to protect its parks .	-3.9409
I live on Streetbrook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my local government if the Council cannot even stop it . '	-3.4024
A resident who did not want to be mentioned said : ' It is ridiculous , we have just seen the last round of those travellers , just to be plundered by another round .	-4.4916
The figures have increased this time and we have even seen a horse in the parking area ' .	-2.8048
A speaker from the Solihull Council said : " We are aware of an unauthorised camp in the country beyond the Streetbrook Road and work with the Solihulls police , taking the necessary legal steps to move forward as soon as possible .	-5.5189
To support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many people as possible report anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101 .	-2.9458
This will help to create a picture of the situation in which the Court must check when we present our case . '	-4.7376

After all , with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof through the then ambience Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on April 13 , 2014 , about 30 000 nights were lost each year and also revenues from the spa tax .	-6.0346
In the autumn of 2014 , with rising numbers of refugees entering the country , the hotel building was offered to the Land Council as a gathering accommodation , giving rise to controversial discussions .	-5.8868
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by drawing up a planning plan to secure the area as a hotel location .	-4.1813
The decision was not uncontroversial in the local council at the time .	-3.9813
Freudenstadt 's Upper Mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and talked at that time about serious stakeholders .	-7.7989
He should be right .	-1.3900
Luisenhotels Group , Managing Director Birgit Scherer , based in Bad Bergzabern , acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three-star plus category under the name of Waldhotel Luise .	-4.5588
The group has four houses with the Freudenstätter Object .	-2.6799
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb .	-1.0714
You are called Hotel Luise , Luisenpark , Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise .	-1.1455
The former Hotel Birkenhof is located in front of the entrance for a long time and when you enter the house , it becomes clear how extensive renovation works are taking place .	-6.8469
The floors were cleared out , blankets were partially removed , old bathtubs were removed from the rooms .	-4.9087
The entire hotel building is a single building .	-1.9110
There is still much to be done by March .	-1.5029
" It is actually a beautiful hotel " , says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper .	-2.7320
Everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style .	-2.6233
The rooms are equipped with large walkable showers , the entrance area is redesigned and new windows are installed .	-4.3060
Everything should later be " nicely citizen-friendly " , as Thomas Scherer says .	-4.9026
'We want to make a gesture about it ' .	-3.0309
The hotel features a swimming pool , spa and meeting room .	-3.1583
Scherer was not able to be positioned at on the in . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .	-8.7970
The Waldhotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to expand , Scherer explains .	-3.8616
Both individual holidaymakers , groups or businessmen should feel at home in the hotel .	-3.2495
He has already held talks with OB Julian Osswald and Tourist Director Michael Krause , Scherer .	-3.6796
The ideas of the city are similar to those of the hotel group .	-3.5490
'We are on the same line ' .	-0.8944
As to the level of investment , Thomas Scherer does not want to be exact .	-4.4447
Nearly a million euros , it calculates .	-3.6455
The outside installations are also brought to the fore , which is already clearly visible .	-5.2920
A large terrace is created in an inner courtyard , which will be accessible by the restaurant , which is open to the public .	-8.5173
Thomas Scherer is optimistic : " Freudenstadt is a good market " .	-1.7689
Russia Affair : US Special Representatives Set Grand Jury	-3.3562
In the Russia affair for US President Donald Trump , special counsel Robert Mueller is said to have set up a so-called Grand Jury after a report .	-3.6119
The body has started work in recent weeks , writing the " Wall Street Journal " on the basis of familiar persons .	-5.4834
The newspaper evaluated the move as a sign that Mueller has expanded and intensified his investigation .	-3.3106
The CNN transmitter reported that there are already initial invitations of the body in connection with a meeting between Trump ’ s oldest son and a Russian lawyer .	-3.4542
US intelligence services have long accused the Kremlin of deliberately interfering in the 2016 presidential election campaign .	-9.0094
Mueller examines whether there were deals between Trump ’ s campaign team and Moscow .	-2.3176
The investigation ’ s focus is on several men who acted in the election campaign as Republican advisor . with . with . . with . . . with . . . . .	-9.3487
According to reports , Mueller also increasingly scrutinized Trump ’ s private and business environment .	-2.3071
A few weeks ago , the Washington Post wrote that the Trump Special Advisor had put himself in the centre and investigated the accusation that the president might have impeded justice during the affair .	-6.3215
The main task of Grand Jurys is to verify and decide whether charges should be made .	-4.8111
Grand Jurys are therefore also called accusations .	-3.3074
In most cases , they are used when there are larger and controversial cases .	-4.1896
The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors .	-1.6086
The panel may also be activated by the prosecutor ’ s office to temporarily invite people to take part in Eid .	-11.0292
According to the CNN transmitter , subpoenas have already been issued that revolve around the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer .	-4.1621
People who were involved in the meeting were invited to say one thing in the report .	-3.9135
They should also provide documents .	-1.1848
In addition to Trump Jr. , Trump ’ s advisers and son-in-law , Jared Kushner , and his then campaign leader Paul Manafort , were in talks .	-4.0803
Legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the appointment showed that Mueller was not intimidated in his work and that he wanted to act quickly if necessary .	-4.4026
However , it must not necessarily be called for the Grand Jury to be switched on at the end to decide on the charges .	-5.7864
Nevertheless , the appointment of the panel is the beginning of a new phase in investigations and a new reason for concern for President Trump .	-3.9509
In the midst of new revelations , the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portray the Russian affair as a campaign of his political opponents .	-2.9933
" Russia 's history is a total invention , " said Trump .	-1.8530
The issue gives democrats a chance to ' feel good , because they have nothing else to talk about ' .	-3.7376
His special adviser , Ty Cobb , stated in an opinion that he did not know anything about setting up a Grand Jury .	-3.5445
However , they also usually work in secret , he stressed .	-4.2699
The White House is in favour of any measures that accelerated the work of the special counsel in a fair manner .	-6.4548
Former FBI chief James Comey said three times that it would not be determined against the president .	-3.0604
There is no reason to believe that this has changed , as stated in the statement .	-3.4286
Mueller , however , was only used after Trump Comey had fired .	-2.9682
Because of this harassment , accusations against Trump had become loud , he wanted to obstruct justice .	-3.8773
Comey said in June before a Senate Committee that Trump asked him to stop investigating the then national security adviser Michael Flynn .	-3.6868
The President is under great pressure for this investigation .	-2.5257
After depicting US media , the White House collected material against the Special Advisor and his employees .	-3.5320
The speculation about whether Trump wants to sack Mueller .	-3.3117
Unlike an independent Congressional Special Rapporteur , such as the Watergate affair around the later resigned President Richard Nixon , Mueller has a position in which he could , in theory , be fired by the Ministry of Justice at the behest of the President .	-4.7423
Several senators from both parties want to prevent such a move .	-2.2671
Two groups of Republican and Democratic Senators put forward legislative proposals on Thursday that the special counsel could no longer be dismissed as easily as possible .	-10.9099
Antarctica : Gigantic Iceberg Drives in Antarctica	-3.1331
In the West Antarctic , a gigantic iceberg has dissolved from the Schelfeis , close to seven times the size of Berlin .	-5.3720
This was announced by the Bremerhavener Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .	-2.9064
The more than one trillion tons of heavy and 5800 square kilometres now drive north and will probably take two or three years to melt .	-4.7192
It has 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres is one of the biggest ice giants that researchers have registered over the past three decades .	-4.4276
A threat to humans does not come from it .	-3.7206
According to research , the extent to which climate change has played a role in the iceberg ’ s breakdown is unclear .	-3.9416
In total , however , there has been a series of unusual collapses of ice shelves in the region for some 30 years , the US Research Centre for Snow and Ice ( NSIDC ) writes on a factual background .	-5.2682
According to many researchers , this can be linked to global warming .	-2.3550
The now abandoned Coloss was a part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis .	-4.0287
Schelfeis sweeps on the sea and is fed by large glaciers .	-4.0030
It therefore continues to grow into the sea and regularly breaks down .	-3.8792
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is is located in the south of South America , close to the top of the Antarctic Peninsula .	-7.1201
Northern this sleepy was disturbed the balance of growth and abortion a few years ago .	-4.5774
AWI researcher Daniela Jansen writes that a complete shelf party had collapsed there .	-4.9748
There is some evidence that the Larsen C-Schelfeis is also in danger , because the front edge has never withdrawn as far as it is today .	-5.4968
Moreover , the ice plate is under tension and can collapse if a piece of ice breaks down at a key point .	-5.2409
The melting of the Schelfeis and the iceberg does not increase the sea level , as it swims on the water and displays ice as much water as it results after melting itself .	-6.0590
The loss of the horseshoe , however , leads to glaciers flowing directly into the sea and leaving much faster than before .	-6.3388
This may increase sea levels , but to a small extent , the UK ’ s research project to observe the Antarctic ( Midas ) .	-4.7615
According to AWI data , Larsen-C-Schelfeis is Antarctica ’ s fourth largest shelf event , with almost 50 000 square kilometres .	-5.9971
At the crossing from the mainland it is 700 meters thick , on the edge to the free ocean , about 200 metres .	-9.8644
There it regularly breaks down .	-2.3092
" Although it is a natural phenomenon and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change , the ice shield is now in a more vulnerable position , " said Martin O 'Leary of British Swansea University .	-4.9220
" This is the most extensive withdrawal since the beginning of the records , " he also confirmed .	-2.9203
Scientists should be contested as to whether the Larsen-C-Schelfeis will grow again or go back in the long term and possibly collapse , Mr Luckman said , ' Our models say that it will be less stable ' .	-6.4199
But this will take decades .	-1.8400
Even if these researchers do not attribute the breakdown of this gigantic iceberg to climate change , many ice shelves in the Antarctic Peninsula have disappeared in recent decades .	-4.7086
This long tip of Antarctica stretches towards South America .	-3.3548
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey research programme , the Ice Area of the Antarctic Peninsula has fallen by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s .	-3.2102
Temperature has contributed to the decline .	-1.9135
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed about three degrees over the last 50 years , one of the areas where the temperature rises most rapidly .	-4.5551
CDU wants staffing fees	-3.7586
Because it is becoming more and more difficult to occupy vacancies , the CDU is demanding that it leave the employers ' association in order to become more attractive .	-4.8420
Only just before the summer break did the Kreistag attract 41 new posts in the administration .	-4.1783
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann .	-2.0519
17 trainees are now behind their first working day .	-2.8197
The teaching centres at the circle are obviously very keen .	-5.0263
Around 620 applications for the places to be awarded this year .	-3.7309
Nevertheless , the circle still lacks staff in order to be able to meet increased requirements and tasks .	-4.7472
Currently , there are still 50 job vacancies unoccupied by Mettmann circ.	-3.9090
Among other things , doctors and engineers are required , as well as general .	-4.8391
The CDU , together with the FDP and the UWG , wants to take the initiative in Kreistag and counter the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .	-5.0086
According to the wishes of the parties , the administration is to develop a concept for personnel recruitment and development .	-11.4913
The aim is not only to meet short-term requirements for skilled workers , but also to counteract the shortage of candidates for the future , it says .	-4.7294
The overall concept should be internally and externally , show concrete measures for cross-beginners and include an educational offensive , calls for CDU , FDP and UWG .	-4.8311
That sounds like a good approach .	-1.4271
The circle is dealing with staffing problems , which we previously did not know .	-5.3870
Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .	-3.0210
We are talking about genuine ' competition between public employers ' .	-1.9447
In addition , a large number of employees leaving the service due to illness or age .	-4.5194
So the best time to act is to avoid more jobs being vacant .	-5.0487
But Klaus-Dieter Peoples , the CDU group leader , goes beyond the joint motion with his party .	-4.1656
He recently gave rise to a fisting surprise when he publicly questioned the cover for human resources and stunned the other parties .	-7.0020
People would like to see all possible ways of leaving the municipal employers ' association reviewed .	-5.5797
" If we do not reach a satisfactory solution here in the short term , then the county administration with the trade unions should strive for a house rate , perhaps in cooperation with the county cities , " says peoples .	-7.1554
In this way , the CDU is trying to pay employees and officials better than the public service tariff system actually provides .	-5.4732
The salaries are currently exact , there are increases or more money only if you change to a higher level oriented to professional years .	-5.3346
But the circle ’ s tasks have grown ever more in recent years . has been a .	-3.9903
Only a few weeks ago , new spaces had to be set up to deal with the provisions of the new Prostitution Protection Act .	-3.8023
Not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers , Country Thomas Hendele and County Director Martin Richter have a problem : they have too few staff .	-4.0414
Italy ’ s Fight for NGO Migrants Boats	-3.9273
Italy has warned NGOs using Mediterranean rescue boats that they must not continue to do so unless they abide by new rules for their operations .	-3.2907
" If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , " said Minister Marco Minniti , Interior Minister , in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa .	-3.8875
Minnitis 's warning came a day after the Italian authorities had seized a boat from the German aid organisation ' Youth Rettet ' , because their team had effectively cooperated with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration .	-4.2167
The aid organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to give its opinion on detailed allegations by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio .	-4.2172
" For us , saving human life is and remains our top priority , so we are very sorry that at the moment we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone , " said the organization in an opinion on social media .	-4.6669
'We can only judge all the allegations being made at the moment after we have gathered all the information and can assess the situation ' .	-4.6011
The Italian authorities have been monitoring the Youth Rescue boat , the Iuventa .	-3.2360
It is suspected that his crew will take hook boat migrants on board , delivered directly to them by human traffickers , and that smugglers can depart so that ships can be used again .	-5.5331
At least this meeting was supposedly only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the act of the Public Prosecutor whose contents were published by Italian media .	-3.8782
The occupation is suspected of ignoring the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , which monitors rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons , not for any other motive .	-4.4768
Under the Code of Conduct , boats such as the Iuventa must , above all , have an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities .	-7.0863
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to keep to the code : Save the Children , MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain .	-2.1830
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable , because they would not bring with them ' substantial changes or disabilities ' of their bailouts .	-4.3328
Among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel laureate organisation is doctors without frontiers ( MSF ) .	-2.6182
Minniti has now said that the number of migrants arriving after the rescue operations in Italy has fallen sharply in recent weeks , suggesting that efforts to strengthen Libyan coastguard and cooperate with local mayors have borne fruit .	-4.0448
" In the last few days we have begun to see the light at the end of the tunnel , " said the Minister .	-2.2977
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in the hope of achieving Europe .	-3.0764
Raising and Trials	-2.0990
Nine Weiler bikers , the " Berlin Outer Posten " and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the North Pfalz for four days to enjoy trials and sights .	-4.4163
Three friendly guides were available for this purpose .	-2.4390
The accommodation in the Wachenheimer valley proved to be a good starting point for tours .	-3.5234
The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra .	-2.0123
In hot summer temperatures along the vineyards , the first tour led to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim .	-8.7142
This was followed by viewpoints , partly on towers , from which you could see far above the Palatinate Forest and the plains above .	-7.2865
In between , there were always longer increases , for which long trials were rewarded .	-3.6821
On the second day , after Bad Dürkheim it went to the saline and to the folklore sausage market .	-7.3725
Again it was a viewpoint connected by " flowing " trials and moderate increases .	-3.6143
On the last two days , many metres of altitude were said again .	-4.1039
Caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and huts brought welcome breaks .	-3.0864
In Bad Dürkheim , the bikers in the open-air inhalatorium breathe healing soles .	-4.2582
New city was also under control .	-3.0555
After 173 kilometres and almost 4500 metres of altitude , the group had learnt the Palatinate forest from its best sporting and cultural site .	-5.0861
Konsole instead of Rasen - Bundesliga equips itself for e-Sport .	-3.8953
Are the sports stars in the future sitting in front of computer consoles instead of fighting through in wind and weather over the stadium grass ?	-5.6643
Fact is : E-Sport has long since become a serious industry , a lucrative business - great stars , millions of fans and huge high gear tournaments including .	-4.0491
The first Bundesliga to become increasingly involved in this area have recognised this .	-4.9733
In 2015 the VfL Wolfsburg started , later the FC Schalke 04 followed , and most recently the VfB Stuttgart , which founded an e-sports department in mid-July and signed a contract with two professionals for the FIFA 17 computer game .	-11.9018
" We hope to inspire new young target groups for the VfB in this way , " says Managing Director Jochen Röttger.	-4.0458
He is sure that " many clubs will climb up this turn " .	-3.5714
Next weekend , the FIFA World Football Association in London will be organising the first Interactive Club World Cup in which the gamers of different clubs compete .	-4.8647
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint-Germain or the PSV Eindhoven qualified .	-2.6932
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sport .	-1.5988
The ex-trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players .	-2.4372
" Real soccer has to deal with the 14 to 30 year-olds , in particular , that young people will continue to go to the stadium in the future , " says the 52-year-old .	-6.1803
And : the clubs tried to conquer all kinds of markets , especially the Asian ones .	-2.5397
With prominent e-sportsmen under contract , you could have a presence in these markets online far more than just sending the Bundesliga team to Asia once a year .	-5.3063
What exactly is at issue here ?	-1.4840
In e-Sport , computer games such as " League of Legends " , " Dota 2 " , " Counterstrike " or even the FIFA football simulation are presented at competitive level .	-4.7789
Long ago , as in normal sport , leagues have established themselves in which the professionals compete against each other .	-4.2075
And during the 2022 Asian Games , e-Sport is already part of the official program .	-2.5236
But is it really a sport ?	-1.8973
Many people certainly need the idea to be used .	-3.1848
Ingo Frobsil , too , has been a long supporter of the issue .	-4.8756
E-Sport is a sports professor at the German Sports School in Cologne , because it is competent and has many biological and physical reactions that can be found in classical sport - for example , increased heart frequencies , stress reactions , hormonal changes .	-6.4630
It also requires cognitive skills , technical and tactical understanding , and rapid response capabilities .	-3.4678
Professional gamers should not only train on the console , but also train their bodies and focus on nutrition .	-4.1233
" Fitte player is a good player . "	-2.4250
Frobei also sees problems : " Doping is becoming more and more a topic " .	-4.0865
Controls are hard to implement in online games , and the scene lacked classical sports structures .	-4.1736
The scientist positively emphasises the high integrative effect of e-sport .	-3.5309
Players are on the international road , like a large global family , there are no intercultural barriers .	-3.3509
A study by the Deloitte Group and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software ( BIU ) predicts rapid growth in e-Sport .	-4.1560
In 2016 , Germany had implemented EUR 50 million , mainly through advertising , sponsorship and major tournaments .	-3.5169
Sales is expected to reach 130 million in three years .	-2.2633
That is not true of the EUR 2.4 billion of the football bond league .	-4.0146
However , " E-Sport " is no longer far from other established sports such as handball , basketball or ice hockey " , the Deloitte consultants write .	-3.9100
Many countries have gone further internationally .	-2.1295
Big markets are Asia and the USA , where ex-basketball players Shaquille O<unk>Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez participate in the US Team NRG eSports .	-2.4890
Hollywood Schauspieler Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSport-betting provider Unikrn .	-2.8693
There are things that are happening in Europe too . . . . . . . . . . . . .	-6.4332
In a Norwegian school e-sport was introduced as a teaching centre , says Frobbly .	-4.9883
In the Netherlands and France , the football first-class clubs , according to Dutt , are now obliged to set up an e-sports department .	-4.3568
" By European comparison Germany is lagging behind , " says VfB Executive Board Röttgermann .	-3.1951
Feeling in nostalgia only and dissolving the old times is no longer enough .	-4.6928
The aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but at the same time to align the company with the modern market .	-3.9541
" We live in a digitized world , " says Dutt .	-2.0950
" You cannot say that only football is the only thing that it has always been " .	-5.5881

Michelle Carter has condemned the texts pushing Conrad Roy into suicide .	-2.8134
A Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls for suicide .	-2.3213
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her sentence behind bars and five years have been suspended on trial .	-2.5936
Carter was sentenced in June for negligent killing of Conrad Roy , who died on 13 July 2014 .	-2.1595
The father of Roy said at the hearing on Thursday : " My family is untrusted .	-2.7090
My son was my best friend . "	-1.0135
Carter was allowed to remain free until his appeal .	-2.9721
She had been confronted with a maximum sentence of 20 years , but her lawyers argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from mental illness .	-6.1533
Carter was dressed in red trousers and a cream-coloured blouse , with tears in the eyes , with faded hands and looking downwards when she was sentenced .	-6.5973
" Your actions have killed Conrad Roy , " the prosecutor told the court .	-2.9248
" They ended their lives to make their own better .	-2.6050
She has not assumed responsibility , " she said .	-2.1984
'It showed no respect ' .	-2.9352
But Carter 's lawyer said it was a ' terrible circumstance , which she deplores . '	-4.5895
Judge Lawrence Moniz said , however , that he did not find out that their ' age or maturity or even their mental illness have a significant influence on their actions ' .	-4.0283
A Public Prosecutor read a statement by Roy 's mother Lynn Roy saying that " there is no day when I am not entrusted with the loss of my beloved son .	-4.0006
I want him to be proud of me and , as I have done with everything , I try to be there for his sisters despite all the pain I will bear for eternity , " says it .	-6.6188
Roy 's sister , Camdyn Roy , said that she would be " pursued " by the recognition that she would never participate in the wedding of her brother or be an aunt for his children .	-4.2704
" No longer having this only person I have been with since my birth every day is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , " she said .	-4.0529
The case seems to set a legal precedent , because there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide .	-2.7076
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014 .	-1.8871
The case attracted national attention following Carter ’ s revelation that he had encouraged him to end his life .	-3.2769
" If you look , jump from a building , fire yourself , I do not know there are many ways , " she said in several messages that she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on holiday with his family .	-4.6549
In the moments before his suicide she wrote : " You must do it , Conrad " and " Everything you need to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy . "	-3.7660
Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention through the death of Roy and ordered that she benefit from the case through any press .	-3.6727
The case shared the legal opinion .	-1.9866
One of the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox , who was convicted in 2007 for murder of her British fellow citizen in Italy before being released two years ago .	-4.5333
In Los Angeles Times , Mrs Knox , 30 years old , made a comment : ' Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not prison ' .	-2.7451
Joshua Kimmy : Learning from FC Bavaria ’ s New Mini Lahm	-2.5943
The fact that Joshua Kimmy was allowed to run up as a captain at the Audi Cup is no coincidence .	-3.6186
The FC Bavaria dares the Confed Cup winner a great season - extra motivation doesn 't hurt .	-4.2748
Something was different in his cabin place , that saw Joshua Kimmy immediately , even though the additional clothing was very , very small .	-5.0570
But since the second day of the Audi Cup was not a Philipp Lahm or a Manuel Neuer , he made his tie to the arm .	-5.5322
" The trainer did not announce it , " the Confed Cup winner told afterwards , after his first assignment as Bavarian Captain .	-3.9207
Well , the state could have run better than at 0 : 2 against the SSC Naples .	-3.6611
But Kimmy could interpret the sign of the coach as well .	-3.3736
Not the eight years old Arturo Vidal had been chosen as the leader of the C-Elf in the team of young players , debutants , and just out of the holiday professional , but rather he .	-6.9750
Suckerl is better distributed to those who are much trusted to have a mood .	-6.4753
So if you chose to approach the legacy of Lahm , you can only use a small extra motivation .	-4.6300
Kimmy confirmed : " This is what you want to take responsibility as a player .	-3.8974
On Wednesday , the 22-year-old flirted as a mini-lamb over the field .	-3.0103
To the right , that is now its position , the white bind on the arm did its rest .	-4.9391
And Kimmy actually felt like that in this start-up information he could best take the rod over .	-8.6742
He gave instructions to try to steer the unseen force .	-3.2839
He looked at the whole , while many others were self-employed .	-3.8917
Vidal was able to overcome his lack of fitness ( did not work ) ; Renato Sanches was trying to tie up on the devil to the performances of Asia ’ s journey ( though limited ) ; and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle were not negative in their first appearance in the Bavarian Trikot .	-10.2462
The staff were very friendly and helpful .	-4.6346
Sule ran on Kimmy , Rudy before the defense , both acting sovereign .	-5.0494
The prestigious Napoli storm often did hard , and swells also tried several times successfully in the game building .	-7.9712
His colleague Mr Rudy admitted that the result was ' not as we hoped it would ' .	-3.1044
But he also performed well in the debut .	-2.9373
Play relocation , Tempowechsel : " For this style I was also taken " .	-6.4936
How unfamiliar this Bavarian world is for the new entrants was after the match .	-5.2249
Rudy , for example , did not give one or two interviews in the catacombs , but certainly gave six or seven interviews .	-3.3135
Kimmy passed away after a few brief testimonies in the back of his new players .	-12.2262
There he heard an interesting sentence from Süle : " What happens here I have noticed .	-4.7939
At Bavaria you just have to win any game " .	-2.4917
After all , he does not have to teach the new .	-2.9380

Companies satisfied with Rheinland-Palatinate Minister : Economics praises Wissings Tempo .	-3.3771
It was often unconventional , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when Eveline Lemke ( Green ) was still Minister for the Economy of Rhineland-Palatinate .	-4.2629
This is evident after more than a year when the new Minister for Economic Affairs , Volker Wissing ( FDP ) , is in office .	-3.1626
Chambers and companies from the region speak on T V request of a change in economic policy - and at the same time they pitch the old minister .	-6.2395
Frank Natus , Chairman of the Association of Trier Companies ( VTU ) , says : " Wissing takes up the wishes of the economy that Lemke has all blocked . "	-3.8010
Natus sees the biggest turnaround in infrastructure policy : the gap between Kelberg and Adenau is now high on the country ’ s list of priorities .	-9.2430
This year , the Ministry hopes to have a planning process until 2021 .	-4.2837
A role in the country ’ s plans is also played by the West circumvention of Trier , which is the primary necessity of the Federal Transport Road Plan .	-6.1336
The aim is to start the route in December 2020 , says Minister Cornelia Holtmann .	-3.3102
Natus sees this as a signpost to support regional , but internationally competitive , companies .	-4.1381
The Chamber of Commerce ( IHK ) Trier , as suggested by Wissing , is striving for a Rhineland-Palatinate label to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports , which have lapsed for ten years .	-5.0964
Moreover , Wissing has an open ear for people who want to create their own company praises the IHK .	-3.2419
The craftsman Trier sees in the new master bonus an additional incentive for young trainees , says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach .	-3.7083
A premium of EUR 1000 is planned for the existing master examination and EUR 2500 , when graduates become self-employed within ten years of master training .	-6.3440
However , the domestic list for the country remains long .	-3.0367
The planned building of the roads is quick to create facts , but at the same time it lacks the necessary staff , says Jan Glockauer , head of the IHK Trier .	-6.7061
Of 56 new engineers who want to stop Wissing from nationwide mobility , only 29 have been occupied .	-5.7653
The IHK calls for more orders to be made to external offices .	-3.1916
CDU Group vize Christian Baldauf points to calculations by the Court of Auditors that the country is investing more than EUR 20 million less in the preservation of national roads than proposed in 2017 and 2018 .	-5.2453
Frank Natus also expects a country ’ s concept to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region .	-3.5873
What is also sobering is the existing broadband construction in the country .	-4.9214
In 2016 , in an IHK survey , regional companies had only valued 3.4 on the network supply .	-10.4872
They complained about stalling Internet connections and breakdowns .	-3.4822
On the other hand , former Minister for Economic Affairs Eveline Lemke is currently out of politics and is still in the Supervisory Board of the wind power company Pro Wind .	-5.2163
The Green Group left Lemke in April to become President of a private college in Karlsruhe , where , after four months of disagreement , she again allowed the field .	-5.3963
Audi is said to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers are facing a backlash .	-3.2472
One day before Audi announced , BMW said that it would offer to upgrade the software to more than 350,000 vehicles .	-2.2925
The BMW chairman said that the company believes that ' there are smarter options as restrictions on driving ' , and thus referred to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - to ban or limit diesel vehicles .	-4.9188
On Tuesday , Daimler announced that there would be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe modified to reduce its diesel emissions .	-3.0323
None of the companies described it as a call back .	-3.4839
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules on carbon dioxide emissions .	-2.8192
But the nitrogen oxides emitting diesel engines are considered carcinogens and may cause asthma .	-3.0991
The costs for car manufacturers to install systems to neutralise the emissions from diesel cars are also increasing , which makes it difficult to keep car prices competitive .	-4.7479
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also charged with nurturing powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem .	-3.2071
Companies are trying to avoid the mistakes made by Volkswagen , which could regulate emissions in order to comply with the rules when a car was tested but returns in normal driving conditions .	-4.6508
In the United States several people have been charged with Volkswagen and others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic .	-3.3847
Last month , the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .	-2.1948
The former manager , Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio , is an Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be tried in the United States .	-2.6153
Earlier this year , Audi was incorporated into German criminal investigations at Volkswagen , after the Audi authorities accused of having installed a system to circumvent European emission regulations , and a question focused on the United States was extended .	-5.0729
Including Audi in the investigation could place a heavy burden on Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to the profits of Volkswagen .	-4.1823
This Message Has the Flow on Saturday ’ s Isar	-3.1513
The city wants to protect the Isar .	-1.5560
Tomorrow , Munich will be taking the Isar visitors with them , which has a special message .	-7.8547
If on Saturday it is again drawn to the Isar , there will be a large float between the Flaucher and Reichenbachbrücke .	-5.7465
And this is not a common flow , with isar tourists .	-3.4598
We want to educate our visitors .	-6.4753
On the float you can see a big infotrant .	-4.4583
It shows a rubbish mountain .	-1.7954
The prelude to a public relations campaign to appeal to Isar visitors .	-2.1390
The motto " True Love is ... " is to sharpen understanding of Isar as a protective wild flow .	-5.0642
As early as last summer , Isar and this year too , there are other actions and measures to achieve prudent and environmentally aware behaviour .	-6.4988
Mordillo 's Knollen Nases and Laughter Against Paganism	-5.0946
Mordillo was temporarily one of the most published Cartoon drawers , the nose of his figures are his trademark .	-4.0138
The Argentine also paints 85 and works on a film .	-3.7679
His message : laugh , ' because there is too much suffering in the world ' .	-1.5673
Guillermo Mordillo was born on August 4 , 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in BuenAires .	-6.1459
In the early years as an artist , he beat himself among other things as a drawer for greeting cards - which frustrated him .	-4.7517
" The happiest day in my professional life was the day when my job lost , " he once said .	-1.5381
After stations in Lima , New York and Paris , he succeeded in breakthrough in the late 1960s : with the publication of his cartoons in " Paris Match " and then in " Stern " and other leading magazines around the world .	-5.0657
Even in China Mordillo found many fans .	-1.7616
Again and again the artist was inspired by cities .	-3.1706
Large , rounded Mordillo figures tumble in drawings with the Schiefen Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .	-3.9755
In the early morning , according to his own data , he is still sitting at the drawing table today , working almost ten hours every day .	-5.3107
Via calendars , puzzles , books for children and adults , T-shirts , plush animals and watches , his drulling figures continue to be widely distributed worldwide .	-10.9482
He has been working on a cartoon film and a TV series with his figures for six years .	-3.8909
The main person in the movie " Crazy Island " is a Giraffe - Mordillos 's most popular animal in his drawings - which has a thousand pets as an opponent .	-4.5858
For the first time , his figures speak in the 3D film , which is to come to the cinema screen in 2019 .	-4.6311
" I do not know exactly what they will say , it is strange for me , " says Mordillo .	-1.8759
The script is not written by him .	-1.2389
That 's why he 's focusing on the TV series , which , like its original drawings , is worthless .	-5.6843
The Provence of Climate Change	-2.4137
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .	-2.3352
The lavender is declining due to drought conditions and insects transferred because of diseases , causing great headaches to scientists and farmers trying to find solutions .	-4.9323
Eric Chaisse , expert of the CRIEPPAM agricultural research institute in Provence , said : " The lavender in the Provence is effectively at risk because the plant has been exposed in recent years to the effects of climate change , which brought much less rain in spring and much more in autumn .	-4.7872
This has an impact on the life of Lavendel .	-9.1696
There is also a small cicade , a microbacterium that transmits dwarfs , and in very dry weather there are many of them . '	-3.7409
The stakes are high .	-0.9899
Lavend oil not only attracts tourists , but also perfume and cosmetics .	-4.7607
Eric Chaisse said : " Instead of having very long plant oils with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , underdeveloped and either missing or weakened .	-2.6928
So we have fewer parts with essential oil . '	-1.8334
Solutions that are considered include better water distribution and the slowdown of soil evaporation , as well as plant spraying with a protective mix of tone and water and developing varieties that are more resistant to drying .	-5.1929
The town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhön celebrates its 1200 years of existence .	-3.1240

The murder of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico	-2.1400
The workers of the Riodoce weekly newspaper usually meet on Wednesday to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the State of Sinaloa through organised crime , corrupt officials , and intercessive drug wars .	-5.0690
But on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .	-1.9122
They were told that it is important to change their routines .	-2.1235
Two high-level journalists are discussing what feels safer : they should take their children to the office , who were the target of a granate attack in 2009 , or leave them at home .	-5.3513
Security experts have written three words on a table on the front of the room : opponents , neutral , allies .	-2.7037
You ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary , your perceptions and your feelings are sufficient .	-4.1354
There are drug smugglers , politicians , businessmen , journalists suspected of being on the government ’ s salary list or cartels , a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .	-3.6181
There is no rest break from violence , and while corpses are mounting throughout the country , more and more journalists are taking office : at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012 , 589 after attacks and threats under federal protection , and so far , there have been at least seven deaths in seven states this year .	-5.7607
Among the latter is their editor and inspiration of Riodoce , co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas .	-3.7624
" The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , " Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on drug violence .	-2.7176
His absence is deeply felt , although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez , showing his middle-class finger with the word " justice " , hangs at the facade of the Riodoce building .	-6.0811
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the reporters discuss their divided topics , the trauma , their nightmares , sleep , paranoia .	-5.4010
Although a special Bond Attorney was set up in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists , it has only initiated two criminal proceedings , according to the Committee on Journalists .	-5.1332
As with most of the thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organised crime every year , journalists ' murderers are rarely brought to justice .	-2.9389
At Riodoce , they still insist on treating Sinaloa ’ s violence , despite being indifferent and even though the terrain is now more treacherous .	-4.9872
Without information about the murderers , without justice , the meeting to discuss security has little use , Ibarra says .	-3.1834
" It 's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , " he says .	-1.4810
'So long as we do not know why , let us all distrust . '	-3.3147
In the morning of May 15th , Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the provincial capital of Culiacan .	-10.4609
He managed to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men .	-4.6292
The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .	-4.1123
Valdez was 50 years old .	-0.8389
He left a woman and two adult children .	-0.9164
Rumours tend to lie around in Culiacan freely .	-2.2782
But on the subject of Valdez , there is virtually nothing but silence .	-2.4427
Since Guzman ’ s arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January , Sinaloa has become one of the country ’ s bloodiest battlefields , as rival groups are fighting here to fill the vacuum .	-2.6729
There is no point in Sinaloa shooting someone or more people on the street every day , or in the cemetery full of ornated two-story mausoleums for drug-kings who are larger than many homes for the living .	-6.4041
Forget for one minute that there is a state of " peace " when only one cartel has control of the coastal state with its precious ports and drug-trading routes to the United States .	-5.6534
Nevertheless , despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work , Ismail Bojorquez ( 60 ) , a co-founder and director of Riodoce , has broken down with the blame that he could not protect his friend .	-3.8059
He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder .	-1.4336
First , in February , there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez , a leader of one of the rival cartel factions in the war with Guzman ’ s sons .	-2.7693
This release may have upset the sons , suspected gang members bought each copy of the issue once it was delivered to newspaper kiosks .	-3.9235
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for their own security following the confiscation of another newspaper that published the same history .	-3.3691
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .	-1.9329
He had survived for so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there .	-2.1151
He served as an experienced Noroeste reporter in 2003 , when he joined together with five colleagues to set up Riodoce and sold USD 50 holdings .	-5.1379
In Sinaloa , " it was impossible to run journalism without encountering the drug problem , " said Bojorquez .	-2.4349
Over time , the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .	-7.8657
Reporters loved being able to publish hard fierce investigations without fear of censorship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one dared to treat .	-4.3631
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce , she received the prestigious " Maria-Moors Cabot Prize " for her reporting in Latin America .	-5.5178
In the same year , Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in persecuting Mexican drug history , wherever it led .	-3.3324
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid .	-0.7482
" I want to live " , he said at the time of the CPJ award .	-2.1244
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa " is a way of life , " he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV .	-2.1763
" You have to take on the job you are doing as a journalist - either you do that or you play the stupid .	-5.2487
I do not want to be asked : ' What did you do in the face of so many dead ... why did you not say what was going on ? '	-3.2089
The Riodoce team misses Valdez , the fun bird that could curse like a port worker , the friend who was generous with embarrassment and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .	-4.6020
They trusted on his routine .	-2.5615
He would always be worried .	-5.1191
He would always go to El Guayabo , the bar opposite the office , and always sit at the same table .	-2.6410
Now they ask : was his love of routine his corrupt ?	-2.8983
His death has also forced them to question their own assumptions about how best they can do their work and remain alive .	-3.3293
" You don 't like it when you look at their women , their children , their clean shops , their hidden runways , " to get drugs .	-5.4443
" These things were not allowed , " said Bojorquez .	-1.5126
The result , even in the best times , is a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation .	-2.2285
Trust your own instincts .	-0.7624
If it smells incorrectly , stop there .	-2.8058
The trouble is , the editor of Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that ' smell a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing happened with Javier ' .	-4.0889
The old rules , as he and others say , no longer apply in Sinaloa - just as they are in Tamaulipa , Veracruz , Guerrero , and other states where a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes , weak institutions , and corrupt government officials is at home .	-4.1394
The landscape is constantly changing .	-1.1286
In the space where Riodoce ’ s employees met for security training , mobile phones were suddenly not allowed , and days before it became known that spyware sold exclusively to governments was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .	-5.3949
Outside , two policemen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 <unk> C ) in the shade of a tree .	-2.3692
They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a quadruple building in a middle class neighborhood of Culiacan . was .	-10.4130
Half in joke , some of the reporters wondered whether these officers were among the 50 % of the policemen who the governor himself described as untrustworthy .	-3.7890
It is months since the reporters entered the mountain landscape , where the drug gangs are de facto under control .	-3.5423
For this week , Riodoce has posted on three main stories .	-3.6963
There was the murder of the brother of the former famous Boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa .	-2.6778
They also had an exposé to government spending focused on the governor ’ s home town .	-3.0831
And there was a group that carried out abduction in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan , a block from the office of the prosecutor .	-3.1842
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or what happened , so caution was required when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favourite place for drug dealers and authorities .	-3.7399
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belongs to the governing Institutional Revolution Party ( PRI ) , which dominated almost all political levels in the entire century .	-4.8026
Recently , several PRI governors have been accused of corruption for high-profile cases .	-3.2495
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this place , including one in which a son of " El Chapo " Guzman escaped a military attack .	-3.3856
Only a few months earlier , readers had seen the Valdez column as the most informed source of abduction .	-3.9488
" In the past we knew what happened , " said Villarreal , 46 , the nickname " El Flaco " because of its slim body status .	-3.9050
'Now all channels of communication have broken with our sources ' .	-1.9982
The office of Valdez has become a storage space for characters and stickers protesting against the murders of journalists , because staff have become something they would never have expected : activists on behalf of the press .	-5.6304
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few characters and next morning went to a demonstration for another journalist to the office of the Public Prosecutor .	-3.4050
Salvador Adam disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed , in the western state of Michoacan .	-2.2127
A burned body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests that it is .	-2.3764
Journalists have become louder throughout the country by writing in organized protests " SOS Press " on walks and buildings .	-3.4070
On that day , the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and is trying to gain international support for the judiciary in the Valdez case .	-3.7830
At a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa the day after the assassination of Valdez , Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on and killing journalists because they told the truth .	-3.3202
She has since asked for it to be re-divided by the government , because it is concerned that its anger has violated its objectivity .	-4.0598
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are " surrounded " by organised crime , government officials involved , and an indifferent society .	-3.2181
In his last book " Narco Journalism " , he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs , but also ordered by politicians and security forces under one cover with organised crime .	-4.4426
The Articulo 19 media watchdog group assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists from the police and officials last year .	-4.6359
" In Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth , " said Ramirez .	-2.6396
Obviously , the murders have a deterrent effect .	-2.0913
Nobody forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago .	-2.5801
Her body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Zeta cartel : ' I am here for my reports ' .	-3.2997
A computer keyboard and headphones beside their separated head .	-2.0091
Some branches have chosen to close , like the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the assassination of Miroslava Breach in March .	-2.3875
Others continue , as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of her director in 2004 .	-2.4172
In 2010 , the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the Drug Cartels with a editorial on the title page entitled " What do you want from us ? " .	-4.5340
Some journalists have fled their home states , or even from the country .	-3.0699
It is a painful decision .	-0.9224
It is difficult to find work in exile , and they are still watching the streets and looking for dangers .	-2.2880
And sometimes they are hunted , as seems to be the photographer Ruben Espinosa , who was murdered in 2015 , along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City , three months after the flight from Veracruz .	-3.7460
For those who remain behind and continue to work , it is a daily dance with risky decisions .	-3.1793
Ibarra , who once wanted to be a poet , admits that drug trafficking is frightening him .	-5.9813
" Mexico goes to hell and so I was reporter , " he said .	-2.3755
At midnight last Friday , when the last issue was finished , Riodoce ’ s editors were sitting in front of the office and dranking beer on the Civic Road , when all their phones started to be crowded .	-7.4169
A series of shooting with rivals and security forces near the resort of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead .	-3.8516
The war continued to escalate , as promised by a number of cartel attacks in the region .	-2.1530
From the onboard edge they have published news on the website of Riodox via mobile phone .	-5.8309
The title page had to be changed the next day .	-1.3235
Siren houded near - another foundry in the area .	-3.8601
Bojorquez looked at the policemen who held guards to see if they were willing .	-2.8414
If they were afraid of anything , they did not show it .	-2.2607
Riodoce ’ s employees were following the huge portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle-finger was visible to the whole of Sinaloa .	-5.0667
" As you can only remember closing , " said Bojorquez , " on the same day that Javier was murdered , the intern asked me to send it to the street to report . "	-8.9716
Dinosaurs used camouflage to escape his enemies .	-2.5662
At first glance , it looks like a statue , albeit a frightening one .	-2.8446
Researchers have now found that the first findings of a Canadian miner 's incredible Nashorn were so well received that experts described it as " Mona Lisa of Dinosaurs " .	-4.8776
It was so well preserved that they were even able to find that his scarce skin was reddish brown - and they said it had had something of a " troubled past " .	-5.8294
The report in Current Biology called it " the best preserved tank dinosaur ever found and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world " .	-4.1015
The fossil is a newly discovered type of nodosaurian that lived in the middle of the circle time between 110 million and 112 million years ago .	-3.8421
Its incredibly well preserved state has stunned researchers who describe it as " truly remarkable " .	-3.3589
According to reports in National Geographic , the crop nut is the best preserved fossil of its kind .	-5.0864
It was found by Shawn Funk when he grub on 21 March 2011 at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta , Canada .	-2.5174
He met something that seemed wrong from the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely .	-3.8188
He discovered Fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology .	-2.4119
They spent the next six years discovering the wild animal within the <unk> 2,500 ( <unk> 1,100 kg ) heavy earth clump .	-3.6800
After all this hard work , the final result is ready to be revealed .	-1.9894
" If you blink a little with your eyes , you might almost believe it has slept , " said the main author , Caleb Brown , scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum , where the creature is seen .	-4.2532
" It will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and well received dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs . "	-7.0084
Researchers found that , although it is covered with armor and resembles a changeling tank , this vegetable freshness was probably threatened by meat eating dinosaurs .	-5.8233
The strongly panned dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide themselves from predatory animals , and used a shielding technique known as counter-attack , which is also used by many modern animals .	-4.7104
This would have allowed itself to become more involved in its surroundings and to evade its enemies , say experts , suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs .	-5.6557
The 110 million year-old creature from the Nodosaurian family made headlines in May and is now available in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology .	-3.2418
Researchers have now studied wild animals and Borealopelta markmitchelli is named after the Museum Engineer Mark Mitchell , a team that spent more than 7,000 hours carefully discovering it .	-4.7665
The astonishing preservation of the copy allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and armor over his body .	-3.6711
They discovered counter-chatting , a common defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the tip of the creature was dark than its base .	-9.5287
Although counter-shading is common , the results are surprising , as the size of Borealopelta exceeds that of the animals living today by far .	-4.5070
It suggests that the dinosaur was hunted by enough pressure from meat eating dinosaurs that evolution favored concealing confrontation as a means of survival .	-4.3186
But most contemporary animals using counter-shading - think of rehe , zebras , or belt animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey , signalling that this nodosaur was facing a real battle for survival .	-5.2143
" Strong predatory behaviour on a massive , strongly panned dinosaurs show how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the Kreidezeit must have been , " said Brown .	-4.5074
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was red brown .	-2.1647
Scientists continue to examine the animal for references to his life , including his conserved intestinal shell , to find out what it eaten as his last meal .	-3.9239
They believe that the dinosaur , when he died , was thrown into a river and driven out into the sea , where he sank on his back to the sea basin .	-5.1168
At that time Alberta was as warm as southern florida today , and rivers and oceans probably spread far more nationally than they are today .	-3.3942
" This nodosaurian is really remarkable because it is fully covered with preserved scaly skin , but also preserved in three dimensions and preserves the animal 's original shape , " said Brown .	-5.1745
" The result is that today the animal looks almost the same as in the early cycle time .	-4.0588
You don 't need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it , but if you look a little with your eyes , you might almost believe that it is sleeping . "	-9.0405
The Kreidezeit was a time when huge theropodes , carnivorous dinosaurs on two legs traveled the Earth .	-5.0455
Although the King of them , the Tyrannosaurus Rex , lived millions of years after Borealopelta , the captured dinosaur was driven by some of his terrifying ancestors .	-4.2570
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus , a 38 foot ( 11.5 m ) long , six tons heavy monster .	-3.1132
The scientists whose latest findings appear in Current Biology journal believe that Borealopelta was soaked in the sea after death and mummified in the mud .	-4.5925
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he grub on March 21 , 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta , Canada .	-2.4215
According to the museum , it is the best preserved man-made dinosaurs in the world , including skin and armor , and is complete from the snout to the hip .	-4.4876
On average , the creatures had about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to <unk> 3,000 ( 1,300 kg ) .	-4.2790
It contained two 20-inch long peaks raging from its shoulders .	-3.2996
Researchers believe that the tanned vegetable freezer was washed through Western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea .	-5.6740
But the submerged state of the dinosaur kept its armor in exquisite detail .	-2.8985
The auctioned remains of this special copy are so well preserved that the remains of the skin still cover holmpy panzer plates along the dinosaur .	-5.4425
As Michael Greshko has written for National Geographic , such a level of conservation is rare as a profit in the lottery .	-3.4052
The more I see it , the more confusing it will .	-1.5627
Auctured remnants of the skin still cover the woolly tank plates that wear the skull of the animal .	-5.8185
His right foot is on his side , his five fingers are sprayed upwards .	-4.2663
I can count the scales on his sole ' .	-1.6009
In thunderstorm : Mass carambology on A8 : Many wounded .	-3.6628
Hefty accident on the A8 on Thursday evening : Knapp 30 vehicles are transported into a mass carambolage .	-7.8055
There are numerous injuries , kilometre long traffic jams and gauffs .	-4.3653
On the Highway Stuttgart-München ( A8 ) about 20 people were injured in a mass carambalage during the late Thursday afternoon .	-4.5509
According to the police , at 5 p.m. , between Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen ( district Aichach-Friedberg ) during a thunderstorm there were almost 30 vehicles , including probably trucks .	-5.7923
Initially , no data were provided about the exact number of injuries .	-3.9253
They are light to medium sized injuries , one police speaker said .	-4.7058
A large number of rescue vehicles were ordered at the site of the accident .	-4.0795
The A8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich .	-2.3483
In Munich ’ s direction of travel , an approximately ten kilometres of backload was formed .	-7.1775
As an AZ reporter reports , massive handicaps occurred on the opposite track - through numerous gates .	-5.2511
The fire brigade listened to the labels of vehicle stencils , which are now subject to delicate punishments .	-11.0365
A second accident happened on the A8 just after 18 : 45 , this time between Augsburg and Dasing .	-3.5695
There was a collision between a car and a car .	-4.1406
A rescue helicopter was on the road to the accident .	-2.4009
Deutsche Bahn : Group testing " Comfort Check-in "	-2.0366
It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced before : nothing is suspicious you sit in the train and sleep .	-5.2299
Or one is deeper in his work and has just a brilliant thought .	-2.4838
And then : puff .	-1.7941
Come and wake up a smooth or tear the passenger in the middle of the workflow .	-5.2868
Card control .	-2.5473
But the times of discontinuation are over .	-3.4130
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing a creamless ticket control .	-13.1021
It is easy to confirm by phone that you take your seat and thus devalues the ticket .	-5.1782
A test operation is currently running on two tracks .	-2.5725
" If the offer goes up , we will expand it .	-4.5889
It is expected to be available at the beginning of next year on many other routes in Germany , " said a railway spokesman .	-4.2149
" Comfort Check-in " tells the train the map devaluation without a shaker .	-4.0044
To be able to use them , however , a number of conditions have to be met : you need a smartphone or a tablet .	-4.5292
And you have to have booked an online ticket - what most passengers already do .	-3.7979
It is also necessary to purchase the DB Navigator via the app of the train , which is in any case the most convenient way to book tickets .	-4.7016
Finally you need a seat reservation .	-2.3509
The " Comfort Check-in " works like this : You get to the train , call your ticket under " My Tickets " .	-4.5525
In the case of test customers a button for electronic devaluation will be displayed . data . data . . data . data . . . . . .	-6.7524
The train attendants get a message on their mobile devices that the passenger is in the train X and has taken the booked seat Y .	-4.1602
When checking a ticket , the train attendant comes in Y knows that there is a passenger with an already devalued online ticket .	-7.0905
So you can continue sleeping , work on and remain silent .	-3.4911
The " Check-in " has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which should make use of passengers .	-4.2575
" If you want to travel easily without checking the ticket by our train staff , you can check in the Navigator DB .	-5.7894
This allows passengers to make their travel time more personal in the train , " says Michael Peterson , marketing board of DB Fernverkahrt .	-5.8072
Second plus : " And our employees have more time than they are today to address individual customer needs " .	-5.1733
Those who often travel by train know that , in addition to delays and passes , ticket controls are one of the main problems .	-6.2094
Often you do not have all the documents you need to validate your online tickets , but one .	-6.0972
Either the credit card or the identity card or any other document is missing .	-4.7218
The result is endless discussions between train attendants and passengers , resulting in poor mood in the segment or large areas and delays in controlling your ticket and ultimately takes the time for the shaker to deal with other concerns .	-7.1176
Only a small number of test customers can still use the new service .	-1.8008
And this only applies to ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart food .	-3.0800
Further numbers on the same route are not activated yet .	-3.6795
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question : ' Why Streets ? '	-2.5069
On August 9 , 2014 , Brittany Ferrell was shaken to her core .	-2.1010
Only one day after she arrived in New York City , the born in St. Louis was on the bed of an Airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone .	-4.5914
She stumbled over a post from someone from high school .	-2.3330
" The police have just killed an 18-year-old child , and it is still on the street , " said it . .	-3.1321
Confused because nobody else posted the information on their feed , Facebook closed and opened Twitter .	-2.6739
A user with the handle <unk> TheePharoah has been retveetet on their timeline .	-8.2313
The rapper from the area of St. Louis was killing live tweet the death of Michael Brown , an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson , Mo .	-4.1162
He posted an image of Brown ’ s lifeless body , which was stretched out on the street and would remain there for four hours .	-4.1640
" That 's wild , " Ferrell thought .	-3.2160
But death was not new to them and their community .	-1.8907
She placed her mobile phone in order to return to tweets about people on the Canfield Drive later in the evening .	-3.7714
There were photos of the police band and people who shouted , and of a man who claimed to be Brown 's father , who bore a shield with the title : " Ferguson 's police just killed my unarmed son ! "	-5.2149
She observed a live feed in which a policeman was in front of a group of demonstrators with a beloved dog .	-3.5387
In another video , she said , another policeman exposed his rival and wrote : " I will kill you ... animals all . "	-3.3521
" That 's not common , " Ferrell recalled her statement .	-2.9289
'That is not the kind of murder we have become accustomed to and which we can call typical ' .	-3.9220
In this moment I felt a joke .	-3.7218
I was angry and wept ' .	-1.4649
She booked a return flight and returned home the next day .	-2.0025
After landing at 23 p.m. , she took her six-year-old daughter from her father ’ s home and decided that the two would go to Ferguson next morning .	-4.8624
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the following three years is the theme of a new documentary film , " Whouse Streets ? " , in the movies from the 11 .	-5.1254
It is a story of survival and protest , of love and loss , of strength and resistance , which consists of the views of the people who live in the community and filled the streets to demand answers .	-4.9597
When Ferrell went to Ferguson with her daughter , who was wearing a flower dress and a matching crown , the two discussed a conversation that they had innumerable times before this morning » about black experience and black state <unk> .	-10.4143
" Thou remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe in ? " she remembered what she said .	-3.4556
" We are now going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that was not right .	-2.6935
I couldn 't take her away , " Ferrell later said .	-3.1043
" What happened today is a culmination of what happened in the past .	-1.6614
They need to know it and to see it and be raised there .	-3.4737
It needs to be well developed , not only activism and organization , but also the various strata of black experience and the black constitution , and what we must do to become free to liberate ourselves .	-3.9417
Although I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience a flagrant racism , she is no different to the next black woman child .	-3.9117
I have the feeling that I would do her a disservice to keep her away from it ' .	-3.6246
The first station when they arrived in Ferguson was on the South Florissant Road , a place opposite the police authority that became a campsite when the activists were waiting for the possible non-indictment of Officer Darren Wilson .	-5.0785
There Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who did lunch .	-3.8561
They prepared pockets and helped pass them on to demonstrators .	-2.0021
Slowly a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell .	-2.0988
" My activism changed completely after 9 August , " she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri St . Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association , focusing on food justice and health inequalities in black communities .	-3.5865
" I had no experience in organizing .	-1.4118
Everything has come . '	-1.8234
weeks later , during an evening demonstration , Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan , one of the co-directors of the film .	-2.5403
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted only " document " what happened .	-2.3083
Ferrell put a question : ' Do you want to document or try to find a story you can exploit ? '	-3.2777
This scepticism was fed by countless cases of human beings , often by whites , in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience .	-3.7966
As Folayan recently said in an interview , ' We had heard people born and raised in Ferguson not center their votes and we wanted to do it differently ' .	-3.6834
Folayan had already worked with the then co-director Damon Davis , an artist who is known for his activism around death row occupants .	-3.5906
Ferrell brought the project closer , along with six other locals , followed the team of " Whouse Streets ? " in the years after Brown 's shooting .	-5.4133
" This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us , " said Davis .	-2.4625
" That was the main thing for me , as these people are depicted , for that is how I will be represented . "	-4.3742
The aim was not to focus on Ferrell 's experience - to show that the movement " is not a Messias leader , but a community that comes together , " said Folayan - she turned out to be the most open participant in the film .	-4.7006
As a result , documents from " Whouse Street ? " surprisingly show personal aspects of Ferrell 's life as she loves and marries her wife .	-3.9267
" I felt like naked , " Ferrell said and laughed when she first saw the finished product .	-2.2076
" But I understand that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people . "	-3.2840
In addition , Ferrell ’ s story repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement .	-2.4264
Two of the three founders of the movement who , after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 , marked the film " BlacklivesMatter " in social media , identify themselves as gay .	-3.1254
" Black , gay women in managerial positions have overall carried the movement , " said Ferrell , " and therefore we are constantly fighting on various fronts .	-3.9689
Black , gay women must bear the brunt of everything . '	-2.0098
Folayan agreed to note that " the movement really is maintained by black women and many black women " .	-2.2731
However , it insists that " this is not an affirmative type of action " , whereby Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film due to her identity .	-3.9070
" She was the person who raised the energy , " she said .	-3.2425
" It is no coincidence , although she was at the forefront , because in a life on these crossings as a black gay woman is so high at stake .	-5.2060
You can feel your energy through the screen ' .	-1.9554
Meanwhile , Ferguson ’ s news cameras have long disappeared , but racial links between the community and the police continue .	-3.0957
Ferrell is on trial for 2 <unk> years because of blocking a motorway at a demonstration .	-2.7170
She describes the social atmosphere of the area , which she calls her home : " A chaos .	-4.0167
However , she clings to a singing and feels committed to this memory since she went to the streets three years ago in Ferguson .	-6.1687
" It is our duty to fight for our freedom .	-0.8625
It is our duty to win .	-0.9454
We must love and support each other .	-1.1121
We have nothing to lose - except our chains ' .	-1.1983
From ' Dream ' to ' mad cow ' : TV readers discuss bit gallery	-4.0921
The bit gallery moves people , even though it is far from being built .	-3.1159
But the idea of a shopping centre at the southern end of the pedestrian zone has since the first presentation of 2009 split the population into advocates and opponents .	-4.8450
Cold temperatures do not make the subject much easier .	-5.6050
Also on our Facebook page " Volksfreund Bitburg " the topic is discussed .	-2.6805
While some say in the Bit Gallery : " This would be a dream " ( Anja Becker ) or " That would be real class " ( Nicole Schausten ) , comes from the other side : " Do no man " ( Siggi Betzen ) or quite plain : " Lars Scholz " .	-6.2946
While advocates are building a gallery of customers into the city , which also benefits the rest of the business , opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will flourish .	-5.3152
In addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the plot on which the Farmhouse stands , where 13 direct marketers offer their products .	-5.3735
This will stop as the construction begins .	-2.5211
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - in the direction of Beda Square with possibility to sit outside .	-4.7384
Simone Rooms : " For many years we have been buying in the Farmhouse almost weekly .	-4.2892
Especially our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the rural women always enjoy .	-4.6819
We also discovered the butcheries .	-2.7536
We hope that there will also be an opportunity to maintain this offer during and especially after the construction of the gallery .	-4.2910
There are other cities .	-2.5239
The small market hall in Frankfurt in particular is interesting . '	-2.3393
Gerd Densing : " Whether direct marketers are located in a market hall in the gallery , the rent is calculated .	-4.4074
However , the new project does not seem to be very low . '	-3.9941
Eva Kilic : " What shopping palaces in Bitburg ?	-1.5975
Whether it be clothing , shoes , droughts or supermarkets , I find this superfluous .	-4.0893
There is enough of that in our city .	-2.9927
You can see how many shops are empty - some for months and years .	-3.1551
However , since there is not even a proper weekly market here , it is all the more important that we maintain at least the market hall .	-4.1773
After all , the products offered there are fresh , mostly offered directly by the producer and , above all , is worth the price .	-5.9663
As you can see , shops in a shopping centre are only rented by larger companies , because the rents there are often not acceptable to a retailer .	-5.1154
It is a shame that special shops almost no longer exist and what remains of them will probably disappear ' .	-5.5497
Wolf Fandel : " A shopping centre with a market hall does not fit for me .	-2.9632
And the gallery does not fit into Bitburg .	-1.2137
Above all , where should the Farmers Market Hall go during construction ?	-5.2391
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long term , if the bit gallery actually comes .	-3.9341
Or does the specter Bit Gallery already manage to sell all business from Bitburg ? '	-3.7006
George Marquet : " That simply will not work .	-1.6454
And no one needs a shopping center that is empty .	-2.4793
In my view , it would have been better to promote a real farmers market instead of this gallery .	-4.0251
But the insanely many , I think , projects that are pointless in the construction sector in Bitburg no longer have any place for a farm market hall .	-8.0172
If the market hall is broken , a bit of culture will disappear . '	-4.1983
A fitting similarity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA	-2.3098
In the middle of the Fridman Gallery area in New York there are many faces - white , black and brown almost unnoticeable - that hang on cables on the ceiling .	-4.0114
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfers and Haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning .	-3.7389
Manning sent the excerpts from the Fort Leavenworth prison , where the former intelligence analyst had a 35-year-old prison sentence after making publicly available as secret diplomatic messages on the WikiLeaks website .	-5.8058
The new exhibition opened on August 2 is called A Becoming Resemblance .	-2.4017
It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg , whose discipline merged its expertise in technology , computer science , and art , and Manning , a trans-frau , and groundbreaking dissident , whose sentence was converted by Barack Obama when he had only three days in office .	-5.6126
Dewey-Hagborg , by the algorithmic analysis of DNA , extracted by Manning and created from the 30 portraits of what one might look like with these genomic data , has created a sharp , albeit intellectual commentary not only on the formability of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also on identity .	-6.1779
Manning , who was born as Bradley Edward , but has spoken openly about identification as a woman since her puberty , was sentenced in 2013 for 20 charges , including six violations of the espionage law , computer fraud , and theft .	-3.9478
Their image was suppressed by the prison , so much so that there was only one photograph - a grained black and white selfie , where manning clearly sits on a driver 's seat and carries a platinblock wire - with which it was associated .	-7.7805
In 2015 , Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of her 2012 project ' Stranger Visions ' .	-2.5117
In it , the artist portraits produced strangers from forensic artefacts such as cigarette smell and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people might look .	-4.5470
That was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine .	-2.0688
" They interviewed Chelsea Manning while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , " explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition .	-3.2019
And she could not be visited at this time and she could not be photographed , so you took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .	-3.5043
The artist and her imprisoned museum became unequal puppets who exchanged several letters over the course of two years .	-4.3015
They even created a comic " Suppressed Images " illustrated by Shoili Kanungo , which predicted a future in which President Chelsea 's judgment would be transformed and would be able to see the exhibition personally .	-4.2255
Indeed , just a few days after the book was published , Obama would demand Manning ’ s release after seven brutal years in a Kansas military prison was a welcome way of meeting .	-2.9418
There is also some depth and strength at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Trump is waging a war against informants from the government camp and against Transgender troops to find new , tweakable ways to further unleash the rigid divisions that he should actually fix .	-6.4991
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said that " things happen for a certain reason " .	-2.6725
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Manning called for an end to the " automatic fragmentation based on sex , race , sexuality and culture " , with her over-large signature below ( the " i " in her family name is with a heart .	-5.9319
On the opposite wall its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand feet of Cs and Gs and As , is written in pencil .	-3.3001
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by including the 200 letters ( or nuclear ones after the advanced scientific lexicon of the artist ) how surprisingly similar , at least in biological terms , we are all .	-3.5786
" What people hopefully will take with it is that our genome does not care about who we are and how open genetic data are for interpretation and how subjective they are , " said Dewey-Hagborg , whose video work from 2007 , Spurious Memories , is also to be seen .	-4.1506
" DNA data can tell so many different stories , so 30 of these stories are . "	-2.1086
The last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in its own room , is a page from the above mentioned comic novel .	-4.6075
It shows Manning how she appears with a hand-held phone from the disciplinary barracks of the United States like King Kong .	-4.4499
" When they cold your speech , they have won , " it is said .	-2.6134
'So never stop the mouth ' .	-2.1584
" It came directly from a letter she wrote to me , " said the artist who greets from Philadelphia .	-2.1258
'I still get a golden eye when I talk about it ' .	-3.4389
Manning has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if it were to do so , it will be welcomed by the masks in the middle of the room , by their own genomic simulators , which are like hordes of protesters .	-6.3596
This was also targeted , like all in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 " 2 , Manning Stature ) , where their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil .	-5.6939
" In the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , " said Dewey-Hagborg of the portraits .	-2.5143
" I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement that was behind its liberation . "	-3.3769
Professor of Northwest University and an employee of Oxford University sought for killing .	-3.3958
A nationwide human hunt is underway for a Northwest University professor and an Oxford University employee seeking to be suspected after a man was killed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago .	-4.8835
On Monday , Wyndham Lathem ( 42 ) and Andrew Warren ( 56 ) issued arrest warrants for murders due to their alleged participation in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell Duranleau , as shown by the acts of the Cook County Official Court .	-10.3979
The documents say that Cornell Duranleau , 26 , died after several styles .	-2.4730
A Community warning system published by the Chicago police authority says that the body was discovered on 27 July .	-2.7490
Officers received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .	-2.7952
Cornell Duranleau was still declared dead at the place of events , and detectives investigate the cheeks as murders , while the police actively seek the two suspects , said officials .	-4.5421
Lathem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwest University since 2007 .	-2.2632
Alan K. Cubbage , Vice President for University Relations , said in an email explanation that Lathem has now been reviewed and excluded from the entering of the Northwest University campus .	-5.3011
" This is now a criminal matter investigated by the competent authorities , and Northwest University cooperates with this investigation , " said Cubbage .	-3.2201
Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University .	-1.6707
A university spokesman and Somerville College said in an email declaration that ' we are in contact with the police in Britain and are prepared to help the US investigation authorities in every way possible ' .	-5.1434
The statement added that Warren ’ s colleagues were shocked , and want him to be .	-3.6882
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Authority , Anthony Guglielmi , said he strongly urge the suspects to stand up to the authorities .	-3.3056
" The police have an idea of their place of residence , and our efforts to localize them have intensified , " said Guglielmi .	-8.4963
Guglielmi said that local , regional and national authorities will help to find the suspects .	-1.7357
Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building administrator of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received a puzzling tip saying that something happened in apartment 1008 .	-3.1232
The police described the scene as very cruel .	-0.7873
Guglielmi said that it is unclear whether the incident also took place on 27 July .	-1.8183
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building .	-2.4321
" We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship , " said Guglielmi .	-1.8772
The management team of Grand Plaza issued a statement to the residents : " The police are currently working on the timeline and background of the victim and is exploring a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . "	-4.9514
'We will close the WADA Roadmap in the near future ' - Russian Vice-Prime Minister Mutko .	-2.8648
Russian Vice-Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that it will not take long for the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) to be implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency ( RUSADA ) .	-3.2485
" At a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road map RUSADA has been given the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD ( UK Anti-Doping ) .	-3.6697
The WADA road map was updated in this regard , " explained Mutko on Thursday .	-2.5634
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA Roadmap for complying with the code , which describes the criteria for reinstallation of RUSADA and was recently published on the organization 's website .	-3.7985
According to Mutko , it contains nothing that could give Russia cause for concern .	-3.1315
" Everything has been announced , everything is implemented .	-2.0092
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and WADA in the near future , " he added .	-1.7990
However , one of the criteria mentioned in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the results of the investigation approved by the WADA by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on allegedly state-sponsored doping in Russian sport .	-3.4624
On the matter , Mutko said : ' We are carrying out the investigation because our anti-doping system has admitted a mistake .	-3.7430
All the measures have been implemented .	-1.3932
But there were no state programmes and we are not going to concede something that does not exist . ' . , , . , . . . . . . . .	-6.5808
Mutkos words were in line with those of Vitaly Smirnov , head of the independent Russian anti-doping Commission .	-3.0817
In talks with the Russian sales office RSport at the beginning of the day , Smirnov gave problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organisations , but then added : " We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and rules .	-4.5998
No one wants to accept this report unconditionally , ' added Smirnov .	-2.4144
RUSADA was excluded from the implementation of doping checks in Russia in November 2015 , as part of the doping scandal .	-3.6058
However , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping ( UKAD ) .	-2.4747
After a visit to Moscow 's headquarters in July , WADA Director-General Olivier Nigli stated that RUSADA is " moving in the right direction " to be re-used .	-4.1293
Aldi isn ’ t Selling Eagles	-4.0966
This was shared by the business groups .	-2.9338
It was simply a precautionary measure that no health impairment could continue to be assumed , as the communication stated .	-5.6465
From now on , only eggs should be delivered to Aldi , which have been proven to have been tested adversely for fipronillable anti-lubricants .	-6.0913
Aldi wants to create clarity and transparency in his customers .	-3.4563
The start-ups that will help your company not become the next user .	-3.2556
Amy Errett wanted to measure happiness with your staff at your e-commerce start up , but the surveys did not work .	-3.8978
Answers were often vague , little helpful , or even worse , fraudulent .	-3.0454
And even if you promised anonymity , some workers did not trust the process .	-1.7262
" There was simply never consistency and objectivity , " said Errett , who operates the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care company Madison Reed .	-2.9007
She has called for help from outside .	-2.0506
A new race of Human Resources start-ups is on the increase to help companies find out how their employees feel .	-4.0382
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it enables companies to conduct surveys , address specific groups and demographic groups , provide employees with anonymity and complaints hotlines , and in some cases whistleblowers to bypass the C-Suite executives and contact the board directly .	-5.0724
" You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit to follow their health , but where is the fit for your company ? " said Jim Barnett , co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City start-up Glint , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement .	-4.2861
Errett said that she had a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint .	-4.2006
In addition to the snap-surveys and surveys from certain teams , it offers a heat map of the company that shows at a glance what units have most complaints and which managers have low asset results - so that you can check why .	-5.6428
Businesses come to understand that they must remain at the top of the workplace culture , so that you do not become the next user involved in scandals since a former employee has published a blog post describing an environment of harassment in which those who have spoken have been punished .	-5.4883
For start-ups like Glint , this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity .	-3.0510
The global governance , regulation , and compliance sector could have more than $ 118.7 billion in 2020 , according to the Let 's Talk Payments financial website .	-3.0197
Denver , Colorado , start-up Convercent , which helps companies prevent and recognize bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity early this year in the midst of the Uber case in discredit .	-4.2597
Convercent has almost 600 clients , including Airbnb , Microsoft and Tesla .	-1.1193
Uber has recently registered as a client .	-2.1678
As Glint , Convercent allows companies to send tailor-made " puls- " surveys , collect confidential responses in real time , and view the heat maps of your problem areas .	-4.2690
It also provides an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior .	-2.5689
When the chief executive is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .	-2.9684
" The court of public opinion has detected regulators , " said Patrick Quinlan , the founder and managing director of Convercent .	-3.1309
When a company is found which treats its employees poorly or acts unethically , it can experience costly consequences from consumer boycott , worker fluctuation and complaints , Quinlan said .	-4.0986
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations , has deployed Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of policy and procedures and have a simple way to reach their headquarters .	-4.4698
In the past , when an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or e-mail for the headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .	-4.0737
It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vitrano , Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel , who said there was no good way to follow complaints from employees .	-3.6456
Now that the Convercent company is deploying , problems previously hidden by executives sitting in offices in cities or states can be identified and addressed more quickly , such as discrimination , harassment or unfair practices .	-4.7778
" I can get closer to this holistic 360-degree view of employment experience , " said Vitrano , who leads Ruby Tuesday 's risk management group .	-3.9660
'And we protect our shareholders against employment and litigation ' .	-2.7385
Companies began to take ethics , values , and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 , after Arthur Andersen ’ s accounting firm collapsed due to ethical violations by the Enron scandal , Quinlan said .	-3.5789
But it took until the ' social media became their right ' that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundering online .	-4.1120
" Before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , " he said .	-2.1369
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service and place a burden on companies with recurring charges for the use of their products .	-4.5366
It is a business model and an opportunity that finds the approval of Venture Capital investors , who have supported both start-ups .	-3.0586
Convercent received $ 10 million in February financing from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital , raising all capital to $ 47 million .	-2.7912
Glitzers secured $ 10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners and brought all of their funding to $ 60 million .	-3.8038
These investments are hardly surprising , given the networked nature of businesses , culture , and venture capital .	-2.6541
There is a growing research complex that shows that today ’ s employees expect more from their jobs than they have done .	-3.1221
In competitive markets like Silicon Valley , high salaries and interesting projects are only stakes .	-3.5534
The staff want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .	-3.3678
" If people are happy to be in a company that belongs to their voices , and that the work you do is worth it , they feel more committed to making this company successful , " said Nina McQueen , Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn , who uses both Convercent and Glint .	-4.4597
Investors yield returns when their portfolio companies are running well , and companies run well when employees are committed .	-4.3135
If the Analytics Tools of third parties promise to increase the commitment and commitment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .	-4.2930
Data on employee engagement with experts in workplace culture is important .	-2.8970
But the data are useless if a company 's administrator does not take action .	-4.2491
Indeed , when a company asks staff for your feedback , it can have an expectation that change is on the way .	-3.4195
And if change does not come quickly enough , or at all , it can cause disappointments and demotive employees .	-3.4680
" When you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be ready to have 4,000 talks , " said Russell Raath , President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kotter International , who has seen companies that have relied too much on data collection .	-5.0028
" For if you will not follow staff ask , " Have you really heard me ?	-2.6094
Are you looking at that ?	-2.0015
And who do not care , why should I ? '	-3.3707
Madison Reed , who is now carrying out monthly employee surveys , was able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported on Glant , so Save .	-3.7166
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees , it was able to reorganize several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems .	-3.5726
At Ruby Tuesday , the company is getting new insights about its employees , and it hopes that in the long run this will lead to a better link of workers in an industry known for high sales .	-6.2587
" If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose the people , " said Vitrano .	-1.8967
" And if you lose people , you also lose customers .	-1.2625
And if you lose customers , you will lose business .	-2.0079
The NCAA eliminates two-day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins .	-10.5060
It 's up to 23 o 'clock when a lot of UCLA football players are entering the campus on one side of the new training fields .	-5.3738
Some have exhausted their trico parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .	-4.4816
For a good part of the team , these minor minutes represent a lunch break .	-3.0935
Players enrolled in summer courses will return to their final exams after the three-hour exercise before returning to the Waterman Football Center the next morning at 6.30 p.m.	-4.2968
" This is a real treachmill for the guys the next three days , " said Bruins-Trainer Jim Mora just before Monday became Tuesday .	-3.9100
NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the load of players and has actually extended their days - at least until Friday 's finals .	-4.4360
This is why the first three UCLA trainings should start at 19 : 15 in order to meet the players ' already completed timetables .	-5.9221
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins postponed the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and carried out practical exercises during the summer school for the first time during Mora 's summer school in Westwood .	-4.6517
They are expected to have 18 exercises in the course of August , 20 before the start of the formal preparations for the game against Texas A & M in September .	-5.1487
Mora said he supported the NCAA ’ s regulatory change , even if they add a further point to players ’ busy routes .	-5.1682
" We put this enormous burden on them three or four days , and it is very challenging , " said Mora .	-2.2704
" And they simply pushed it through , they continue to bury , they are great people .	-3.8122
I think that once we get to Saturday and we have more time , it really will be great ' .	-3.2746
UCLA will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished , which will not be easy to do , given the clear lines of its fields of view from an adjacent car park and the adjacent Luskin Center , a hotel of high class , which has already been beaten with footballs that gave a protective network behind a gate .	-9.0745
Bruin-players are expected to occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mora admitted that there could be a problem once these rooms are free during the season .	-4.4158
" We will use our security , " said Mora .	-2.4427
" This is a real problem and it is not a long way to think that people hire a room there and then prepare to record an exercise .	-5.0134
If you have the video tape of an exercise , it is a pretty good deal .	-2.6186
But we have security forces there and we have security forces on parking 8 .	-2.6013
We will do the best with what we have .	-1.6764
I am not too concerned about this .	-2.4873
We have a plan ' .	-0.7599
Facebook wants to intensify Facebook ’ s review of counterfeit news .	-2.1224
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false reports to third party fact-inspectors and then show their results under the original post , said the world ’ s largest online social network on Thursday .	-6.3325
The company said in an opinion on its website that it will start using updated machinery learning methods to identify possible false reports and send them to factual inspectors , which will potentially show results of the facts check from the original article .	-7.3469
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main distributions for so-called fake news , many of which believe that they have also influenced the 2016 US presidential election .	-3.6633
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with French voters flooded with false stories in the run-up to the May presidential election , and Germany supports a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to quickly eliminate hateful postings as they did before the September elections .	-8.8783
On Thursday , Facebook said in a separate declaration in German that a test of the new facts review will be launched in the United States , France , the Netherlands and Germany .	-3.6609
" In addition to the knowledge which stories are being contested by factual auditors of third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , " said Sara Su , product manager for Facebook messages in a blog .	-4.4615
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature to the " related article " and works on other changes to its message feed to reduce incorrect messages .	-3.3281
Creating a comic novel : A Castle in the History of England	-1.4607
In his recent past , Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970 ’ s and 1980 ’ s .	-8.7378
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history of his cosy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent , and has now become the inspiration for a graphical novel by Jamie Rhodes , a mosphaaric Yorkshire man with a love for historical documents .	-4.7910
" I think it is so nice to look at the manuscript of someone who has been dead for 300 years , " he says awkward .	-4.0316
'What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand ' .	-1.9842
'A Castle in England ' spans the time from the Middle Ages to the Age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney .	-4.3186
It is not the first book by Rhodes , based on an archive : he wrote 2014 ' Dead Men 's Teeth and Other Stories ' , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library , a project he found unexpectedly emotional .	-2.6993
" I only reacted to the thumb on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700 's who worked for the Jacobins , " he says .	-3.7484
" That is its thumbprint !	-2.5344
And letters always smoke for smoke , for at the time one spawned a fire because of light .	-4.6902
For someone who lives 300 years later , smell has an effect as if he were there himself .	-3.9290
Oh , I love archives ! "	-1.4792
For someone who is beaten with old papers so that he is supported by the National Trust and Arts Council England and lived in a castle almost four months ( " To be honest , I have a little overvalued my welcome greeting " ) this seems all too beautiful to be true .	-5.4871
Rhodos spent his days exploring the Victorian " new " castle , watching the archives , and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle , such as the mounted hyene heads on the walls and the bottles that had been buried by centuries .	-5.0975
He walked through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape carers , gardens and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .	-5.0784
Then , at night he drank " whiskey and started writing " .	-1.6519
The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown , as the National Trust only received full access in 2006 when the last heir , Elizabeth Hussey , died .	-3.4060
When Rhodes arrived a decade later , employees just started to look after the archive he described as " hundreds of years in which aristocrats said " Oh , I throw it on the attic " .	-5.2806
Diary books , letters from the age of English Empire , maps representing who had what : " You might think that land conflicts would be boring , " says Rhodes , " but there was a birch to fight the two families .	-4.8244
Boys , let it all go ! '	-2.9938
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point for scuba diving into English history on a broader basis , including ' The Labourer ' , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the farm rebellion of 1381 .	-5.0622
" There is a recording of a riot that appeared in the castle in 1380 , in this book entitled ' Knight Families of Kent and Sussex ' , says Rhodes .	-3.8492
" The rebellion began in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start .	-3.3242
Perhaps the two are linked ? '	-1.6390
Other stories are deeply rooted in the history of the castle - like ' The Priest ' , which tells the story of the Jesuit patron who the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation .	-5.0029
Or ' The Smuggler ' , which portrays the 18th century jewellery Arthur Darrell , who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones ( a discovery that was made years later when his coffin was excavated ) .	-5.1373
The Darrells are Rhodes ' favorite family of Scotney : " Gentlemen seemed to be quite gorgeous , always making debts and spending money on things they could not afford .	-6.3218
Other generations of Darrell men triggered their debt crises by marriing rich old women - I imagine them as a pile of good looking boys with a talent to advertise inheritance . "	-4.0190
After his work at the castle , Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences .	-3.6038
He brought a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämäki , the site of a early 20th century sanatorium , which has since been reclaimed by nature .	-4.8229
But Scotney has a special place for him .	-1.0051
" I was sad to go again , " he says .	-1.1415
It was like ' Oh , now I have to finish with the damned life ' .	-2.9854
Campaign Behind : Over 300 year-old Marian Chapel in Rhöndorf	-4.6260
The city of Bad Honnef started its campaign to introduce a new roof brand ( Rundschau of Thursday ) with the hillside of the 301 year old Marian Chapel in Rhondorf .	-6.1177
Until Thursday mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and the slogan secret .	-2.4553
At the end of August there will be a celebration on the island of Grafenwerth as the highlight .	-3.7867
'Fine for us .	-1.9621
Or ? " , the masters of the action have been asking on the posters on the Rhöndorfer Chapel since yesterday .	-4.9617
" We don 't really think of this ( of course ! ) , they write on your site .	-4.5651
" But we use this measure to gain your attention .	-1.5120
And to make it clear that some is better than it seems .	-1.5347
Basically , we firmly believe that , as a Bad Honnefer , we know very well about the beauty and attractiveness of our city . ' .	-4.7219
The action is about more than " just " a logo and a slogan , it goes on .	-4.0129
" We must formulate a single promise , one that gives the city a distinctive stand-alone feature " .	-4.3097
After all , they compete with other communities .	-2.0070
The city of Bad Honnef can cost a middle-fifth amount of its new roof brand and campaign .	-4.9833
Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan ’ s Army Fear	-1.4031
Every year at the beginning of August , Ankara advises the Supreme Military Council ( YAS ) on retirement and promotion in the Officer Corps .	-4.1309
This week too .	-2.1398
At first glance a normal procedure .	-1.5542
But nothing is routine with Turkish forces a year after the coup attempt .	-2.3418
The sitting was no longer held in the General Staff building , as in the past , but in the Prime Minister 's office .	-4.1268
Under the chairmanship of the Head of Government , the five Vice-Presidents and the Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs Ministers have now also participated in the discussions .	-5.4555
This was the overnumber of civilians in the YAS .	-2.9278
The government is pulling the reins in the military .	-2.4143
Chief executive Hulusi Akar remains in office , but the commanders of the Army , the Air Force , and the Marine have been replaced .	-5.2833
Since the failed coup , Head of State Erdogan fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals .	-1.6232
More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the army 's ranks - mostly due to alleged connections to the movement of the exile preacher Fethullah Gülen , who sees Erdogan as the wizard of the coup attempt .	-5.4200
We have been negotiating with 486 people who are to have been directly involved in the coup attempt since this week in Ankara .	-4.4774
On the day after the coup , Erdogan called the attempt to overthrow a " God gift " , given that he had the opportunity to " clean up the armed forces completely " .	-6.5433
But does Erdogan really have a grip on the army ?	-1.5606
At the end of February , the newspaper " Hürriyet " published an article entitled " Unbehagen in the Military Headquarters " .	-3.6730
In the General Staff there are concerns about an increasing " Islamisation " of the army , which manifest itself , among other things , in the lifting of the ban on headscarf for soldiers , the newspaper wrote .	-4.8566
In any case , making the army and the security forces all the same goes on .	-5.2020
In mid-July , Erdogan had another 7395 statesmen fired by decree , including 2303 police officers and 546 soldiers .	-4.0533
It seemed that Erdogan tamed the military .	-1.9862
The generals used to be the real masters of the country .	-2.4167
Three times , they invoked their role as guardians of the secular state order .	-8.5180
After his 2002 election victory , Erdogan pushed back the power of the military step by step , not least by invoking the reforms of the European Union .	-4.0292
Former officers say that Erdogan is aiming for an Islamization of the armed forces .	-4.2937
In the Vocal Europe magazine , a nominally unnamed officer who sought asylum after the coup attempt for fear of persecution abroad , the Turkish army will be " full of extremists and salafists " in a few years ' time . in the . in , . in . . with .	-6.8528
If that were the case , it could not make NATO cold .	-3.6256
In any case , after the cleansing , there is doubt in the alliance about the Turkish army ’ s willingness to take action .	-4.3068
Leadership structures and operational capabilities are " weakened , " says NATO diplomats .	-2.4374
Washington Changes Green Card Rules	-1.1033
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the Green Card rules , said President Donald Trump , cited by the media .	-1.7716
It provides for reducing legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stricter rules for obtaining visas for temporary work permits and restrictions on family-oriented visas .	-3.7688
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President .	-1.7580
The bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .	-7.8156
'This law will reduce poverty , raise wages , and save billions of dollars on taxpayers , and will do so by changing the way in which citizens from other countries are issued Green Cards . '	-4.1254
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .	-1.5096
This new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English , who have the financial means to support themselves and demonstrate knowledge that will benefit our economy , " said Trump , cited by the American media .	-4.1815
Ministry wants to renovate track for racing huttles .	-3.4091
Over the past few months we have been arguing about the future of the racing huttle - now it 's time to go very quickly .	-6.3721
Before the end of the year it is planned to be built on the marble stretch on which the tourist track runs .	-6.1253
In order to ensure the future of the racing huttle in the long term , according to the Ministry of Transport , construction work will begin this year .	-4.7829
" With the decision to continue ordering and renovating the route Ilmenau , the country acknowledges itself to this primarily important link for tourism , " said Transport Secretary Klaus Sühl in Erfurt on Friday .	-6.0596
The cost of repairing the route was approximately EUR 2.5 million .	-2.5192
Of that , the country assumes 75 % .	-3.3232
The treaty , on the basis of which the shuttle is to continue to be ordered by the country , is currently being finalised , declared Sühl .	-5.0750
The Ministry and the South Thuringia Railway as the operator are already agreed on the technical details .	-3.8299
" Thus negotiated the road map , the vehicles used and quality standards , " said Sühl .	-3.2826
The planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be concluded for eleven years .	-6.7711
The racetrack shuttle should be ordered regularly on December 2017 .	-3.5027
The circuit shuttle is a popular tourist rail link between Ilmenau and Rennsteig stations .	-4.0981
In recent months , pilot operations have tested whether the route is used by enough people to order it regularly in the future .	-4.8986
The route is also due for partially heavy losses .	-4.9551
The rise of sex robots is real , and we should worry .	-1.5061
Just when you thought that it could not be any crazy in 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots comes .	-4.0916
Yes , indeed .	-1.0760
Sex robots are a big thing at the moment .	-1.5435
Recently , the Foundation for Responsible Robotics ( FRR ) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years .	-11.6619
According to Noel Sharkey , an eminent professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR , we must begin to take their rise seriously .	-3.9932
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the chest wart and the type of fingernagel .	-3.8800
" People are funny about them , but companies deliver a lot of it , and we will see it much more often , " said Mr Sharkey in publishing his new report .	-4.8311
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with deliberately human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence .	-3.1369
The user can also " customize " his robot according to his convictions , choosing everything from the eye color of the robot to the form of the chest warning to the type or color of his fingernails .	-5.3661
But it is even more worrying because many robots have the " personalities " that would make a step-woman look progressive .	-4.3570
Modern sex dolls have become robots with a silicone skin .	-1.6900
For example , the RealBotix robot allows users to customize their robots to the properties they find appealing , such as shudder .	-4.7123
Then there are the Roxxxy Gold Sex robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as Frigid Farrah , who convey the impression of boldness and Wild Wendy with a " adventurous " personality .	-5.1549
" Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is as good as possible to your personality , " swaps the True Companion website .	-4.0890
So she likes what you like , and she doesn 't like what you do not like , etc .	-2.3525
During the day she also has her mood - just like real people !	-2.9933
She can be tired , obsessed with conversation , or she can be " in mood " !	-3.3494
There are many worrying aspects to this rise in sex robots - not least because they replace genuine human relationships - but the subdued female characteristics , the references to rape when one goes to Frigid ( that is , opposing ) Farrah , worry one of the most .	-6.1243
On his website True Companion Roxxxy compared with a vibrator , but for men .	-1.9712
" If women ( sic ) can have a vibrator , why can men not have Roxxxy ? " says it on the site .	-3.5906
However , these sex robots are not just a fetish or contain just another sex toy .	-2.5938
Their emergence and increased refinement point to something dark and deeper in our culture , to a withdrawal from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with subjugation as an optional addition .	-3.5999
Of course , most men will not have sex robots , and while the FRR is noticing its rising popularity , they remain on the margins of consumer culture .	-5.9109
But what leaks out of peripheral zones can be very instructive about the spirit of the time in which we live .	-3.9671
And many people are not strange or offensive until the free market allows them to do so .	-2.5514
There is a certain overlap that these advanced sex robots appear at a time when women ’ s rights are under threat worldwide , when there is a president in the White House who has boasted women ’ s sexual assault .	-4.6303
The most dissuasive aspect of the TV series ' The Handmaid 's Tale ' ( ' The Report of the Magd ' ) are not the graphical images , the swelled body and the evoked eyes , but how realistic this vision works .	-5.2503
The Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap .	-2.9747
The aim behind these sex robots is to create a physical similarity to actual women as realistically and technically possible ( albeit with pornostar proportions ) .	-3.4298
Their builders want to feel humanly that they imitate the movement of a real body .	-2.5957
But , put to the point when it comes to their " personalities " , robots are not real women .	-3.2248
You cannot separate yourself from your pet or simply leave .	-3.2638
They have no mediation or background history , nothing to suggest of independence or anything that could disrupt the imagination of total submission .	-6.8829
In other words , they are false slaves .	-2.1129
Or to put it in the 2017 speeches : girls .	-3.3387
Trump ’ s Great Performance ?	-1.4674
He makes Mitt Romney a commonsense embodiment .	-2.6865
It has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions that polarized the US electorate have also divided families in small format .	-3.2387
There have been newspapers in the US about Christmas and Harvest Festival about how to deal with Trump ’ s horror of choosing relatives .	-4.7412
We all supposedly strive to burst our filter bubbles .	-2.4299
Less noticed has Trump ’ s power to bring families together .	-1.7758
I mention this because my cousin , a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Republicans in our family , visited me this week in New York .	-2.6318
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .	-1.6606
Trump in the White House is suddenly and strangely on the same side , including the Republican kinship with which she had fought for decades .	-3.5872
This is certainly a good thing for the dining table , but it strikes me in a further context that this also entails significant risks .	-5.0222
Trump strengthened the left , but his presidency ’ s degrading effect has the strength to push us all to the right .	-3.6488
When we speak of ' normalization ' and Trump , we refer to the cruel possibility that one day his girls will no longer kick us off .	-5.7594
But there is an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump “ normalizes ” right-wing Republicans , who suddenly appear to be an embodiment of sensitivity relative to his standards .	-3.7159
I find myself today affected by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney ’ s uromic version of the mad - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax declaration was made ) - both of which , in fact , are a very mild offence compared to Trump .	-6.1074
When Trump goes , the Republicans ’ next candidate must be mentally healthy only to be an immeasurable improvement .	-4.0400
When my cousin was in the city , we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park , the largest carousel in the New York Park department , and the best three dollars to spend in the city if you don 't need a caffeine .	-4.4255
The horses are huge , the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are crazy and the animals are roaring to look at their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climbing music conveys this in strange ways .	-6.6695
So many clichés of a city disappoint : the views of high buildings become old , the skylines become too familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city is not equal to the dream .	-4.3221
Thirty-five years later , and I am still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a great circular traffic in northern London .	-5.3268
However , the Central Park Carousel is still a strange magic experience because two years , one 11-year-old and two women in the 40-year period can go to it and all have a great time .	-12.3950
If I had been able to assess the carousel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one asked .	-3.2775
On the other hand , this week , in a department store , I was forced to evaluate my " experience " with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card .	-4.0855
In the coffee house at the corner of my street , it is the same , plus the option to compare the evaluation with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the loading .	-4.6079
Not only does this lead to a slowdown in what should actually be a neutral exchange , but it also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality to a situation where no need is needed .	-4.8611
The poor woman in the department store was apologising grinding while I got tired of extending my credit card with five stars .	-4.5556
Moved Oscar Pistorius to hospital with breast pain .	-2.4657
For the second time , Pistorius left prison for a hospit. hospital .	-3.4270
Last year , he was hospitalized for the treatment of cuts to his wrath , which he had , according to prison authorities , suffered after a case in his cell .	-5.5182
Pistorius was sentenced to death for murder after an appeal by the prosecutors against a first sentence .	-4.2503
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine 's day in 2013 , shooting them several times through a door of the toilet booth in his house in Pretoria .	-3.8249
Pistorius claimed that he believed his girlfriend to have a nighttime intruder hiding in the cabin .	-4.9806
The prosecutors have announced their intention to oppose this time the six-year imprisonment of Pistorius ’ appeal , which they say is too lenient .	-4.3344
The National Prosecution Authority said it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the appeal could be heard this year .	-3.7803
Pistorius is in danger of being increased to 15 years if prosecutors are successful .	-3.8300
There is no death penalty in South Africa .	-0.9104
As a farmer Arnold finds a curious egg .	-2.5962
The last of the Blumberger schools were the Fourth Crawlers made of feet and Epfenhofen in their vacations and in the secondary schools .	-6.7294
Three of the dismissal pupils will go to the gymnasium in the future , four to the real school .	-5.9198
On Tuesday evening , school manager Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public in the Biesental Municipality in Epfenhofen .	-4.5620
As a symbol of the school release , the 29 students of the four classes under the direction of Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder chose a young eagle who grows up in the chicken courtyard but is then dismissed into freedom .	-5.9497
The murderer Shar led a musical entitled " Der Adler im Hühnerhof auf " .	-5.6008
Fauer Arnold found a strange egg and let it broke out from his chickens .	-3.5029
Instead of a chicken bucket a small eagle came out .	-3.6492
But the hope of making him a chicken broke down , the eagle spread out his wings on a high mountain and resolved .	-4.3905
After that , the classes showed three and four a chicken dance in the study of Yvonne Frank .	-2.8625
The hens danced with the young gockles who wore cylinders to the bet .	-2.2543
The eagle stands for integration , said school-manager Angelika Sitte .	-8.1751
The juvenile may be different from the other juveniles ( kicks ) , but it is one of them .	-5.5670
He will never be like a chicken .	-1.6075
His provision is to be free .	-1.3088
She wanted every four-plaintiff to feel accepted in his new school .	-2.9027
I would like to thank the Members , the former head of school , Michael Müller , who is constantly jumping in school bags , and the parent representatives .	-6.3351
Sophia Schumacher explained the school teacher 's future . is now over . .	-8.2453
After two years of teaching , they do not leave their students very untouched , because it was a really great time .	-7.0794
Finally , they have been able to rely on the fourth-plaintiffs .	-4.0214
In conclusion , all students had a song of summer and holiday time .	-3.8138
It was a great pleasure for children .	-4.5569

Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece	-0.7655
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece , informed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted from television .	-2.4887
On the morning of 1 August , a group of illegally camping people was arrested in Sithonia , including the two Bulgarians .	-2.9220
The same day they were released while an investigation is under way .	-2.4240
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported bTV that the Bulgarians were later released . on . on . with . on . . with . . .	-9.2531
The Greek authorities have tightened control over free camping and impose considerable fines on anyone who is found in a place that is not intended for this purpose .	-4.2275
The controls will continue throughout the season .	-1.8592
The Ministry said that the Court can impose a fine .	-2.3935
Software updates for diesel vehicles : What those affected need to know now .	-3.1280
How exactly will the software update take place ?	-2.2092
Do diesel drivers need to participate in the action ?	-2.5513
Overview of the most important questions and answers .	-1.8215
At the diesel summit BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of 5.3 million cars .	-2.9178
They are intended to improve the exhaust behaviour of cars in the emission classes Euro 5 and in part Euro 6 .	-5.1975
Euro-4 diesel or worse are excluded .	-2.2023
Anja Smetanin from the ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments :	-2.1143
Is the new action mandatory ?	-1.0184
No , the negotiated software updates are voluntary .	-2.4371
" The mandatory updates beforehand only apply to the vehicles that have rubbish software , " says Anja Smetanin .	-3.5760
The KBA ordered its rearmament .	-4.3295
How and when will customers be informed about updates ?	-2.0536
Manufacturers have announced rapid implementation in the coming months , but have not yet set a precise date .	-3.3040
Daimler has notified to write to each person concerned .	-3.8173
If an inspection is due anyway , it will be done within its scope .	-3.0498
How long should the overall turnover lag ?	-3.4026
Smetanin says " Strong to say " .	-3.8402
This depends on the commitment of the manufacturers and on political pressure .	-3.2079
'Because we have seen car manufacturers do not act voluntarily on the environment ' .	-3.7035
How long should the update take ?	-1.2422
The conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .	-2.4349
Time consuming can be to get an appointment .	-3.5378
What do drivers who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group do ?	-2.5327
The ACE is advising to wait .	-2.3284
Expectly , foreign manufacturers would draw , says Smetanin .	-5.0215
Will a massive fall in the price of Euro-4 cars be threatened ?	-3.9522
The ACE fears this .	-1.4252
But particularly in regions where driving bans are threatened .	-3.9012
There have been no loss of value for older diesel in rural areas so far .	-3.2999
The ACE advises to wait for sales .	-1.9205
LL Cool J Get Kennedy Centers Award	-2.5098
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in the Washington .	-1.2637
President Trump ’ s first prize ceremony promises to become political .	-2.1808
One of the winners will not come - out of protest .	-2.1682
LL Cool J ( 49 ) is the first rapper to receive one of the most popular awards of the renowned Kennedy Center .	-3.2903
As the culture facility announced on Thursday , this year , singer Gloria Estefan ( 59 ) , Lionel Richie ( 68 ) and choreographer Carmen de Lavallade ( 86 ) and TV producer Norman Lear ( 95 ) are among the celebrities .	-4.0078
The awards will be handed over at the beginning of December . . awarwill the . the will . will . . . will	-8.4262
Traditionally , US President Donald Trump will host a reception and attend the award together with his wife Melania .	-2.8405
The Lear winner , acclaimed with progressive TV series , has therefore already announced that he will not participate in the gala .	-5.3870
The ' New York Times ' said : ' This Presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even depriving them of the means - and that is a burden on me ' .	-5.5729
Estefan , a 59 year old , stressed that she would use the conversation with Trump to clarify her view .	-4.1396
The Kennedy Centre , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital .	-1.9757
Other awards include Meryl Streep , Aretha Franklin , Robert De Niro , George Lucas , Tom Hanks and Sting .	-2.6642
We Make the City Live	-1.9449
Roland Wacker , Hasah ’ s city builder , will be retiring next year .	-4.0852
The job is already posted - but suitable candidates are rare .	-3.6829
Wacker has been the city builder for 31 years .	-2.5845
And his work is still enjoying him , as he gives in the press conversation .	-5.5123
He reports on varied but also demanding tasks awaiting his successor .	-3.9796
At the same time , he is surprised that no application yet fulfils the requirement profile .	-3.5374
The city is looking for an architect or building engineer at the nearest possible time .	-3.2944
So there is still time to make an introduction , taking into account the regular deadlines for redundancy .	-6.1524
Since Hasach acts as a sub-contracting authority for the administrative community , the applicant must provide relevant qualifications .	-5.5394
Because this function definitely wants to keep the city .	-2.4687
If they could no longer fill it , citizens would have to go to Offenburg for consultation .	-4.2034
But proximity to the citizens is important to the city and to it , Wacker says , which reports about a good working climate and good sentiment between the authorities and the citizens .	-5.9153
In more than 30 years in office , several important projects have accumulated , looking back on the wackers with pride .	-4.7976
" We make the city worth living , " he 's sure about the Bauamt and his staff .	-4.6231
In the future , however , there are many varied projects on the agenda : the redesign of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofenkplatz are , for example , being launched .	-6.5827
The Kinzigbridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renewed , the stadium reconstruction is still a topic .	-4.1603
The latter alone will beat around EUR 1.5 million if we do it right , Wacker estimates .	-4.5022
" Everything in all await great tasks for my successor .	-3.0931
The work here is fun . '	-1.8715
A great deal of room for manoeuvre is available for a city builder .	-5.4576
With Hasach ’ s own Bauhof and Garden , much can be reacted flexibly to .	-5.4561
" You can move a lot , " says Wacker , and the design of the green facilities is often commended by citizens and visitors .	-4.4039
Since the old town as an ensemble is under monument protection , it is important to have " an eye for what suits clean " when new buildings are approved , the outgoing city builder stresses .	-5.6233
In any case , the city builder bears a heavy responsibility .	-3.5944
He is a builder , " at the end everything here is running over my table " .	-2.8633
With care and coordination he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neumaier ( Hochbau ) has been present for ten years , Manfred Schöner ( deep-building ) for 15 years .	-5.9086
Also , that his successor remains long , Wacker wants : " We are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the post " .	-5.7883
For continuity is not only important for a good working climate , but also for the further development of the city .	-4.0368
If you want to inherit Roland Wacker , you should be able to study as a graduate engineer or bachelor with a specialized architecture and have good expertise in the field of building and planning law .	-7.1883
The Municipal Building Office is subject to high and low construction , building management , basic employment , management of urban properties , town-house with Bauhof and Municipal Gardens , as well as lower building rights authority including monument protection .	-10.7122
Discard bicycle on lines : Disabled South Railway	-5.7120
According to the police , the hitherto unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bicycle on the lines from the railway system in the Leoben Stra<unk>e area ( B116 ) .	-5.0981
They were damaged so much that the impending freight train had to be stopped .	-4.2240
The investigators leave from two male perpetrators and search for them since the night hours .	-3.3915
A pink scooter and a bicycle rider were observed by witnesses close to the resort .	-5.1986
" This goes far beyond a whistling slope , " said <unk>BB spokesman Christoph Posch , to the APA .	-5.2843
The perpetrators would have put themselves in great danger and also put rail transport at risk .	-3.5442
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and the facility , as well as the delay minutes and the costs of rail replacement transport , Plönalles of rail customers could also be brought to the perpetrators .	-7.5360
Overall it is possible to expect a " substantial " sum , the speaker said .	-4.2300
The damage was repaired on Friday afternoon and rail transport on the South Railway route could be done without any disability .	-5.3654
Nearly ten passenger trains had been cancelled on Friday morning , two of which concerned long-distance transport .	-4.2462
Goods trains were not available , but they were delayed .	-2.8968
According to <unk>BB spokesman Christoph Posch , about 200 metres of cabinets had to be replaced .	-3.8282
Isolators and masts were also damaged .	-1.1780
Red meat , dairy products , and chocolate may help relieve IBD ( inflammatory intestinal ) .	-2.4073
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system .	-1.0423
But a new study claims the opposite : a diet rich in meat based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory intestinal diseases .	-2.7827
The incurable state , which affects roughly 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the UK , is causing stomach and vesicles , recurring or bloody diarrhea , weight loss , and extreme fatigue .	-4.7841
While those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms , researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid Tryptophan of proteins contributes to the development of immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine .	-9.9982
The leading researcher , Dr. Marco Colonna , explained that immune cells patrol in the intestine to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in food do not enter the body .	-3.9154
Cells capable of inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without harming sensitive tissue .	-3.0125
If the balance tends too far towards inflammation , it can result in inflammatory intransigence .	-3.8793
Experiments have found that some form of tolerance promotes immune cells in mice that carry a particular bacterium in their inventories .	-5.7843
And the bacterium needs Tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .	-3.5024
Professor Colonna said : " We have established a connection between a bacteria species - lactobacteria reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbio , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .	-4.7006
The more Tryptophan the mice had in their food , the more they had of these immune cells " .	-2.6182
He proposed that the combination of L. Reuteri and a Tryptophan rich nutrition promotes more tolerant , less inflammatory intestinal , if the same system operates among humans .	-4.9154
The postdoctorandin Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found that a group of mousses had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which was kept separate , did not have it .	-5.1531
She suspected that the difference had to do with the intestinal robiomes of the mice - the community of bacteria , viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract .	-4.1749
The humidity of the mice was DNA sequenced and six bacteria were found in mice with immune cells , but without them missing in mice .	-5.2962
The mice was raised in a sterile environment , so that they lacked a pottery robiom and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they got the L. reuteri and immune cells .	-6.0450
To understand how bacteria affected the immune system , researchers L. reuteri grew in a liquid and then transferred small quantities of liquid - without bacteria - to immune cells isolated by mice .	-13.5935
Immune cells became tolerant cells .	-1.7935
When the active component was cleaned from fluid , it proved to be a by-product of Tryptophan metabolism known as an indol-3 lactic acid .	-4.0174
When researchers doubled the amount of Tryptophan in the mice ’ s feed , the number of such cells increased by about 50 % , but when the Tryptophane levels were halved , the number of cells fell by half .	-4.8808
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells as mice , and that most of us L. reuteri protect in our gastrointestinal tracts .	-2.6042
It is not known whether Tryptophan by-products from L. Reuteri develop cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes related to Tryptophan have been found in humans with inflammatory intestinal disease .	-3.5745
She said : " The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote because these cells control inflammation on the internal surface of the intestine .	-3.4700
Potentially high Tryptophan values in the presence of L. Reuteri could lead to an expansion of this population . "	-4.9196
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has committed a " genius " with Nemanja Matic .	-1.4756
Jose Mourinho believes that after the midfield player had his debut at Sampdoria on Wednesday evening , he signed a " genius " with Manchester United .	-3.9751
The <unk> 40 million signature of Chelsea began with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid begins on Tuesday , and impressed in the holder role when people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira moved forward to power .	-5.4122
Matic , however , was excluded from the Blues preparation Asian tour and only made 45 minutes , which admitted Mourinho had to improve before the premier league season began .	-5.4816
" He takes time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , " said Mourinho .	-1.7094
'We will help him to be ready sooner than later ' .	-1.6295
In addition to Matic , Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started in the Aviva Stadium , when Mourinho formed his start XI for the beginning of the season .	-4.3377
This week , the Independent revealed that Mourinho wanted another three new commitments , but he insisted that the club had already done a " fantastic job " to fulfil three of its four priority new commitments .	-4.1159
" Get three of four for which I thank the association " , he added .	-3.3709
'I will be happier if they get four out of four for me , but they have made great efforts ' .	-3.8633
Boeing paints Dreamliner in the Sky	-2.0883
Boeing has painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner in the sky .	-4.2943
The pilots flew from Seattle in Washington State , but the drawing began in Marquette in Michigan State and moved in the form of a dreamliner over the US , which is several thousand kilometres .	-4.9460
The action lasted 18 hours and one minute .	-1.0716
On the radar screens was the form of a dreamliner .	-3.1953
All this was an endurance test for new engines .	-6.8590
Boeing had already made such advertising earlier .	-1.6885
Thus the number " 787 " and the Boeing logo was painted in the sky .	-2.9011
New Look at Martin Schulz - Hannover , We Problem	-3.8422
As the wind turns out , when Sigmar Gabriel was still the SPD leader , social-democratic prime ministers always looked to Berlin with some concern before the elections .	-4.2392
If not a fault from the party headquarters , just no headwinds from the federal government , the campaign ’ s most important desire was .	-7.8783
Since Martin Schulz led the party , this has changed fundamentally .	-2.0473
Since then , the Willy Brandt staff have been watching events in the SPD governing national capitals with growing horror .	-4.5926
What Schulz got from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in the approach with the headwinds .	-3.3011
They were deep-blows .	-4.4190
And one by one .	-2.1607
After the surprising end of the red and green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of SPD and Green .	-3.0101
" This shows once again : Rot-Green simply cannot govern reliably , " said CDU Secretary-General Peter Tauber , the editorial network Germany ( RND ) .	-4.9258
The surprising exit by a Green MEP has plunged Prime Minister Stephan Weil ’ s government into a severe crisis .	-3.5301
Five months before the country ’ s election , his red-green coalition lost its single-vote majority to the CDU and FDP opposition .	-9.7499
The Green Federal Managing Director Michael Kellner has called on the breakaway Lower Saxon Green MEP Elke Twesten to return its mandate .	-5.1536
Translating to the CDU means a clear distortion of the electorate .	-3.3637
Elke Twesten must immediately return her mandate , " said the Federal Manager and Election Manager of the Green Group to the German editorial network ( RND ) .	-4.6035
" Everything must not be true " , a SPD campaigner seats , when the new message of hey reaches the party headquarters on Friday morning .	-7.5698
Stephan Weil , Prime Minister of the SPD of Lower Saxony , is there without a governing majority following the transition of the Green MEP Elke Twesten to the CDU .	-6.1876
It is the preliminary culmination of an entire range of large and small crises in SPD national associations .	-3.2627
And no one knows what comes next .	-1.2083
The misery began with the unexpectedly significant defeat in March ’ s Saarland election .	-3.0474
A blue eye , more not , the comrades at the time calmed down .	-3.5747
After the country elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia , things will be different .	-2.5446
That became the case - and it all became clearly worse .	-4.8838
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the taumen , the Düsseldorf bankruptcy smoothed the party .	-5.3572
The comrades worked hard again in the weeks afterwards .	-7.7941
Then , when they had just created new courage , the G-20 summit in Hamburg came .	-3.3118
And with him came the next lowering .	-1.9663
Mayor Olaf Scholz , the last strong SPD head of state , lost his nimbus on that weekend because he was in Elbphilharmonie while his city burned . was .	-3.8702
And because he then made quite a few mistakes in crisis communication as to what could be done wrong .	-5.5407
Since then , Scholz has been fighting for political survival .	-1.4026
Now Stephan Weil too .	-1.8633
Due to the VW exhaust gas tanker and its role in the supervisory board , the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has long been critic.	-4.4958
The brain poll numbers were added .	-5.0457
Yet , or perhaps precisely for this reason , Weil has been trying increasingly to accentuate in the accent over recent weeks .	-6.9131
The efforts of the former mayor of Hannover to expand his power in Berlin did not hide cooperatives around Martin Schulz .	-5.1996
They offered him because they promised to stabilise the party from Because .	-4.3795
The opposite could happen .	-7.2156
Because of this , the partisan twist of the Dutch Greens is basically not to blame .	-6.3504
And Schulz certainly not .	-2.6848
For the time being , the comrades are trying to keep their own ranks closed .	-3.8673
Her anger is directed at the Greens , and particularly at the dissenting parliamentarian , Twesten .	-4.2528
" It is intolerable and damaging to democracy , as Mrs Twesten puts her own careers ' interests above everyone else ' , says Matthias Miersch , leader of the party leftists in the SPD Bundestag Group , the editorial network Germany ( RND ) .	-5.4932
Mrs Twesten was elected to Parliament not because of her person as a direct candidate , but through the list of countries of the Lower Saxon Greens , so the Lower Saxon MEP continues .	-6.2501
The logical consequence would be for them to return their mandate .	-2.1262
Thomas Oppermann , head of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament , complains of an ' undemocratic manoeuvre ' .	-3.5076
" The will of the electorate was clear four years ago : people have made Stephan Weil the prime minister , " says Oppermann , who leads the Dutch SPD into the federal elections as a leader , the RND .	-5.5136
" Now the personal career of a future CDU MEP is falling the election result , " Oppermann continued .	-3.3396
He asked for the background to be cleared up .	-2.4372
I want to know whether there has been more or more commitments from the CDU in Lower Saxony .	-3.7591
Assistance for Corps III	-4.2275
Anyone who wants to rehabilitate his house after years can soon get support from the country .	-5.5554
The Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives STEG Stadtwicklungen will be informed on Wednesday .	-4.1384
At the beginning of the information event , Schindler once again gave a look at what has happened .	-5.1286
There have been receptions since 1991 .	-2.7607
Baden-Württemberg has taken over two thirds of the funding sum at that time , from 1991 to 2004 .	-4.5847
In the 2005 to 2016 rehabilitation area , the premium was still 60 % .	-4.7489
For shindlers , the renovations to date are a " success project " - it is important to promote interior development as well and not only to open up new construction areas .	-7.1794
On 4 April , the President of Karlsruhe was informed that there would be a recovery area III .	-4.5887
The funding amounts to EUR 833 333 , of which EUR 500 000 would come from the country , the rest from the community receiving .	-4.1387
How does a recovery area develop ?	-3.1249
We will continue to investigate where the " really old " houses are .	-3.6901
However , it is also important to see whether there is any interest in restoring the area .	-5.3202
If necessary , the territorial borders could then shift again .	-2.5158
The STEG represented Martin Keller , Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening .	-2.6312
Keller presented the contents of the Federal Country Programme " Social City " , in which the remedies would be carried out .	-5.3712
The core of the programme is the revitalisation of urban areas , the improvement of housing and work conditions and the maintenance and development of infrastructure .	-4.7311
The measures would be carried out object-related , i.e. per plot .	-3.8875
The recovery area would then be laid down as a statute .	-3.7652
The allocation period for funding has run until 30 April 2026 since 1 January 2017 .	-2.7818
However , until September of this year , the inventory would be carried out once again , in which the participants in the recovery area would have a questionnaire to fill in .	-7.4773
In November or December , a decision on the constitution is to be adopted so that the remedies can begin next year .	-6.3278
Pietzschmann then explained that every municipality must carry out the said preliminary inquiries .	-3.4274
It is a question of evaluating and deciding when to rehabilitate and to what extent .	-4.0509
There will be a refund in the Property Register for each property .	-4.9988
Pietzschmann will come back again after receiving and a picture of the situation , she promised .	-5.0614
Gotzel stressed that the project 's involvement was a major success factor .	-4.0501
There will therefore be questionnaires that will be sent by mail to the citizens in the coming weeks and that can be completed after the end of the summer holidays .	-4.9553
The yellow questionnaire is the " Archaeological and Property Archaeological Architecture " , which deals with the building state and the recovery intentions .	-7.0636
In the grey questionnaire , the " Household and Housing Arch " , details on the size , distribution and residents of a home can be made .	-5.5952
The blue " operating sheet " is only to be filled out when business spaces are operated in the building .	-4.6523
Please note , however , that a completed questionnaire is not simultaneously an application for funding .	-3.6447
Moreover , new construction measures are not eligible for funding .	-2.9758
Schindler also stressed that the distribution of funding under the " greyhounds principle " works - who comes first , prefers first .	-5.5297
You cannot ' reserve ' funding for later on .	-2.8997
In conclusion , photos of the " Ortskern II " project were still shown to make the attendants " tasty " .	-6.3556
British inventors are using a microchip to move in house and car with a handmovement .	-4.2460
A British inventor is the first in the country equipped with a microchip to open his front door , enter his office , and even start his car with a hand movement .	-4.0033
Steven Northam , 33 , had implemented the tiny chip between thumb and pointing finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology through their company BioTeq . . . with . is . is on . is on . on on on	-12.0290
He has joined forces with Dr. Geoff Watson , an advisory anaestheticist in the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester , Hants , to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards .	-4.0190
The technology resembles a cat and dogs implanted microchip and lasts only 30 seconds .	-1.6034
The company of Mr Northam also wants to change locks on houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for an additional charge of <unk> 300 per lock .	-4.5149
The married father of one has now installed both at home and at his BMW Z4 technology , which starts when his hand is in control .	-3.8284
White House 's advertising costs the taxpayer Thousands	-1.8415
The White House ’ s decision to fly a naval helicopter to South Lawn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month costs taxpayers up to $ 24,000 according to the military ’ s claims left to the TIME magazine .	-4.3284
The green and white Sikorsky VH-3D , known as Marine One when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on 17 July in the White House with American building programs .	-3.6587
President Donald Trump , Vice President Mike Pence , and White House officials made a round of products from all 50 countries .	-2.8383
The Connecticut helicopter was manufactured next to a yacht from Maine , a fire-fighter from Wisconsin and a Mississippi forklift truck .	-4.3414
The White House ’ s military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmented order or FRAGO , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn , following the records of Marine Helicopter Squadron One ( HMX-1 ) , the unit responsible for operating the helicopter .	-6.0042
" I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , " the commander of the HMX-1 wrote on the eve of the event his superior , the deputy naval commander for aviation .	-4.3510
The news showed that the helicopter hit South Lawn on 17 July at 3 p.m. on the South Lawn event , and it stayed until the grid was cleared on that evening between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 .	-6.4171
The note adds that if the departure from the White House were to be delayed , due to the limitation of hours , a second team would be required for the return flight .	-4.5227
The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event , while the unit security personnel remained on the ground during the time .	-3.9543
The records provided by the TIME did not make it clear whether a second flight crew was eventually required .	-3.9855
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes .	-2.1974
Data sets indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could violate the provision .	-2.9809
" One question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case , " the commander wrote .	-2.9773
" Sounds as if you are closed , " the deputy commander replied .	-2.9449
The " Made in America " event was described by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act .	-3.2629
But official events also have political overtones .	-1.6808
At the event , the President initiated the reform of the Senate ’ s health reform and promoted efforts to curb government regulations .	-4.5243
Using the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon .	-2.6548
Presidents are obliged to use them for the journey .	-1.7748
But asking for their use only for a photo OP is unusual .	-3.1200
Trump conducted an inquiry in February , when the presidential plane , against the background of his first campaign rally in Melbourne , Florida , and his Twitter account , is full of news that his predecessor complained about the use of the presidential aircraft .	-5.1467
" The White House is enthusiastic about the show " Made In America " - which shows products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials , " said the Deputy Press Secretary of the White House , Lindsay Walters .	-3.7157
HMX-1 crews often carry out training flights in the area around Washington and South Lawn to replace US president in the White House with precise centimeters .	-3.5022
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July , HMX-1 carried out 58 training landings in the White House .	-2.3978
The flight for the " Made in America " event counted during the training needs of the flight crew for the month , said an official .	-3.6001
Helicopter units also flew 11 hours this day for " non-presidential support missions " .	-3.8375
The White House said that taxpayers did not take over the burden of any of the other requirements presented at the event .	-3.1287
A speaker from Sikorsky said that the company had not been involved in exhibiting the helicopter on the South Lawn .	-3.7408
HMX-1 does not have budget records for presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .	-2.3539
According to the US Department of Defense for the 2017 financial year , however , the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is $ 24,380 per hour .	-3.4007
Unity records indicate the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia .	-3.5900
The White House argues that the actual costs of operating the helicopter are well below this rate .	-2.1369
" Setting the cost to taxpayers on the basis of estimates for the reimbursement rates is highly misleading , " said Walters .	-3.9881
'These estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds ' .	-3.3354
According to a 2015 RAND study , DoD reimbursement rates do not include personnel costs , but take into account the cost of fuel , maintenance and conclusion of the contract .	-3.8562
At that time , the former White House press spokesman , Sean Spicer , defended the deployment of the helicopter for the event .	-2.7946
" The idea is to present things produced in America this week , " said Spicer .	-1.5627
" And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not thousands , depend on it .	-3.1471
And I think , like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly .	-2.0731
It is , of course , appropriate to emphasise this . '	-2.5843
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter when he made a round about the South Lawn event , but he placed himself in the driver ’ s seat of a fire brigade .	-4.8810
In the White House , Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and talked with the media about his own fleet of corporate products .	-3.1993
'I know Sikorsky very well ' , the President said , ' I have three of them ' .	-1.9910
TC BW Neuss Before Tricky Tues	-2.7093
Leaders of the Second Tennis Bundesliga compete with the table third search sdorfer SV .	-5.5520
Tomorrow , the TC Blau-Weiss Neuss will join Kiel at the Table Third Suchsdorfer SV in Kiel from 11 .	-5.6205
Despite five matches , the top runner of the Second Tennis Bundesliga still has a staggering record .	-5.6850
Team chief Marius Zay has respect for the opponent .	-2.9538
" This is a compact team that always plays in quite a similar formation .	-2.1633
Especially on the back positions I find the team very good ' . . . . . . . . . . . . .	-5.2929
Imports from the High North are the main source for class and stability in the search village SV .	-6.2871
" Their Danes and Finns can even point to bets in the Davis Cup .	-2.7215
And they are also strong in double , " says Zay with a view to Harri Heliovaara ( Finland ) , Andre Göransson ( Sweden ) , Sören and Esben Olesen , Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus ( all Denmark ) .	-2.7431
" As always this becomes difficult for us .	-2.7262
You also need a good portion of happiness . "	-2.7393
The Neusser team for the trip to the far north is practically standing .	-4.1581
His debut for blue and white could give Maxime Janvier .	-2.4632
If the French , who is still active at the Challenger tournament in the Italian Biella , does not make it to the Bundesliga , the Zenek Kolar ( Czech Republic ) , playing in the tournament in the Czech Liberec , will be playing for the first time this season .	-8.7456
Hans Podlipnik-Castillo , formerly the unbeatable Chilene Hans Podlipnik-Castillo , was still in the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel on the ball yesterday .	-6.3634
But he should be in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschulp , Niels Lootsma ( both Netherlands ) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina .	-8.3216
After his two victories last Sunday against the Alster Club , Máté Valkusz could once again join the team .	-3.7205
If it is not enough for the 18-year-old Hungary , who was still the number one of the junior world rankings in January 2016 , someone from the Trainerstab around Marius Zay fills up the cadre .	-5.5955
How America Can Dash OMV	-2.6154
Donald Trump was not really happy when he signed on Wednesday evening under the law to tighten sanctions against Russia .	-3.4424
" In his haste to pass the law , " the Congress packed a few " unconstitutional rules , " he etched .	-5.5717
The response from Moscow was also as sharp as expected , and even Brussels fought against the US push .	-3.2729
After all , the draft provides for punishing European companies that help Russians build gas pipelines into the EU .	-3.2951
Consequently , domestic OMV investors have been worried since , co-financed the construction of Nord Stream 2 in Russia with other European companies .	-5.3862
The threat scenario is enormous .	-2.8203
However , it is too early to assess the consequences , according to the official statement of the oil company .	-3.6443
Indeed , Donald Trump himself would have to bring the sanctions to life by executive order .	-2.9906
Twelve weapons stand for him .	-2.7812
" The press " has looked at which the Group could defend and which could really hurt him .	-4.0767
Narcos Staffel 3 Trailer : Without Pablo Escobar , the Cali Cartel will be brought to the centre of Netflix ’ s hit series .	-4.3166
Despite the second season of Narcos , which Pablo Escobar Killer reveals , the series of Netflix is far from over .	-3.2549
The stages three and four were already confirmed by the streaming service , the first received their first trailer and showed the latest bad weight of the show .	-3.5650
With the third season , DEA has focused its attention on the richest organisation of drug trafficking in the world : the Cali cartel .	-3.8543
Led by four powerful patents , they operate " like a Fortune 500 company " only with more government bribes and violent actions .	-3.1258
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela ( Damian Alcazar ) is the leader of the cartel , Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , Pacho Herrera ( Alberto Ammann ) commands the Mexican connection , and Chepe Santacruz Londono ( Pepe Rapazote ) is located in New York .	-2.5355
In the newly published trailer , Pedro Pascal returns as a Javier Peña , the type that invites American and Colombian law enforcement authorities to support the war on drugs .	-3.3568
Further new actors are Matias Varela , Michael Stehl-David , Matt Whelan , Miguel Angel Silvestre , Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro .	-2.6065

Roll Reverse : The City introduces 46 kitchen aids .	-3.6129
The city organizes the Kita lunch table again .	-5.1227
With strong contacts for the children and a team allocation .	-4.6443
The clock is turned back in the city ’ s day centres .	-5.0787
On September 1 , Krefeld takes over the supply of food in the city ’ s children ’ s facilities ( Kitas ) again .	-5.9054
For Sonja Pommeranz , Deputy Head in Youth Aid , this is good news : " We were all very pleased " .	-3.9622
It is still cooked out of the house : a cater takes over this task and delivers fresh cooked cooled cooled .	-7.3582
The city operates in the Krefeld area of 46 children ’ s day centres , in 44 children get a warm meal at lunch time .	-4.2175
During the last year , 2800 children each sat on the tables , and the need is growing steadily .	-5.2692
" Meanwhile , not only children who are cared for 45 hours a week , in Kita at lunch , " explains Pommeranz .	-4.7472
" The offer is also valid in the 35-hour service when children stay until 2 p.m. " .	-4.4674
From September 1st , 46 part-time workers have kitchen service : they heat up the dishes supplied , add salads , raw food and fruit , portion the meal individually , hand out the meal , clean up , and clean the kitchen .	-8.1890
" The employees are firmly assigned to a kita , " says Pommeranz .	-3.1711
The size - there are two groups as well as seven groups - decides the amount of hours .	-3.1536
" The kitchen helpers are now firmly part of the Kita team , " says Pommeranz satisfied .	-3.1493
" In this way , they are much more involved and it is easier to implement pedagogical concepts for the capital . is . . is . is . is . . . with . . . .	-9.5954
It is also a question of healthy nutrition and cooking lessons .	-3.8136
" Children should help prepare food " .	-2.2124
The direct connection of the kitchen power to the team makes sense .	-2.8809
Also for the children .	-1.5287
" They have a known force in the Kita , a person who is familiar to them and not constantly changing people " .	-3.2733
This continuity is important for children .	-1.2305
The cleaning of the kita rooms - so far also the task of the kitchen staff - will be handled by special cleaning staff .	-4.8652
This variation - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has , in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen performance , also the charm that it has shown to be the most economical in comparing the cost to the city 's own government and foreign distribution , as the press office says .	-8.1288
This is despite the fact that 46 part-time employees are recruited .	-3.7243
" But these hours do not count so much for 750 people in the education area , " says Sonja Pommeranz . . . . is . . . . . . . . .	-9.6054
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN	-8.3028

" The role of women cannot be overestimated , " he said on Wednesday in a statement .	-1.3528
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women are fully involved and involved in all parts of the electoral process .	-3.1535
Afghan elections to the Provincial Council and the presidential elections take place on 5 April .	-2.5722
The Taliban have published threats against an electoral process that coincide with the transition from international combat to an advisory role .	-3.1780
This year , for the first time , the elections will hand over power peacefully from a democratically elected government to the next one .	-2.3482
Haysm said that a strong role for women will further reinforce Afghanistan 's democratic success .	-2.8712

Men try to Out 13 Years	-3.1177
Two young men aged 19 and 23 are expected to try to rob a 13-year-old girl on Thursday .	-3.7457
According to police information , the men spoke to the 13-year-old , who were with friends at Kolpingstra<unk>e , about 14.55 , because they wanted to make a phone from the girl .	-6.7216
The 13-year-old , however , rejected the request and continued with their friends .	-3.2574
As a result , one of the perpetrators tried to attack the girl 's cell phone and necklace , which was a mistake .	-5.5335
Without prey , the duo fled .	-1.7953

GMB concerns about investment in Glasgow ’ s McVitie factory	-2.0401
A trade union would like to check with managers of the biscuit manufacturer McVitie about the long-term commitment to production at their plant in Glasgow .	-4.2486
GMB Scotland said that the company has denied the future of investment at Tollcross ’ s site .	-4.6131
More than 500 employees work at the plant which , among other products , manufactures hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits .	-3.8479
McVities owner Pladis said he invested over GBP 5 million in recent years .	-2.8896
He added that employees and trade union representatives would be " experienced first " if their activities were to change .	-2.9056
In a letter to the company 's subsidiaries , GMB urged Scotland McVitie 's to ' express concern that funding for the modernisation of production lines would not be promoted ' .	-10.4199
GMB senior organizer Drew Duffy said : " The fact that we cannot gain clarity from the General Site Manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross concerns our members deeply .	-3.9412
Generations of families have worked here and the workforce is concentrated strongly on the local community and the Glasgow region , an important pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage .	-4.5111
That is why , in terms of jobs , wages and prosperity , and in the context of Brexit , the rising cost of living and chronic decline in production , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a thriving production presence at McVitie .	-4.8485
A spokesperson from Pladis said : " Tollcross has only received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday , and the company will respond directly to it , as we value the continuous commitment of employees and trade union representatives .	-6.0935
Two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross , where some issues were discussed openly .	-2.9954
We discussed with employees that , like all companies operating in a highly competitive and uncertain economic climate , we are constantly reviewing our business - and this applies to all of our divisions and sites - in order to remain competitive .	-4.8367
She added : " In recent years , we have invested over <unk> 5 million in our Tolcross-site , particularly in production lines and operational improvements .	-3.5480
We fully recognise the legacy of Tollcross as a production site , and if our operations change at the site , the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to know this . '	-5.4688
Has the PSG Barcelona warned Neymar three years ago ?	-1.4311
The La Lega side likes to regret its interest in Marco Verratti .	-2.7545
Paris Saint-Germain will not stop prosecuting Neymar after giving an offer of <unk> 189 million to trigger his release clause , but did she warn Barcelona three years ago before the world record attack ?	-5.1687
The sensational approach fuelled the transfer window in summer , because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than twice the previous mark , with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United last season for <unk> 89 million .	-4.1061
After finishing , Neymar becomes the world ’ s most expensive player and the world ’ s highest paid professional athlete .	-3.9378
Barcelona is angry at how Neymar forced his way out , despite a source close to the Catalan Executive Board insisting that the club has always done its best to address him since his arrival in Santos in 2013 .	-4.4703
But was the PSG President warned about this prospect three years ago ?	-2.5241
When Manchester City expressed interest in the signing of Blaise Matuidi in 2014 , Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strong warning for any club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PSG .	-4.2325
" I am not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players , we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact their players , " said Al-Khelaifi .	-3.1469
" We respect all clubs .	-0.6691
But if they try to sign one of our players , they will have consequences ' .	-3.2743
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish club at the beginning of this summer expressing interest in the PSG midfielder Marco Verratti .	-3.9016
PSG made it clear that it would not allow International from Italy to leave under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its prices for Neymar .	-3.6263
Rollers Distributed and Corrupted	-4.0315

The police are trying to witness an accident at the B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese .	-2.8460
Because he got a car on his track , the driver of a VW Touran had to escape and touched the guide plan .	-5.9067
On Thursday evening , the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum and his VW took the 215 from Stolzenau to Leese .	-4.4318
In the area of Stolzenau ’ s circumvention , he met a passenger car on his track , so he had to depart to the right . . .	-9.9917
The tour driver touched the guide plan .	-4.3875
Sachdamage was caused on the car .	-3.1495
The driver of the incoming car , a Mercedes Benz , had overtaken a lorry and continued his journey without taking care of the road accident .	-3.8667
It may be good , according to the accident manager , that the Mercedes-driver did not even notice the accident .	-4.4335
The police are now asking witnesses of the incident and the driver of the polluter 's team to contact the commissioner in Stolzenau on 05761 / 92060 .	-4.6344
Interview : ' Domspatzen report relieved Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger '	-2.2743
The Regensburg Domspatzen report on cases of abuse relieves Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger .	-2.5388
This is what author and historian Michael Hesemann means .	-3.1581
The final report on the misuse scandal at Regensburg Domspatten continues to provide discussion .	-4.4866
Christian Weisner , spokesman of the Reform Movement " We are Church " , explained after publication to the German press agency , he expected an apology from the former Regensburg Bishop and today Kardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the Cathedral Chapel master Georg Ratzinger , the 93-year-old brother of the emerited Pope Benedict XVI .	-5.8083
It would serve the image of the Catholic Church very much if Muller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret at their own omissions or their misjudgement at the time .	-4.9500
The Vatican newspaper " Osservatore Romano " , on the other hand , criticised the fact that ' double standards ' would be applied to reporting violence in domestics .	-4.8182
As far as the attacks in Regensburg are concerned , nobody doubts that these are ' shameful and shameful deeds ' which should be punished and prevented in the future ; it is striking , however , that the ' degree of medial manipulation ' , according to the author Lucetta Scaraffia , historian and member of the Italian Committee on Bioethics , is stri.	-6.9871
" The habit of describing the Catholic Church as a source of all evils is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to consider it normal , " writes Scaraffia .	-3.7683
In the interview with the Bavarian broadcasting company Fürstin Gloria von Thurn and Taxis , he also said : " You like going to the church and that is a fried one " .	-6.9848
She also pointed out that in her youth " shots were a very normal educational means " to deal with cheeky children , as I was . "	-5.3184
They would find it unfair to apply today ’ s benchmarks to previous decades , for the world has changed .	-6.8555
In connection with the reports on abuses , the Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger also appeared .	-4.0543
Unjustifiably , author and historian Michael Hesemann , who wrote with Ratzinger the memorial book " My brother of the Pope " ( translated in 12 languages ) .	-4.7394
" I have to protect Georg Ratzinger , " says Hesemann , " because all this had nothing to do with him , " he values the results of the final report .	-4.0015
What exactly is the 440 page report presented by the lawyer Ulrich Weber , appointed by Bistum Regensburg with the Enlightenment ?	-3.0104
In total , 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were " sexually abused " between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s with high plausibility " victims of assaults , 67 domspatches were sexually .	-6.8841
The final report refers to Georg Ratzinger , who worked in Regensburg between 1964 and 1994 : " In summary , it is possible to note that , in many cases , forms of physical and mental violence were used by Domkapellmeister R.	-5.3396
Especially with a high degree of emotion , pupils could be punished more severely .	-4.9618
Nonetheless , unlike many other accused , it is noticeable that many victims valued the general humanity of R. and , therefore , in many cases , even combining positive memories with him , despite the violence . . . . with . with . . with . . with	-10.9522
In the interview , Hesemann explains why the final report on the misuse scandal at the Regensburg domains Georg Ratzinger in his view relieves the burden on him .	-5.2702
Mr Hesemann , the 440-page report on ' incidents of violence in the field of deforestation at the Regensburg domiciles ' gives a contradictory picture of dominator Georg Ratzinger .	-6.6815
On the one hand , many students highlight its " humanity " .	-2.8015
On the other hand , it also appears as a cholera and perfectionist , who often became handy when a Domspatz musically did not produce a top performance .	-12.8517
How do you view this final report as your biographer ?	-2.0160
Michael Hesemann : If you take the trouble to read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask why the name Georg Ratzinger is actually there .	-5.7135
He is just eight pages dedicated to him , and he is clearly exempted from any suspicion of mercy or co-knowledge in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .	-6.1916
The pre-school violence processes also took place outside his sphere of activity .	-4.3690
At best , he can be accused of having experienced it too late or of not taking seriously enough initial observations .	-5.1264
The Domspatzengymnasium in which he worked was perceived by virtually all respondents as " revelation " , " heaven " and " better world " .	-4.9904
For example , the vast majority of his students , Georg Ratzinger , testifies to him as " warm-hearted " , " popular " , " honest " , " competent " and " comprehensible " , as extremely good teachers who regularly provided the boys with cakes , biscuits and bonbons and " always relocated from children 's grapes " .	-6.5348
Only a minority complains about its perfectionism and its high emotion , which has already led to rage .	-4.2392
He himself admitted , deeply regretted , and apologized for the fact that not only did he flap with stools and threw the key bond on the ground , but also spread ear-figs and drew excessively cheeky guys on the hair or ears .	-8.8672
It must be said , however , that such educational methods were widespread in the period in question , the 1960s and 1970s , both with parents and with teachers .	-4.6728
Do you also know such breeding methods ?	-2.2543
Of course , I think any of us born before 1968 .	-2.4735
I have seen this in a secular school , a state gymnasium .	-3.0525
Compared with what this report is about , that is , the appalling sexual abuse and the pre-school violence , this is , of course , a trivial matter .	-5.7177
One wonders whether it has to do with his fame and role as brother of Benedict XVI that many media have just plunged into him .	-4.6775
The Bavarian Pope is a lot of people who have never understood him and are still passionate .	-6.1317
The truth is , however , that the report relieves Georg Ratzinger on every aspect !	-3.2850
A great deal has been reported in the media in connection with the report on the subject of abuse in the Regensburg Domspatches .	-4.9257
In the final report , will Georg Ratzinger be accused of any ill-intentioned or ill-advised abuse ?	-5.7579
Michael Hesemann : Well , no .	-1.9634
Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claims to have entrusted themselves to the Domkapellmeister .	-3.3749
Not even parents were inaugurated .	-1.6842
" I never dared to talk to my father or mother , " a stakeholder deputising for others said , " It was all very embarrassing to me " .	-5.8861
The real problem in educating sexual abuse was , and is that most victims remain silent from shame .	-3.9190
If they did not even entrust themselves to parents and siblings , then certainly not to a choir leader who would have been , in a professional sense , a colleague of the perpetrator .	-5.4667
How do the Domspatzen-Schüler Ratzinger assess the role of abuses ?	-4.5794
Michael Hesemann : A student questioned it as follows : " Regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he ( Georg Ratzinger ) would have had timely findings and could have stopped the perpetrator .	-5.8297
I think it <unk> also really absurd to think that he has calculated that <unk> Buben has opened up more forcefully , clearer or even more , than towards their parents , boarding directors , trust teachers , etc .	-11.6666
That he is talking about sex ... - unthinkable ' .	-2.3801
The report thus comes to the very clear conclusion : ' the fact that the pupils and / or their surroundings were entrusted to him in advance could not be confirmed within the framework of the investigation ' .	-5.8384
So , as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg Ratzinger must free himself from all cognition .	-4.6297
Nor can he be accused of having not prevented or brought him to display .	-4.3976
There is therefore no reason to link his good name to these repugnant crimes , as has unfortunately happened in some cases . .	-3.7230
The media have read a lot about " violence processes " at the Regensburg Domspatches .	-5.7246
The former dominator Georg Ratzinger is accused in the report " Wegscheuen " .	-4.9771
Does he have to live with this accusation ?	-1.9334
Michael Hesemann : This is the big problem that everything in the reporting was mixed and mixed into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere in the middle of it , Georg Ratzinger .	-5.3754
That is , however , exactly what the report is being misused .	-3.4682
There is a clean separation : between the pre-school and the gymnasium of domestics , between sexual abuse and the processes of violence and , let us say , other accusations .	-5.9229
In addition , the report deals with incidents dating back to 1945 , including four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not chief choir of domestics .	-5.4133
All the horrific caning pedagogy , the cases where boys of sadistic teachers were regularly harassed and malleable , including horrific suffering , all occurred at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen , where truly scandalous conditions had to be ruled .	-6.6481
But they had nothing to do with the Cathedral master Georg Ratzinger , for he got the boys to face only when they were already on the Domspatzengymnasium .	-5.8070
On that was , as most witnesses emphasize , the subject of " pre-school " tabu .	-4.2301
One was only happy to escape her and enjoyed so much better treatment and for many even " paradise " conditions .	-2.5831
What was different about the Domspatzengymnasium ?	-1.9486
Michael Hesemann : there was already discipline , but not sadistic violence .	-3.2408
This also applies to Georg Ratzinger , in which the report concludes that ' many victims have appreciated the general humanity of R. and , therefore , in many cases , even connected positive memories with him , despite violence ' .	-9.0110
At most there is still the accusation of having looked away .	-3.7856
Despite all efforts , however , the report has been able to define only two periods in which it has been reported about pre-school conditions .	-4.5641
The first time in 1970 / 71 , when he just started to establish himself and did not hear anything from what was happening at a school where he didn 't know and was responsible ( according to the witness ) , and then back in 1993 .	-7.7076
Will Georg Ratzinger consistently close the ears before the conditions ?	-3.1554
Michael Hesemann : No , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium , which the report even reproduces .	-3.1724
In that , he points out to him that ' the caning penalty continues to be practised in pre-school ' .	-6.6199
In view of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent intervention .	-2.9577
This was , of course , at a time when there was legal clarity when caning was long ago banned in Bavaria , too .	-3.4573
Before that , they occurred in a legal grey area , as we all know .	-3.4512
It was hard for him to assess where the people affected were perhaps exaggerated or dramatised and where the limit was really exceeded .	-5.5970
Nor can we say that he has always looked away .	-2.9754
That is simply not true .	-1.1570
In 1980 , caning at schools was officially abolished in Bavaria as well . in . , with in .	-4.6709
For Fürstin Gloria von Thurn and Taxis , yes , it was unfair to apply today ’ s educational standards to that time .	-4.3635
How do you see that ?	-1.2684
Michael Hesemann : We historians talk about the " pitch of anachronism " , i.e. the danger of judging the past according to today 's moral standards .	-4.5990
The Prince is right there .	-5.9383
However , this does not apply , of course , to sexual abuse , which at all times was abhorrent and not to what was concealed in the pre-school of resentment and violence against innocent children ’ s seeds , well beyond what was usual at the time .	-7.8460
That is all very horrible and I am glad that it is finally being dealt with .	-3.6740
At the same time , however , I must protect Georg Ratzinger , because all this had nothing to do with him .	-3.1033
His means of disciplining and punishing , that is to draw earthquakes and hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .	-5.8988
When physical punishment was then banned , he also strictly adhered to it .	-2.9726
What image of his Regensburg period did Georg Ratzinger reflect in talks with you for the book " My brother of the Pope " ?	-3.8329
Kam the subject of caning ?	-3.9109
Michael Hesemann : Well , the book is about the life of his brother Joseph , Pope Benedict XVI , tells from his perspective , since the domains played only a side role .	-4.4028
Nevertheless , I do not hide the fact that he led a strict regime there .	-3.9758
But this , too , must be said : without this perfectionism , without the demand for unconditional discipline , it would have been impossible for him to form an institution of world rank from what had been known as Regensburg until then , true cultural ambassadors of Europe and its musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the US ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .	-8.4661
With biscuits and bonbons alone , one does not make an irresistible singer and stand before every success , no matter what area , but always discipline , passion and self-overcoming .	-6.8951
As what kind of person did you experience Georg Ratzinger when talking about her book ?	-3.0795
Michael Hesemann : Through the work on the book and beyond , I have really experienced Georg Ratzinger as a wonderful , humorous , groundless , deeply believing and heartbeat person who cannot imagine that he could do anything to just one fly .	-8.2209
I regularly get to know how many ex-dominated spats still today , 23 years after his empathy , keep in contact with him regularly , read him - he 's almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family .	-5.6160
So those who have not yet forgiven him that he was once strict with them are clearly in the minority .	-3.8251
Most domspace is now thankful to him for having enriched their lives and brought the world of music to them .	-4.6653
And that he was always a good , fatherly teacher - a strict father , of course , that may be - but also a loving spectrum of respect , to which she still looks today and to whom she is honored .	-8.3693
I would like to make it quite clear that all the accusations made to him are educational methods which were then on the agenda .	-5.6711
We can be glad that we have long since overcome this time .	-2.9188
But it is highly unfair to make a man a man , just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother , a media scapegoat .	-3.7606
The evil intention behind this is all too obvious .	-2.0578
The report that has just been published relieves it .	-2.7714
Now it would be fair to have a 93-year-old man who has earned a great deal of merit , and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps even Germany , no one would know the rain-burning domains finally to be left in peace .	-9.7161
