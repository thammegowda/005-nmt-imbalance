Gutach : More Security for Pedestrians	-2.2698
They are not 100 metres from each other . On Tuesday , the new B 33-pedestrian ample at the village parking lot was launched in Gutach .	-7.0976
Two installations so close to one another : the intention or the line of signs ?	-4.9974
This question was clearly answered by Gutach 's mayor yesterday .	-2.1992
" The town hall pillar was installed at that time because it secures the school path , " Eckert explained yesterday .	-4.1384
The Kluser traffic lights secure both cyclists and bus passengers and mountain residents .	-3.1155
The plant which was officially launched yesterday was important for the crossing area Sulzbachweg / Kirchstra<unk>e .	-3.2973
We have the museum , two churches , a spa park , a bus stop , a doctor and a bank as well as the flow of traffic from the residential area <unk> Grub <unk> .	-3.9408
" In the case of high traffic and pedestrian incomes , Eckert had to take another traffic light to ensure their safety .	-5.8842
This is also confirmed by Peter Arnold of the Landratssamt Offenburg .	-2.5308
" According to current measurements , approximately 12 000 vehicles pass through the municipality of Gutach on the B 33 daily , of which about 10 % are heavy goods vehicles , " emphasises Arnold .	-5.5962
Therefore , the building of another traffic light is more than necessary : " Security is just going ahead " , according to Arnold .	-5.9847
A total of four traffic surveys were carried out , and a roundabout was also considered , but because of the narrow crossing in the Sulzbachweg / Kirchstra<unk>e .	-7.3614
The first test was made by Arnold in the choice of the traffic lights : " In the middle of an extra wooden trunk for us with particularly long trunk trunk trucks , we tested whether these vehicles can leave the Sulzbachweg to the B 33 without knocking over the traffic lights " .	-10.6146
The approximately EUR 15 000 traffic light system itself is the ' most modern on the market ' , explained Arnold .	-4.9375
The complex is equipped with colourful LEDs , which shine so intense that the lights from the drivers , for example , can be seen well in the sunshine .	-8.4123
And it is also economical : the older light systems consume about 100 watts , the new just eight watts .	-4.6209
There are three light systems per direction .	-1.9727
Arnold explained the technology of the new plant : this is equipped with two radar sensors .	-2.4826
If the pedestrian pushes the traffic light button , the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation .	-4.0560
If the road is free , green comes immediately for the pedestrian , if not , it takes about 15 seconds .	-2.8420
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase can be completed for the pedestrian .	-3.3093
" If a group or handicapped people go on the road , the green phase is extended , so everyone arrives safely via the tram , " said Arnold .	-6.1201
Of course , drivers must be involved in this as partners and watch the road .	-4.6279
This was not the case yesterday : hardly showed the traffic lights for pedestrians green , smoked a upper class vehicle - at bright red .	-4.4758
Josef Winkler has been writing for more than 30 years his childhood and youth from the soul .	-8.4578
The Kärntner poet has often described the disasters of his Catholic village childhood - the lack of speech , the persistence of raw violence and blunt sexuality , the anguish and freelessness .	-5.8650
The Büchner prize-winner is especially known as a pro author , theatre texts are rare in his work .	-5.3053
Collage from prosatexts Gerhard Fresacher composes for his performance " Weatherluchten auf der Zugenspitze " , which is now available in Garage X at St. Peter 's Square , hence a collage of prosatexts .	-6.3910
The theater maker , for example , combines elements from the autobiographically influenced novel " Der Leibeige " ( 1987 ) with Prosaminiatur from " Leichnam , his family trembling " ( 2003 ) .	-6.0040
On the largely empty stage - an important requirement : a cracked sofa , which is additionally copied and masturbated - the eight-headed ensemble is hindered by the text material .	-6.7393
In doing so , director Fresacher seems to be relying on the text .	-6.5772
The 70-minute performance outperforms the template with an abundance of directories known as the repertoire of post-dramatic forms .	-4.0447
The actresses are sometimes rather dubious .	-4.9371
They are tough dressed with their heads under water , spotted with their evening drops to the wall .	-6.4736
Twisted in cellophane or renees , they stack on dangerously high plates through the staging , either monologize loudly or lie completely silently on the stage floor .	-5.2831
The text , however , is hardly mediated in this painstaking way .	-4.5774
The best moments have the evening when sung - the bandwidth ranges from Deep Purple to popular songs .	-2.2982
Only towards the end will the overlapping performance become a little calm , and Winkler ’ s subsequent absurd humor stays up .	-6.3144
A black box in the car ?	-1.3670
US road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the decreasing high-way system , and believe to have found the solution in a small black box that can be found in the dashboard of each car .	-5.9986
The devices that record every kilometre spent and report information to the authorities are at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and federal planning offices to revise the outdated system for financing US roads .	-4.3293
The usually boring area of road planning has suddenly unleashed an intense debate with colourful alliances .	-3.9822
Libertarians have allied themselves with environmental groups and argue that the government can use the small boxes to record the kilometres driven – and possibly also where they have been driven – and then use the information to calculate tax costs .	-12.2192
The Tea Party is horrified .	-1.5113
The American Civil Rights Association ( ACLU ) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of data protection concerns .	-2.9218
But , while Congress cannot agree on what to do , several states are no longer waiting .	-2.8891
They are currently examining how to switch over the next ten years to a system in which drivers pay per mile driven .	-4.4695
Thousands of drivers have already tested the tachographs , some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring .	-8.6671
That really is a must for our country .	-1.4582
“ It ’ s nothing we can only use , ” said Hasan Ikhrata , Managing Director of Southern California Assn. of Governments , who is planning to record the miles taken on all California drivers in the state from 2025 .	-5.1097
The way in which we pay those taxes will change .	-9.2154
The technology for this is there .	-1.7807
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund , financed from the taxes that Americans pay at the fence , is broken .	-3.3466
But America is no longer as big as it used to .	-4.0554
Cars use less petrol .	-1.3110
The state petrol tax of 18.4 cents per gallon ( less than 4 Eurocents per litre ) has not increased for 20 years .	-3.3012
Politicians dare not to raise the tax just to a cent at high spray prices .	-4.2568
“ The petrol tax is simply not future-proof , ” says Lee Munnich , an expert on transport legislation at the University of Minnesota .	-3.6167
Its state recently equipped 500 cars with tachographs to test a miles based payment system .	-3.2533
“ This is the most sensible alternative in the long term , ” he said .	-2.6270
Bureaucrats call it a miles based user fee .	-2.6768
It is not surprising that the idea is inspired by urban liberals , because the tax could , for example , be used to influence driving behaviour in such a way that congestion and climate-damaging exhaust gases are reduced .	-5.1372
California ’ s planners rely on the system for formulating policies aimed at achieving the federal state ’ s ambitious , legally anchored goals on climate change .	-5.1937
But the Republican Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania , Chairman of House Transportation Committee , has also stated that he sees the most viable long-term alternative .	-3.1716
The Reason Foundation ’ s free marketers are also inspired by the idea of allowing drivers to pay for the journey back .	-5.8559
“ This is not a tax disappearing in a black hole , ” explains Adrian Moore , Vice-President of Reason Guidelines .	-2.4873
People pay directly for what they get .	-1.1654
The movement is also supported by two former US transport ministers , who , in a report in 2011 , had called on Congress to move toward miles based reckoning .	-4.1698
The US Senate last year approved a $ 90 million pilot project that would have comprised 10,000 cars .	-2.8267
But the majority in the House prevented the push and responded to the concerns of rural MEPs representing people who often have to go to work or town on a daily basis .	-5.9174
Several states and major cities nonetheless move in that direction .	-3.4720
Oregon , which currently accrues 5,000 drivers for the country ’ s largest experiment , is the most dedicated .	-5.1626
These drivers will soon pay the mileage fee instead of the petroleum tax to the state .	-3.7251
Nevada has already completed a pilot project .	-0.7235
New York City is also considering such a thing .	-1.3574
Illinois tests it to a limited extent with lorries .	-2.5632
And the I-95 coalition , which includes the Ministries of Transport of 17 states on the east coast ( including Maryland , Pennsylvania , Virginia , and Florida ) , is currently examining how to introduce the change .	-3.4967
The concept is not a universal hit .	-0.6068
In Nevada , where 50 volunteers were equipped recently , drivers were sceptical about the idea that the government could pursue any of their movements .	-3.4674
“ Concerns against Big Brother and such things were a big problem , ” explains Alauddin Khan , Head of Strategy and Result Management in the Ministry of Transport in Nevada .	-3.8501
People did not want it .	-0.7556
When the test started , the Nevada ACLU warned on its website : “ It would be relatively easy to convert the tachographs into adult surveillance devices . ”	-4.1471
There is no need to build a huge , bulky technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data about the daily movements of individuals .	-3.6750
Nevada belongs to a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology , with which the state can capture the kilometres driven , but not exactly when and where .	-4.0617
As Khan said , public opinion would also be more reassured .	-2.6878
The hunt for this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California .	-2.0435
The company did not initially join to help states tax drivers .	-5.6553
Rather , its aim was to take root in an emerging market for car insurance , where drivers are to pay on the basis of the miles they have taken .	-5.8128
However , the devices they test are also interesting for road planners because they do not work with GPS and provide only limited information that is regularly uploaded via modem .	-4.3355
“ People are more willing to participate if their speed and location are not recorded , ” Ryan Morrison , Managing Director of True Mileage , declared .	-3.1735
Some of these public pilot programmes have made great mistakes .	-2.3525
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways of doing this .	-2.0075
In Oregon , planners experiment with giving car drivers a number of choices .	-2.9103
You can choose a device with or without a GPS .	-1.6254
Or they choose no device at all and pay a flat rate based on the average mileage spent by all nationals of the state .	-4.5736
Others hope to be able to sell the concept of a distrustful public by providing the devices with more functions than with some . .	-3.8942
In New York City , traffic officials want to develop a tax device that also pays parking fees , pays insurance only for kilometres hazardous , and collects speed data from other vehicles in real time , enabling drivers to evade traffic congestion .	-6.3146
“ Car drivers would be motivated to participate by the added value of the benefits that the system offers , ” says the city ’ s planning document .	-3.4506
However , some road planners are wondering whether all talk about the pay per mile is not just a huge diversion .	-4.3526
At the Metropolitan Transport Commission for the San Francisco Bay area , officials said that Congress could solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund simply by increasing fuel tax .	-4.2352
An additional one-time fee or annual levy could be imposed on drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that use little petrol so that they also pay a fair share .	-4.0904
“ There is no reason for an operation if an aspirin is enough , ” explains Randy Rentschler , the head of the Commission ’ s legislation and public affairs .	-4.6046
If we do , hundreds of millions of drivers will be concerned about their privacy and many other things .	-3.2862
Königsfeld : Small team BeWacker	-7.4572
The Voluntary Fire Army handled its autumn test despite lack of personnel with Bravour .	-4.5805
Only 11 men took part in the exercise .	-1.6477
Commander Hans Kammerer , in his training assumption , had chosen the property feather in Burgberger Stra<unk>e .	-4.7517
A short lap should have been produced there during singing .	-5.1874
Two people were injured by the resulting fire and smoke development , but one of them was still able to send an emergency call .	-4.6592
After the first review of the situation by Hans Kammerer , two breathing guardians of the Wehr agreed to enter the building .	-5.1204
After a short time it managed to find the first person and pass the outside .	-3.7192
The second person had to be worn .	-0.8874
This was not so easy as there was also a narrow staircase to be overcome .	-4.8009
The building , a workshop with integrated stables for two horses , was not easy to secure .	-2.3878
It stored a lot of wood and also strawballs in it .	-2.6990
Further there were electric woodworking machines .	-2.7149
The first solvent was carried out via the tank in the vehicle .	-3.0544
Another line took place over an overflow hydrate at about 100 meters distance .	-5.3609
Three solvents have been implemented .	-4.4511
There was also a ray tube used in the building .	-3.6348
Hans Kammerer was also interested in showing what can be done with low-cost staff .	-6.0063
In the event of a serious accident , the Königsfeld daily operations group will support you .	-5.0533
The command was satisfied with the procedure .	-2.5018
Networking universities and firms	-2.2264
On his visit to the district of Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald , the president of the country , Guido Wolf , was also informed in Titisee-Neustadt where the came . in . .	-7.1126
At the Highschwarzwald Förderzentrum he studied this important issue with the executive shoulders of the occupational schools , the Kreisgymnasium and the parent committee chairman .	-8.2365
" Education is an important location factor " , emphasized Claudia Stehle , director of the Hans-Thoma School , who presented the networked school education centre High Black Forest .	-4.1929
Wolf was impressed by the training model projects .	-1.7465
Since 2011 there has been a successful collaboration between the Förderzentrum , Kreisgymnasium and Vorschulzentrum in the Wdistrict . is . with in . with . in . with . .	-8.9281
He also praised family friendliness in the county .	-2.6135
" It is important not only to have the family stage in mind , but also due to demographic change the phase to care for relatives , " said Wolf .	-5.0521
He also stated that more and more workers were looking after the care and care of their relatives .	-4.1863
" Without the support of employers , the resulting burden on employees can lead to an end to employment , " said Wolf .	-3.7786
But no one can afford to lose skilled workers , he continued to say . . , .	-3.9467
Another particularly important factor is the networking of universities and businesses .	-2.6202
" For those who have learned the benefits of the region during his studies , with his acquired knowledge and skills , often remain the regional economy , which helps to strengthen the region , " the president of the country was convinced .	-7.4021
Only if adequate training places were offered can the specialist demand be met .	-4.4318
In his opinion , the location advantage of the district is its advantageous location in the southwest of Germany , close to France and Switzerland .	-4.4113
In addition , on his journey from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg , he experienced the efforts already made to expand local public passenger transport .	-5.7013
" Stay stubbornly and make public transport better , " he said to the local politicians present .	-3.8486
Living with music an entertaining afternoon	-2.2060
For 15 years the Kaul family has been inviting the Dietinger seniors to coffee , cake and then to a Vesper .	-4.2294
Previously , the elderly were carried out in the resting place .	-4.5450
Meanwhile , this afternoon is taking place in St. Josef ’ s nuhome . with . with . . with . . . . . . .	-9.2882
Locals were delighted with the delicious cakes and cakes .	-3.9263
Later there were sausages .	-2.1511

The more than 100-year-old natural stone wall as the frontier demarcation of the old courtyard to the Kirchstra<unk>e , which is in front of the renovation , is to be set again with the reconstruction plan of the city of Bräunlingen .	-8.6892
In the days before Kilbig , a small angle wall was built during the first works of the renovation of the front school house , stabilizing and static discharge of the natural stone wall with balustrade , which dates back over a hundred years .	-7.2435
According to Alexander Miskok of the Bräuinlinger Stadtbauamt , the provincial monument is to be included in the planning and a remedy for the old wall .	-8.0497
The aim is to calculate the costs by experts , who will then be put on the table to the Council of Ministers for deciding and defining the way forward .	-7.3984
A decision on this will probably be taken next year .	-2.2541
After the rehabilitation , plastering and cottage flanking of the old inner courtyard within the two side wings of the school built in 1912 , it will soon be necessary to rehabilitate the needy limitation wall from scratch and put on new substructure .	-9.4194
The historical , one hundred years old demarcation wall of the old church church house , is mainly due to water and frost damage , since no drainage is available , needs renovation and has an archway forward .	-7.9103
Deep cracks in individual stones are testimony to weather damage , but the wall is currently not at risk of collapse .	-4.4430
A steady wall is a prerequisite for a school school school school student using the latest fortification work .	-5.7311
Originally , school rehabilitation was planned even in 2008-2009 , but high unscheduled expenses caused a shift .	-4.8802
An important word on historical school renovation , even used for film shoots , will be the National Palace Office .	-5.1638
If the rules of this site are set , then the city of Bräunlingen hopes to receive grants from the monument guardians .	-6.9540
The students of the Bräunlinger primary school , who are now taught again in a well-renovated old school building with new Aula , will soon be able to use the old school .	-6.4008
<unk>zdemir wants to receive jazz education in Stuttgart .	-2.0751
Cem <unk>zdemir , Chairman of the Greens , has now also been involved in the ongoing discussions on the future of music schools in Baden-Württemberg .	-8.9096
" I think it is wrong to abandon holistic training at the Stuttgart Music School , " said <unk>zdemir the " Stuttgart News " .	-3.8394
Jazz and Classic belong together at the jazz location of Stuttgart .	-3.4955
In this way , <unk>zdemir , who is regarded as a favorite for a direct mandate at the federal elections on 22 September , is opposed to the Green Red State Government .	-6.3086
On the basis of an expert study , this is forcing a reorganisation of the five music schools in Baden-Württemberg .	-5.1629
Jazz and Pop will then be transferred from the Stuttgart Musikhochschule to the Mannheim Musikhochschule .	-4.7596
US Border : A Super Tunnel to Drug Smuggle	-4.0711
On the border between Mexico and the US , investigators discovered and decommissioned a ' super tunnel ' to smuggle drugs .	-3.1356
As the US customs authorities informed , the more than 500 metre long tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity , rail tracks and a ventilation system .	-4.3923
Three suspects were arrested , eight tonnes of Marijuana and nearly 150 kilograms of cocaine seized .	-2.9201
According to data , the tunnel has not yet been used .	-2.9189
" These cartels are stupid when they think they could go through the radar , " said US District Attorney General Attorney Southern California , Laura Duffy , at a press conference in San Diego , where it was discovered an end to the tunnel .	-5.0238
Duffy told the drug gangs : " If you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them , we will be determined to make your dirty money a huge waste " .	-5.3059
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are fighting drug cartels permanently .	-2.9135
Since 2006 , more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug crime .	-2.0186
Constructed by Experts	-0.8306
Due to the lavish furnishings of the tunnel , the investigators assume that it was constructed by architects and engineers and that the building took up about a year .	-4.7156
The track was equipped with electric cars .	-3.5559
On the Mexican side , access is located in a building that is 80 meters from the border .	-3.6033
According to the authorities , a ladder leads 20 metres into the depth to the actual tunnel entrance .	-3.0903
The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 meters of altitude and 90 centimetres width .	-3.2949
It would also have been appropriate to promote illegal immigration towards the United States .	-3.0773
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine fund .	-2.2337
The third , a Mexican , was caught because of the seized marijuana .	-3.0102
All three threaten , as officials have said , the maximum sentence of lifelong freedom deprivation .	-4.0761
Eight such tunnels have been discovered since 2006 , and the San Diego press conference continued .	-1.9348
It is the first time that cocaine was found in such a tunnel building .	-2.8209
Normally cocaine is smuggled in smaller quantities , not through tunnels .	-2.2488
This shows the ' despair ' of the drug gangs whose traditional routes have now been cut off , said Bill Sherman of the DEA drug prosecution in San Diego .	-4.8193
They would do everything to enter the US .	-2.0696
No details were given to those arrested , at least one was Mexicans , it said .	-3.7428
They have to face imprisonment for up to ten years .	-2.1350
In 2014 , Geisinger ’ s Day	-3.2971
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250 .	-2.1604
Returning to the first historical reference is coming ever closer .	-3.9289
When the year ends in good eight weeks , the anniversary year is approaching .	-4.2112
Geisingen und Kirchen-Hausen wurde 794 erfolgreicht erfolgreicht erfolgreicht .	-5.9119
A document was produced in churches in which both towns were mentioned .	-3.8183
On March 15 there is to be an official start to the anniversary year , and since Geisingen currently has no hall , this initial event takes place in church houses , where both were mentioned for the first time before 1250 years .	-6.6205
During the anniversary a number of events are planned both in Geisingen and in Kirchen-Hausen .	-3.9600
Kirchen-Hausen will be 1250 on a festive weekend from July 18th to July 20th .	-3.6907
celebrate a return .	-3.9026
On Friday with a festival , on Saturday and Sunday with a feast around the church hall .	-3.4601
The Church Hausener Kirchenfest is also celebrated at this festive weekend .	-4.9623
City music director Rudolf Barth has written an order composition for the city during the anniversary which will be listed at three dates .	-4.9773
On the 21st of June together with the Sunday celebration of the Black Forest Association , on July 12th in the Arena with fireworks and on December 13th the first concert of the city music in the new festival hall .	-6.1350
This is completed and inaugurated in the anniversary year , the official date is last September , 27 and 28 September .	-4.8046
On the occasion of the Geisinger Stadtjubiläum , a new chronicle is also being released .	-15.6176
" It is not only a chronicle of violins themselves , but also a printed work on today 's violin , which consists of ghosts , churches , corpses , audits and gutmagings , " says Mayor Walter Hengstler .	-9.1860
And today ’ s violin celebrates 2014 birthday , 1974 today ’ s space was realized with the incorporations .	-5.4781
The new chronicle will be presented in the new festival hall in Geisingen on November 21st or 22nd .	-4.2193
2014 , however , is also another year with many anniversaries .	-3.3655
The strawglonki narrative begins on the 8th of February with a customs evening on the occasion of its 60-year anniversary , the harmony of Gutmadingen will be 90 years and will celebrate the banquet on the 29th of March and will celebrate the district music festival on the 1st to 4th of May .	-7.6425
The Altenwerk Leipferdingen is 40 years old , the Geisinger School has been at the new location for 50 years and celebrates this on May 10 , the Musikverein Polyhymnia Leipferdingen is 150 years old and celebrates this in the context of the Brunnenfest from July 4th to 7th .	-5.5062
The town of Geisingen was mentioned for the first time in the history of 764 in a certificate owned by St. Gallen Monastery .	-4.5714
The certificate was made in churches ( houses ) , which was then a place of jurisdiction .	-3.3369
Both communities are therefore mentioned in the same document .	-2.4099
Since 2014 this 1250 year should be celebrated accordingly , in addition to this the municipal reform is still 40 years old .	-6.7330
The Council is targeting track bases .	-2.7312
Should the rail transit " Am Hirschen " be carefully rebuilt to increase road safety ?	-5.0899
Yes , the local councils decided .	-1.5116
Shield tach must take responsibility for this EUR 220 000 .	-4.0850
Deutsche Bahn intends to improve the Kinzigtal rail network next year .	-3.0495
In particular , the safety of rail passes is to be improved - regular collisions of trains with other vehicles across the country .	-6.0613
If the municipalities agree to the reconstruction measures , they must take part in the costs by one-third , the rest share the railways and the federal states .	-6.6189
Schiltach City Master Roland Gri<unk>lor explained to the municipal council the peculiarities of the " Am Hirschen " bath hill .	-5.7785
There the city plans to build a hole in the height of the tunnel mouth west of the railway tracks .	-5.1267
Big vehicles , such as long-timber transporting , could also be in the trains without blocking the track .	-7.0589
As a result , Greek owners proposed to construct a necessary support wall in such a way that the city could disseminate the subsequent road in due course in order to ensure a smooth flow of traffic .	-6.7775
This was controversial in the municipal council , because some Councils cast doubt on the need for road proliferation : Thomas Kipp , in his words , put the mood of the critics on the point : ' Do we have to make so much money available for so few vehicles ? '	-7.4690
Mayor Thomas Haas contradicted : The Hirschen railway crossing is used regularly for long-timber transports .	-4.7989
Even timber from the Kuhbach area is partially transported over this route , because the vehicles up to 20 metres long could not use the route on the Häberlesbrücke because they could not turn into the main road .	-6.1936
In addition , the route serves as a transit for those vehicles that cannot use the tunnel when the main road is closed , Haas argued .	-3.8584
In view of the fact that Kirchberg and Schlossbergtunnel would have to be rebuilt and renovated , as is currently the case in Wolfach , the railway crossing " Am " Hirschen could also have an important transport impact for a long period of time .	-6.9407
The Councils agreed to have a look at the cost of the intended distribution of the roads .	-5.0652
Notwithstanding this , the majority of the railway transition was agreed with the assumption that the necessary support wall would be built in such a way that the city could develop the subsequent road towards " Bahnhofstra<unk>e " , if necessary for meeting traffic , to some 5.5 metres .	-8.2092
On the other hand , the conversion of the Trautwein railway line could lead to a completely different problem , affecting the entry into the rapidly rising " Geroltzhäuser Weg " .	-7.4448
The administration had investigated the train restructuring plans from the engineer 's office Breinlinger , because she had doubts about whether the planned connection to the Geroltzhäuser Weg would be possible without further ado .	-7.1187
The investigation concluded that it was not to be ruled out that road inclination could lead to longer cars being seated .	-6.3372
The responsibility for this , in turn , lies with the city as a road load carrier .	-3.5823
Consequently , the rebuilding could lead to liability disputes .	-4.3622
Haas argued that since both the timber drilling and the turning off in the current state of development worked , the conversion of the rail transition should not be agreed .	-7.0728
Even at this point , the risk of a collision of the train with a car on the transition is significantly lower than at the other railway crossings , because it is directly next to the stop point in the middle , to which there is a good view connection .	-8.6732
Even trains from the main station should have been cut off at this point so that no collision threatens .	-5.6308
Most people refused to approve the rebuilding of this railway transition because the city of Schiltach had to " disrupt the problem with suspension vehicles " , according to the councils , since the railway can withdraw from responsibility after the construction work has been completed .	-9.3376
The body considers the reconstructions at the railway crossings " Before Heubach " and " Before Kuhbach " , for which cross-agreements have already been reached with the train .	-5.9257
Esa decides on major space missions : Billions of missions .	-2.9260
Far planets , waves of gravity or black holes - European Space Agency experts now need to agree on two major projects that they want to launch in the next few years .	-4.5120
30 proposals were available , five are still in the race .	-2.2204
Far worlds .	-1.1365
More than 1000 planets of other stars have already found astronomers .	-2.1829
Whether , at least , there are some of them , nobody knows .	-3.5716
The choice is difficult : Should you search for waves of gravity ?	-3.9611
Or rather explore the origin of the cosmos ?	-2.0017
Or flag with imaginable planets and discover some alien life ?	-6.7611
These are the questions that the leaders of the European Space Agency , Esa , are asking .	-8.2373
For their " Cosmic Vision " programme , they are looking for ideas for two major space projects that are intended to advance research significantly .	-5.6818
The budget for such ' L missions ' is approximately EUR 1 billion each .	-1.5886
The start is expected to be 2028 and 2034 .	-1.5929
In early September , the elite of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions .	-2.2240
30 ideas were discussed , and five of them have now entered the closer election .	-4.9037
Many bodies examine the proposals , hook up with researchers .	-3.4995
A final decision will be taken in the next few days by the scientific programme committee .	-3.0012
The Esa has chosen four major questions , to which the missions of the Cosmic Vision programme , initiated in 2007 , are to find answers .	-5.5038
What are the conditions for the emergence of planets and life ?	-1.8269
The exact events surrounding these stars are still in proverbial darkness .	-3.6779
A major infrared elescope in all could permeate this dark .	-5.2125
And if a star has planet , under what circumstances can life develop there ?	-3.5366
To answer this question , the space telescope " Cheops " will be launched in 2017 , which will examine 500 already known planetary systems in our area .	-5.7286
But the possibilities are limited , Cheops is a small mission with a budget of EUR 150 million .	-7.5303
With larger instruments , astronomers could map probable planets , and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres , searching for " biomarkers " : gases that are considered to be indicators of biological activity .	-5.2912
How does the solar system work ?	-0.9369
This question , too , is ultimately intended to indicate the conditions for the creation of life .	-5.9398
The magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field as well as the particle radiation it emits with the planet system play an important role .	-4.4806
In our solar system these processes can be examined exemplary .	-2.8522
With the ' Solar Orbiter ' , the Esa has already approved a M-class mission ( the budget is about half a billion euros ) for this issue .	-4.7096
The probe should start in 2017 and watch the surface and activity of the sun closely .	-3.7701
Jupiter and his moons are of great interest to researchers .	-2.2258
They want to find out what role the Giant Planet played in the development of the solar system .	-3.1583
For this purpose , Esa foresees the first of the three L-missions of the Cosmic Vision program .	-3.8921
The song " Juice " ( Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer ) is expected to begin its journey in 2022 .	-2.2262
Eight years later she reached Jupiter and was supposed to investigate the atmosphere of the planet and the icy moons of Europe , Kallisto and Ganymed .	-4.6506
What are the basic physical laws of the universe ?	-0.7743
The universe offers many opportunities to study matter under extreme conditions and to investigate whether the laws of nature we know are still valid there .	-5.2304
Perhaps there are also deviations that could guide physicists to a new theory , under which all known laws of nature can be combined .	-5.5947
How did the universe emerge , and what is it ?	-6.8345
Our cosmos was created by the big bang 13.7 billion years ago .	-2.5882
In addition to the matter we are accomplished , from the stars , planets and creatures like us , there are dark matter , whose gravity holds galaxies and clusters of galaxies together , and Dark Energy , through which the expansion of the space accelerates .	-6.5316
So far , researchers do not know which physical laws were valid in the first second breaks of the big bang , nor what constitutes Dark Matter and Dark Energy .	-5.8308
With ' Euclid ' , the Esa has already approved a M mission , which is scheduled to be launched in 2020 .	-4.5516
With a special telescope , the probe is supposed to investigate the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time throughout the sky , thus enabling conclusions on the nature of dark matter and dark energy .	-6.2842
Who could make the race	-1.8074
Of the 30 proposals , only two will be left at the end of the selection process .	-2.4627
In the opinion of many experts , the best chances of authorisation as L mission have been E-Lisa , a challenging concept to prove waves of gravity .	-5.5208
This includes physical changes in the structure of space , which Albert Einstein predicted almost 100 years ago .	-4.3640
To date , they have not been proven .	-1.9841
Elisa could achieve this , the scientists hope for the project .	-2.8419
The mission provides for a two- or three-probe detector that is deployed in space .	-3.2592
In contrast to the Earth 's plants , it could also prove waves of gravity that emerged at the big bang , providing new insights about the development of the cosmos .	-6.5365
Four other proposals are still competing for the second L mission : a large X-ray escope called " Athena " , which is intended to explore black holes , " Icy Planets " , another mission on the outer planet of the solar system , " Prism " , a mission to measure the cosmic background radiation , and the " Exoplanet Finder " , which is meant to detect and investigate the earned planet .	-7.4568
Among other things , proposals on mars rehabilitation , research of moon , venus and asteroids , and solar physics are already excluded .	-7.2976
Snowden is prepared to “ cooperate with Germany on US surveillance . ”	-2.0899
Edward Snowden , the whistleblower of the US intelligence service , has stated that he is ready to travel to Berlin and to announce before the German Bundestag if the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander do not give answers about their activities .	-4.6682
The German MEP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden in Russia on Thursday , where this asylum was granted to discuss with him the statement in Germany .	-2.8689
In a letter from Snowden , presented to the media in Berlin on Friday in Ströbele , he writes : “ Even though the result of my efforts has been proven to be positive , my government continues to treat a divergent attitude as a breakthrough and seeks to criminalise political expression with a threat of criminal conduct that cannot be defended . ”	-7.6662
The truth is not a crime .	-2.0431
In the letter , Snowden writes that he is convinced that the support of the international community can persuade the American Government to drop the charge against him .	-4.5190
The US Department of Justice charges include espionage and theft of state property .	-2.7792
The German Minister for the Interior , Hans-Peter Friedrich , said to Time Online : ‘ If Mr Snowden is prepared to speak with German representatives , then we will find ways to make that possible ’ .	-4.6628
Relations between the US and Germany have been burdened by claims that the NSA has listened to Chancellor Angela Merkel ’ s phone .	-3.8392
Thomas Oppermann , the Member who chairs the parliamentary committee responsible for the secret service , said that one should seize the opportunity to listen to Snowden as a witness , if possible , ‘ without jeopardising him and completely ruining relations with the US ’ .	-5.0044
Ströbele , a Green MEP , published a picture of himself and snowden in his Twitter feed .	-2.4537
He was accompanied during his visit to Russia by two German journalists .	-5.0838
Ströbele explained that , according to the lawyer of the former NSA employee , Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country .	-3.3257
If Snowden says in Germany , he needs an assurance that he is ' safe ' there , the honourable Member says .	-4.2007
In his letter , Snowden explains that he sees a “ serious and ongoing ” campaign of persecution that has driven him out of his home .	-10.0665
But it is touched by the global response to “ my act of political expression . ”	-2.5663
Citizens around the world , as well as high-level politicians – including in the United States – have described the revelations about an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance as a gateway to the general public .	-8.9634
In his letter , Snowden offers the German authorities an offer of cooperation “ if the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation have been resolved . ”	-3.2786
Frontier Airlines charges for hand baggage .	-1.3823
Frontier Airlines plans to demand up to $ 100 of passengers wishing to baggage on their flight .	-4.1676
Frontier Airlines intends to calculate up to $ 100 for one piece of hand baggage and $ 2 for coffee or limonade , even if the announcement on Wednesday was that passengers could keep the whole dose .	-4.7234
The new charge applies to hand baggage in the baggage compartment above the seat , small bags under the seat remain free .	-3.0262
Frontier said that USD 25 will be charged if the fee is paid in advance and USD 100 for passengers who paid only at the plane .	-6.2301
Front spokesperson Kate O 'Malley said that the charge of $ 100 is aimed at moving travellers to care for payment in advance .	-4.4184
“ We do not want to calculate this sum , ” she said .	-2.5191
Airlines started to charge for the first and second items of baggage in 2008 .	-3.3535
Passengers who tried to circumvent them have therefore put as much of their hand baggage as possible , which means that the baggage compartments are often overcrowded .	-5.0037
Charges are one way to get passengers less on board .	-2.1143
O 'Malley said that the new fee is not really about earning money .	-2.0939
It is the most loyal customers of Frontier who had clearly stated that it would be increasingly difficult to find space above the seat .	-5.5938
Passengers purchasing their tickets on the airline website do not have to pay .	-2.8433
This means that a passenger may carry a piece of baggage with Frontier for free , but the next person may pay $ 100 for a comparable baggage .	-12.2234
O 'Malley explained that the Frontier website and check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers are informed of the fee before they arrive .	-4.7212
Frontier 's new hand baggage charge will only enter into force in the summer , and there is no precise date yet .	-4.6187
Passengers often bow to baggage surcharges and other charges , but airlines are keen to return to them .	-4.6598
They argue that baggage transport cost money and passengers should pay this service if they wanted it .	-3.2921
Many on Wall Street see the new baggage charges as a sign that airlines are taking enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of loss .	-3.5706
Most have so far left fingers of hand baggage charges .	-3.1401
Spirit Airlines Inc. requested first hand baggage charges three years ago and later Allegiant Air , also a low-cost airline .	-3.4420
The only other airline with such a charge is the Hungarian Wizz Air , announced by Airline Consultant Jay Sorensen , who closely follows the additional charges .	-4.6199
He estimated in a December 2011 report that the hand baggage fee Spirit would raise $ 50 million annually .	-3.7002
Sorensen , formerly a leading position at Midwest Airlines , recently flew to Spirit and was curious to see what he would expect from a flight if passengers were confronted with the company ’ s unusual hand baggage charge .	-13.2244
“ The boarding process was one of the most smooth I experienced in my career in aviation , ” he said .	-2.6929
I expected to see teeth nirks and hands-on discussions at the climbing .	-4.5700
“ The plane was full , ” he said , “ and boarding ran like lubricated . ”	-2.4228
Frontier is also following the $ 2 for coffee , tea , limonade or juice .	-3.6259
The company explained that passengers buying limonade or juice should retain the whole dose and make coffee free .	-5.2400
Water remains free of charge .	-0.8836
In 2008 , US Airways attempted briefly to demand money for soft drinks , but reversed this seven months later after passengers had complained and no other large company had retracted .	-5.7311
Frontier ’ s move to charge hand baggage if passengers do not buy directly from the airline is the latest initiative with which customers should be directed to their own website .	-4.4516
Airlines pay online travel agencies such as Orbit 10 to 25 USD per ticket sold .	-2.7429
This gives all companies an incentive to move passengers directly to the buying , rather than through an online travel agency .	-5.4329
Frontier , however , has gone most far in this area .	-3.0613
In September , the company began issuing only half the number of frequent flyer miles when booking via an online travel agency .	-4.0874
On Wednesday , miles were once again cut to 25 % of the route .	-2.8101
For this reason , a flight trip booked by a third party with Frontier over 1000 miles will only bring customers 250 miles .	-5.6354
Passengers can also book seats directly on the Frontier website .	-3.3553
Frontier has a faithful client base at its headquarters in Denver , but the business is shrinking and the company loses money .	-6.9011
The revenue fell by 9 % , and flight capacity fell under 13 % in the first quarter , as read in the financial report published by the parent company , Republic Airways Holdings Inc . , on Wednes.	-4.7194
Republic has attempted to control Frontier ’ s finances within the framework of selling the company .	-4.3235
Talk to the Bible	-2.5844
Some 40 women attended the last female breakfast this year in the evangelical parish Bisingen .	-2.9864
The theme of the day in the municipal hall were " proverbs from the Bible " and " medieval speeches " .	-4.9152
Zita Köhler , Chairman of the Church Council , received a lecture on the biblical saying after breakfast .	-3.8182
" Say words contain lifestyles , rules , or warnings , " she explained .	-3.2834
It compared several proverbs with the corresponding biblical places and explained the meaning .	-3.0312
She called saying : Wood eye is watchful as scales fall from the eyes , cast an eye on someone who gives His the Lord in sleep , wash his hands in innocence .	-5.7011
On several occasions the speakers also advised their listeners what the saying was .	-4.5019
The medieval saying took on the parish of Christel Dehner : all good things are three , blue , hate something .	-4.7955
She explained the meaning and origin of the speeches she called ' bridges to the past ' .	-2.7638
Finally a raffle was lost .	-2.9610
Prices were drawn on a table , and were humorously rewritten before being passed on to the winners .	-5.9836
Visitors of the breakfast round also mixed mayor Kandidat Roman Waizenegger .	-4.5119
Learning instead of Unemployed : pilot project for unskilled people in tourism	-3.4666
On the Mecklenburgische Laenplatte , a pilot project for the tourism industry started .	-3.7620
Under the leadership of the Federal Employment Agency , 49 women and men who already work as unskilled workers in the sector are to be qualified over three winters for hotels and restaurants .	-4.9599
" New to this is that the six-month courses end with qualifications , " said Carmen Wiechert of the Employment Agency Neubrandenburg .	-4.0845
The benefits would be multifaceted : the participants would not be unemployed , firms would receive trained professionals , who were lacking in hotels and restaurants , and the agency would not need to finance unemployment .	-6.1355
The project also includes the Chamber of Industry and Commerce in Neubrandenburg as well as the German Hotel- und Gaststättenverband ( Dehoga ) Mecklenburg Vorpommern .	-4.8858
NSA says that “ internal error , ” rather than hackers , are to blame for the crash of the website .	-4.6962
The shadowy National Security Agency explained on late Friday that a mistake had gripped her public site for a few hours and not hackers as was claimed online .	-5.0263
“ NSA.gov wasn ’ t available for a few hours this night because an internal error occurred during a planned update , ” explains the Spionagency in an e-mail message sent .	-7.1602
The problem will be resolved this evening .	-1.5763
The claim that failure was caused by a distributed Denial of Service attack ( DDoS ) is not true .	-2.3975
In the early evening hours , online server trackers noticed that the NSA website was not available for at least six hours and this is still not available for some users .	-4.1584
Before that , a speaker from the NSA told ABC News that the authority ’ s sensitive internal network was “ in no way . ”	-3.2919
Secret information is not in danger , according to the speaker .	-1.7738
At least one group of hacktivists claimed to have paralyzed the NSA website with a DDoS attack .	-3.3146
In such an attack , the target site is flooded with page views until the server is overloaded and the site collapses .	-4.0397
Cybertactics are relatively simple and attacks do not serve to penetrate the target system 's internal network .	-2.7467
The former super-secret NSA , whose nickname once was No Search Agency ( no such authority ) , is now in the light of the public , and is exposed to sharp criticism following the revelations made over recent months about its wide-ranging surveillance program in Germany and abroad – a result of the secret NSA data stolen and published by the disillusioned former NSA employee Edward Snowden .	-7.1930
The growing controversy surrounding the secret service spurred initial speculation that the incident today was the result of a targeted cyper-operation .	-4.4373
Easily declined the number of people without jobs in October by 22 to 1,307 .	-3.6012
While 3.1 % of the quota was better than last year and better than in September , " we had hoped for more , " says Monika Felder-Bauer , Deputy Deputy Deputy Head of the Employment Agency in Sonthofen .	-5.0920
Many companies have reacted to hitherto in terms of attitudes .	-4.7051
One reason for this is , according to Felder-Bauer , ' we have few skilled workers in the craft sector , in the health care sector and in the care of the elderly ' .	-5.6949
Since September , employment opportunities for staff in the hotel and catering industry have been underway again .	-4.6986
The winter season starts in mid-December .	-2.4260

Bombardier ’ s loss of profit following a decline in supply figures and orders	-4.8458
The Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15 % decline in net profits on Thursday , after being pressured by declining orders and deliveries on aircraft in the third quarter and contract problems in the railway economy .	-5.4169
Bombardier , based in Montreal , also did not publish flight test data for his brand new CSeries aircraft and did not provide any new information as to whether the aircraft could go into commercial use next September according to the ambitious timetable .	-6.6224
On the maiden flight of the test aircraft a year and a half months ago only three more launches were followed , which makes it questionable whether the test phase is scheduled .	-6.5084
Results fell behind the forecasts and led to a price turnover of more than 8 % on the Toronto stock market .	-5.3183
Cameron Doersen , Analyst at National Bank Financial , lowered his evaluation on Thursday from “ outperformance ” to “ sector performance ” with a view to the fact that the shares have limited potential in the next one to two quarters .	-5.4507
“ Although weaker delivery rates were widely expected in aircraft , we are clearly disappointed by margin development in the transport sector , ” Doersen said in a customer letter .	-5.8787
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries when the aircraft testing programme is proceeding .	-4.1456
However , if new orders are not announced in the coming months , we expect the market to become more sceptical towards the programme .	-3.5998
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft series can catapult the company into the lower market segment currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus .	-2.0647
The first test aircraft was presented to the public in March , and after months of delays it first flew in September .	-3.8972
But , so far , binding orders for CSeries are moderate with 177 , as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests and want to see whether the company ’ s claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost savings in the new nozzle traffic aircraft are relevant . on . is on on . on . is on on . on on . on . on . on	-11.6912
There are currently 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies .	-1.9993
Chairman Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will achieve his objective of 300 binding orders at the beginning of the commercial use of the jet .	-3.6699
The management of the company also assured analysts and media on Thursday that the programme was scheduled .	-3.3525
“ The test aircraft no longer stayed on the ground than expected , ” Beaudoin said at a telephone conference , adding that while the aircraft was staying , ground tests and software updates were scheduled .	-5.7762
Each manufacturer plans different .	-2.3839
We have decided to make a first flight and then to have a revision period , as we have done .	-5.3750
This is happening throughout the programme .	-2.2803
The second of five test aircraft is expected to start in the next few weeks , the rest shortly afterwards , it was said of company website .	-5.0735
However , analysts remain sceptical as to whether , twelve months after the maiden flight , the first customer can launch a CSeries aircraft .	-3.8542
Bombardier explained that it verifies the planning for commissioning ( EIS ) and will update it in the next few months .	-4.0066
“ The slow advance of the flight test – even if it obviously corresponds to bombers of internal planning – reinforces our view that commissioning is shifting to the first quarter of 2015 , ” Doersen said .	-5.1808
In the third quarter , with the end of September 30 , Bombardier ’ s net profit fell to $ 147 million , or $ 8 cent per share of $ 172 million , or $ 9 cent per share in the previous year .	-4.0810
The adjusted profit per share is unchanged 9 cents .	-2.9859
Sales declined slightly and declined from 4.2 billion dollars to 4.1 billion .	-2.6447
Analysts expected a profit of 10 cents per share and a turnover of $ 4.56 billion , according to Thomson Reuters I / B / E / S.	-2.6263
The world ’ s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer indicates that he has delivered 45 aircraft this quarter , a decline of 57 last year .	-4.1324
Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26 .	-1.5694
The order book for the aerospace service was $ 32.9 billion on September 30 , and was therefore unchanged on December 31 .	-4.5217
“ In the field of aerospace , the results were in line with our specifications , but low order intake and overall market conditions were disappointing , ” said Beaudoin .	-4.9140
Sales in the aerospace business fell 13 % to $ 2 billion .	-2.8952
Bombardier , the world ’ s largest railway manufacturer , announced that sales in this range increased by just under 11 % to $ 2.1 billion .	-3.1791
The order book in the transport divide was $ 32.6 billion on September 30 and was thus slightly increased on December 31 .	-4.3946
The profit margin in the area of transport was affected by settlement problems with some major contracts .	-4.0770
According to company management , new guidelines will be set for the fourth quarter .	-3.7360
In afternoon trading on Thursday , the Bombardier stock dropped by 8.5 % and stood at 4.83 Canadian dollars , after it was announced that the Google-Finance Board will switch to the Board of Directors Patrick Pic.	-5.6469
The Brazilian Embraer SA , the world ’ s third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and bombings of the closest rival , reported a ten-percent decline in quarterly profit on Thursday .	-4.7667
USA ’ s Flying Boy of Los Angeles	-3.9346
On Friday morning ( local time ) an unknown person fired shots at LAX airport .	-4.3156
Whereas the airport ’ s management informed Twitter that the shooter was in custody , the Los Angeles Times reported that the man was dead .	-4.8174
A security man was also killed .	-2.0578
Media also reported several injured .	-2.2418
US President Barack Obama is constantly informed of the situation , said White House spokesman Jay Carney .	-2.5003

Hundreds of people were taken to safety from the building .	-2.2605
Users on Twitter published photos of a special command and a gun lying on the floor .	-2.8847
The incident began at 9.30 a.m. ( local time ) , as the airport management told about Twitter .	-3.9897
The access roads were blocked , which , according to the CNN , resulted in long returns .	-5.5752
Until landing , aviation had been temporarily suspended .	-3.6900
However , on CNN several planes were observed at startup .	-4.6495

Cocaine Dependent attorney who warned against police investigation must be imprisoned .	-3.9634
Basharat Ditta , 42 , passed on information to the Underworld ’ s size Neil Scarborough .	-3.4898
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug dependence could come to light .	-3.5768
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Crown Court .	-1.3566
A well-known criminal defender who warned a drug baron against a major police investigation because he was afraid that his secret drug addiction could be detected was sentenced to three years in prison .	-4.7555
Basharat Ditta , 42 , underworld sizes provided Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about his activities in the drug trade after being compromised by his own cocaine search .	-4.1820
The “ first-class ” lawyer with the nickname “ Bash ” was arrested in 2011 in his house after the police supervised Scarborough , which he had represented in a previous drug procedure .	-5.2485
Officials watched Scarborough ( 32 ) deliver three bags of cocaine at the house of lawyer in Blackburn , Lancashire , while he was with colleagues at a dinner of the bar .	-5.2794
The investigation revealed that Ditta regularly consumed Class A drugs after traces of cocaine in its hair , its wallet , and credit cards had been found in tests .	-3.9368
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011 , he tried to obtain unauthorised information on the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners .	-2.7227
All four suspects were supervised by the police in the course of a major investigation into the heroin and cocaine trade in Lancashire , Cumbria , Merseyside , Berkshire and West Yorkshire .	-3.3308
Together with 32 others , they were later arrested after the police secured heroin and cocaine in a number of house searches , worth <unk> 1.5 million , and <unk> 200,000 in cash .	-4.8005
Ditta , 42 , passed on information to criminals because he feared his drug dependence could become public .	-2.2040
Today , Ditta , who works for Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn , was found guilty and sentenced at the Liverpool Crown Court , following a three-week trial .	-4.2410
He gave up cocaine ownership during an earlier survey .	-2.7608
The lawyer was convicted after the police found that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011 in her investigation against Scarborough .	-4.3169
Two investigators followed the suspect and saw how he went to Ditta ’ s home , where he put the drugs under the lawyer ’ s garbage with a purity of 60 % in a black golf glove .	-5.2210
Shortly after supplying the drugs , Scarborough regularly telephoned with Ditta , who was at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park .	-4.0551
The lawyer returned home , took drugs , and nine communications were exchanged between the two .	-2.4474
It was announced in court that Ditta was a “ regular consumer ” of cocaine after having been discovered in Class A testing drugs in his hair , his wallet , and on his credit cards .	-5.4879
Ditta was arrested later , but contested taking cocaine and said he spoke to the presumed dealer because he was his client , claiming that her discussion was “ lawyer secrecy . ”	-4.9631
During his arrest Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards , but they were secured and taken out of hair-sample .	-4.9535
At the police interrogation , he said that he would operate both under his private address and in the workplace an office and a client would call him at home for legal matters .	-5.7101
The court was informed that he had called important actors in the drug trade , some of which he had represented before , after significant arrests and that he had informed the investigators about them .	-6.5553
Prosecutor Anne White said : “ A criminal prosecutor should know better than anyone else that the law is not being broken . ”	-6.7245
Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal defender , since he has admitted himself too much with certain clients .	-4.1090
The relationship in question is not simply that of a drug trafficker , but of a drug trafficker who supplies his lawyer with drugs .	-3.3676
Some of his communications were undoubtedly legitimate , because he was the lawyer of these people .	-2.7439
But this went well beyond the limits of a normal relationship between lawyer and client .	-2.6074
He fought as much as possible against police investigations , so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities .	-7.5262
Mr Ditta has called his profession into disrepute .	-2.8271
He was too close to certain clients , especially Scarborough , and he allowed his independence to be compromised .	-1.9944
Ditta had no misconduct and claimed : “ If I were a corrupt lawyer , which I was not , and wished to pass information on to Scarborough , I would not wait for 15 hours but do so immediately . ”	-6.0906
But , after the hearing , superintendent Lee Halstead from the police in Lancashire said : “ Mr Ditta has taken the step from a criminal defender to a criminal at the moment he started to buy drugs from organised criminals . ”	-4.9446
His dependence on cocaine led to a hopeless compromise and made him susceptible to the motives of leading members of organised crime , who commissioned him to obtain valuable information on police investigations .	-3.8677
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure confidence and confidence in the public .	-3.0056
Ditta has lost this trust and tried to get bogged down behind the facade of his profession .	-4.6314
The Lancashire Serious and Organised Crime Unit led investigations against Ditta , which also led to a condemnation in three cases of cocaine and judicial impediment , highlighting our determination to bring criminals to justice .	-4.9052
This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that nobody can escape the arm of the law .	-2.7817
We will find you and bring you to court .	-1.6079
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after declaring guilty of conspiracy for heroin , cocaine , and cannabis trafficking .	-3.1597
Thirty-five more people involved in the drug trade were sentenced to total punishment of 153 years for drug crimes .	-3.7253
On his website Ditta published an area of questions and answers about himself in which he said that his dream job was to represent clients in the death cell in America as a lawyer , his ultimate guest at dinner was Mohammed Ali and inequality of opportunity is the motivation for his work .	-5.6235
Revolutionary Art Work	-6.9999
At the end of the celebrations of its 160th anniversary , the Liederkranz Dunningen will frame two services of God with the " Deutscher Messe " by Franz Schubert .	-6.2372
After the great success of the music " Rock my Life " , which was enthusiastic by the spectators in the spring of this year , at the end of the anniversary year , the band will enrich two services with the performance of the German Fair by Franz Schubert .	-6.5771
On Saturday , October 26th , this extraordinary fair will take place from 19 during the evening fair in St. Martinuskirche Dunningen and on Sunday , October 27th , at 10.15 a.m. at the church of St. Johannes Baptistkirche in Lackendorf .	-5.6290
The so-called Deutsche Messe with the original title " Gesange zum Feier des holy Saxons des Messe " , D 872 , is a spiritual music by composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was considered almost revolutionary at the time of its creation .	-6.4497
The fair is performed within the framework of the services provided by the client Johann Philipp Neumann in mind .	-4.8921
Under the guidance of Hermann Schneider , the choir is accompanied by the blues group of the Musikverein Frohmus Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi in the organ .	-3.6717
Haslach : Skepticism V	-3.6816
The 2015 Parliamentary elections will , for example , change fundamentals in the Hasach ( SE ) community .	-4.8491
There is then only one parish council for all six parishes .	-2.6829
On Saturday , the bodies from Hasach , Hofstetten , Mühlenbach , Fischerbach , Steinach and Welschensteinach prepared for the changes .	-3.7654
Because the fundamental decisions of the diocese are nothing more to be changed and it is up to the parish councils to implement them as satisfactorily as possible .	-4.8703
In the course of the day , it became particularly clear that skepticism toward the new is diminishing , but increasingly confident .	-5.6772
From ideas and expectations of the innovations in 2015 to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the parish council , the extremely constructive talks of the six bodies with the main officials of the Maritime Service Team ran .	-5.6102
The regional decan Georg Schmitt explained on the basis of a presentation the new guidelines for seal units in the archdiocese of Freiburg .	-4.6136
In the future , the SE Hasach , as the church community , forms a body of public law that enters into the rights and duties of the six individual church communities .	-6.5319
There will only be a common parish council and a foundation council , in which the parish is represented .	-5.0935
At least two elected members are to be represented from each parish and six parish teams are formed on the ground .	-5.2141
Their task will be to promote ecclesiastical life in the city .	-3.9564
When it came to the finances of the individual parish there was a great need for discussion .	-4.6742
The innovations provide that accumulated funds in the parishes are kept to the target .	-5.7295
On the other hand , liabilities are transferred to the general community .	-3.6811
There was great concern , particularly with regard to the large planned investments , whose commitment then affects all the parishes .	-5.5076
" Even in the past , investment was made only in projects that were managed by the individual parishes alone " , relativized Hasah 's parish chairman Bruno Prinzbach .	-5.1847
Practical experience with a common body for five parishes , Barbar Knight , chairman of the board in the Schutterwald-Neuried Marine Region .	-5.1645
They had set themselves up in 2006 , ' becoming one , five remain ' and found that this is not so easy .	-6.2837
The bodies of the Hasacher Maritime Unit then decided to answer questions about the future composition and size of the joint parish council and the practical work of the community teams .	-5.7653
The drafts will be clarified at further meetings and adopted at another joint meeting of all six bodies next spring .	-5.8447
In the end , the parish Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the Maritime Unit , which was approved by a clear majority .	-4.6661
In Güllendorf , the electricity is becoming more expensive .	-4.2191
Citizens pulling villages must adjust to higher electricity costs .	-3.3966
As the managing director of the municipal works , Jörg-Arne Bias , confirmed against the S<unk>DKURIER , additional costs are increased to a four-person pool village family between 70 and 90 euros per year .	-6.3172
The main reason for the upcoming price increase is the increase in the so-called EEG shipment from 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt-hour .	-3.8359
This shift is reconfigured each October by the four operators of the large electricity roads .	-5.4679
These include the additional costs incurred by the change in energy , which they can charge by levying the electricity price .	-6.4547
The Village Municipalities are the last link in this chain .	-4.2987
In his forecasts , the Energy Company Supervisory Board had even assumed a higher leverage , as Jörg-Arne Bias reported .	-3.3377
Now the concrete figures would have to be calculated before the municipalities could inform their customers about the exact price increase next week .	-4.1325
" We are going from an increase of 1 cent plus x " , says Bias , where the number is more close to the 2 cent .	-3.9451
Duration lights : Eight to wait	-5.2367
Sometimes a traffic light is not green .	-2.6777
The contact loop in the street doesn 't react , or the light sign is broken .	-7.6381
What should be done - driving at red ?	-3.3689
If a spokesman has waited long enough on a red light and the crossing is free , he can continue , explains Stuttgart 's lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine " Motorrad " .	-4.9759
The waiting time , however , must be ' appropriate ' , which can be interpreted differently on a case-by-case basis .	-3.5450
Becker advises to stay for at least five minutes before starting from a traffic light disorder .	-4.1206
However , if you continue on the journey despite red light , you must be aware that it is entirely to blame for an accident caused by it .	-5.2515
Those who tolerate less than five minutes may not wait long enough , warn Becker and point to a decision by the High Court of Hamm .	-3.9175
In the negotiated case , a driver ignored the traffic lights after about three minutes and was responsible for a negligent red light breach .	-5.7052
The traffic lights were not broken ; they turned to green a little later .	-4.4276
He was not allowed to travel because of the particular situation - but not the fine .	-4.4300
The Community ’ s Council is pleased with sound Budget	-4.7872
Whenever it comes to household municipal meetings , Mayor Ralph Gerster has laughed well .	-4.9393
The local bakery in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled , and debt has no longer known the administration since 2005 .	-4.6147
The 2012 financial year can also be regarded as full success in this sense .	-2.9977
This became clear when the 2012 annual accounts were presented .	-2.4458
As Andrea Rothmund said , the administrative budget , at around EUR 7.6 million , was over EUR 1 million higher than planned .	-3.9802
The surplus in the administrative budget , which amounts to around EUR 1.8 million , was around EUR 1 million above the approach .	-3.9814
The surplus was mainly due to higher commercial tax revenue and the community share of the income tax .	-4.7366
The asset budget , too , was well above the planned values .	-3.5194
Last year , instead of EUR 1.5 million , it stood at EUR 2.5 million .	-3.6179
" This is essentially due to the increased appropriation from the administrative budget , " said Rothmund .	-4.4807
Since fewer investments were made in the 2012 financial year than planned , repayment is also higher .	-3.8920
In total , the overall reserve was increased by around EUR 2.1 million , to a total of EUR 4.9 million .	-3.1597
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for their good work .	-2.0219
" One does not simply shake such a work out of the sleeve , " Gerster praised with a view to the annual accounts .	-5.0099
He and the local councils clearly rejoiced by the good figures .	-3.1748
It may sound paradoxical , but these very good figures could soon cost citizens dear .	-3.3674
Due to the good financial situation , the municipality has in the past abandoned high rates of leverage .	-5.9120
This , however , has often been reduced by the country , according to Gerster .	-3.7232
There are conditions for these grants from various compensatory records .	-4.1807
Amongst other things , cities and communities applying for subsidies must have certain levers .	-8.6892
" We have to look at the issue of leverage , because investments are in place in the years to come , for which we would like to have grants , " said Gerster in this . .	-5.6221
Nagold : Hugo Wermter for 60 years in Choir	-2.7167
At 60 years as a singer , Hubert Wermter ’ s story at the men ’ s singer club Caecilia is almost twice as long as that of the autumn festival , in which he was solemnly honoured .	-5.4003
As usual , Hubert Wermter was on stage in the colours of his men 's association .	-2.9243
After 60 years , singing with the choir , which is now more than a loving one , still makes him great fun .	-6.8342
Wermter was also active in the association , including 28 years as a member of the committee .	-2.6849
He received several awards for his dedication and his breath : Jörg Kohr , Pastoralreferent on behalf of the Caecilian association Rottenburg-Stuttgart , presented him - since the choir is also a choir - a certificate of the Association and an honorary letter signed by Bishop Gebhard Fürst .	-6.9109
His singers gave him the certificate of the German choir association and a grave pewter .	-4.9221
In addition to the honour , the 31st autumn festival took place in the usual trains : the MGV amount , the Salzstetten song crane , the Baisingen singer department and the local music association had loaded a colourful mix of choirs and singing styles , which had been maintained by some 400 visitors .	-9.0629
The MGV Vollmaringen opened with atmospheric songs such as " In the Wine Paradise " and " Lustig , its brothers " .	-4.5838

The men 's association amount also sang classical choral songs like " Jägerwerben " by Julius Wengert , " Weit , far away " by Hubert Goisern and the popular song " When you go through the valley " .	-6.9132
With his mixed choir and his women 's group - the " pulse choir " - the Salzstetten was responsible for the women 's rate of the festival .	-5.3499
The mixed choir kidnapped with the Napolitan folk " Santa Lucia " and " Eviva Espana " from Antos Gus to foreign countries , while the " impulsor " also resorted to foreign languages : " Liberatio " and " Hey Jede " belonged to their program .	-4.5798
The Baisinger Sportverein ’ s singing department returned to home cinemas with " What is Süssmuth ? " by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Papperts , where the Fulmaringer Musikverein offered the crowning musical qualification .	-6.7357
For the children there was a small add-on programme - " Oma Hanne " alias Hannelore Stollsteimer led a carpet theatre and read a few stories that the children had a good lunch .	-7.0157

Kenyan ’ s press is outraged by controversial media law .	-3.0231
“ We are in a frightening situation , and we should ask ourselves : what is Parliament ’ s position on simply abolishing judicial independence tomorrow ” was to be read in the paper , which considers the draft law unconstitutional .	-6.9645
“ The law is draconian and very punitive , and we reject it , ” Cyrus Kamau , Managing Director of the Capital Group , including Capital FM , said one of the most prestigious independent radio stations and news websites in Kenya .	-4.0725
He said that the new media tribunal “ will always be prejudiced , because it is an extended arm of the government , ” and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya ’ s position in the global economy . , . . . on .	-4.9350
“ I hope the President will listen to us and we appeal to him to reject this draft law and return it to Parliament , ” he said .	-2.7774
According to The Star newspaper , the government “ takes the media into a stranglehold effectively ” through the new law , against which The Standard , Democracy , and Freedom of speech in Kenya “ suffered a severe blow , ” and called the draft “ draconian . ”	-6.1912
Adoption of the law is one of a series of measures designed to strengthen national security in the aftermath of the attacks by armed Islamists on the Westgate shopping centre in September .	-3.8196
The Kenyan media grabbed the authorities ’ wrath because they published recordings of security cameras , where the units sent to the resort allegedly robbed the luxurious shopping centre .	-6.1501
Police head David Kimaiyo responded to this by appointing two journalists and a leading media representative , even if the subpoena were withdrawn after a media outcry .	-4.3110
Under the new law , media houses can be punished with a penalty of up to 20 million Kenyan shillings , and individual journalists with up to a million and the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from an official press accreditation .	-4.2718
The Tribunal also has the right to seize the possession of those affected if a penalty is not paid .	-3.5318
According to Daily Nation , “ a single penalty can push most radio stations into bankruptcy . ”	-2.6967
Moreover , the newspaper believes that these measures could have a devastating effect on Kenya ’ s description of “ lively blogosphere . ”	-7.0553
If they silence the media , politicians could do whatever they want with impunity .	-2.6878
“ Nobody will ever know it , ” Mutuma Mathiu wrote , a journalist at the nation , who described the Kenyan media as a decisive factor of control in public life .	-9.9128
“ Leave politicians to themselves , lead the country into bankruptcy , and return to the time of hunters and collectors , ” he commented .	-3.7269
Kenyan legislators drew up the public anger in the past .	-2.9933

Bad Dürrheim : A Dream Is True for the FC	-3.0103
In spite of the cold weather and rain , the official opening ceremony for the Kunstgras-Sportplatz lost nothing to the city and the football club .	-6.3005

Also 50 grams of apple mood or an eating spoon of painted canseeds plus three eating spoons of water are suitable for this purpose .	-5.7674
Points are not made with eggs , for example , with a mixture of a teaspoon baking powder , an eating spoon , food intensity and three tablets of mineral water .	-7.5312
But also 50 grams of soyajoghurt or silk tofu can fulfill this purpose .	-3.2973
According to the Vebu , around 800 000 people currently eat vegan in Germany , i.e. purely plant .	-9.1167
Sleeping in New York	-1.1831
On the way to their host families in Weymouth , Massachusetts , the students of the Black Forest Gymnasium met the American city of New York .	-3.5751
After eight hours of flight , the Brooklyn Bridge was immediately reached on foot by the heart of the city , Manhattan .	-4.4595
It has already offered a fascinating view of the world-famous skyline , which is a special attraction in the evening light .	-5.8678
Due to the shift in time , students were almost 24 hours on their legs , but according to the motto " The City is not sleeping " , the day was decided on at Times Square .	-5.3782
Despite shutdown , the Statue of Liberty was reached by ferry on the second day and could be reached on foot .	-5.2123

After that , the hectic drive of New York ’ s streets went through the Rockefeller Center to Central Park , which provided an ideal opportunity for a quick rest in the autumn sun .	-6.5532
After a short flight from New York to Boston , students have now arrived in their host families and are enjoying their everyday life at Weymouth High School .	-4.1912
Also this year a Hubertusmesse is celebrated on the name day of the Holy Hubertus in the parish church of St. Marien on the Hülsbergstra<unk>e .	-5.3587

Jagdhorn blades group of the hunting three-fold Westphalia , led by Brigitte Kluth , musicians on parforcehearers ( natural heartbeat in the mood Es ) to ancient , originally French melodies .	-7.6422

The solemn fair will take place on Sunday , November 3 , at 11.30 a.m.	-2.7613
The newly designed oppression shines with a new cafe .	-3.9689
One that invites you to stay and stay again .	-3.5648
One that wants to make the name of the programme .	-2.5450
According to Lexicon , Déjà Vu describes a psychological phenomenon that is expressed in the sense of having experienced or seen a new situation .	-4.3748
In case of visiting the homonymous café at the Opschluss in the district town of Kleve in sight to the Rhine-Waal University , it must not remain a pure déjà Vu feeling .	-6.7025
After all , the café with its beautiful name has precisely the goal : to make a real stay not only mentally but also to make it possible to experience it again and again .	-7.6917
Because it 's simply fun and beautiful .	-2.9538
A glance into the inner life at the oppression 8 gives the viewer a good feeling at first sight .	-5.2493
The ultra-modern but not cool café ambience looks like a place to feel good .	-4.2298
Here , the team with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the top spoil the guest with a variety of varieties of coffee or cocktails .	-4.7274
You can also enjoy delicious cakes or freshly prepared baguettes .	-3.9519
The owners , both 33 years old , have already made a name for themselves before the opening of the tasty café at the oppression as a gastronomer : in Kranenburg they conducted the " Art Lounge " .	-6.5792
The sympathetic café lovers hope to have more audience from moving to Kleve to the oppression .	-5.2013
Not least by the university .	-2.5555
" Where we have no specific target group , " says Daniel Büttner .	-2.8802
Instead , the two here would like to address young students in the same way as seniors and all age groups in between .	-3.9838
Apposos Café lovers .	-2.6101
The friendly owner couple stands behind the coffee enjoyment .	-3.0134
Enjoy the fragrant hot breeze in all different variations .	-4.4958
Expressofan	-0.4588
Daniel Büttner is more the Express fan and Mirjam van der Stelt the Cappuccino drinker .	-2.1689
" A baguette - that is my thing , " she tells the NRZ .	-3.8775
Two events were already in the bright café .	-2.8601
Better said one .	-2.7501
Because the harbour festival took place outside rather than the outside - the Café Déjà Vu did not benefit from it . .	-4.2233
But there was also a barbecue evening .	-4.3097
" Beautiful , successful and funny " , the two 33-year-olds found .	-3.1376
But not everyone 's business .	-2.0396
Maybe Daniel Büttner is not a pronounced fan of event evenings : " You can 't do it all right " . ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-8.8048
And with an event I speak only those who are interested in the special event .	-3.3159
Therefore , events will be the exception for us .	-2.8330
" We want to disrupt the normal operation as little as possible " .	-2.4619
This means that Déjà Vu also stands for reliability .	-3.4180
In terms of the quality of the products offered here , as well as the team and the beautiful surroundings at the Opschlag in Kleve .	-3.9205
The road which is becoming more and more a gastronomy mile .	-2.9715
For the joy of many Klever , the guests from near and far and the students who discover the gastronomy and hence also the Café Déjà Vu .	-5.0344

UN proclaims new poverty reduction targets	-2.1633
The United Nations is beginning immediately to set out a series of new objectives to replace the Millennium Development Goals announced twelve years ago to combat poverty .	-3.8870
In the run-up to the UN Sustainable Development Summit , which began in Rio de Janeiro in the evening , Australian diplomats played a key role in pushing for “ sustainable development goals ” to replace the Millennium Goals that expire in 2015 .	-3.4948
They have been included in the final draft document adopted by world leaders , including Mrs Gillard , at the summit .	-2.6831
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at the summit this evening that the time has come to “ think beyond national interests . ”	-3.1472
“ I am pleased that member states have agreed to embark on a process to agree universal , sustainable development goals , ” he said .	-3.0246
“ These objectives will build on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the post-2015 framework for development .	-2.8731
I will spare no effort in implementing this mandate given to me by member states to realize our vision of the sustainable development goals that build on the success of the Millennium Goals . ”	-3.9925
Although the SG Achim / Baden has been without victory for four days , the Handball Supreme License continues to maintain a good mood .	-6.0687
Trainer Tomasz Malmon leaves no doubt about this .	-2.5634
Everyone is still fully motivated .	-1.5789
However , I hope that we will finally win again .	-2.8306
" Because I don 't know how to taste a victory anymore , " Malmon expects a success experience from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II .	-4.4852
Even if the Fredenbeck Third Reserve has not cleared trees at the moment , Malmon warns the pointing finger in advance .	-5.3460
I have trained many players myself in the A-Youth .	-3.2941
Therefore , they will certainly be especially motivated against their ex-coach .	-2.7747
" In addition , the SG coach illustrates whether there is reinforcement from the first one .	-5.4952
In order to return to the track of success , the Malmon team must definitely increase in comparison with the previous performances .	-4.3241
Above all in the cover work and the switching game it did a lot last but not least .	-6.5716
The realisation of opportunities also definitely needs to be better .	-3.3022
So I hope that my players finally got their head free during the short break .	-3.3484
Security concerns in Mozambique grow with clashes between influential personalities .	-4.1731
Thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo under the watchful eyes of Samora Machel ’ s statue , the founder of state and first President Mozambique , to vote for peace in a rare public demonstration .	-4.3303
“ We want peace again , we want stability , ” said Vanessa de Sousa , Managing Director of an investment company .	-1.6298
For fear of the country ’ s future , she exchanged her business clothes for a t-shirt with the name “ We Request Safety ” in Portuguese and joined on Thursday the crowd on the capital ’ s independence square .	-5.9332
For almost two weeks , there have been reports every day of clashes between government forces and Renamo , which are among the worst fought since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago .	-8.5095
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement that was initially supported by White Rhodesia and later by the apartheid government of South Africa in an effort to destabilise the country ’ s independent government .	-4.1897
After the 1992 peace treaty , it became an opposition party .	-1.8816
Analysts find it unlikely that the country will return to a full-scale conflict , but recent events have worried foreign investors and locals .	-3.4399
The stakes are high for the rapidly growing economy , as the discovery of huge gas reserves off the coast and coal deposits in the northwest could bring investment of more than $ 50 billion from firms like Rio Tinto , Vale from Brazil , Eni from Italy , and Anadarko from the US in the next few years .	-6.0697
The ruling Frelimo party , since 1975 the dominant power , and Renamo blame each other for the tensions .	-2.1255
Renamo claims that the government provoked the recent clashes by attacking its members in Sofala province , a traditional stronghold of Renamos , on 17 October .	-2.8954
The attacks on the former rebels escalated when government forces attacked Renamo bases and tried to kill Affonso Dhlakama , leader of the group , told Renamo ’ s spokesman against the Financial Times .	-3.9485
The government blames Renamo for the clashes and accuses the organization of having attacked soldiers .	-2.7253
President Armando Guebuza has attempted to downplay concerns about instability .	-2.2552
On the subject of AFP , the French news agency , he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama sees itself as a “ loser , ” who “ wants to use all of his remaining forces to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government . ”	-5.2386
Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they want to avoid war .	-1.6604
But concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted as saying that Renamo cancelled the 1992 peace agreement .	-3.3580
He said to the FT that he meant Frelimo no longer respect the agreement .	-3.7088
“ Our vision is to restart negotiations and make them serious , ” said Mazanga .	-3.3239
Previous inter-party talks have done little to resolve the tensions fueled by a series of clashes this year .	-3.1782
" We have two adult men here ( Guebuza and Dhlakama ) who gather the heads , " says Joseph Hanlon , lecturer at Open University and Mozambique experts .	-4.0167
None of them are well under negotiation , and no one is prepared to make the necessary concessions .	-7.6977
Renamo , who is pushing for electoral reform , has already said that she will boycott the November local elections .	-2.6254
Presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for next year .	-1.2981
Some commentators have interpreted the use of force as an attempt by a ailing movement to gain concessions and financial benefits from the government .	-3.2685
Renamo ’ s electoral successes have been shrinking since 1992 , while a newer party , the Movement Democrático de Mo<unk>ambique ( MDM ) , founded by a former Renamo member , is likely to improve in the election .	-4.4182
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – whose resignation is due when his second term ends next year – wants to destroy the country ’ s democracy .	-2.5452
“ He does not want a multi-party democracy , he does not want transparent elections , he does not want peace because he does not want to give up the presidency , ” says Mazanga .	-3.0348
It is unclear what capacity Renamo has , but it has undertaken disturbing attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important north-south connection .	-4.4494
Most of the fighting took place in Sofala province , which is a few hundred kilometres north of Maputo , where Beira is located , the port , the mining companies like Rio Tinto and Vale use to export coal .	-4.4497
In June , Rio suspended the use of the railways for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the track .	-2.7358
Mazanga was reluctant to answer the question of whether Renamo would repeat this threat .	-2.7547
Renamo wanted to “ warn the international community that things are not good in Mozambique , ” said Mazanga .	-2.0016
Instability has increased the frustration over the government , says Fernando Lima , Head of Mediacoop , an independent media company , because many people are already concerned about corruption , slow progress in development , and a recent wave of abduction .	-4.3393
“ People think that the government and the president are responsible for the country ’ s future , and he should be the one who finds solutions to the problems , ” he explains .	-3.6741
Omar Sultane , a demonstrator , said that people simply wanted stability .	-1.3996
“ No one is interested in Renamo and Frelimo , they simply want peace and usable roads , ” he said .	-3.6167
Children should be given myths and legends as “ exemplary for life , ” one author says .	-4.6136
Thor ’ s stories showed that “ brutal power has no chance of clever tricks , ” and the Artus legend demonstrates how important it is to have a dream .	-2.9462
But many myths are “ far too wild , too offensive , and , in some cases , too dirty to be taught at schools , ” which is why Crossley Holland argued for “ careful selection ” of age-oriented works .	-4.2787
“ I find it wonderful that myths and folklore are already part of education in America , ” he said .	-1.9016
I have proposed this as a plan for 20 years .	-1.6862
He added that , among authors and teachers who are “ excessively didactic , ” children would “ disable entirely , ” because amusing stories convey the messages “ underground . ”	-5.4076
Crossley Holland , who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myth and the British Folk Tales , declared : “ You can pursue certain intentions , but you should keep them in the background as possible . ”	-4.3865
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an author writing for children is the need to convey hope .	-3.1361
Not everything needs to be simplified or lead to the Happy End , but there is an immanent sense of good and evil .	-2.8902
It must be understandable , revealed in history and not explained .	-3.2743
This is the old story of pointing rather than telling .	-1.8140
Hansjakob rejects Freihof	-2.5145
100 years ago , Heinrich Hansjakob moved his retirement residence in Hasach , and on Sunday his last years were alive in the " Freihof " .	-4.9998

Billy Sum-Hermann understood it incredibly well to get involved in the role of the sister and gave her immense life in mimic and gesture .	-5.0062
The Mühlenbach Farm Chapel played selected pieces of music between the different scenes and rounded off the performance .	-5.2418
Hasah 's mayor , Heinz Winkler , was awarded the honorary citizenship in honor of the then incumbent , Hättich , who , together with a portion of the city council , made his awards in with the inc.	-15.3243
Her rewarding then made the tri-king singer who called Hansjakob to the call : " Oh how beautiful , there again young women become alive to my own tri-king-time " .	-8.6237
With their song " O Jesuleine " , they enjoyed the audience in the Freihof as well as the Storchentagskinder with their loud " Auch , Auch " .	-6.5266
At that time , his criticism of the Attorney Church expressed Hansjakob as well as his concerns about the devastation in agriculture , the consequences of industrialization or the effects of war .	-6.6464
In his homeland , behind his tomb chapel on the fire at Hofstetten , he found his resting place .	-4.4018
" A disturbing spirit had finally found its peace and had gone home forever , " said it at the end of the scene game .	-4.9525
Many applause and many commendable words were there for the audience .	-3.9213

However , a first breathing of Ludwigsburg was not to be heard .	-3.9680
" We were not dealing with the Wildcard procedure until Düsseldorf had a licence , " said Neckar-Riesen-Boss Alexander Reil of our newspaper .	-3.9406

Stelle Piepsen disturbs residents	-3.3465
Rhenus Midgard also invested heavily on land .	-1.4764
They spread the coal coming from the ships to the hald .	-3.6141
The company has several irons in fire at its location .	-2.2425
Besides the import of coal , Rhenus Midgard also relies on wind plant logistics .	-3.0249
Black the coal shines on the campsite in front of the roof .	-4.2847
Two huge blue shaft and return chargers distribute or load coal here as needed . with blue .	-6.5018
Every movement of the charging devices produces a striking sound of warning over the terrain .	-6.1325
" The signals serve safety and are legally mandatory , " says Matthias Schrell , Managing Director of the Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven .	-3.1359
When the wind is unfavourable it is much to hear - and so there have already been some complaints from people from the town .	-8.3060

In close consultation with the authorities , we are now in the process of keeping warning signals calibrated with technical measures .	-3.8344

" This year we want to scratch the 3 million tonnes mark during the envelope , " Schrell said .	-4.2147
Next to the Eon power station , the import coal goes to power stations in the inland country .	-4.5353
If the GDF Suez power plant is still on the net , a good 5 million tonnes of coal imports per year would be realistic .	-4.3335
The three ship loaders on the bridge and the second transport band could create up to 10 million .	-2.7591

Court is blocking decision on the NYPD ’ s Stop and Frisk Directive	-3.7174
On Thursday , a federal prosecutor in the US blocked a judge ’ s order calling for changes to the Stop and Frisk Programme ( “ Anhalt and Search ” ) of the New York Police Department , and disbanded the judge from the case .	-4.9979
The 2nd Court of Appeal declared that judge Shira Scheindlin 's decisions would be suspended until a decision was made on the appeal of the city .	-4.9867
The judge judged in August that the city was violating the Constitution with the way in which the programme for the staying and surveying of people was implemented .	-6.5863
The city appealed against its assessment and the appropriate remedies , including the decision to set up a monitoring body to assist the police in amending their directive and training programmes .	-5.3378
On Tuesday , the Court of Appeal heard the arguments for suspending it .	-3.6605
The appeal report stated that the judge had to be dismissed from the case because it violated the Code of Conduct for American judges by determining that a judge should avoid the appearance of partiality ; this was partly justified by a series of media interviews and public statements in which she responded publicly to the Court ’ s criticism .	-6.2446
The judge had judged that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people because they inappropriately targeted black and Latin American men targeting the Stop and Frisk programme .	-4.0817
They appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of major changes , including reforms in directives , training and service supervision , and arranged a pilot program with body sung cameras in areas where most controls were carried out .	-5.2153
In August , the city of New York agreed to end the practice of storing names and addresses of persons released after police control .	-3.3011
An oral trial of the city ’ s appeal is planned after 14 March 2014 .	-3.2510
Stop and hairsty tactics have been criticised by a number of supporters of civil rights .	-3.2323
Such controls have been in various forms for decades , but during the term of office of the partial mayor Michael Bloomberg rose to an all-time high of 684,330 in 2011 , most of them black and Latin American men .	-3.9621
In 2004 , four men belonging to all minorities brought legal action , which developed into collective redress .	-4.3976
Advocates of changes to the NYPD Stop and Frisk Programme , the changes will end unfair practices , create a more trustworthy and effective police force , and influence the way other police presidents use the system .	-4.9235
Opponents believe that the changes would dampen the morals of the police , but not criminality ; money would also be wasted and the broader problem of a police force that is under pressure following the disappearance of thousands of jobs in the last decade .	-5.9400
The judge pointed out that she did not end the Stop and Frisk practice , which is constitutional , but only reformed the way the controls were implemented by the NYPD .	-4.6646

The tenth birthday of the association was celebrated on Saturday afternoon , which has already had considerable successes .	-4.4852
The first Chairman Henne reported in detail about the work of the association .	-2.6490
He himself was the first time in Mauritania in the Cheijk-Zajed-Hospital in Nouakchott in 2004 .	-2.5874
The result was further cooperation and the gynaecologist Henne carried out numerous operations on site on several journeys .	-5.3675
During the speeches , pictures of the inserts on a large screen were shown so that the guests of the anniversary event could take a look at the actions mentioned .	-5.6832
The desert vehicle of the association was also shown .	-2.2609
It is a former federal border guarding vehicle .	-3.2356
Rainer Prewo , the former OB of Nagold , had proposed to equip this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and now plans , according to Henne , to work in consultative function at the association .	-5.3431
In 2008 , the Zimmerei Schleeh from Baiersbronn , in record time of just under a week , created the Socogim health station , a misery area on the outskirts of the capital - voluntarily .	-5.9508
Henne also mentioned a New Mother Child hospital in Nouakchott .	-2.1123
Especially interesting in times when the birth clinic is to be eradicated in Nagold .	-4.0675
You learn a lot in Africa as a medical practitioner , says Henne , for example , deceleration against burn-out .	-4.7089
Due to political unrest in the country , one could not make as many journeys as planned , but for this , many medical professionals came to Germany to hospitate here in various areas .	-5.3611
In addition , containers are regularly sent to Africa using material , such as medical equipment , medicines , association materials , hospital beds and glasses in March of this year .	-4.7694

Coulson used phone hacking to verify a tip .	-3.0662
The former news of the Word editor Andy Coulson supposedly used “ phone hacking , surveillance , and confrontation ” to try to confirm a false tip about an affair of then-Interior Minister Charles Clarke .	-4.4176
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC declared to the Old Bailey Court that News of the World had a false rumour in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with his “ attractive special adviser ” Hannah Pawlby .	-4.0832
The newspaper commissioned Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlbys voicemails , and persecuted them , but Coulson also invoked them and left news , as the court learned .	-3.7350
“ In the opinion of the prosecutor ’ s office , Coulson , who is now a NotW publisher , is no one facing the home of people and hopes to tap them for fresh action , but one who likes to confront people with a story to see their reaction , ” Edis said .	-6.7962
He said NotW uses three procedures to investigate stories : telephone hacking , surveillance , and confrontation .	-3.0319
The editor is personally involved in the third method .	-1.0738
Obviously he knows of the second , the monitoring , it can not be different .	-2.8942
What about the first one ?	-1.3944
Does he know about phone hacking ?	-1.2371
He disagreed , but we say , “ And whether he knew about it . ”	-2.7024
Rumours about a Clarkes affair were first picked up by NotW ’ s feature editorial when a source that was sexually interested in Pawlby was said : “ Don ’ t waste your time , it ’ s combined with Charles . ”	-4.9619
A band with voicemails from their phone of at least three occasions was secured in August 2006 in Mulcaires apartment .	-2.3812
The investigators also found entries on the detective computer where Pawlby and her sister were stored as “ projects . ”	-3.5361
At the time when the searches were running , the grandparents of Pawlby received anonymous calls in which they were asked for information about them , Edexplained .	-4.1153
Meanwhile , former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup supervised the movement of Pawlby .	-2.3152
On June 18 , 2005 , Coulson left her a voicemail with the following content : “ I have a story that we want to bring out tomorrow that I would like to talk about with Charles . ”	-3.7515
Edis explained that Coulson ’ s activities in this story followed the same pattern as those of other major figures , such as former interior minister David Blunkett .	-4.0556
On Thursday , they heard that Coulson Blunkett faced a married woman for an affair when he was himself lied to the accused Rebekah Brooks , who was married at that time .	-5.5329
Coulson and Brooks are arguing to have parted with others to hack phones between October 3 , 2000 and August 9 , 2006 .	-4.4721
Telephone hacking has been admitted to Mulcaire , Thurlbeck and Weath.	-2.7186
French football will indeed go through the first strike since 1972 from protest against the planned Reichstag tax .	-5.0272
A conciliation meeting will end without result .	-2.5748
In the Reich Tax conflict , the government and professional football in France have stuck into a dead end after a failed conciliation meeting .	-5.8570
President François Hollande received clubs and associations representatives on Thursday at the Paris <unk>lysée Palace and also listened to their complaints .	-4.1758
However , he refused to spare football from the planned 75-percent tax on income of more than a million euros a year , which all the country ’ s firms are expected to pay for two years from 2014 .	-5.3179
The other side remained hard .	-2.4371
The strike announced at the end of November will now be pushed through , with the Chief Association of Professional Lubs ( UCPF ) , Jean-Pierre Louvel .	-5.6941
The Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 games scheduled between November 29th and December 2nd are therefore cancelled .	-4.3976
Flying : No absolute protection	-2.5054
" We want to involve the inhabitants early in planning " , mayor Jens Hü<unk>ler opened the Civil Information Event on the flood protection concept .	-5.0722
Around 80 participants had come to the community hall to explain the planned measures , ask questions , raise concerns , and bring in ideas .	-4.7365
Houses made it clear : ' The final decisions are taken by members of the local council ' .	-4.1991
The floods , which flattened on 15 May 2009 , had been a major event that raised the question of protective measures for the future , Household said .	-7.0350
A river area survey was commissioned with the neighbouring town of Aidlingen , which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in memory .	-4.7933
" Protecting as many plots as possible is the target " , says Household .	-3.9455
The planning of protection against the German weather service is statistically planned every 100 years to be expected .	-4.5702
Climate change is taken into account by a 15 % surcharge .	-3.3680
In specialized circles this is called " HQ 100aClimate " .	-3.1264
The water masses , which caused significant damage in memory in 2009 , corresponded to 1000 years of flooding .	-4.6508
" There is no absolute protection , but we can achieve a relative improvement , " he said .	-3.3416
To protect the HQ 100aClimate , around EUR 4 million must be invested in memory , with the municipality expecting some 70 % national aid .	-5.4126
However , houses have pointed out that there is only support if an overall approach is implemented .	-5.6404
The municipality needs the participation of its citizens .	-3.4468
An expensive planning and approval procedure must be completed .	-2.2200
In the best case , implementation could begin in 2016 .	-7.4457
Amongst other things , the protection concept presented last week in the municipal council ( we reported ) provides for local measures in the flow of the River Irm from the Stammheim Valley .	-4.8899
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept , participants took the opportunity to raise their concerns .	-2.4506
Amongst other things , it has been questioned why no more dams and restraints are planned to protect the place .	-4.3217
Gregor Kühn , specialized planner of the commissioned engineering office Forest and Corbe from Hillsheim , who presented the concept , stressed that it needed the interaction of all the measures presented to achieve the desired goal in the sum .	-5.4613
In addition , the most economical solution is to be found , according to Joachim Forest of Forest and Corbe .	-3.7833
There was discontent among old-fashioned residents , who , even in the case of normal thunderstorms , suffer from congestion on the channel network .	-8.0040
The problem is known about the administration and the first measures have already been taken .	-3.7159
However , houses pointed out that the guidelines for channel systems are different from those for flood protection and should not be mixed up .	-4.5068
The municipality is obliged to interpret the channel network in such a way that there may be two to three years of rain .	-5.1818
Throwing sewage channels larger would swallow millions .	-4.3230
Serious Missed After Closure	-4.4746
Two drivers were seriously injured at a frontal collision on Wednesstra<unk>e 44 near Revensdorf early Friday afternoon .	-4.3872
The police immediately blocked the road , but initially little could say about the accident .	-4.6804
However , there are various testimonies that should only be evaluated .	-2.8445
It is clear that the 19-year-old Lenkerin went to Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf met her with his Hyundai .	-4.9390
Both vehicles clashed together , with a woman so hard to shed , that the fire brigade needed just under half an hour to get her out of the car wreck .	-5.7569
The actual cause of the accident was left unresolved .	-3.4016
Both of these accidents came to nearby hospitals .	-3.3831
The track was closed for about two hours .	-2.3169

Philip K. Dick was a Godseer , a metaphysist , his novels and narratives also have something serial .	-3.4087
Amazing relative in the exterior : the brilliant eyes , the beard , the high forehead .	-5.2651
And just as Fjodor M. Dostoyevski , with his massive oeuvre , can be seen as the founder and apologist of the Russian soul , Philip K. Dick is read as an American prophet , which is certainly true in his own country .	-5.5817
Some titles are published in Heyne 's publishing house , the Haffmans cassette with the 118 narratives distributes two thousand endings .	-5.8149
Dick explains America - the kingdom of breathtaking technical progress , coupled with paranoia , madness and belief , to be chosen .	-4.2540
Dick had God 's experiences , his late books read like a mixture of the revelation of John and a computer manual .	-3.0160
Perhaps he was crazy , drugs had taken his brain .	-3.0756
He captured , early already , that the computers are divinities .	-4.2807
He wrote a theology of the computer and asked what distinguishes a man from a machine , the creator from his creator .	-2.7256

On the instructions of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection and Terrorism Control ( BVT ) , the German Interior Security Service , he should shoot the roof of the US Foreign Post , which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank .	-4.7264
According to German media , the BVT wanted to prove the presence of surveillance antennas , and the action led to a change of words between the US and the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin .	-3.6500
In September , James Clapper , US Director of National Intelligence , once again insisted that the US did not use foreign espionage to “ steal foreign company secrets on behalf of US firms to expand its international competitiveness or profits . ”	-4.8365
But , since Edward Snowden , the former whistleblower who became a whistleblower , started publishing his horn to US surveillance secrets , European governments and business leaders are no longer sure whether they can take the director at his word .	-5.0764
Reports that the US National Security Agency has spied Petrobas Brazil ’ s oil company and acquired data from US cloud suppliers , including Google and Yahoo , have led the company paranoia to a new high level because of state surveillance .	-5.5448
The overrun barrel revealed that Chancellor Angela Merkel ’ s phone was confused , possibly for ten years .	-3.1568
If the most powerful person in Europe can target , then company leaders are certainly potential targets .	-4.4500

I believe it is conceivable that this data will be used for mutual benefit .	-2.2562
“ Germany must wake up , ” explains Oliver Grün , president of BITMi , who represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany .	-2.7223
German companies believe that the US now poses an almost as great risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft , a survey published by the EY advisor company in July .	-4.0773
However , in the documents leaked by Snowden , there has so far been no evidence that the US has passed on foreign company secrets to its own companies .	-4.4903
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU should lack certain IT and Internet opportunities and reduce its dependence on the US .	-3.1903

Yet the range and technical refinement of the Snowden revelations shocked companies that previously saw China ’ s biggest spy risk .	-3.4327
Cloud Computing is undergoing a major change because European business leaders are now more aware that US-based data are subject to jurisprudence and are therefore potentially at risk .	-5.2522
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance , a trading institution , the survey revealed about ten percent of non-US data mining activities with Prism .	-4.0921
Jim Snabe , deputy managing director of SAP , says : “ We see a new question from customers that did not exist a year ago – she says : Where will my data be stored and can you guarantee that they remain physically in this legal area ? ”	-4.6777
Many German business leaders believe that recent reports simply confirm what they knew anyway , namely that powerful states want to steal their most precious secrets and that they must therefore be guarded at all costs .	-4.5097
The fact that economic espionage is taking place is no surprise .	-1.6814

The Sheriff ’ s Lowndes County investigators concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident , but this doubts the family of the 17-year-old .	-4.6000
" They are convinced that their son was murdered , " said Benjamin Crump , the lawyer of Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson , to FoxNews.com.	-2.8192
They never believed that he had died as the Sheriff knew .	-4.1735
“ They believe that there is no logic whatsoever to violate the laws of physics , as well as common sense , ” Crump said .	-4.5579
Instead , they are convinced that the truth is concealed to protect the person or people responsible for the death of their son .	-3.5842
“ Your son went to school for learning and came back in the corpse bag , ” he commented .	-4.8687
US Prosecutor Michael Moore said on Thursday that there will be a formal investigation to Johnson 's death , because a number of important questions remain unresolved .	-4.2815
What was the cause of death ?	-0.5188
Is his death attributable to a crime ?	-1.5253
This explained Moore at a press conference on Thursday afternoon .	-1.9799
I follow the facts in which direction .	-1.4843
My aim is to find out the truth .	-1.1884
“ I believe there is a sufficient basis for formal investigation , ” he said .	-2.3857
Moore explained to reporters that initial autopsy suggests that Johnson died as a result of a “ position-induced first . ”	-4.9012
A second autopsy , however , has given rise to another cause of death , according to Moore .	-2.9899
“ There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed , ” he said .	-1.8110
Moore added , if there is sufficient evidence for a criminal or civil investigation to be carried out to Johnson 's death , he will instruct the FBI to carry out the investigation .	-4.5436

CDC Publish Children ’ s Allergic Lines for Schools	-4.4224
On Wednesday , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) published a series of guidelines for dealing with food allergies from children at schools .	-2.9551
These are the first such directives issued by the US Government , as the number of children with food allergies compulsory for school is increasing .	-4.7948
One in 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy .	-1.8062
According to the CDC , the spread of food allergies among children increased by 18 % between 1997 and 2007 .	-1.7826
The guidelines provide information for schools to raise awareness of food allergies among teachers and employees and how to deal with children who show allergic reactions .	-4.5658
It is also recommended that schools have epinephrin stock – the auto injection of the EpiPen brand is most used – to counter a potentially lethal over-sensitivity response .	-4.2446
Legislators in the states have recently changed the rules so that schools can easily hold epinephrin stock .	-3.9628
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms mentioned by children who have an allergic reaction .	-2.2942
Children may say , “ It feels like it feels as if something was pressed on my tongue , ” “ My tongue feels like a hair lying on it ” or “ my tongue cribbed ” .	-6.5896
Parents of Intersexual Children can choose “ Gender Unvoted ”	-3.6670
Germany is the first European nation in which a third sex is recognised for children born with non-unambiguous genitals .	-3.2692
newborns are no longer assigned rigorously male or female .	-8.1009
Under the new law , parents must no longer declare sex for such children , but can “ indefinitely ” or “ not stipulate ” at birth certificate .	-4.7620
The aim of the law is to exert pressure from parents so that they do not have to make rushed decisions on operations for the allocation of sex in newborns and to combat discrimination against intersex people .	-6.1895
One intersexual person said BBC years later : “ I am neither man nor woman . ”	-2.7561
I remain the patchwork created by doctors , mutilated and scared .	-2.4359
It is estimated that one in 2 000 children each year do not come to the world either as a boy or a girl .	-4.0159
They belong to the intersexuals , a group falling under the diagnosis of sex differentiation disorder ( DSD ) , a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes , germs ( eggs or hods ) or unusually developed genital .	-4.8781
Wallis Simpson may have been intersexual .	-1.2037
The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed , but most experts in the US recommend using the best available information on gender allocation if no provision is possible , rather than waiting for the psychological and physical development of the child before deciding , if at all , for an operation .	-5.8854
The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher , who specialized in gender identification issues , said that the new German law “ sounds like a good thing . ”	-3.2838
Intersexual children are an ethical dilemma .	-0.8223
“ Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgery , but most children do not . ” He said .	-2.5526
Gender assignments can be done without surgery and then wait to see how identity develops .	-3.9341
Scientific data about how a child develops his gender identity at all are not very accurate .	-3.7769
No one knows why it is happening .	-1.3053
It is like the secret why people are gay .	-1.7977
A report to the European Commission in 2011 states that intersexual people are different from transsexuals or transgenders , because their status is not gender , but due to their biological constitution , which is neither male nor female , but typically both at the same time or not clearly defined as one of them .	-4.8227
These characteristics were shown in subordinate sexual characteristics such as muscle mass , hairing , breasts and stature , priority sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genital organs , or chromosomes and hormones .	-5.4478
The report also gives an overview of the discrimination exposed to intersex and transgender people in work life and the extent of harassment , violence and prejudice discrimination .	-4.7978
Young people who do not match the gender picture now have a special camp .	-3.2382
Meanwhile , in Australia and Nepal for adults , it is possible to indicate official documents male , female , or “ third sex . ”	-3.7733
In June , Australia ’ s Norrie May Welby ( 52 ) was recognized as the world ’ s first “ genderless ” person , after a court had conceded lifelong maintenance of “ undefined ” gender status .	-4.9206
German identity cards have a third assignment , next to M and W for intersexual , the Minist.	-4.8768
In neighboring France , gender issues are still controversial , so a news report on France 24 .	-3.1539
In 2011 , dozens of French members of the strictly Catholic country signed a petition that “ gender theory ” should be removed from schoolbooks .	-2.3879
The US site Catholic Online has also spoken out against German law , saying : “ If the world is torn into a new state where gender is a choice , but sexual activity is not , then we are twisting two other pillars of civilisation . ” .	-12.3287
The mother of a Maryland newborn explained to Baby Zone that she would find better if babies were given a sex at birth .	-4.2160
“ The parent ’ s life is stressful enough even without further restrictions , especially if one does not know the sex of one ’ s child , ” she said the parent ’ s website .	-4.7377
Children need stability and security .	-0.5685
Historically , children born with both male and female gender stones were called hermaphrodites , after the attractive Greek god who had both sexes .	-3.7657
Ten years ago , medicine regarded gender as something to be extinguished and then rebuilt .	-3.1852
But the ethical foundations of an operation are now being questioned , after it is known how complex gender identity is , and that doctors can be wrong because they do not know how to grow up with the sex they assign .	-5.6359
“ In the mid-twentieth century , one called a psychiatric emergency , ” Drescher said .	-2.7332
When such a child was born , it was not the psychiatrist who was called , but the surgeons .	-2.7909
Dr. John Hopkins University ’ s ruling theory of the treatment of children with non-unambiguous genital dates back to Dr. John Hopkins University , who believed that the sex was formable .	-5.8789
He coined the term “ gender identity ” and argued that social and environmental appeals – such as parents educate a child – interacted with a child ’ s genes and hormones , shaping a person as male or female .	-4.6467
But his theories were controversial in a 1966 case known as “ John / Joan . ”	-2.5159
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been separated from a plain circumcision to masturbate the child completely and also to remove his hods and then take him up as a girl .	-7.5912
“ Money presented this case as a successful example of transformation , but it was not , ” Drescher said .	-2.8095
When the boy was around 15 , he switched back to the male sex and married a woman .	-2.7687
At 38 however , he committed suicide .	-2.2338
According to Drescher , there are still doctors who would practice this model .	-1.6006
But in the 1990 ’ s , with the Internet ’ s entry , survivors of these sex exercises appeared , “ unhappy with the outcome . ”	-4.4557
For example , Jim Bruce , a 36 year old author from Montana born with XY-male chromosomes , but ambiguous genitals .	-2.4695
Doctors were unclear whether he had a large clitorian or a small penis , and were convinced that he could never lead a “ satisfactory life ” as a man .	-4.2000
So his external organ and the Hoden were removed surgically shortly after the birth in 1976 and he was brought up as a girl .	-3.9961
At the age of 12 he received female hormones .	-1.5378
“ I knew I ’ m not a girl , ” he told ABCNews.com .	-2.2139
I was unfortunate , but it was really difficult to ask questions .	-1.6063
At the age of 18 he should receive a vaginal plastic .	-2.0074
But , because he was depressive and knew that something was wrong , he demanded his medical acts .	-3.6513
What he found out was shocking .	-0.9436
I was sterilized at my birth – and no one ever told me that .	-2.7219
Bruce was born with a DSD through which his body could not produce enough testosterone to develop the genitals .	-2.5545
After knowing the truth , he switched to male identity , received testosterone injections and let his breasts be removed .	-5.0384
The operation has made it infertile .	-1.9689
Today , he fights for others in an organization called Interface Project for perceiving intersexual people as normal .	-3.5887
But Anne Tamar-Mattis , Managing Director of Advocates for Informed Choice , California , is concerned that German law can “ encourage Stigmatization and Stigmatization . ”	-4.2429
“ Many activists are worried that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and to allow the child not to be determined , ” she said .	-4.8437
We fear that this is beneficial for interventions .	-2.8924
We think it would be better to admit male or female sex and then wait .	-2.5556
But we do not yet know how the law will affect , so we can only speculate .	-2.3549
Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supported Australian law , because “ it allows adults to recognize as the third sex . ”	-4.0972
“ Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal sex , ” she said .	-2.3066
German law is about assignment at birth .	-2.7662
This is not a struggle to force small children at this stage .	-3.2240
When they grow up , they can decide their own bodies .	-2.8052
But Dr. Arlene Baratz , a breast radiologist from Pittsburg who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group , says German law “ empowered ” both parents and children .	-4.1206
Katie , the daughter of Baratz , was born with male chromosomes , but has a DSD named complete androgen-resistance .	-2.6625
Due to the receptor defect of the target cells for testosterone , cathedral developed female characteristics .	-4.7557
She has a vagina , but no uterus and no eggs .	-1.8183
Today , Katie 29 is married ; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as a member of the Child 's psychiatry .	-3.6304
Although it is infertile , it hopes to have a child through adoption or a surrogate mother .	-2.6250
“ The law gives parents room for whom they do not have to make decisions hastily , ” Baratz said .	-4.6885
It gives them the time to make different tests and clarify things and gives them so time to write “ male ” or “ female ” .	-10.5929
In this way , everything is fine – one draws the child large and loves it .	-3.4663
You have a wonderful baby and you enjoy the happiness of your parents .	-3.0829
And you don ’ t have to rush out an operation that can ’ t be undone .	-4.0316
" This includes children in the decision and eliminates the fear that parents are displaying because they think they are not doing the right thing , " she explained .	-4.7781
Ultimately , the child decides gender , which is better suited to him – and that is wonderful .	-3.7214
This will enable children to make the decision themselves .	-7.8564
Unknown injured girls by shot from car .	-2.1028
Unknown ones have injured twelve years of Saxony-Anhalt in shots from a car .	-4.9952
The perpetrators had probably fired an air pressure weapon on on a group of children in Genthin on Thursday evening .	-4.2622
That informed the police in Burg .	-2.8669
The girl was easily injured by the left coat .	-2.2143
Rescue forces brought the girl to hospital .	-2.2649
The shot came from a small car passing a group of six children and suddenly stopped .	-3.0710
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car .	-1.6294
The perpetrators also shot on a bus stop .	-1.9073
A disk broke down .	-1.5227
They then drove away .	-3.4736
The criminal police investigated , it was said on Friday .	-3.0821
Until now , police inspection can look back at Kempten on a quiet Halloween night .	-2.8530
The civil servants were only called twice to mourning children who threw them against house facades .	-6.2483
Since the owners realized this in good time and immediately removed the eggs , no damage should be caused .	-5.5054
In addition , some of the New Year ’ s Cologne have been raised in the city area , but no material damage has been caused .	-7.8080
A resident in the Bischof-Friendorfer Way reported that his car was wrapped with clooping paper and his wheel blades were missed .	-7.7954
Until the police arrived , however , the man found his cylinders in the immediate vicinity all again , which is why the police had to stop working .	-7.0649
Housing with a future-oriented perspective	-2.4394
Actually Waltraud Ries lives dreamlike .	-2.5728
Your house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with a lot of green , an old tree house , nice neighbours and not too much traffic .	-3.9738
It is only a few minutes away by public transport to the city .	-2.6176
" I hope you are not afraid of spiders ? " asks Waltraud Ries and shows you a fat spider on the door frame .	-11.4901
I have been looking for a new apartment for my husband and myself for some time .	-2.0247
But you know how difficult it is in Stuttgart .	-2.0150
The reason , however , is no phobia of spinning , but the concern that at the age of the many stairs to the house and the apartment can no longer cope with .	-7.6787
In addition , since a Meniskus surgery , the midfifties have had to know what it means to move from floor to floor with handicap .	-5.0957
Only recently is a book from her published on the theme of ' happiness live at age - Which type of living is the best for me ? ' .	-5.4102
" Our apartment is the best example of what is not possible at all " , it begins to tell .	-4.4860
When she moved to the maisonette apartment with her husband more than 20 years ago , it was simply a nice apartment in the middle of the green .	-3.8152
Today , at mid fifty Waltraud Ries thinks differently about it .	-3.3279
She also knows , however , that she is one of the few people who are actually dealing with the issue of ' living in the age ' .	-5.1519
Most suppress it as long as it goes .	-2.5601
Always get only the others ' , they say dirty .	-3.5231
Only when the suffering pressure is really great are you worried .	-3.5797
" Then it may be too late " , says Ries .	-3.8857
In her book , the interior architect presents 17 living models for a self-determined living of age .	-4.4086
" Which form of living you choose is always an individual decision , " she explains .	-3.0749
D i e solution do not give it for age .	-1.7828
Even those who can afford the retirement residence in Tuscany or Brittany should always consider becoming ill .	-4.5025
And : ' Without good knowledge of the language , one can also combine in the Dolce Vita , ' gives the authorized accountant to consider relocations .	-6.5717
Among their models are classical care models , alternative living forms or the often cited pensioners ' WG .	-4.2447
Everyone has their Ticks and Macks at the Age	-2.5915
'But for me such a community of housing would be nothing ' , she says with a twist of eyes .	-5.6984
It was a bit noisy at night .	-6.5797
'At age you need your retreat rooms ' , says Ries .	-4.3754
The author of the book does not want to exclude the fact that a community of elderly residents can still function .	-5.4344
However , this must be different from the classic student WG .	-5.8891
And sometimes you just want to rest , ' she believes .	-2.9869
With this opinion , at least in the provincial capital , it is not alone .	-3.1379
" Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own home as long as it goes , " is also the experience of Theresa Rütten , the head of civil service life at the age of the capital .	-4.7036
Your service advises people about ' becoming older ' .	-2.8680
That is why elderly people , especially elderly people , would often find inconveniences and restrictions to stay in their familiar surroundings , and that is also the experience of the Foundation Warentest .	-6.8177
There are many ways of making the house or apartment accessible today .	-3.5951
Ries recommends to all those who are concerned with the age-oriented rebuilding of their house or apartment , to be thoroughly informed and not to entrust themselves to the first craftsman .	-8.0040
Today there are also specialists for reconstruction according to age .	-3.0729
Even in the rental apartment one thing or another can be realized , and if it is only the toilet hike , the interior architects clarify .	-6.1052
But it is not always possible to reconstruct the existing flat for age and accessibility , even if it is still so beautiful .	-6.0579
This experience had to make Waltraud Ries .	-1.4786
Although you could install a staircase inside the apartment , the path paved with stairs to the front door would be a much bigger obstacle .	-5.6947
She will continue searching until she found the ideal object for herself and her husband .	-2.3203
She grew more before the move than before the spider at her home door .	-4.2471
The US wants to continue prosecuting Snowden	-2.0474
The US has not changed its stance on former US intelligence officer Edward Snowden .	-2.1994
He will continue to be accused of having passed on secret information unauthorised .	-3.9041
So he must face criminal proceedings in the US , said US Secretary of State Jennifer Psaki in Washington .	-3.6384
Nor would Snowden ’ s recent statements make any difference .	-4.1150
Previously , after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow , German Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele had called on the US not to continue to punish him .	-3.6954
Psaki stressed that what was said by Ströbele was that of a parliamentarian , not that of a German member of the government .	-4.8667
The intelligence agency Edward Snowden is basically ready to talk to German authorities .	-3.7141
But first he wants to know his situation clearly .	-3.0762
This has been made clear to the US-sought former NSA staff in an unaddressed letter published by the Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele on Friday after a meeting with Snowden , and passed on to the Federal Government , the Bundestag and the General Public Prosecutor .	-10.0538
The letter has the following wording :	-2.9828
The Responsibility	-2.0932
I have been asked to write to you about your inquiry into mass surveillance .	-2.4506
I am called Edward Joseph Snowden and used to be contracted or employed by a direct employment as a technical expert at the National Security Agency ( NSA ) , the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) and the Defense Intelligence Agency ( DIA ) of the United States .	-3.8367
In the course of my work in these institutions , I witnessed systematic violations of the law of my government , which led me to act on the basis of a moral obligation .	-5.4762
As a result of the publication of these concerns , I was exposed to a serious and persistent hatch that forced me to leave my family and my home .	-4.6804
I live in exile at the moment and I enjoy temporary asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation under international law .	-2.9371
I am encouraged by the resonance of my political action , both in the US and elsewhere .	-1.8269
Citizens around the world , and senior officials - including the United States - have judged the revelations into a system of all-encompassing surveillance that no one is accountable as a service to the public .	-5.2665
These espionage revelations resulted in many proposals for new laws and directives aimed at the previously hidden abuse of public trust .	-9.3534
The benefits to society from these acquired findings are becoming increasingly clear ; at the same time , the risks acquired have been significantly reduced .	-4.8637
Although the result of my efforts has been proven to be positive , my government continues to treat dissent as a breakthrough , seeking to criminalise and charge political opinion .	-5.0000
However , speaking the truth is not a crime .	-1.9313
I am confident that the United States Government , with the support of the international community , will adopt this unacceptable position .	-3.4087
I hope that , when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved , I will be able to contribute appropriately and legally to the responsible clarification of the facts concerning the statements made in the media , particularly with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports .	-5.4885
I look forward to meeting you in your country as soon as the situation is resolved and I thank you for your efforts to safeguard international law , which protects us all .	-3.8300

Kindergarten has found a private buyer .	-1.8709
" The building is in good hands " , says Winterlings Mayor Michael Maier .	-1.6644
The local government sold the former kindergarten in the garden street to a private person .	-2.9487
The Municipal Council approved the sale in its most recent session , not public .	-10.0465
The building changed its owner at a " reasonable " price .	-1.5886
" The community is satisfied " , emphasizes Maier .	-2.2171
EUR 100 000 were allocated to the budget .	-2.1233
It is not yet clear how the new owner intends to use the former kindergarten .	-2.4400
The mayor is right that Winterlingen has handed over responsibility for the building before winter to someone else and therefore no longer has to pay for the entertainment of the house , how to heat , look after the garden and clear the path .	-6.8474
" This effort is now away , " Maier looks forward .	-2.7090

The revelation is the most notable surprise of Mark Halperin ’ s long-awaited work on the 2012 election campaign , “ Double Down : Game Change 2012 . ” . , , . , on . , . on . . , , , . ,	-9.8632
The Times is a copy of the book that will soon appear , and they reported on Thursday evening that presidential top advisers had “ large group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011 ” to find out whether Obama ’ s dwindling hope of re-election would be better if he dropped Biden .	-5.8116
According to Jonathan Martin , the National Policy Correspondent of the Times , the book thoroughly traces the history of the efforts of leading campaign and White House staff , notably former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley , to assess the effect it had on poll numbers to exchange former Secretary of State Clinton against the Vice-President .	-5.9600
The potential change was a strictly guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office .	-2.4215
Only half a dozen of the president ’ s closest advisers – including Daley , former campaign leader Obama , Jim Messina , and former White House Leader David Axelrod , and David Plouffe – knew about the planned change .	-3.3778
In “ Double Down , ” it is claimed that Daley has been at the forefront of efforts to exchange Biden despite its “ narrow , personal relationship , ” before eventually choosing to do so , after the data showed that Clinton ’ s candidacy would “ not significantly improve Obama ’ s chances . ”	-6.3091
In an interview with Martin , Daley confirmed that the government had actually considered replacing Biden with Clinton .	-2.3750
“ I said a whole series of things to be considered , and that was one of them , ” Daley told the magazine .	-3.8558
It must be remembered that the President had terrible poll numbers back then , so we thought : “ For God ’ s will , what do we do ? ”	-4.0999
While Daley described the investigation as “ due diligence , ” Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN that considerable effort had been made during the re-election campaign to find out whether such a move would pay off in the ballot box .	-5.1538
“ In campaigns , not so much money is spent on surveys and focus groups if you don ’ t really think about something , ” Martin said at AC360 .	-4.0251
But it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team thought about exchanges .	-2.5936
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his boss at the time had known about potential change .	-3.0779
While Daley declared that he did not believe that the president was “ aware ” of the potential change , the former chief of staff admitted that it was “ possible ” that Obama knew it .	-3.8094
Martin added that “ Double Down ” did not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether Obama ’ s political explorations had reached the desk .	-3.6406
Cooper asked Martin whether he really thought Obama knew nothing about investigations into whether to let Biden fall in the election .	-3.8729
Martin responded “ Possibly . ”	-2.3130
What happens to my e-mail ?	-2.1477
Email actually means an electronic letter .	-1.6413
Did the design of the Internet service E-Mail technically implemented the secrecy of letters in the same way as the conventional mail ?	-5.9252
During the conception of the early Internet services , the focus was on making communication possible .	-4.4055
Therefore , with regard to the basic technical protocols , no attention has been paid to creating a stable foundation for a heartproof exchange of letters .	-5.0228
Therefore , a conventional e-mail is more like an open postcard than a sealed letter .	-3.2271
If the user " Anna " sends an email to " Benni " , are the computers of the two connected directly ?	-3.4989
The email program or browser of Anna will send the mail to the mail server of their service provider in the first step .	-3.8509
For example , if it has a GMail account , it would be Google .	-2.4319
This mail server sends the content to the provider that Benni uses .	-1.9950
On the track the mail can run over several other servers on the Internet .	-4.0993
Bennie can then call the content at its provider .	-2.5441
Will conventional emails be read through the net ?	-2.3687
Most mails are read several times by software robots on the way .	-3.1361
When providing the sender , it is usually checked whether the mail carries a malicious program as an attachment .	-4.8478
A virus check is also carried out on the receiver systems .	-1.8864
Providers also check if this is a random and unwanted spam mail that is deleted immediately or at least sorted out into a spam folder .	-5.9194
Do the robots have another task ?	-1.4865
For systems like GMail , the robot also determines the information Google needs to place context advertising .	-3.0770
If Anna and Benni communicate via GMail about their coming holiday trips , Google can display links to holiday offers .	-5.0890
Do unknown people also read e-mails with ?	-3.4904
The probability of unauthorized persons reading an e-mail is very low .	-3.6743
In theory , this is possible .	-2.2082
In companies administrators often have the possibility to read electronic mail .	-3.8338
The law enforcement authorities and secret services also have legal means of intercepting or taking note of e-mails .	-2.8262
There is also the possibility of illegal delays .	-3.3992
Is it possible to protect emails against reading the coin ?	-3.2525
An encryption based on the OpenPGP standard can effectively encrypt an email against fellow reading .	-5.7077
With high technical effort it is also possible to conceal the metadata of an email communication so that it is not even easy to identify who has communicated with whom .	-5.3210
How important are Yahoo and Google on the email market in Germany ?	-1.4453
Yahoo and Google , according to a August 2013 survey by Consulting ’ s Consulting , play only a minor role in the mostly privately used mailboxes .	-4.6079
While Yahoo-Mail 's shares were last falling , GMail was able to make clear from Google .	-4.4538
Mother in the Forest Crashes Pensions	-3.7331
When his prayed mother died , a man from Wolfsburg forged a plan .	-1.6319
He buried the dead in a forest - and continued to collect their retirement and care .	-3.3560
To be able to collect pensions and carers further , a 67-year-old Wolfsburger buried his dead mother in the forest after police investigations .	-4.1166
First of all , he averted the death of the 89-year-olds , and then he dropped the money for more than a year and a half .	-5.0370
Now the 67-year-old has to answer for fraud , as a speaker said on Friday .	-2.5033
So the man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt .	-2.1098
The man was suspected in May : at that time , it fell that no medicines were needed for the needy mother .	-4.8473
Pensioners told them that his mother had travelled to Spain .	-2.5298
Because the officials found this strange , they continued to investigate .	-3.0975
It was discovered that the two had lived in a common apartment for more than 15 years and had recently maintained it .	-4.6028
The 67-year-old had finally granted the death of his mother .	-2.5088
Obduction , according to the police , did not produce evidence for a capital crime .	-4.4813
Would you like to have ice cream shining in the dark ?	-3.7020
A British entrepreneur has developed the first bright ice-cream in the dark , using agony .	-9.1139
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent characteristics of the sea animals and created a shining delicacy .	-5.2207
The idea came to him after reading research on grades and persuading Chinese scientists to artificially produce the brilliant protein .	-4.5978
The ice cream reacts when eating with the tongue , increasing the pH value in the protein and causing the light .	-3.4408
Chris explains that the meal reacts to the warmth in the mouth and shines – the more one is licked , the brighter it becomes .	-5.0743
Charlie , founder of the “ Lick Me I ’ m Delicious ” ice cream company , says : “ The product is incredible , but still in a very early production phase , and so you get two grams of it for <unk> 200 . ”	-4.6829
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH value .	-1.3380
When the mouth heats the protein , the pH value and the ice lights up .	-2.9555
We have tested it over the last few months and it seemed ideal to get it on Halloween because it has this wonderful lighting effect .	-5.0041
It is probably the most expensive ice cream I have ever made , because the cloth is four times more expensive than gold .	-3.3125
Every ball costs me about <unk> 140 .	-1.7062
But for that it is delicious .	-2.4437
Charlie ’ s experimental company , based in Bristol , is famous for its unusual flavours , including beer , cheese , beef and gold .	-3.8374
But his latest creation is to become even more ambitious .	-5.4550
He says : “ I want to develop an invisible ice cream . ”	-2.5602
That is impossible in itself because of the breakage of light caused by the ice crystals that make up ice cream ; but I suspect we will find a way to do it .	-5.7399
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a torque artificially manufactured by Chinese scientists .	-2.5927
The TSV Morsum is still without any point in the Handball Association League after six days of the game .	-3.5746
Now it ’ s time for the team of Ingo Ehler to join the Derby against the TSV Daverden , who celebrated his first victory last weekend .	-4.5380
With this game the season begins new for us .	-1.7871
" I hope we finally have our head free , " Ehler 's behaviour is optimistic .	-3.4451
He finally has his complete cadre available , except for the permanent injured Hendrik Blohme .	-4.8032
DVerde also relies on tempo play as we do .	-4.7656
We must therefore keep our error rate low .	-1.8352
Above all , however , we need to increase our coverage , which has lacked a certain impression .	-4.8820
Daverdens Coach Thomas Panitz is more relaxed after the first season victory against North horn .	-4.0444
The game was of course a house number .	-1.6459
But that is why we are far from favorite , because everything can always happen in the derby .	-3.9186
However , Panitz now wants to lay in Morsum to start a series .	-4.0482
Jan-Malte Jodat is missing .	-2.3925
To this end , the A-youth Joost Wind<unk>uz , who is active with double rights at the A-Jugend Competitionist HC Bremen , celebrates its seasonal debut .	-7.4077
Those who are not hot in such a game should stay at home .	-3.2510
Halloween 2013	-1.2213
When I was small , Halloween had some magic .	-1.2823
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets , stay late and suffer for our neighbourhood .	-3.5120
Today I was more likely to become the Halloween Muffel .	-3.7001
Over the last two years , I have not agreed to distribute from my home out of sweets , and I do not think I will do so this year .	-5.2918
But according to statistics , I am a black sheep as far as Halloween is concerned .	-2.3669
The majority of Americans – 158 million to be precise – are celebrating Halloween this year , spending $ 6.9 billion in total on sweets , costumes , and decorations , according to the US Dealers Association ( NRF ) .	-3.5738
One thing I look forward to every Halloween is the trend .	-3.9578
The costumes will account for about $ 1.2 billion of the $ 6.9 billion spent , according to the NRF .	-2.4822
This year , enchanting unspoilt items are the last cry . ! ! . . . . . . . . . .	-8.2157
Women no longer need to wear sexy clothes , they can now also embody seductive food such as pizza , hamburgers or carrots .	-5.2985
As far as men are concerned , I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead , and I bet the Daft-Punk space winners will make it into the Instagram feeds this year .	-4.0334
According to Google , the most sought after costumes are zombies , batman , pirates and witches .	-2.2312
I suspect there is nothing wrong with tradition .	-1.6641
We dressed our dogs last year and were not alone to my surprise .	-3.0786
Indeed , this year , Americans spend $ 330 million on pet costumes , says the NRF .	-2.3242
That is a lot of ' hot dogs ' .	-2.4367
We are not shy about candy .	-2.9063
Americans will spend $ 1.9 billion this year , according to The Nielsen Company .	-1.2734
These are about 270 million kilograms of chocolate , lutches , bonbons and rubber bear .	-4.3408
So good news for the US Department of Commerce ’ s 41 million people who are spreading through the neighborhoods with the phrase “ sweet or saure . ”	-7.6576
In fact , we will buy more than 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and , let us not fool ourselves , we will eat .	-7.8105
The only thing we do not want to consume is the sugar-sweet Candy Corn ; nevertheless , 15 million kilograms of it are sold around Halloween , so the National Association of Sweet Producers .	-4.2553
These are about nine billion grains of maize .	-1.8957
It is a mystery I have not yet been able to resolve .	-2.2201
Nothing belongs more to Halloween than houses in which it spurs .	-2.4324
They have great names like “ Terror Behind the Walls ” ( which , incidentally , is in a real prison ) , “ Howl-O-Scream , ” and “ The House of Shock . ”	-3.2656
There are , in fact , 1,200 officially recognized spuckhouses in the United States that earn $ 500 million , America Haunts said , and that includes the wonderful photos you just pink into your trousers and then put your friends on Facebook where you won ’ t get rid of them again , and then the type on which you stand leaves a comment like “ nice face printing ” .	-9.3396
But let us finally get to the shortcomings .	-2.9347
Charlie Brown trusted us with the Great Bargain when we were children , and the cutting of a pumpkin lord is like the decoration of the Christmas tree – something we have done from small .	-6.3017
Fortunately , the “ baby in the shorts ” trend only started last year thanks to Pinterest , so most of us grew up with cutting the shortfall and not sitting there .	-5.2212
This year , Americans will spend about $ 106 million on pumpkins , according to the US Census Bureau .	-2.8492
The abbreviations , which are slowly rotting in the front garden , probably come from Illinois , where 245 million kilograms of pumpkins were harvested this year .	-5.0076
If you want to score the right points , call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa , California and cut a bit of chicken from their 921 kilo heavy shortfall .	-5.9187
Flat fire in helmet law : rescue forces Berge Cooled Corpses	-4.5044
The fire brigade had to leave in helmet on late Thursday evening .	-3.7579
A three-family house in the Hof district begins fire at night .	-7.8273
The rescue forces have a cooled body from the house .	-2.9065
Rescue forces found a cooled corpse in a three-family house in a helmet in a fire .	-5.6638
Whether it is an inhabitant is still unclear , as a police spokesman said in Bayreuth .	-3.3962
Late Thursday evening it had burnt on the ground floor of the house .	-3.1444
When the fire brigade hit , the flames were already beating out of a window .	-3.2096
The staff went to the apartment and found the corpses in a room .	-3.0613
This room and one other burned out completely .	-3.2632
The entire ground floor was damaged .	-1.3917
All other residents were not at home during the fire , the police continued to explain .	-3.3044
For the time being , the building cannot be inhabited .	-3.8444
The exact cause of the fire was initially not clear .	-2.1064
Germany ’ s largest national church has launched an offensive to promote the profession of pastor .	-3.4293
Background is a possible parish shortage : the Gospel Lutheran Landeskirche Hannover expects that the number of her currently 1,800 pastors will halve by 2030 , according to current situation .	-5.6024
For young people today , the profession is very attractive and offers good future prospects , said Pastor Mathis Burfien ( 43 ) in talks with the Evangelical press service .	-4.4813
It is attractive to be able to determine the working and day-to-day course yourself .	-3.8142
With Burfien , the Landeskirche commissioned a pastor for the first time to inspire young people to study theology .	-4.6052
Currently , fewer and fewer young people choose to study theology after graduation .	-3.2727
Burfia takes this back to the process of deception : " God 's voice is quiet , the world is loud . "	-4.5883
The profession is characterised by great freedom and diversity .	-2.3058
I am the Commissioner for my calendar and can give my priorities where I think it is important .	-4.7271
As a soul carer , pastors could be close to the people .	-3.7672
They earned as much as teachers and could live well from it .	-2.3624
Certainly , more is paid in the free economy , but theologians would have a safe employer .	-3.3871
This comes to the young people of today , who are not just about careers , but about a good job .	-5.5589
According to the National Church , which comprises three quarters of Lower Saxony , around 60 pastors are currently retired every year .	-7.6635
At the same time , about 40 graduates of a theology study begin their Vikariat .	-3.6772
In sparsely populated peripheral areas such as the Harz , the Emsland or the Wendland , it will be difficult to occupy jobs in the future .	-4.3694
Burfien wants to organise study days for young people , among other things , as well as inviting celebrities that have studied theology .	-4.7293
Studies in theology offer broad training .	-3.6201
It can even be the President of the Federal .	-3.3126
Land Rover Rally Series announced	-0.4215
The interior includes racing seats and six-point seat belts as well as a conveyor system .	-4.7555
The options range from strengthened brakes , a service package with support for bowler workshops and logistical support , to vehicle storage between events .	-4.7037
Drew Bowler , Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport , says : “ The rally customers coming to Bowler have changed . ”	-2.5695
They are not all experienced riders , but people who are looking for excitement and adventure and who are looking for an achievable way to world class events .	-5.1177
We are pleased to be able to open this path in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA , and we believe that the format opens up new opportunities to experience the various rally disciplines in Britain and abroad and to prepare newcomers for the rally and reality of Rally Raid .	-6.1086
We had real fun developing the Defender Challenge car – this is an entertaining championship .	-3.4134
In addition , the Defender Challenge has a training and test day in February and the option of participating in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East .	-2.9781
Fire brigade called for the rescue of a chicken , which fell 15 metres above the ground on a dangerous rocky edge in a quarry .	-5.7600
Cockerspaniel Ruby was off the hook after a small traffic accident .	-6.8150
Three days later , she was discovered by a walker in a quarry in her misplaced location .	-3.6571
Fire-fighters were at the rock wall and rescued the dog from the safe death .	-5.0668
The fire brigade succeeded in securing a hip that was set on a 15 metre high lead in a rock wall .	-6.5892
The nine months old cocker spaniel bitch Ruby was left behind after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before it was saved from a quarry on Wednesday .	-5.0293
Scott Alderson , 25 , and his girlfriend Becky Hall , 20 of whom the dog belonged , came to the Flappit quarry in Denholme , West Yorkshire to return to Ruby and thank the firefighters of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service .	-3.6902
They had desperately sought their missing bitch and published requests for help on social networks when they had escaped into the quarry after a small traffic accident .	-5.3752
On Wednesday around 14 : 15 o 'clock , a walker who executed his dog saw the stranded Ruby at the 15-meter high in the quarry .	-6.2160
The Cleckheaton Fire Station technical rescue team rushed to rescue Ruby , which was then transported upwards in a dog box .	-3.7907
Andy Clayton , specialist of the technical rescue team , said : “ She was in a dangerous situation .	-2.3369
It was located in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from above and the ground .	-3.1369
She did not move a muscle during her rescue – she was like frozen .	-3.6366
But now it is doing well .	-1.8769
She then eaten a few dog cakes .	-2.4019
This was quite an unusual effort .	-2.7905
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible .	-1.2721
Peter Lau , specialist of the technical rescue team , said : “ Ruby had a giant piece . ”	-2.7955
It was possible that it was very seriously injured or worse .	-2.3661
Ruby was brought to the examination of the veterinarian , but he did not notice anything other than exhaustion and dehydration .	-4.5397
Becky Hall from Halifax , West Yorkshire , said : “ It was frightening to watch the bailout . ”	-3.2159
I couldn 't believe that she really was up there .	-2.9959
It was wonderful to keep them in the arms .	-2.4834
The veterinarian explained that if exhaustion had become too great and collapsed , it would probably have crashed .	-2.7602
The fire fighters have done a great deal .	-2.6116
It was really brave what they did .	-2.3301
We are simply so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible .	-2.3770
Scott Alderson from Keyley added , “ We were afraid it would fall down but it remained above . ”	-3.2220
The fire fighters were great .	-1.8240
I can hardly believe where it was .	-1.0479
Mick Jagger explains he never logged Katy Perry when she was 18 .	-3.1201
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week , the pop star said she was working as a background singer on Jaggers song " Old Habits The Hard " from 2004 .	-4.2939
Perry explained that she had eaten with the altrocker to the evening , and that “ he forgot me when I was 18 . ”	-5.4616
She added : “ That was a long time ago and he was very nice to me . ”	-2.9053
In a statement , a representative Jaggers , 70 , said on Thursday that he “ categorically denied that he has ever attempted to approach Katy Perry . ”	-3.7970
The representative added , “ Perhaps it confused him with someone else . ”	-2.8287
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest appearance at the Rolling Stones Tour this year .	-2.4587
Her new album “ Prism ” landed on first place this week .	-4.1355
George Kerevan : European Unbundling gives Scots the Choice	-3.0303
A new day , a new story of horror and independence .	-2.3554
This time , we are warned that an independent Scotland is needed to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership .	-5.2246
This is the key word for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a threshold secured with barbed wire along the Hadrian Wall .	-4.1707
Indeed , the strathcly proposal highlighted the potential economic benefits that would bring more freedom of travel in the rest of Europe , but this did not play a part in the headlines , as expected .	-5.9543
Nor has anyone mentioned that EU member states often bow to their strict rules when it is cheaper for them .	-4.4170
Because Scotland is currently not part of the Schengen area , continuing disregard for Brussels would be only a small concession in return for what we really want from the Scots .	-4.9042
So not a story .	-6.2289
And one that has come so long that it already looks like a fossil : the first time I heard the “ independence means passport controls ” duck at least 40 years ago .	-4.9142
An interesting point is lost in the constant repetition of this ancient history .	-3.3847
Why expect an independent Scotland to dance under the European arrow ?	-3.1609
Why exchange the London yoke for that of Brussels , especially now ?	-2.0669
These are the real European news : the great post-war plan to unite Europe has stalled .	-2.7066
With the euro crisis , the European project has officially died .	-1.7177
Parties that are anti-EU or who want to override the euro as a common currency are gaining ground across the EU .	-3.8605
Even in Germany , the Euroskeptic Alternative for Germany – founded only this year – could summon almost five million votes in the September Bundestag election , effectively expelling Free Democrats ( the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrat ) from the Bundestag .	-5.7616
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federalist Europe .	-1.6279
The current economic crisis , however , turns out to be a turning point .	-1.6827
Because of the strict austerity policies imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank , together with the straightjacket into which the national economy is forced by adherence to the single currency , many people believe that the European project has gone too far .	-4.7134
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments causing excessive budget deficits – only in Greece .	-1.9148
Instead , the Eurosystem has fixed its members on exchange rates that are beneficial to German exporters – and German politicians would like to do so .	-3.5963
Without the possibility of devaluation of the local currency , southern Europe will find itself with a built-in productivity disadvantage compared to Germany .	-3.3237
The only way is to cut wages and public spending – spurred by Berlin .	-1.7305
Behind the current budgetary and monetary problems , there is a deeper European productivity problem .	-6.6376
As a result of the “ green ” energy policies imposed by Brussels – a code for subsidising French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – European industry pays twice for electricity and four times gas , compared to the United States .	-4.0816
This is a paralysing cost disadvantage , as we have already seen in Grangemouth .	-3.7304
All wage festivals in the world do not protect the European petrochemical industry from being pushed into the corner by cheap American shale gas .	-3.2189
As a result , revolt is rising , especially in France , the EU ’ s former cheerleader .	-2.9715
After the war , France ’ s political elite saw the EU as a vehicle to keep Germany in check and lift Paris on an equal footing with Washington .	-2.6883
But Berlin no longer needs Paris to be a gateway to political legitimacy , and Europe has expressed its own economic policy , which has to do with the struggling French economy .	-5.7504
The result : Marine Le Pen ’ s right-wing anti-EU National Front has just won a decisive re-election , placing the governing Socialists in third place .	-3.7260
The National Front is now France ’ s most popular party , with 24 % of the vote – a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a right-wing divide would automatically benefit the left .	-4.4152
What makes Le Pen , with its newly gained popularity among the workers ’ white French , do ?	-4.1969
It wants to use next year 's EU elections to forge an anti-EU , anti-common currency bloc in the European Parliament .	-8.5958
If anti-EU parties do well in these elections – and that is perfectly possible – then for the first time such a block could dominate the European Parliament .	-3.5729
That is the point I want to make : in the not-too-distant future , the growing opposition to the EU and the single currency will be united to abolish the euro .	-3.8968
The EU will not disappear , but it will become more like the “ Europe of ( sovereign ) nations , ” which General de Gaulle favored .	-2.4676
Germany and some of its satellite economies may hold on to the euro , but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies .	-2.2101
I expect the United Kingdom to distance itself from this project in the hope of flattering with the United States .	-3.2357
But Washington ’ s growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain alone will be in Atlantic rain .	-2.3559
Where does Scotland go by all this ? ?	-5.3736
We can decide to be a region of ( ultimately ) small England .	-1.9684
Or we can defend our own economic interests – including telling Berlin and Brussels what they can get stuck there . . , . . . . . . . . with . . . .	-8.5751
I suspect Scotland could go very well in a loose European association if we retain our own currency .	-3.9743
Cooperation with other similarly thinking countries is easier in a non-federated Europe of nations .	-2.0636
Otherwise , we should consider doing Norway the same and retaining our economic independence .	-2.7145
The SNP government in Scotland is – remarkably – the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe and won a spectacular majority in 2011 due to the rejection of the proposed ( and made ) cuts that Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the Tory-Lib Dem coalition had to accept .	-5.0160
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to opt for independence now , only to have austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels .	-3.6831
Growing Early Puberty	-2.2160
Afro-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white peers , as studies show .	-2.0937
Physical changes do not immediately mean puberty	-2.5430
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible .	-1.6106
Experts believe that epidemic obesity is a trigger to early puberty .	-1.6938
The early puberty trend is less pronounced among boys .	-2.9808
The former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in children 's health and family issues .	-8.8001
Should a mother be worried if their daughter grows breasts and shame at the age of seven or eight years ?	-3.5310
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando , Florida , the pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz declared that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and were a new norm .	-4.1955
“ I spend a lot of time reassuring parents – usually this is not a sign that puberty is now happening quickly , ” Kaplowitz explained .	-5.6222
Obvious indications of the development , such as growing breasts , shame and axle hairs , and body smell , are evident in girls .	-5.5752
Nevertheless , there has been only a slight shift in the age of the menarchs ( occurrence of the first circulation ) over the last 40 years .	-9.2997
In the United States , the average age is 12.5 years , less than 12.75 in 1970 .	-2.0913
“ When the development of the breasts begins , it takes at least two to three years to the menarche , ” said Kaplowitz , also author of the book “ Early Puberty in girls : The essential advisor to deal with this frequently occurring problem ” .	-6.1022
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty progresses .	-1.8426
It is controversial , which is actually the beginning of puberty , but it is “ premature ” if breast growth is accompanied by a growth boost from eight years ago .	-5.1543
In most cases , the process slows or stagnates – something that a child doctor can monitor closely .	-2.2392
With faster advances , tests could be displayed by an endicronologist to eliminate serious problems such as tumor or cysts .	-5.3731
There are methods of treatment for delaying an early menstruation and defending another consequence : the premature ageing of bones , which can ultimately lead to growth impairment and therefore small body growth in adults .	-6.5900
Recommendations for medicinal or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child , the speed of development , the rate of growth and emotional maturity .	-7.4118
Psychosocial aspects are also important .	-1.2870
Kaplowitz is cautious when it comes to medicines , but he admits : “ The suppression of puberty can mitigate behavioral problems and the emotions of girls to be different from their contemporaries . ”	-5.1924
The other major problem is understandable : parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have the period .	-1.6562
“ They worry about the risk of pregnancy or how they handle the hygienic side , ” Kaplowitz said .	-3.7765
“ It was a shock , ” recalls a woman whose daughter received ten her days .	-3.2440
Although there were first signs and we had discussed menstruation , it was emotionally not prepared .	-3.3011
She came home scared and excited from school because she was the first in her circle of friends .	-2.5400
There are many widely published theories about the causes of early puberty .	-1.7072
But there is no coherent evidence that hormones in milk or other foods , chemicals in the environment , or sexual embassies in the media are rotten .	-4.2545
Young , like girls , get into puberty earlier .	-3.2347
Kaplowitz believes that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of obesity .	-1.8894
He supported the carrying out of a study in 2001 on girls aged between six and nine years , which establishes a connection between body fat and admission to puberty .	-4.2817
Other studies support this conclusion , but there are many other factors involved .	-1.9481
African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white contemporaries .	-2.5571
There are various explanations .	-1.8169
Globally , an early puberty seems to be influenced by all kinds of things , from economic conditions to climate to genes .	-2.8886
Another mystery is that , although boys are already growing the face and shambles , the trend toward a full-fledged former puberty is not as strong as girls .	-6.2684
Other doctors at the AAP conference underlined the complexity of the issue .	-2.1102
The emergence of acne and shamhair is common even in babies and infants .	-2.7514
“ We must be careful as we identify the true beginning of puberty , ” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman , a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children ’ s Hospital in Morristown , New Jersey .	-2.7787
Parents should not hesitate to consult their paediatrician how they should speak to their child .	-3.3634
“ This can mean you have to talk sooner than expected , ” Kaplowitz said .	-5.4262
If you stay calm , the child usually reacts well .	-2.5421
Girls flourishing early need the insurance that the process is a normal part of life , even if it occurs earlier than intended .	-3.9300
Jumbo manufacturers argue over seating in the face of large orders .	-2.2391
A dispute over the width of seats in the tourist class for long-haul flights has arisen between leading aircraft manufacturers , indicating the tone for a bitter collision on the Dubai Airshow this month .	-5.6049
The dispute revolves around the seating width offered to passengers on long flights in the tourist class – not always those who seek the greatest efforts by airlines , but this designated space is key to the efficiency claims of the newest Airbus SAS and Boeing Co aircraft .	-6.8650
This week , Airbus called for an industry standard requiring a seat width of at least 46 cm ( 18 inches ) in the tourist class , but the US Archrival Boeing says that airlines should decide .	-10.0000
The dispute comes at a time when aircraft builders are competing to sell even larger versions of their two-engine long-haul flyers , and expect records at the event from 17 to 21 November .	-5.0316
How the rear part of the aircraft is designed – in particular , if there are rows of nine or ten seats – is crucial to the economic outcomes given by the new “ mini jumbo ” design .	-5.4058
Boeing claims that its modernized “ 777X ” seats 406 people in the tourist class who are more than 17 inches wide and thus allow ten per row .	-5.5119
Airbus explains that the competing version of the A350 carries 350 people in 18 inch wide seats in the tourist class , with nine per line .	-4.1474
Aerospace giants often share shots about technical details by advertising in the trade press .	-5.3299
Now Airbus is appealing directly to the public in front of the Dubai Airshow , where the 777X , with more than 100 orders , is expected to make the race .	-4.7417
Recently , the company presented an advertisement that could be the beginning of a new ad war , showing donors an image in which three people are queued together in a restaurant , and the title : “ Would you accept that ? ”	-6.5050
“ Boeing proposes long-haul flights in seats that are closer than regional turbo-props , ” says Airbus sales chief John Leahy .	-4.1513
People are getting thicker in the face of changed eating habits , but aircraft seats have not changed radically .	-4.0251
Between the early 1970s , when the Boeing 747 defined modern long-haul journeys , and the end of the century , the weight of the average American male between 40 and 49 years increased by 10 % , according to the data of the US Department of Health .	-4.9119
The size of the 21st century male average American waist is 100.8 cm according to US health statistics .	-4.2340
Airbus says that its rival is sticking to a seating concept from the 1950s , when the average body size of the freshly baked “ jet set ” was narrower .	-5.3119
Research has been carried out , according to Airbus , that an additional 2.54 cm duty per seat increases sleep quality by 53 % .	-4.6075
Boeing disputes the Airbus figures on the seats and says that it is not at the manufacturers ’ discretion to decide how airlines strike the balance between flight tariffs and the facility .	-5.5327
The company also explains , according to studies , that the experience in the aircraft depends on more than the width of the seat .	-4.7734
“ It really amounts to giving airlines flexibility so that they can do what they think they need to be successful , ” explains the flight cabin expert Kent Craver from Boeing .	-4.8088
They do not want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable .	-1.3542
They know their business better than anyone .	-1.2301
For passengers , the issue is more elbow freedom , but for manufacturers , it is becoming increasingly an issue that can affect sales .	-5.3768
Behind the dispute is a race for aircraft orders with an estimated USD 700 billion at least after list prices over the coming decades , which could have a lasting impact on the US or Europe ’ s export balance .	-5.1178
As Reuters first reported in July , the seat layout is the driving force behind the battle for the new jets .	-3.1258
Both Airbus and Boeing maintain 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest two-engine long-range design than the market leader in this segment , Boeing 77-300ER 365 seats .	-3.8579
The Boeing statements on the results depend partly on the fact that the 777X with its ten seats per row is compared to the original design of nine seats in the 777 .	-4.3711
Increased costs per unit are still lower than those for machines currently used with ten seats per line .	-4.4528
“ Boeing thus keeps more seats on its aircraft to make it more competitive with our products , ” says Kevin Kenniston , Head of passenger comfort at European Airbus .	-3.9039
On the other hand , analysts say that full cabins of ten seats per row for existing 77s indicated that many passengers opted for the tighter arrangement , which could be accompanied by cheaper fares .	-4.7287
“ Eighteen duty seats would be great for passengers , but the reality is : from an economic point of view , the Airbus offer is controlled by the threat from the 777 , ” says Mary Kirby , expert on cabin facilities , founder and editor of Runway Girl Network .	-5.3119
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats , but a catalogue of suppliers from which the airlines can choose .	-2.8375
The world travelers of jet vendors even carry bandages with them to measure the setting up in the competition .	-5.8632
Even if they offer comfort , all manufacturers also offer jets with high-composite design for low-cost airlines and regional flights .	-5.0743
Airbus offers a ten-seated A350 , but it has not sold , according to its own statement .	-4.7053
Until recently , Airbus stressed the importance of more cabin adaptability and offered wide seats in the corridors for some jets .	-3.6024
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets , experts say that the call for a new industry standard would probably be squeezed , but could distract from the wave of 77X sales .	-4.1780
New Anti-Nicotine vaccine could make the smoke of pleasure .	-3.8365
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could spoil the fun of smoking .	-1.5548
A single dose of vaccine was able to protect mice from nicotine for a lifetime .	-2.2532
Prior to human testing , more experiments are needed , which may take several years , but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said that the first results were good .	-4.7232
“ We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can once help millions of smokers who have tried to stop trying to find out all the methods available on the market , but have experienced that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches , ” Cornell said .	-5.5538
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to provide genetic information about the production of nicotine antibodies .	-2.8314
The virus selectively infects liver cells , which then produce a permanent stream of antibodies .	-2.3463
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain , leaving a smoker with no nicotine high .	-3.4202
In experiments , vaccinated mice to which nicotine was administered contributed its normal level of activity .	-4.2329
If there had been no vaccination , the researchers declared that the nicotine had reached its brain .	-4.2007
The experiments are described in the Science Translational Medicine .	-1.6315
Previous vaccines failed because they contained antibodies .	-1.9052
Vaccines had to be given so often to maintain the antibody level that they were expensive and impractical .	-3.8622
But the cost of the new vaccine is probably much lower , because it transforms liver cells into antibody factories .	-2.7519
As Professor Crystal said , a future human vaccine could be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette and thus prevent nicotine addiction .	-4.5601
But it is more likely that smokers would use it to stop .	-2.1753
“ They then know that when they start smoking again , they no longer enjoy it because of the nicotine vaccine , and this helps them to lose their habit , ” he explains .	-5.8325
British scientists said that the results were interesting but warned that further research was needed .	-2.3528
Tripodi disputes having been influenced by Obeid	-2.2101
Contrary to former Labor Minister Joe Tripodi of New South Wales , government corruption supervision is initiating an investigation .	-4.4299
The former NSW minister denies amending Maritime lending rules at the request of his political mentor , Eddie Obeid , who had hidden holdings in three properties in state-controlled land .	-4.7285
On Friday , the Independent Commission Against Corruption ( ICAC <unk> Independent Commission against Corruption ) extended its investigations into the question of whether Obeid has influenced various state ministers to extend leased contracts at the Circular Quay , where the Obeids operated two restaurants and a cafe without calling for tenders after their expiration in August 2005 .	-5.5913
Now it is being determined for the accusation that Obeid 's covert interest in the land was known after Tripodi 's previous Deputy Chief of Staff Lynne Ashpole announced on Thursday .	-5.1647
In many years of talks that began in 2005 , the government had pushed for public tenders for the lending contracts .	-4.0790
The tenants were opposed and wanted longer maturity .	-5.5805
In 2009 , the leased contracts for companies at Circular Quay , which annually raised $ 2.5 million to Obeids , were extended without a public tender .	-5.6952
Tripodi , who was Minister for the Port of February 2006 to November 2009 , was originally in favour of public calls for tenders .	-4.2703
But he contested the changes made to Obeid ’ s request , which , as Tripodi confirmed , had pushed for the government ’ s renegotiation .	-5.3401
One of the ICAC telephone records showed talks from August and September 2007 between Obeid , Tripodi and Steve Dunn , a senior official who had moved to the port ministry after working under Obeid in the Fisheries Authority .	-4.8329
'Was the subject discussed in these telephone conversations to draw up commercial leasing arrangements ? ' asked Vice-Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi .	-5.4001
“ No , ” Tripodi replied .	-1.2380
I cannot remember what was discussed , but it was definitely not .	-1.8645
It is certainly not between me and Mr Obeid .	-2.5788
Israeli fighter aircraft Attack Goal in Syria , Official Sources	-4.0011
Israeli hunting aircraft had attacked a target in the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday , confirmed a senior government official against Fox News .	-4.9884
The official did not explain what the objective was , but said it was at least one .	-2.5424
According to Association Press , the target was Russian SA-125 missiles .	-3.4039
At least twice this year , Israel has already carried out air strikes on missile supplies in Syria .	-2.8338
Foreign workers with 457 visas could be subjected to “ the test of authenticity . ”	-3.1749
The government is considering a 457-visa “ authenticity test ” for foreign workers as part of expanded measures .	-4.4982
If the test is introduced , it would be used through a criterion to prevent the 457 from being used to occupy unskilled jobs or as a back door to attract family and friends to Australia .	-5.2374
Today , a government proposal for discussion was published after the former Labor Party member Maxine McKew condemned the government ’ s comments on foreign workers , because they could be seen as insults by Australia ’ s neighbors .	-5.5195
“ Strong declarations such as to make foreigners at the back , ” and Australia ’ s first stop , are a very unpleasant retreat in times when unions demanded a protected labor market , ” she said Australia India Institute today .	-7.5501
Historically , it was that white labour should be protected – and if some in the region were echoing this historical artifact , that would not surprise me .	-4.2001
The proposal for discussion encompasses twelve measures that were once thought up by former immigration minister Chris Bowen .	-3.9419
Immigration Minister Brendan O 'Connor , who was in talks yesterday about smuggling of human beings in Sri Lanka , has implemented five of the recommended changes , and others are still being considered .	-4.0402
If the “ authenticity criterion ” is adopted , someone requesting a visa could be checked to see whether “ the application is correct in cases where the applicant is related or is personally connected to the owner or a relevant person of the supporting company . ”	-6.7150
Companies could also be required to hold accountability on the number of 457 visa holders , after , in the past , companies that initially wanted to support only a small number of workers ended up with hundreds .	-5.2414
Meanwhile , a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker probably died from a heart attack after arriving this week with a refugee boat on the Christmas island .	-3.9024
The late nine year-old son of the man who came to Australia with him has been supervised by an adult cousin since his father ’ s death on Wednesday , who was also on the boat .	-4.8509
Australian authorities brought the man to the Christmas Island Hospital , where he died .	-1.6692
The British Government has announced a study aimed at increasing the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland .	-2.6695
In the work of HS2 Ltd , it is proposed to establish high-speed links between Scotland and the North of England as early as phase 1 in 2026 .	-4.2652
Secretary of Transport Baroness Kramer said that the project “ will bring Britain closer together . ”	-2.5829
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was very pleased to work with the British Government on this plan .	-2.7479
Phase 1 is a new high-speed rail link between London and the West Midlands .	-2.1023
After phase 2 there will be links to Manchester and Leeds .	-2.4113
In June , the government corrected the estimated cost of building the high-speed road between London and North England from <unk> 32.7 billion to <unk> 42.6 billion .	-2.8401
The British Government , which is involved in discussions with transport Scotland , has mandated HS2 Ltd to look for further stretch capacity and travel time improvements for North England and Scotland .	-5.7573
This includes the possibility of travelling from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London from the end of the day to three hours or less .	-3.6563
Baroness Kramer said : “ Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network that brings Britain closer together and its cities . ”	-3.1054
We are moving forward with HS2 because it brings enormous benefits .	-2.4281
Without it , we face a capacity crisis on our rail network .	-2.6129
But it is also about the link between 18 British cities , including Glasgow and Edinburgh , which will be improved thanks to HS2 .	-3.1604
As the Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael said , “ Today ’ s announcement is good news for Scotland . ”	-2.4613
On behalf of the Scottish government , Keith Brown Carmichael called for “ unambiguous ” support for Scottish integration into the HS2 network .	-3.4767
Brown said : “ The high-speed rail link has enormous economic potential for Scotland , while Scotland ’ s economic power also provides an argument for fast rail links across Britain . ”	-4.7342
We are therefore pleased to work as a partner of the British Government and to examine the options for a high-speed rail link in Scotland , which creates benefits for all and complements the Glasgow Edinburgh link that the Scottish Government is already planning .	-5.2961
I look forward to examining the report of inquiry with the British ministers next year and taking the next steps together .	-3.4158
Electronic equipment in aeroplanes is provisionally in force in Australia .	-2.0462
Australia ’ s airline passengers must continue to disable tablets and smartphones at startup and landing , despite efforts in the US to relax the arrangements for such equipment .	-4.1523
The US Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) allows US airlines to change their specifications so that passengers can read , watch , or play on their devices during critical flight phases , as long as they are in “ flight mode . ”	-3.9717
During most of the flight , passengers are already allowed to do this , but many people find it annoying that they are not allowed to read their e-books when they start and landing .	-4.9683
Australian companies are observing the decision to implement them , which US airlines have to do a huge amount of work , but are not pursuing immediate plans to amend their regulations .	-6.4876
The CASA Aviation Authority also stated that the announcement would be considered , but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic equipment still apply in critical flight phases in Australia .	-4.7453
“ CASA currently does not have any specific rules on the use of electronic equipment in the airplane , ” has been announced .	-4.6055
The subject is subject to provisions whereby airlines must maintain safety at any time and passengers must follow the safety instructions given by cabin crews .	-4.1862
Virgin has already held talks with CASA about extending its Wi-Fi entertainment system to flights and has said that it is open to change , but that it should be initiated by the legislator .	-4.8312
“ We would welcome a review of CASA ’ s approval of electronic devices , because we are convinced that this would improve customer experience after we offer wireless entertainment during the flight , ” a speaker said .	-4.5853
Qantas explained that they will remain with the current rules until further notice .	-3.8746
“ Our current guidelines provide that electronic devices must not be used at startup and landing , and we currently do not have plans to change this , ” the company said .	-5.7087
The FAA rules apply to US airlines .	-1.9122
However , we are always interested in developments in regulations that can benefit passengers and will certainly look closely at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it .	-4.3049
The choice varies depending on the age of the fleet .	-3.4459
They must prove that their aircraft can tolerate radio disturbances by mobile devices , and change manuals , training materials , hand baggage programs and customer instruction .	-4.0449
“ After an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet , it can allow passengers to use portable , light electronic devices such as tablets , e-book readers and smartphones at any level , ” the FAA announced .	-4.5623
In the event of misconception , the crew will instruct the passengers during the landing process .	-7.1779
The group also recommended that heavier devices be stayed safely under the seat or in the subjects over the seats at startup and landing .	-5.3780
BVB trailers with luminaires for ugly scenes were provided in the Veltins Arena in front of the swing against Schalke .	-7.5573
Borussia Dortmund subsequently announced severe consequences .	-2.1233
Prior to the Friday match , the Ultras reacted with a silence - first .	-4.0134
It was an unfamiliar acoustic that the viewer had until just before the start of the Bundesliga game between the German vice-champion Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart in the signal Iduna Park .	-7.3088
The guest fans with their sings were to be heard .	-4.3973
On the other hand , the South Tribune , where the most loyal and loudest BVB fans stand , presented itself exceptionally quiet : no song , no raids .	-6.1697
The capo 's podium , which otherwise coordinates the common fire , remained unoccupied .	-3.5294
And at the front of the grandstand , a big flag was flying " Stadium Ban Section " .	-6.3033
Only as a goalkeeper novel Weidenfeller , as always the first BVB player , took the place , burned short-term cheer .	-5.3394
When his team members followed , there were vocals and blowing scarves - but not far from everywhere .	-4.4770
The central blocks 12 and 13 of the South Tribune have had nothing to do with it .	-4.9035
Also that stadium spokesman Norbert Dickel recounted the positive experiences of the last few days - Derbysieg , victory over Arsenal , contract extension of trainer Jürgen Klopp - did not cause festivities .	-6.0242
It was only five minutes before the tap that the capo realized his podium - and until then the straightforward and tangible tension was unleashed in a loud cry when the thickness was as usual on the hills of the stadium .	-15.8770
The last one , as always , was the South Tribunal in the series - and finally , as usual , the most loudest place in the stadium .	-6.8929
And , at the latest , when the South Tribune had the loud call for " Derby-winner is up , " everything was like ever .	-9.3028
Silence has probably been a reaction to what has happened in recent days .	-3.2734
Immediately before Revierderby at the FC Schalke 04 , some of the participating BVB fans had fired luminaires in the audience ranks and in the place - meeting almost goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller .	-5.1525
The game was late due to the chaotic scenes .	-2.3067
BVB-Boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had received the tops of the Dortmunder Ultras in his office - and we believe Watzke 's words , this was a rather untiring date for the fan representatives .	-5.8112
" There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra-movement , " said BVB Boss on Thursday evening at a panel discussion in Frankfurt .	-3.7752
As an immediate measure , Watzke prohibited Ultras from choreography for playing home against the VfB Stuttgart .	-4.8714
" I forbidden this , " he said .	-2.5232
We cannot give up the zero tolerance policy on pyrotechnics .	-1.6227
In addition , the Ultras have been shown various ways of punishing them - until Tuesday they now have time to choose one .	-4.4620
Otherwise , according to Watzke , the BVB will impose a sanction by the end of next week .	-3.1153
" This will be drastic " , insured Watzke .	-4.6054
We should be interested to know what the responses in the southern gallery will be .	-5.2230
Singapore ’ s Central Class Crisis	-2.8606
Janani Amirthalinga exchanges a golden armripe , a ring and a pair of ear rings in a deposit house in Singapore Shopping Centre in Bendemeer .	-5.8953
“ My husband and I just bought a house , there is all my money inside , ” says Amirthalinga .	-3.4249
Although she earns 3,000 Singapore dollars each month ( approximately € 1,730 ) as an administrative assistant and her husband also work , monthly family income is not enough , she explains .	-4.1909
In fact , in parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt is increasing – demand is so great that ValueMax , where she made her exchange , became the third deposit house listed on the Singapore stock exchange this week .	-4.6679
The pledge of jewellery is not only a quick way to get money – 1,300 Singapore dollars in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan .	-3.9066
Typically , Singapore Pfandhouses demand an effective annual rate of 17 % , which is just over 15.4 % required by the United Overseas Bank , a local lender with a branch in the same shopping centre .	-4.7617
Pfandhouses do , however , offer the advantage that there is no need to review creditworthiness or revenue evidence , which is why loans are faster than they are available to banks .	-6.2442
That is why millions of people in the region are turning to Pfandhäuser , as families feel the pressure from rising living costs and increasing household and consumer debt .	-5.0954
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap credit , owing to loose fiscal policies in developed economies , families with lower and middle-income households are seeking to compensate for the difference in a staggering economy .	-5.4494
This week , the rating agency Standard & Poor ’ s growing fiscal debt , mainly through rising mortgages , was a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks .	-4.4892
According to the Agency , Malaysia , Thailand and Singapore have the highest level of household debt in Asia relative to GDP .	-3.0137
Malaysia is at the top of the list , with 80 % of GDP , an increase of 60 % still in 2008 .	-3.1267
Economists are also worried about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand , which has just emerged from a technical recession this week .	-2.8075
On Thursday , data showed a continuing weakness in exports and a reduction in consumer demand .	-2.7083
“ In the end , this means that with costs rising , people in the middle to bottom segment ( income scale ) will try to supplement their income wherever possible , ” says Song Seng Wu , economist at CIMB , a Malaysian bank .	-4.3961
Historical peaks in gold prices over the last two years have reinforced the trend to pledge personal items , as people take the opportunity to turn family jewelry into cash .	-4.5632
In Singapore , about 70 % of the pledged items are in the 200 deposit houses of the city state of gold .	-4.6262
People say , “ The price of gold looks good , let us pledge grandmothers gold chain and recover next month . ”	-3.3510
The largest Thai Pfandhouse operator , EasyMoney , has experienced a 20 % increase in customer service in its branches in recent months .	-3.9294
Pfandal growth is so strong that ValueMax , Bendemeer ’ s subsidiary and 15 other people in Singapore , wants to expand not only to neighboring Malaysia – where the company operates four homes – but also outside Asia , according to Yeah Lee Ching , Managing Director of ValueMax .	-12.9247
The company finances that at 60 % of the 66 million Singapore dollars it took this week with the Singapore stock exchange .	-4.2747
While some lenders have fallen into the crossfire for high interest rates , Yeah explains that Pfandhäuser not only fought cheaper interest rates than other lenders , but also did not directly raise debt .	-6.3585
“ Customers derive objects they already own , and the liquid of personal assets does not increase household debt , ” she explains .	-4.5181
The deposit business is increasingly accepted socially as short-term , secure financing .	-2.9852
Nor are all the people who use debt in financial difficulties .	-4.1346
Singapore 's rich people also come to ValueMax branches to pledge gold bars and Rolex watches , for which they receive up to 60 % of the purchase price in cash .	-4.8727
Customers from all social classes come to us .	-2.6818
“ These include wealthy who lend something for a business or investment in the short term , or small companies that need to bridge bottlenecks in the cash flow , ” Yeah says .	-4.4670

Saving $ 325 million in Tasmanian health care	-3.4172
The Australian government insists on the hard conditions associated with the rescue package of over $ 325 million for Tasmanian health care to ensure that the federal government cannot waste the money .	-4.3693
Federal Health Secretary Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take “ immediate measures ” to avert a crisis caused by an ageing population of the island state , a higher rate of chronic illnesses and system restrictions .	-4.1683
The funding for a period of four years was decided upon after intergovernmental consultations with the independent Tasmanian MEP Andrew Wilkie .	-4.4674
“ The government has put together an emergency rescue package that , in our view , addresses the unique challenges facing the federal state , ” Plibersek said today .	-4.1499
The $ 325-million package includes $ 31 million instant aid for electoral benefits .	-4.9103
A further 2600 operations , including orthopedic interventions and grey Star treatments , are intended to eliminate residues .	-6.1611
In addition , there is money for daily clinics in Hobart and Launceston , better aftercare after stationary stays , professional training , mental health services and the introduction of a system for electronic recording of health data in local hospitals .	-4.8966
“ These investments are in line with the ideas that have told me about the clinic staff that they were the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system , ” Tanya PLibersek said .	-5.4599
The Minister insisted on strict reporting and accountability for the Tasmanian Government .	-2.2221
The state must retain the current level of funding to receive money from the Commonwealth , and report monthly on where the additional funds were spent .	-4.3537
A three-headed Commission will be set up to ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible .	-3.0178
As Wilkie explained today , the $ 325 million would be of little use if “ they were not accompanied by real reforms that put the public Tasmanian health system on a more sustainable course . ”	-4.0803
Nevertheless , he commended the government for responding to his request for urgent help , which he first expressed to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May .	-3.2316
“ I am confident that federal aid will make a major contribution to removing the state ’ s public health system from the Sorge List , ” said Wilkie .	-4.2120
According to the federal government , these electoral achievements will largely make up for the recent cuts .	-4.0420
But the opposition spokesman at federal level , Peter Dutton , thinks today ’ s announcement is only a “ pause solution . ”	-4.0422
“ We are in today ’ s situation because the Labor State government has withdrawn $ 430 million from the health system , ” he said to ABC TV .	-3.8918
It cannot be the case that a state government is tearing almost half a billion dollars out of the system and that the Commonwealth is pouring 300 million , and then pretending to be good news .	-10.6062
Dutton asked Pllibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the bailout would be spent on additional bureaucracy .	-3.0481

Syria has destroyed its ability to manufacture chemical weapons , such as a monitoring group	-3.0829
Syria has destroyed important chemical-weapons and toxic gas munitions , the global chemical weapons surveillance group declared on Thursday , while serious clashes occurred in the north of the country near one of the sites that allegedly contain toxic substances .	-5.3720
Also on Thursday , a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people were killed soon after the civil war began .	-3.4050
The announcement of the Organisation for the Ban of Chemical Weapons ( OPCW ) came one day before the deadline .	-3.1458
1 November , which Damascus , based in The Hague , had set up to destroy or “ inoperable ” all equipment for chemical weapons , including all machinery for mixing chemicals into toxic gas and filling ammunition .	-5.0495
Ending this process , which is basically the first stage of destruction , is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable aimed at destroying all Syria ’ s chemical weapons by mid-2014 .	-3.6080
Destroying the institutions means that Syria cannot produce new chemical weapons .	-2.3978
Damascus must , however , begin to destroy existing weapons and stocks .	-2.7047
According to assumptions , there are about 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons in the country , including muscular gas and the Sarin nerve gas .	-4.0354
The announcement came at a time when , on Thursday , there were battles in the city of Safira , experts say that there is a chemical weapons production facility and storage facilities , as announced by the United Kingdom ’ s Syrian Human Rights Monitoring Centre .	-4.9181
The group of activists who persecuted the number of dead over a network of activists in Syria declared on Thursday that 120.296 people died .	-3.6402
Of these , 61.067 civilians , including 6.365 children .	-2.0254
On the side of the government , 29.954 of them belonged to President Bashar Assad 's army , 18,678 are government-friendly fighters and 187 Lebanese Hizbollah militias .	-3.1685
Also among the dead , 2,202 army soldiers and 5,375 opposition fighters , many of them foreigners .	-2.7891
On 25 July , the UN estimated the number of deaths in this conflict since March 2011 to 100,000 .	-1.7307
This number has not been updated .	-1.7255
The conflict has forced some two million people to flee the country .	-7.2608
Assad ’ s troops have been fighting the rebels in Safira for weeks , many of whom have links to al-Qaeda groups .	-2.5266
The observatory said that on Thursday there were losses on both sides , but did not mention details .	-3.7971
The fighting underscores the danger facing the chemical weapons inspectors , because their mission to liberate Syria from its toxic arms arsenal is a race against the era in the midst of a dead civil war . with on . on the of .	-5.7158
According to the OPCW , which cooperates closely with the United Nations , the team is “ now convinced that it has seen and experienced its destruction all of Syria ’ s major production and mixing facilities . ”	-5.0686
“ No further inspection activities are currently planned . ”	-3.1734
Earlier this week , the inspectors said they had completed the first round of inspections and visited 21 out of 23 of the sites indicated by Damascus .	-3.4426
Due to security concerns the visit of two bodies was not possible , the inspectors said .	-3.2925
On Thursday , the OPWC declared , according to the Syrian statement , that the two sites had been “ abandoned ... and that the existing chemical weapons programme objects had been transferred to other facilities mentioned that were inspected . ”	-5.9589
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two facilities that the OPCW inspectors could not visit .	-2.4879
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons , to be approved by the OPWC Executive Committee next month .	-3.1335
“ I salute the bravery and the courage you have all shown in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever carried out by this organisation , ” said Ahmed Uzumcu , the Director-General of the Supervisory Organisation , in a comment published by OPCW .	-4.7137
For three years now , the mainly Sunni Muslim rebels in this civil war have been fighting Assad ’ s government and its security forces , many members of the Alawites , against a secession of Shia Islam .	-3.8377
In view of further developments , the head of the observatory Rami Abdurrahman said that on Wednesday there was a strong explosion in an air defence facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia .	-3.9609
The explosion was not known , he explained .	-2.2840
anger over verdict for Bali bombers	-3.4234
The survivors and relatives of the 202 people who died in the Bali bomb in 2002 were angry at the judgment of the last of the offender , who was brought to justice , because she felt that Umar Patek was supposed to be under permanent law .	-7.4269
Patek , who was fleeing almost ten years as one of the most sought after people in Southeast Asia , was sentenced yesterday for his role in building explosives for the bomb attack to a prison sentence of 20 years .	-5.1145
It could be made redundant after 15 years with punitive exposure .	-3.1986
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder because of the attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta , where 202 people died , including 88 Australians , and many others were injured .	-3.1821
There has also been a condemnation in a series of terrorist charges , including a wave of explosives in Indonesia ’ s churches on Christmas Eve in 2000 .	-5.3598
The Public Prosecutor had called for a lifetime imprisonment , even if she could have applied for the death penalty for the man who , due to his reputation as a master bomber builder , was also called “ Demolition Man . ”	-6.0657
The decision aroused painful memories at June Corteen , a mother from Perth , who lost her 39 years old twin daughter Jane and Jenny in the devastation caused by Patek and his co-conspirators almost ten years ago .	-4.3963
Fighting with tears , she said that Patek should have been sentenced to death .	-3.3483
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys .	-3.1757
“ You should put him in front of a firing squad , ” Corteen said to AAP .	-4.7428
I have to live every day with no more grandchildren and I will never see my daughters .	-3.5432
The Sari Club was aligned to the ground when , on 12 October 2002 , a massive bomb exploded in a small trunk parked in front of the nightclub just after 23 p.m.	-5.9362
Peter Hughes was in Paddy 's Bar , where only 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber exploded an explosive backpack .	-2.6919
He fell into coma for one month after the attack , and “ died ” three times , while moving to a life conservation system .	-4.6122
Hughes said that Patek deserved the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cell Jemaah Islamiah – Amrozi , Mukhlas , and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the bloodbath and executed four years ago .	-2.5667
It is true that this type should be given the death penalty above all else .	-3.3775
Leaving him alive – no , there is no reason to keep him alive .	-2.5640
Having 20 years after killing 202 people and injuring hundreds is not much .	-2.2970
Patek was the last of the Bali bombers to court .	-2.6935
Almost a decade of arrest , he was eventually taken up in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad in January 2011 , where US forces killed former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden just under four months later .	-4.6356
During the negotiation , an FBI agent stated that intelligence reports had revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with a view to rebuilding the link between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda .	-4.2493
“ He did not face up , ” Corteen said .	-2.7160
Until recently , he did not show any respect for how much suffering he inflicted on other people .	-4.1138
The judgment was made before the ten-year anniversary of the attack this year , which was celebrated in Bali and Australia .	-3.8777
“ There will be many tears this year , ” Corteen said .	-1.5207
Patek may appeal against his verdict .	-2.0058
FAA : Passengers can now use electronic devices in aircraft ( but do not have mobile phone calls )	-3.4203
Passengers can now listen to their electronic devices for reading , playing , music , and using movies but not making phone calls , from departure to landing , according to the new guidelines issued by the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) in the USA on Thursday .	-6.1833
But passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately .	-1.4470
The speed with which they would be implemented , depending on the airline concerned , was explained by FAA staff Michael Huerta at a press conference .	-4.4934
The airlines must demonstrate to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new directives and that they have updated the training manuals of the airline crews and the rules for the denial of equipment in accordance with the new regulations .	-6.4964
The FAA has said that it has already received plans from some airlines that want to expand the use of portable electronic equipment in aircraft .	-4.5947
These airlines included Delta and JetBlue .	-2.0265
“ Depending on the state of the plan , we could approve the extended use of electronic devices very soon , ” the FAA announced in a announcement .	-3.9615
Passengers currently need to disable smartphones , tablets , and other devices when the airplane doors are closed .	-3.1560
They may only reboot when the plane reaches a height of three kilometres and gives the captain the green light .	-4.1254
When entering the landing flight , passengers must switch them off and not reboot before the aircraft has landed .	-5.5455
According to the new directives , airlines that are secured against electronic disturbances could allow their passengers to use the equipment even at startup , landing and on the wheelfield , the FAA explained .	-6.2451
Most of the new commercial aircraft and other planes that have been converted to larger levels for use with Wi-Fi should meet the criteria .	-4.7888
Laura Glading , President of the professional association of professional flight attendants , welcomed the changes .	-2.5316
“ If the new regulation is implemented safely – and we work closely with the airline in this regard – both parties will benefit from it , ” commented Glading .	-3.7831
In all honesty , we are sorry to have to feel passionate about this issue .	-3.9253
Nevertheless , Internet connections for surfing , exchanging e-mails , text messages or downloading data under three kilometres remained prohibited , the authority explained .	-3.9265
Passengers are asked to put smartphones , tablets and other devices in flight mode .	-2.8613
So there is still no “ Words With Friends ” , the scrabble similar online game played by actor Alec Baldwin in 2011 on his smartphone when he had to leave American Airlines for refusing to turn off the device while the plane was parked on the plane .	-5.3840
And heavy equipment such as laptops must continue to be detected , as there is a risk of injury if they are flying through the cabin .	-5.6003
Mobile phone calls will also remain prohibited during the flight .	-3.5317
The regulatory competence for telephone calls lies with the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) , not the FAA .	-2.7279
FAA may lift a ban on certain electronic devices when landing and starting .	-3.6600
Last month , Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board , National Transportation Safety Board security experts on national transport issues to CBS News , mobile phones would still be considered a risk .	-4.3620
“ mobile phones are really a problem , not only because they could potentially cause navigation devices faults , but because we know from the FCC that air transmission can also disrupt transmission from the air , ” Rosenker said .	-5.7093
A industry advisory committee set up by the FAA to investigate this issue recommended last month that the government allow a wider use of personal electronic devices .	-4.7331
In recent years , pressure on the FAA has increased to ease restrictions on use .	-2.8237
Critics like the democratic Senator Claire McCaskill , for Missouri , argue that there are no valid safety reasons for the ban .	-3.4765
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce , because the use of the devices has become pervasive .	-3.8835
Some studies refer to the fact that up to a third of passengers are forgetting or ignoring the switching off of the device .	-4.0975
The FAA began in 1966 to restrict the use of electronic equipment by air travellers after reports of disruptions to navigation and communication equipment by passenger accompanied UKW radios that were then the latest technology trend .	-6.2123
New aircraft are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft , but they are also designed in such a way and approved by the FAA that electronic interferences do not make them anything .	-4.7658
Airlines have been providing Wi-Fi access to passengers for several years now when the .	-4.2468
Flighters adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also less sensitive to interferences .	-3.4060
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for greater use of electronic equipment under the new directives , said Huerta .	-3.4042
Today ’ s electronic devices generally deliver much less radio radiation than previous generations .	-3.1529
E-readers , for example , only give minimal radiation when leafed .	-3.0877
But when downloading or sending data , the transmission values are stronger .	-5.6424
Amazon.com. is one of the advocates of relaxing passenger restrictions on equipment use .	-3.8278
In 2011 , company employees invited a passenger aircraft full of Kindle E-Reader and made a test flight to identify problems , but could not find them .	-4.8553
Members of the FAA advisory committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using devices .	-2.0946
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said that he believed that the device disrupted , even if the risk is minimal .	-4.5803
Other committee members have said that there are only isolated reports of pilots who are responsible for the disruption of aircraft systems by the equipment , and most of them are very old .	-4.7011
The Committee recommended , however , that pilots be allowed to arrange for passengers to turn off the equipment in bad view when they landed .	-7.6480
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and described them as a sensible adjustment for travellers , who would today be heavily equipped with technology .	-4.4532
“ We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not at odds with security , ” said Roger Dow , CEO of the U.S. Travel Association .	-2.8631
The bird rescued from the North Sea drilling island is released again .	-4.8544
A bird flown by air rescue service to the coast , which had been found exhausted on a North Sea drill island , was released again .	-4.8029
The water pitch was flown last month with a helicopter to Aberdeen , where it was bundled by the Scottish animal welfare organisation SPCA in its rescue center in Alloa .	-4.9770
Colin Seddon , head of the center , said : “ This water trail was probably a winter bird from Northern Europe held by the strong winds over the North Sea . ”	-4.7185
Apparently , the exhausted bird sought refuge on the drilling island .	-3.3545
He added , “ he couldn ’ t fly anymore , so we were contacted with the request for help . ”	-4.0254
When they were released , the water rally was back fit and healthy .	-4.2834
Is Europe ’ s elite prepared to do business with Britain ?	-1.2463
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy together and defining what those who provide wealth and work in Britain want to change in our relations with the EU .	-3.9501
To this end , we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey among British business leaders , asking them what they think about Britain , the economy , and the EU .	-2.9756
YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 executives from the economy , which are about the UK 's size , sectors , and regions .	-5.7048
The results of the survey will surprise many .	-1.7876
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now exporting outside Europe , focusing on countries that modernise and grow while the EU is stagnating .	-4.0344
They want new trade links to countries like China , India , and Brazil to be favored by the government , rather than by the long and hard process of reforming obscure EU institutions .	-4.8338
In their view , the majority of economic leaders believe that control over these key competences should be reversed to Westminster .	-4.8502
There was general discontent about the internal market , because , according to companies , the costs of the Brussels rules would now outweigh the benefits of being part of Europe ’ s trade area – even 40 % of large companies agreed that they were traditionally most pro-European .	-5.8419
Finally , and this probably says most , our survey of business leaders showed that a clear majority of Britain wants a course towards changing the agreement and that a relationship with the EU based on trade was not on politics .	-6.5045
This realization that finds itself among companies of all sizes and leading corporations shows that the economy is pushing for a “ meaningful change ” that will bring the movement of action back to Britain .	-5.4248
It is a lot – a change to the agreement and better conditions for Britain would lead to a change of opinion for the EU ’ s remaining in a referendum at 16 % .	-5.5214
The Prime Minister should have no doubt : this survey shows that the British economy is behind his plan to renegotiate the British conditions for EU membership .	-2.7778
It also shows that companies expect a renegotiation to postpone power relations back to Britain .	-3.8226
A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary now that the eurozone moves toward closer economic and fiscal union .	-2.8287
Jobs and growth in Britain must be a priority , as the result of our survey shows , which means greater attention for businesses to trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to rules .	-4.2825
Alexei Miller of Gazprom calls a pipeline in Bulgaria the beginning of a new Gazera	-5.9820
The construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the start of one of the largest European energy projects , explained by the Gazprom Board .	-3.7190
“ Today ’ s event is a milestone : building work on the Bulgarian section of the South-Stream gas pipeline , the largest and most important project in Europe , ” said Gazprom ’ s CEO Alexei Miller , in a statement on Thursday .	-3.8566
The project is a key element in the energy security of the entire European continent .	-1.8030
South Stream is supposed to provide more diversity in Russia 's export routes through Europe .	-3.3444
A dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine , where the bulk of Russian gas is stored for Europe , creates a greater risk of conventional routes , as official speakers have said .	-5.0203
Miller said that the direct link to Bulgaria , a member of the European Union , meant that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries were “ forever . ”	-2.9326
Bulgarian consumers receive South Stream gas at low rates when the entire project comes into operation in 2015 .	-3.3893
According to Gazprom , construction work in other subordinate countries is to begin on the planned route at the end of the year .	-3.3403
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic metres of natural gas .	-1.9495

Consultation before the Royal Commission : Two YMCA staff accused of charges against Jonathan Lord for sex crimes .	-3.5775
Two YMCA workers from New South Wales ( NSW ) have been charged with sex offences related to children before 2011 accusations were made against the child carer Jonathan Lord of Caringbah , as the Royal Commission for sexual abuse of children .	-4.9639
However , in the opening statement to the Commission , the YMCA stated that ‘ there has never been any sexual abuse in the organisation ’ .	-4.4940
Phillip Hare , Managing Director , was consulted on a case in which a YMCA employee was accused of committing child pornography , and another in which a YMCA sports teacher was convicted in 1991 for the abuse of children entrusted to him .	-6.2345
Hare said Gail Furness , one of the Commission 's assistant lawyers , knew of the first case but did not know the second .	-3.6494
He admitted that the YMCA ’ s opening statement to the Commission was also inaccurate in the statement that ‘ there have been external reviews of the YMCA in which the YMCA has been recognised as being at the forefront of child safety ’ .	-4.6813
Evidence before the Commission shows , in fact , that the YMCA was informed that it received the second-largest assessment of four possible in a quality audit from the Department of Education and Communities ( Ministry of Education ) in August of this year .	-4.7523
Hare , who started at the YMCA with 21 , admitted that the management failed “ from me to downwards ” in the attitude of Lord and did not ensure that employees were aware of their obligations to report breaches of the child safety guidelines .	-6.3614
Lord was convicted at the beginning of the year for sex abuse of twelve boys during his two-year activity for the YMCA .	-4.5690
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison .	-1.0028
But Hare contested that the YMCA had a cultural problem that prevented the employee from reporting Lord ’ s violations of children ’ s safety .	-5.2541
The staff said they had observed violations , including that Lord was only with children , that she was privately cared for babysitting , sitting on his lap , saying that he had loved it , and that children were playing with his mobile phone .	-6.8204
Danielle Ockwell , whose chief executive , Lord , had asked for a child protection training because she was worried about his behavior , said that the child service leader Jacqui Barnat , who was the superior lords at YMCA Caringbah , was “ very intimidating and most of the time very inaccessible . ”	-6.6590
The Managing Director explained that he would not accept statements made by employees that they would not have had the courage to report back to their superiors .	-5.5559
Instead , he said , their friendship with Lord has compromised their judgment , which is why they would not have reported it .	-4.1720
Hare explained that he told the board of YMCA NSW that the lesson to be drawn from the “ Jonathan Lord incident ” was “ not about reporting , ” and the Board agreed to it .	-5.8396
Hare said that the decision to urge staff to sign confidentiality obligations shortly after the allegations occurred was taken by the YMCA chief executive Liam Whitley .	-5.5273
He said that this should prevent contamination of the evidence , but that was “ overzealous ” and badly implemented .	-4.3598
The YMCA NSW was not an organisation safe for children at the time Jonathan Lord was busy between 2009 and 2011 , explained Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University , expert on sexual child abuse , the Commission .	-4.0867
He explained that there have been “ serious problems ” in hiring , checking , employing , training , and overseeing employees .	-4.2966
The hearing was postponed until 20 December .	-0.8876
Tony Blair said he would seize the opportunity to return as British Prime Minister , but admits that a comeback is unlikely .	-2.6318
In an interview this evening on the fifth anniversary of his leaving office , the 59-year-old announced his views on various domestic issues .	-2.8451
Since his resignation in June 2007 , after a decade as Head of State , Blair has largely avoided speaking on British politics , and his commentary has mostly limited to foreign policy and his role as envoy of the Quartet of Middle East Peace Tiefs .	-5.5739
When asked whether he would like to return to the office of Prime Minister , Blair was quoted by the Evening Standard from London in the words : “ Yes , sure , but it is unlikely that this will happen , so ... ”	-5.0896

Fenton was praised by the jurors for his natural abilities in dealing with the pony , which was far above his age .	-3.7206
And Toffee received best notes for his appearance and personality .	-2.5591
Fenton received Toffee as a gift on his third birthday last March and has been doing Shetland-Pony every day .	-4.2517
His mother , Donna , 30 , said , “ Fenton and Toffee are a great pan . ”	-2.5178
They had to compete against the whole field and left the field with Goldpokal and Rosette .	-4.5685
It was only the second time he took part in a competition with Toffee , and we were all enthusiastic when he won .	-3.4009
Fully strangers in the arena considered him so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him .	-3.9491
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale , South Wales , follows the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howell , who has been presenting horses for over ten years .	-3.6714
Howell told , “ All the audience was like electrified and everyone fired and climbed it . ”	-5.0132
He ran on sand the entire length of the arena and although he looked so tiny he did fantastic work .	-3.1087
Fenton is crazy for animals – he loves horses , tractors and farms , and has two chickens to care for .	-6.3957
As he has started , it will not take long before he is on the ‘ horse of the year ’ show – and I am sure he will do well .	-4.3137
One speaker from the annual horse chauffeur said , “ Fenton is only three , but he knows how to deal with his pony . ”	-3.7335
Together they are a great team .	-0.9523
Jurors evaluated Fenton and Toffee as to how well they would have beaten and presented themselves in the demonstration .	-4.3058
They look forward to good cooperation between Pony and Leaders – and Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring .	-3.5342
I am sure that Fenton ’ s sweet clothing has done its part , which is really perfect for the occasion .	-5.0684
Chinese newspaper is to be “ reformed ” after appeal .	-2.5907
A Chinese newspaper calling for the release of a reporter accused of defamation on the cover page declared a press regulator .	-4.0653
The New Express based in Guangzhou had made a rare public call to release the journalist Chen Yongzhou .	-2.9319
But Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to falsify reports about a partial company .	-2.9650
Now the New Express is being “ subjected to comprehensive rectification , ” the regulatory authority declared .	-3.2193
The “ Rectification Order ” was created by the Authority for Press and Publications , Radio , Film and Television in Guangdong .	-2.8252
Preliminary investigation revealed that between September 2012 and August 2013 , the New Express , which belongs to the Yangcheng Evening News Group , published several inaccurate reports on the listed company Zoomlion .	-3.1341
“ The New Express ’ s editorial management was disordered , ” the regulatory authority announced in a statement .	-2.6018
She said that it was decided to “ impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou and withdraw his reporter licence . ”	-3.7913
In addition , “ the Yangcheng Evening News Group has been instructed to carry out a complete rectification of the New Express , and recommended that those responsible be identified at the New Express and immediately review the New Express leadership team . ”	-5.6797
Chen wrote several articles for the New Express in which he reported alleged financial irregularities at a manufacturer of construction machinery called Zoomlion .	-3.7485
After being arrested , the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and stood behind his journalistic work .	-2.9411
But then Chen appeared on the television screen and admitted that he had published false reports against payment .	-4.1283
“ In this case , I damaged Zoomlion , as well as the entire news industry and its ability to gain public confidence , ” he declared to the state news broadcaster CCTV . the .	-5.1662
I did it first and foremost because I was on money and fame .	-2.4889
It has become clear to me that I acted badly .	-2.7049
Following Chen ’ s apology , the New Express issued an apology on the front page and stated that it failed to verify the reports correctly .	-10.1204
Several well-known suspects have recently filed confessions on television .	-2.7919
Experts say that confessions are still routinely enforced , despite a legislative change at the beginning of the year in which the authorities were banned from forcing someone to accuse themselves .	-3.5066
Discovering Drug Tunnel by Independent Railway between the US and Mexico	-3.7743
One of the most refined tunnels for drug smuggling between the United States and Mexico , fully equipped with lighting , ventilation , and electrical rail operations , has now been discovered .	-4.4364
The US authorities described the 120 times 90 centimetres tunnel as one of the most sophisticated passages ever found .	-2.5174
The tunnel , which runs in the Zickzack pattern for almost six football fields , connects warehouses near Tijuana , Mexico , and San Diego , USA .	-4.3193
There are countless invisible warehouses in the area , making it easier to hide lorries loaded with drugs .	-2.8988
The tunnel was closed before drugs could be transported unknown , the authorities said .	-3.2056
During the discovery of the tunnel , eight and a half tonnes of Marihuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine had been secured , according to the records of the court .	-4.9738
Three men who , according to the authorities , worked as drivers were charged with the possession and the intended sale of Marihuana and cocaine .	-3.7109
If they are guilty , they are threatened with imprisonment between ten years and lifelong .	-4.1832
In Nogales , Arizona , smugglers rely on an extensive underground network of drainage channels .	-2.3380
The tunnel is the eighth large passage discovered since 2006 in San Diego .	-2.1415
Some of the biggest tunnels were discovered in October following the Marihuana harvest in Central Mexico , which poses the drug cartels the challenge of quickly bringing their product to consumers .	-4.3276
In 2010 , authorities found a scarcely 640 metre long passage with rails that went from a kitchen in a house in Tijuana to two camps in San Diego .	-5.2779
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr are still loving . OrlandBloom and MiK	-2.7568
Actors Orlando Bloom and Model Miranda Kerr want to go separate paths in the future .	-2.6273
In an interview , Bloom said that he and Kerr still love themselves .	-5.8041
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents of the two-year flynn .	-1.4519
Actor Orlando Bloom has spoken about the separation of his wife , Topmodel Miranda Kerr .	-3.0848
In an interview with US journalist Katie Couric , who was supposed to be broadcast on Friday ( local time ) , Bloom said that " life sometimes does not run exactly as we plan or hope " .	-3.8830
Kerr and he himself still loved , stressing the 36-year-old .	-2.6292
" We will support each other and love each other as parents of Flynn " .	-2.5263
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010 , and in 2011 their sons Flynn was born .	-1.9493
The veganism , according to Lexika , is subordinate to vegetarianism , but differs in a very significant way from this .	-5.3836
Because while vegetarians allow to eat cream places , ice or a powerful editor , these bad things are not on a vegan menu .	-4.9203
Milk , cheese , eggs , besides the renunciation of meat and fish , the vegan departs from all animal consumption - also honey is denied .	-6.0991
One might ask what remains , but on closer examination the vegan nutrition world is characterized by a considerable ingenuity .	-5.3315
" Brotaufstriche is very popular " , explains Ute Henkelmann , the owner of the local Reform House , who provides a wide range of special products for Vegans .	-5.7889
Reuben Proctor likes to visit the shop at Domgasse .	-2.7093
For 13 years the native New Zealand live vegan , in Lampertheim he finds ( almost ) everything he needs to live . " In 1997 I changed my diet and became a " vegetarian " .	-5.5442
Around the turn of the century , the next step was taken and I became a vegan .	-2.8708
" The conviction came not only because of nutrition , but because of the choice of shoes , " says Proctor , the art leather prefers normal leather .	-4.9058
He recognized that other everyday concerns are not animal .	-3.9247
Above all , vegan is an ethics .	-2.3909
" I do not want animals to die for me , " Proctor speaks out the maxim of the vegans who extend to all consumer behaviour .	-5.0548
Instead of burgers , stirring eggs or rubber bears backfired rubber , the vegan quickly discovered new products that grew enthusiasm . . the burgerburgers .	-17.1435
" It is a double bonus , " says Proctor today , " actually vegan is not his waiver , not an Ascetic , but a enrichment " .	-5.8380
And it is precisely these conditions that some even well-intentioned attempts failed .	-4.0670
" The addiction factor is a very decisive factor , giving up many quickly , similar to smoking , " Proctor makes a comparison .	-4.8981
And put it : ' Certain tastes are not fixed on the animal ' .	-4.3910
It is often the spices or the type of preparation that make up the taste .	-3.8822
" You can also create the same effect in other ways , " illustrates the vegan .	-3.6861
Proctor brings egg gins , champions and a few vegan sausages to a barbecue festival .	-5.5031
He pays tribute to a balanced , varied diet , in which it should taste quite a lot .	-6.8172
Of course you want to have something between the teeth , that is legitimate .	-2.7897
" It should taste , but this is not only reduced to animal food , " says Proctor .	-3.6273
He did not suffer any health damage to eating disorders , another widespread assumption .	-3.9634
For me , the change had a positive aspect .	-5.8862
I don 't take a foreign cholesterol and I have an increased vitamin percentage .	-8.8658
There are high performance athletes that feed exclusively vegan .	-2.5033
" My blood values are best , I often check myself " , says Proctor .	-4.0677
In particular , many critics of veganism warn against the lack of vitamin B12 .	-2.8517
" Since animals are fed with feedingstuffs instead of grazing on the pasture , it is questionable whether the meat you buy in the cooling trunk is the vitamin B12 proportion high , " Proctor finds .	-5.8785
Vegans also have the possibility to take the coenzyme in the form of tablets .	-3.1160
" My B12 values are fine , " he explains .	-1.7081
Much paths need not be found for procurement .	-4.7602
After all , food is everywhere and every supermarket now has soymilk and other products .	-4.4768
Everything I need can find on site .	-2.9837
I only buy something special from time to time .	-2.7379
" Many people overlook the fact that only the finished products are expensive , but that is the way things are known for " ordinary " finished products " .	-4.8606
In any case , the preparation of vegan dishes is much cheaper and less time-consuming than is commonly believed .	-3.5501
" In the kitchen there is a lot to discover , with a few small buttons you can achieve good , if not partly better results , " says Proctor .	-4.9613
Margarine instead of butter , a little more baking powder and carbonic acid instead of eggs , with its vegan cheese cakes , Proctor could also cause its swing agents to be congested .	-10.4635
Family festivals give the vegan a a new spice .	-2.8682
This has a new dimension when cooking together .	-3.9684
" The situations that can arise are as different as the people themselves , " says Proctor .	-2.6139
Of course , he was also skeptical .	-2.1504
Do not taste my meal anymore ?	-2.5838
" Should I feel bad now because I drink milk ? " - if you have such questions , you will have to act as a vegan with sensitivity .	-5.2329
" I don 't reject people , I am part of this society , " Proctor does not want to be enclaved .	-4.0417
And , more precisely , the world of everyday life does not seem as vaguely as presumed - and the vegan does not seem to be constrained in everyday life as is commonly assumed . as as . as . as . to . . .	-10.8423
Even fast food is allowed .	-1.5518
Pommes are everywhere !	-2.2025
" Many döner shops offer falafel , or just a vegetarian yufka , " says Proctor .	-3.9544
In a pizzeria he gives way to pasta dishes or order a pizza without cheese , everything a question of habit .	-5.1146
The restaurants are so slowly addressing this .	-3.8992
" When I started to eat myself vegan 13 years ago , everything was even more difficult , " the New Zealand countries can find a development : " You have to talk to people , tell them " .	-6.5936
" When there are enough inquiries , they may be inclined to add to the menu , " he hopes .	-3.4710
Vegan restaurants develop , such as the Combuses in Mannheim or the Café Vogelfre .	-3.4496
Proctor wants other restaurants to have at least one vegan dish on the menu .	-2.7116
There are basically vegan dishes for all .	-2.6643
Everyone can eat them , so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive food .	-2.7197
" Meat dishes are exclusive , in the true sense of the word , because they exclude others " , Proctor notes .	-3.4132
" If you want to avoid food scandals , veganism is a safe way to make most of the first impossible , " says Proctor .	-3.4198
But buying vegan products can be a bit difficult at the beginning .	-3.8404
Especially when you learn to understand that animal additives may also contain in earth nuts as a colourer , you seem to quickly leave the courage to follow ethics at so many hurdles and traps .	-6.4278
It is not only for this reason that Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen have written a book : " Veganismo - Animal ingredients and their alternatives " explains the many ingredients that are added to food and also cleaning agents .	-4.5770
" One gradually develops a scanner view and knows which characters and logos one has to respect " It is sometimes better to do small steps than staying or stumbling , " knows Proctor .	-5.9726
Veganism , it is an important moral fingerline that beats consciousness .	-3.3400
He may not quite manage to store his habits , but at least he can teach consumers to critically question their habits .	-4.1531
Nasdaq OMX continues to hold its customers in breath .	-2.3971

British Police is making Assange an extradition certificate .	-4.4658
The British police have today handed over an extradition document to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange , who has sought refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and has applied for asylum .	-4.3209
Scotland Yard said that , if he did not do so , he would be threatened with arrest .	-6.3244
Assange threatens extradition to Sweden for the charge in a sex offence after his possibilities have been exhausted under British law , since the Supreme Court rejected his opposition to extradition earlier this month .	-4.7128

Tax for foreign property owners against London ’ s Bubble	-3.0044
The Treasury has made a provisional assessment of the CGT measure , but it is still waiting for the final decision by Chancellor George Osborne , who had imposed a 7 % stamp tax on housing in the 2012 budget , which cost more than <unk> 2 million , and annual fees for buyers who hold the housing as a company and not as individuals .	-7.0247
Already , revenues from the residential tax in Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea districts , which amounted to GBP 708 million in the 2012 / 13 fiscal year , have been exceeded by collecting revenues for Northern Ireland , Wales , Scotland , North-East , Yorkshire , and Humber region .	-5.7917
Cook said , “ After the ramps on high-priced housing and the introduction of related legislation against circumventing it , it is difficult to claim that high quality real estate is too low , regardless of the impact of the outdated community tax system . ”	-7.2627
“ But this move could make some foreign investors more reticent in terms of purchasing real estate in London , or discouraging owners , ” he added .	-3.3792
First class properties – the top five to ten percent of the housing market by price – in London ’ s wealthy south-west belt , which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon , have increased by a record of 11.8 % last year .	-4.5644
Prices in Central London have been consistent annual growth of 5.6 % , but have been overshadowed by an emerging “ domestic market ” where the south-west part of the city , the north ( 7.4 % ) , and the east ( 6.5 % ) experienced an upward trend , such as a Saville investigation .	-5.7149
Scientists could shed more light on the connection in which the tail of a dog stands with its mood .	-3.8342
Previous research had shown that happy dogs flipped with the tail more to the right ( from the point of view of the dog ) , while it was the left for nervous dogs .	-4.8850
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive these subtle differences and react to them .	-2.1996
Professor Georgio Vallortigara , a neuroscientist at the University of Trient , said : “ People know well that the left and right brain half react differently to stimuli that provoke positive or negative emotions . ”	-3.9866
Here we tried to look at this with other species .	-2.4369
He also noticed that in dogs , just as in humans , the right brain half is responsible for the left movement and vice versa , and that the two hemispheres played different roles in feelings .	-5.0854
To learn more about how dogs respond to the lateral flashing of their species , researchers supervised the animals while these films were watching other dogs .	-5.9725
They measured the heart rate of four-legs and analyzed behavior .	-2.5923
We probably will soon understand why the tail is moving in one direction , once in the other .	-4.0553
Professor Vallortigara said : “ We have shown dog films with dogs – either a faithful version or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects , and we have been able to control the tail movement more to the left or right . ”	-10.1942
When the animals saw how an otherwise printless dog moved the tail to the right ( seen from the perspective of the blowing dog ) , they remained completely relaxed .	-4.7452
But if the tail inclination was mainly left ( again from the perspective of the dog who blows ) , then their heart frequency rose and they looked restless .	-6.2671
According to Professor Vallortigara , the dogs do not deliberately communicate with each other through these movements .	-2.7503
It is convinced that the dogs had learned from experience what movements they should worry about and when not .	-3.8671
He said , “ If you have different encounters with other dogs and if you are tied to the tail in one direction more with friendly behavior and the right side produces less friendly behavior , then you react on the basis of these experiences . ”	-6.1785
Researchers say that the insights of dog owners , veterinarians , and trainers could help to better understand the emotions of their animal .	-4.1915
John Bradshaw , an expert on dog behaviour and guest grants at the Faculty of Animal Health at the University of Bristol , said that this was not the first study to investigate whether left and right is important for dogs .	-5.1104
Last year a team from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn left when they see an aggressive dog and right when it is a satisfied dog .	-3.4505
In another research work at Victoria University in Canada , the following was : “ Dogs tend to go to a robotic dog when his , tail on the left and not on the right , rather than being troubled – just the other way around than in the Italian study . ”	-6.8060
According to his statement , the differences could therefore stem from the fact that the dogs in various studies did not interpret the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs .	-4.8802
A study of how dogs respond to real dogs might help , he explained .	-2.0724
“ Although there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two brain heats are used for different purposes , many details still need to be determined – and dogs are no exception , ” says Bradshaw .	-4.1439
But because their behavior is easy to record , it will probably not take long to understand why the tail sometimes moves in one direction , sometimes in the other .	-5.1751
Arctic Monkeys Shortly Disease in Glasgow	-3.3738
The rockband Arctic Monkeys moved an appearance in Glasgow after her lead singer was sickened by throat dumping .	-6.0737

Pope Francis appoints the first Cardinal in February	-2.9890
Pope Francis will be the first to call new Catholic Church cardinals on 22 February , as the Vatican announced on Thursday .	-3.7831
Cardinals are the highest clerics in the Catholic Church after the Pope , and they are also the ones who elect a Pope , so that Francis will appoint the first group of men who will ultimately work in choosing his successor .	-4.4276
There are currently 201 cardinals .	-1.1246
However , a cardinal that has reached 80 years of age can no longer participate in the Pope ’ s election – that is a group of 120 “ eligible cardinals . ”	-5.0512
In an explanation in which the news was announced , Father Federico Lombardi , a Vatican spokesman , said that there will be a meeting of all cardinals before the ceremony of the appointment of the new cardinals , also known as the Consensus .	-4.5278
“ Pope Francis decided to announce his decision to convene the congress in February in advance so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from around the world can be planned , ” said Lombardi .	-4.2337
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of eligible cardinals would probably have dropped until February .	-2.5274
He explained that a Pope normally appoint as many cardinals as necessary , so that the number of cardinals eligible to vote is 120 again , and so many cardinals over 80 as he would .	-4.3565
Consistium next year is important because it is the first since the Francis election in March of this year , Valero said .	-5.5123
There is now a certain overhang on the part of Europe , and in particular Italy .	-3.1130
“ It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance , ” he said .	-2.0766
Forty per cent of Catholics live in South America , but they have only a tiny number of cardinals .	-7.6428
The Cardinals will also be the first to be called since the formation of the Cardinal Council , founded by Francis , a group of eight cardinals from around the world who have commissioned to find ways to reform the Church .	-4.2905
In the past , the Pope decided everything on its own .	-2.4335
“ Now Francis has selected these eight cardinals to help him , ” Valero said .	-2.2381
He said that it was “ possible ” for Francis to ask the cardinals for advice .	-3.6411
But so far we have not been in this situation – all of this is completely new .	-3.5655
Valero said that bishops would typically invoke cardinals from large places , but Francis is is “ filled with surprises – so we don ’ t know who he is appointed . ”	-5.6560
GM calls for new pickup trucks in the US to repair the seat backrest .	-3.1807
General Motors called back barely 19,000 of his brand new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra Pickup trucks with construction year 2014 to resolve a problem with the manually adjustable seat backrest , such as a communication from the US Auto Safety Authority on Friday .	-5.2681
Some of the cars may have a defect in the mechanism for the suspension of the front seat backrest .	-5.1374
That is why they do not comply with the federal regulations on vehicle safety at head restraints .	-3.6629
“ When driving from the rear to the vehicle , it is possible that the head restraint does not properly protect the occupants , so there is an increased risk of injury ” , was read in the news on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration website ( NHTSA ) .	-4.5274
The repurchased models were manufactured between 1 August and 10 September .	-7.7154
The GM trucks delivery started in June and represents the main model start of the leading US car manufacturer since the insolvency restructuring in 2009 .	-4.2620

My classmates wept with joy and my parents gathered all the newspapers they could find .	-2.6679
A young team of visionaries was on the way to the White House and the nation was ready for change .	-1.6790
When Obama switched to office in 2008 , he had 82 % assent levels .	-12.6331
And then I finish the book .	-1.3899
Turning back to the present is a bad awakening as if one is torn out of a dream .	-3.9155
It is hard to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague memory , a sad reminder of missed opportunities .	-2.2281
In the years since I first voted , something has actually changed .	-2.9809
But it is simply not something I could have imagined .	-2.1880
I acknowledge the great and varied things Obama has achieved , from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for Health Insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq , the end of forced concealment of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden .	-3.6654
I agree that party political blockade tactics have overturned too many efforts to move our nation forward : immigration reform , a public health insurance option and the closure of Guantanamo Bay , to name but a few .	-4.0618
But , having defended the Obama administration countless against colleagues and acquaintances , I have come to the end with my attempts to explain .	-4.5033
I have reached a point of political despair .	-1.2295
The Republican blockade policy cannot explain why it is permitted to hear foreign leaders , or the killing of innocent children by drones overseas .	-4.0073
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data about the privacy of Americans and why whistleblower is punished disclosing state misconduct .	-3.5832
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki , an American citizen , has been murdered without trial , and why public financing and spending levels will be circumvented during the presidential election .	-4.3693
It does not justify the results of a report stating that the White House ’ s efforts to restart the media are the “ most aggressive ... since the Nixon government . ”	-3.8658
And recently , it cannot excuse the inability to create a simple website in more than three years since the Affordable Care Act was adopted .	-7.5055
I do not know if that is what I should have expected .	-1.5565
Whether I should have understood with 18 that the government could contradict the previous political campaigns .	-3.9273
Obviously , the presidency is not a foreseeable course , as an opposition party and accidental events such as the Newtown massacre are shaping public debate .	-4.7701
But when I look at the above examples , they seem to be largely elected by the government itself .	-3.2031
And that bothers me most .	-0.7272
I re-elected Obama in 2012 , not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy .	-1.6847
Mitt Romney offered a confusing and unbroken alternative , he seemed unable to define his direction and positions .	-4.4089
I had the impression that a second term for Obama , free from pressure from future elections , would fulfil the hope that we had heard for so long .	-3.1407
But with the decline in Obama ’ s ratings to less than 45 % this week , the book ’ s return to 2008 has become even harder .	-3.8337
It arouses in me the yearning for the many promises which have dissolved into air .	-3.9797
This week , I read a section in the book describing how Obama had to hijack a serious Clinton loss in Pennsylvania ’ s pre-election elections .	-3.3688
In a meeting with the electoral assistants after the decision , he told his staff that they would have to return to course and follow the purpose of their cause .	-5.9551

Clive Palmer claims that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest on parental leave .	-2.0160
The billionaire and MP Clive Palmer says that Prime Minister Tony Abbott would be in a conflict of interests in his parental leave plans , because his daughters would become pregnant and could therefore benefit from it .	-4.7909
The mining magnet , which is in legal dispute over the payment of $ 6 million to the carbon tax , raised the claim that he wanted to wipe out questions about whether he was in conflict .	-6.2776
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate , which are important for deciding whether or not carbon and mining taxes are cut or cut .	-3.6753
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest , and Abbott ’ s daughters would personally benefit from the laws .	-2.7894
“ He is in a great conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave , because if one of his daughters is pregnant , he has a direct interest in whether or not to receive a holiday , ” Palmer said .	-4.4725
Two months after the election , the Palmer Election Commission officially declared the winner of Fairfax ’ s Sunshine Coast seats , with 53 votes .	-4.8005
Palmer called for a revision of the process to count votes so that it could be done faster .	-4.6999

Palmer also criticized the use of pencils when marking the ballot papers .	-1.5888
Do you use it because you can wipe out the results if you don 't like it ?	-4.1628
Nowadays voting on pencils is incredible .	-2.7863
The Election Commission examined the options for an electronic election and recently published a joint legislative proposal with New Zealand .	-2.3615

RBS suspends two foreigners	-1.4845
The Royal Bank of Scotland suspended two traders from its foreign exchange department , two people familiar with the situation ; this is yet another indication that the global regulatory investigation into the alleged manipulation of the currency market is taking off rapidly .	-5.3937
Some of the world ’ s largest banks , including UBS , Barclays , Deutsche Bank , and RBS , have confirmed that they are working with the authorities to investigate the world ’ s largest financial market , where US $ 5.3 trillion change owners every day .	-3.9473
The two traders would be the first RBS staff to be suspended in the widening inquiry into the Libor interbank scandal .	-3.9724
The Bank , which did not comment on suspensions , confirmed this month that it received information requests from authorities .	-3.4645
“ Our inquiries on this subject continue , and we fully cooperate with the FCA and other regulators , ” the Bank said two weeks ago .	-3.5392
Last month , people close to the situation stated that the RBS sent the records of e-mails and instant messages sent by and to a former merchant to the UK Financial Conduct Authority .	-4.4852
This retailer , Richard Usher , had left RBS in 2010 and has now been reviewed by his current position as European Head of Forex Spot Trading at JPMorgan .	-10.7974
Rohan Ramchandani , Head of European Spot Trading at Citi , was examined this week and Matt Gardiner , formerly senior currency dealer at Barclays and UBS , was suspended this week at Standard Chartered .	-3.7091
Neither trader has been accused of any malpractice .	-2.9731
The Instant Message Group of Usher included bankers at Barclays and Citigroup , said people close to the situation .	-3.2660
UBS announced this week that it has taken steps against some of its staff , after the Swiss regulatory authority Finma declared that it is investigating a alleged manipulation of the foreign exchange market at a number of Swiss banks .	-5.3326
At least six authorities worldwide – the European Commission , Finma , the Swiss Competition Authority Weko , the FCA , the US Department of Justice and Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently dealing with allegations that bankers should have agreed on currency market transactions .	-4.3585
HSBC , Citigroup , JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also started internal investigations or received information requests from authorities , said people familiar with the situation .	-2.8814
Banks get instant messages and e-mails from several years looking for cases of malpractice .	-3.7776
The news about these investigations has stirred up traders in an area that has been one of the most profitable of investment banks ’ trading units in recent years , but has been under pressure this year , because low volatility in currencies restricts speculators ’ chances .	-13.0632
Some bankers have tried to downplay the affair and said that it is almost impossible to manipulate the expanded and highly liquid foreign exchange market , but leading traders believe that this is not necessarily true .	-3.9319
A leading trader noted that , despite the enormous daily volume of foreign-exchange trading , fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use of banks ’ own internal platforms leads “ to enable “ the market to be influenced by very low ticket prices ” .	-5.9816
The news came out on the same day when Credit Suisse announced that she cancelled an London Exchange Traded Funds office trader this week after causing a loss of almost $ 6 million at the end of last year .	-4.6886
The Bank promptly informed the competent authorities and cooperates with them .	-1.7802
“ We are sure that the trader acted alone and that the matter is contained , ” said Credit Suisse .	-3.4847
Malt the Construction fence on the Beechle Property	-3.3325
A group of citizens ' initiative " Swiss Wiese " has enriched the fence on the Bechtle site at the spa promenade in Bad Herrenalb .	-4.7574
She also purified and spread the footpath , says it in a press release .	-4.3612
The planned cover of the demolishing house on the back of the property was not allowed for security reasons because the area threatens to slip down .	-5.2826
Alfred Abel , who currently manages the property , had denied the beautifying action with his colleague Reinhard Domke from the BI .	-3.6359
Before the BI 's action , we had a transparency with the message ' We are in favour ' .	-3.5841
This did not disturb the approximately 20 members of the citizens ' initiative , however .	-2.6266
Their motto on the big poster was " We are against building ruins " .	-3.2622
The giant project should one day fail .	-4.0473
In conversation with many passers-by in front of the " building site " , it became clear that some citizens believe that the realization of the city 's project will be better for many , although few will have the same questions to the dimension of the project presented like the BI .	-6.6732
But they are starting to resign , because the city is further delaying these responses , the BI is saying .	-3.7777
As we heard , the mayor 's public statements also have an impact .	-4.8627
In May , at the municipal meeting , he said that he fears his fears for the thermal bath should the public vote against the plans for a bathing and wellness complex on the Swiss meadow at the Civil Decision .	-7.2488
Some are therefore almost scared , others feel they are " clumsy blackmail " on the population , as the BI press release says .	-6.7821
The BI thanked the donors for the color and all helpers .	-2.0614
Rangnick Challenge for Shiris : Man a SchKing	-3.4016
As satisfied as Ralf Rangnick is with the current high form of the German Bundesliga table leader Red Bull Salzburg , the sporting director of the " Bullen " showed himself disappointed by the referees .	-5.3630
" There is currently a dangerous tendency for people and Alan to be pushed into the category of Schwalbenkönige " , he defended the two offensive-Gridler on Thursday at a press conference in Salzburg .	-6.4244
The most recent occasion for Rangnick ’ s critique was Yellow for Mane at 3 : 0 against Val Gardena last Sunday , in which Senegalese was imprisoned as an alleged actor - which , of course , was not , as the TV images showed .	-8.3228
Rangnick argued that the referee Harkam was " too overwhelmed " .	-7.1584
Harcame also " his part " to escalate between Salzburg-Coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig-Trainer Adi Hütter after the match .	-3.6336
He defended his German compatriot : " I would have behaved the same way as Roger Schmidt in every single situation " .	-4.4002
Schmidt himself does not want to have had contact with his colleague after the skirmish with a hu.	-4.5322
I do not know why .	-1.3341
" For I am the one who was insulted , " stressed the 46-year-old .	-2.3286
In view of the course of success , Rangnick agreed to a hymn of praise .	-4.1678
" There are only two words for this : correct , " he said .	-3.4550
There is not much to suspend .	-1.7445
The way in which the team plays is impressive .	-7.5880
This should continue calmly .	-3.2373
There will be little change in winter transfer time .	-2.2688
There are no great reasons to change anything .	-1.8335
" In addition to a player , Rangnick clearly stated that he wanted to leave the club .	-4.3498
Supreme Court corroborates Obama ’ s Health Law .	-2.3768
It is a great victory for the Obama administration : the US Supreme Court decided today that the health law , closely linked to Barack Obama , is constitutional .	-3.3339
With five to four votes , the judges judged that the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – forcing US citizens to purchase health insurance or pay a penalty by 2014 – is constitutional under state tax authority .	-4.4064
The chief judge John Roberts beat the side of the four more liberal members of the Chamber , while the Scalia , Thomas , Alito , and Kennedy judges oppose it .	-3.7834
The Court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 2700 pages of the law and also took the view that the provision of the Health Act , whereby states would either have to expand the conditions for access to Medicaid or otherwise cancel all state Medicaid subsidies , would not be unconstitutional .	-7.7117
The legal action had been taken by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business .	-2.7432
The law was decisively rejected by all the leading Republican presidential candidates , including the ultimate challenger Mitt Romney , in the 2012 pre-election campaign .	-3.4082
Norway : Norwegian Light Mirrors	-3.8709
With huge mirrors , the inhabitants of a Norwegian village brought light into their gloomy valley .	-3.3476
The Rjukan , situated in the Vestfjord Valley , from autumn to spring , usually sinks in the shade of the surrounding mountains due to the low level of sun .	-5.7372
With three gigantic reflectors at 45 meters of altitude , a century was true on Wednesday .	-4.4151
" Finally , " Mayor Steinar Bergsland swept at the start ceremony at the TV2 station .	-3.8812
Some Talaxi residents settled sun chairs , while others set up sunglasses for safety .	-6.8187
Until now , sun-hungry people had to go on a nearby peak in winter with a cable car .	-3.7688
Ten years ago , the local artist Martin Andersen presented the proposal to direct radiation with mirrors into the valley .	-3.2590
This idea has existed since 1913 .	-3.4155
After several years of debate , the city council had finally adopted the 5 million crowns ( around EUR 615 000 ) expensive project .	-4.2470
A similar construction has been providing the Italian Alpine region Viganella with winter sunshine for several years .	-4.3025
Little Sundays ’ Post Emergency	-4.8587
" Many citizens will not yet have noticed the red points for Sunday leakage are still on various mailboxes in the core city and the parts of the city , but you read the small print on the yellow boxes of Post AG , you quickly find that the leak on Sunday and public holidays is no longer taking place , " says the FDP .	-9.0371
A FDP request has confirmed this .	-2.3942
On Sundays and public holidays , only before the post building in Ernst-Ludwig-Stra<unk>e 36 and at Jakob-Müller-Stra<unk>e 1 in Hüttenfeld .	-4.2474
Whether it will be learned on Sunday in Hofheim and Rosengarten will not be answered in the answer to the FDP 's request .	-4.8322
The FDP spokesman for social and youth policy , Fritz Röhrenbeck , wants to hack up here .	-4.1109
Sundays is an important postal service especially for Terminpost .	-4.0280
" This venture is radically and unreasonable , despite the increase in the price of letters in January 2013 . "	-3.5367
Thomas Bittner , Liberal Group Chairman and City Union Chairman , supports his group colleagues : " What annoys me is the fact that , in this case , the lifetime changes or even deleted . "	-6.6208
The post office is only a few minutes away from the hotel .	-4.8450
" At least the mailboxes in the neighborhoods of Neuschlo<unk> and Rosengarten must be emptied again Sundays " , says Bittner and Röhrenbeck unisono .	-9.3878
Also in the heart of the city , especially non-mobile fellow citizens would have to be able to reach a mailbox with a leaking on Sundays .	-7.5278
In the city parliament , Röhrenbeck asked whether the municipal authorities are planning talks with the post on this matter .	-4.7310
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the post did not communicate with lampertheim .	-2.0106
But there is also a snack in Hofheim for his knowledge . .	-13.6996
Your party supported privatisations .	-2.1636
" Then decisions are taken elsewhere , " said Maier .	-1.3446
Frankfurt ’ s Parking Charges to Ride	-3.8865
Staff were very friendly and helpful .	-5.3765
This morning , the City Council of Magistrates advises on a submission of a traffic deco Stefan Majer ( Green ) .	-9.6029
Parking charges are therefore to be increased by 50 % .	-2.4118
This is not to increase prices , but to reduce the time interval of parking clocks and parking spaces from 30 minutes to 20 minutes .	-4.8074
Then , in December , the municipal meeting will have to decide .	-4.2736
The retail committee of the IHK Frankfurt considers this ' not a good idea ' .	-3.0280
The possibility of parking right in front of the shop is a " non-underestimated advantage for smaller retailers " .	-5.4667
Germany 's Transport Club believes that an increase after two decades is ' entirely appropriate and , in fact , long overdue ' .	-3.3795
Public transport is also becoming more expensive .	-1.2881
City of Freude : Rump hosts	-3.2752
Men I of the TSV Freudenstadt had to take part in the Schiller Schulturnhalle in Reutlingen against the TG Gönningen from the Schwabian Alb with a narwith .	-4.3756
The Elblers were equipped with an experienced team on the other side of the network .	-4.8155
It soon became apparent , however , that they could not fully compete with the rapid actions of the joyful cities .	-6.2616
The Gönninger did extremely difficult with the hard and plated surfaces .	-5.6186
Again and again , they missed the passports and attacks that Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz had in the middle of the network and were not there for block defense .	-6.4972
Two high first sentence profits clearly expressed the superiority of the pleasures cities in all respects .	-4.3474
In view of this overwhelming and play-defining achievement , the third sentence was somewhat lax and lustlessly won the 3rd sentence ( 25 : 13 , 25 : 14 , 25 : 22 ) .	-5.5208
On November 2nd , Baiersbronn will be a much more powerful opponent in the field , and the Baiersbronn TV , which was clearly successful in Nagold .	-7.4616
TSV Freudenstadt I : Dominik Bäuerle , Yannik Büchle , Sebastian Dölker , Felix Pälchen , Stefan Röller , Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz .	-2.3511
In the B-class , the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt were faced in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn .	-7.6656
They delivered a hard contested two-hour match .	-2.3173
Nervousness on both sides caused mistakes and points , especially during ballanning ; in passports too , precision was sometimes defective and in some critical game scenes , the overhead prevented the eye for possible scores .	-8.9109
Marcus Blasutto ’ s TSV team consistently agreed to the great physical commitment and a pleasing commitment of both teams .	-6.0313
Care on the Small English Hut	-4.6940
A group of committed participants met at the small English cottage in Ibach for the fifth nursing day in succession to the Natura 2000 project at the height forest .	-7.4127
Due to popular suggestions , this day in the area of the cottage of the view to the valley should be cut out , mayor Helmut Kaiser said .	-6.4232
Many hikers , according to the Emperor , referred to this area as the splendid piece of the gorge rock , where the landscape offers the ideal setting for magnificent views .	-6.0340
He thanked the attendees for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the nursing day is a suitable instrument for strengthening the connection between man and nature .	-4.9532
It offers every citizen the opportunity to focus on nature itself .	-2.9628
Ecological consideration can also be given to the tourism aspect .	-2.4879
Friederike Tribukait explained this ecological aspect by the Natural Protection Department of the Government of Freiburg following the greeting by Landrat Tilman Bollacher , who had taken over the patronage and wanted the action to be successful .	-5.7159
According to Tribukait , the tourist goal of the broad view is to preserve the ancient Allmendfeld with its specific protected habitat by opening and connecting to the remaining pastures .	-7.1782
Certain species , such as rare butterflies and grass hopper , cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest areas .	-2.9742
You need these free links to artificial conservation .	-2.2347
Tribukait said she would not miss the opportunity to break a lance for the planned biosphere area .	-9.6603
In this planning , the current measure is not just seamless .	-4.2842
A biosphere area also offers the opportunity for sustainable economic and environmental development based on the internationally recognised Unesco status and thus a continuous complement to the achievements of the Life project and the previous carers for the future .	-6.1021
After these various executions , Peter Christoph Wehle and Life Project Manager Cornelia Bischoff entered the helpers in groups .	-5.2080
The larger trees had already been beaten in advance , and the forestry trawler might be ready to go .	-5.1401
A group of helpers should take care of exempting guards and caring for a dry stone lock .	-5.5280
The goal was to have a free view of the viewpoint .	-3.9299
Löffingen : The Poker ’ s Only Candidate	-5.6908
Internet information : Although the Baar town of Löffingen , with its 7514 inhabitants , an intact infrastructure , a forward-looking schooling , children 's , youth and senior policy , as well as its own municipalities , can be described as an attractive city , so far there is no second mayor mandate .	-7.3609
As the only candidate to succeed Norbert Brugger , who is no longer standing for age , the 46-year-old bank manager and business manager Dieter Köppler from Löffingen has so far been appointed .	-7.4478

Google , Samsung , Huawei sued for Nortel patents	-1.2174
The group , which owns thousands of previous Nortel patents , tightened on Thursday an avalanche of complaints about patent infringement against mobile phone manufacturers , including Google , the company that was overbidded by him in the Nortel insolvency auction .	-12.0441
Rockstar , the consortium bought Nortel patents for $ 4.5 billion , sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd , HTC Corp , Huawei , and four other companies for patent infringements before the Texas District Court .	-3.1123
Rockstar is located in the joint ownership of Apple , Microsoft , BlackBerry , Ericsson and Sony .	-2.6016
Google is accused of patent infringement in seven cases .	-1.1868
Patents include technology that matches search terms on the Internet with relevant advertising , the complaint that thus meets the core of Google ’ s search engine business .	-4.4639
Samsung , Huawei , HTC and Rockstar representatives were not directly available .	-2.9767
Samsung , Huawei , and HTC make mobile phones that work with Google ’ s Android operating system , which is in sharp competition with Apple ’ s and Microsoft ’ s mobile products .	-3.1419
In 2011 , Google issued an initial bid of $ 900 million for Nortel patents .	-1.8363
Google increased its offer several times and last offered $ 4.4 billion .	-3.2502
After it was overflowed with Nortel patents by Rockstar , Google Motorola acquired mobility for $ 12.5 billion , a business that was also motivated by Motorola ’ s library to patents .	-4.7259
“ Although Google failed to acquire the patents in the auction with its attempt to acquire the patents , Google has violated and continues to violate the patents , ” says the lamp .	-6.9573
Rockstar calls for a high compensation of Google since it claims that Google 's patent infringement is intentional , according to the accusation .	-3.7487
Egypt Afforded First Freely Elected Presidents	-3.1260
Mohammed Morsi is imprisoning , but his day of triumph is unlikely to mean the end of political disputes in Egypt .	-3.8845
Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised a “ new Egypt , ” when he was the first freely elected president of the country , thus antagonizing the succession of Husni Mubarak , who had been driven out of office for 16 .	-3.9722
With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court , Morsi became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and Egypt ’ s fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy roughly 60 years ago .	-7.4113
He placed the oath before the 18 judges dressed in black robes of the court , who has his seat on the Nile and is subjected to an ancient Egyptian temple .	-5.7443
“ We are striving for a better future , a new Egypt , and a second republic , ” said Morsi at the solemn ceremony broadcast live on state television .	-2.8528
“ Today , the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom , genuine democracy , and stability , ” said the 60-year-old Morsi , an engineer trained in the US and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood , a fundamentalist group that , since its founding 84 years ago , has mostly been targeted as a banned organisation by the government .	-5.9101
Hundreds of soldiers and policemen guard the building when Morsi arrived in a small autoconvoi just after 11 o 'clock . . the was .	-5.4169
Only a few hundred supporters had assembled in the court to cheat the new president , and , unlike the presidential Prunk of Mubarak , traffic was stopped only for a short time , so that the auto convoy could cross the usually busy road that connects the city centre to the southern suburbs .	-6.8979
As an uncharismatic “ substitute wheel ” of the Brotherhood , his personal prestige has grown since his victory and a Friday speech , presenting himself not only as a candidate of the Islamists , but of all those who wanted to target the aspirations of the 2011 uprising against authoritarian Mubarak .	-5.5452
“ Egypt is now a civilian , national , constitutional , and modern state , ” the Morsi dressed in a blue suit with a red tie declared to the judges in the wood-panelled chamber in which he seized office .	-7.1860
Later , Morsi went to Cairo University , where he should keep his inaugural address .	-2.7217
He was officially welcomed by an army band playing the national anthem , which he listened to in Habachtsstellung .	-4.1254
The military leader Feldmarshall Hussein Tantawi was present .	-1.7186
At his arrival , he was welcomed by hundreds of people in the university ’ s largest audience hall with spokespeople from “ The Army and the People are one hand . ”	-4.2547
The Cairo University , built in 1908 as a base of secular education , became a stronghold of Islamist students in the 1970s .	-3.7633
On Friday , Morsi abandoned a symbolic oath on Tahir Square , the birthplace of the uprising that led to the end of Mubarak 's authoritarian rule last year , and he promised to reclaim presidential powers that the military council had taken over from the post .	-5.4254
But with the defeat of the official zeal before the court and not , as usual , before Parliament , it is bowing to the will of the military , indicating that the power struggle will continue .	-11.4618
Morsi ’ s speech at Tahir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures .	-1.6592

On Thursday , a 51-year-old worker in Eggelsberg crashed by a ladder and wounded hard .	-4.6808
The man from Lamprechshausen wanted to change a defective radiator at the outside facade of an inn .	-3.8916

Rape is almost an everyday occurrence in South Africa : there are about 64 000 advertisements annually of sexual violence .	-4.1068
This is almost ten times as much as in Germany , but with 82 million people it has far more inhabitants than South Africa ( 50 million ) .	-3.7438

Studies show that less time is spent on mathematics in English schools – 116 hours a year or three hours a week per school year – than in most other countries .	-3.1561
On the other hand , Australian schools teach an average of 143 hours per year and students in Singapore receive 138 hours .	-2.4698
While there will be no formal requirement to allocate more time to mathematics in the timetable , coalition circles suggest that the comprehensive mathe-testing – combined with a greater weighting of the rankings – will probably encourage schools to spend more hours .	-6.1812
The curriculum focuses more on “ problems from the right life , ” including financial mathematics .	-2.5942

Salem : Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical Dialogue Forum	-1.8958
The next Ecumenical Consulting Forum on Monday , 21 October , at the New Museum of the Castle , we are dealing with the topic " To Hell with Hell - theological considerations about how to deal with the last things today " .	-7.0634
Referentin is Professor Johanna Rahner .	-5.9763
The Ecumenical Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and evangelical parish Salem , the Salem Palace and the Cultural Office of the Bodenseekreis .	-4.2142
Johanna Rahner wants to investigate in the forum how people today classify the " last things " after death .	-3.4663
If people had known too much over the past centuries , setting on the images of heaven and hell , " which still shape our ideas today , " the contemporary prophetic lesson of the hopes of completion is more characterised by a certain embarrassment or even lack of language .	-6.4963
" The greater hope has been exaggerated by the criticism of religion by Christians , " says the speaker .	-4.2872
She has ' provided us with so many question marks that we seem to have lost the exclamations ' .	-3.5358
Johanna Rahner continues : " But the crucial challenge remains the anger of death " .	-3.5160
This leads to the question of the longing , ' dreaming of everything being good in the end ' .	-5.7525
Johanna Rahner , born in Baden-Baden in 1962 , studied Catholic Theology and Biology at the Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg from 1982 to 1989 .	-1.9577

Ulrich Knobel joins the organizing sports club Illmensee .	-2.8577
Participants , especially in the short distance over 15 kilometres and 300 metres of altitude , were also numerous Jedermannsradlers who once wanted to practise their hobby in competitive atmosphere .	-6.7627
Two top German junior riders were also at the start in this race : Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz made good places with the recommendation at the German Championships .	-5.7115
These two could as expected depart from the field .	-3.5271

Pascal Treubel was again placed in second place .	-3.6897
For the ladies , it was Theresa Duelli from Team Nightmare that made it high up to the winner stairs .	-5.2316
Anne nobility from Illmensee and Leonie drivers came from Owingen in place two and three .	-4.1076
A pleasing development is the increasing number of drivers living or working in the community .	-3.4251
Not only was there a wide range of sportspeople in terms of capacity .	-4.7136
The age structure also ran from ten years of the youngest to over 70 years with the oldest starters .	-5.5421
In the main race were even more absolute top athletes at the start this year .	-3.0640
Four drivers were able to take off from the regional top drivers .	-3.5299
Below Philipp Pangerl , a mountain bike semi-professional from the Black Tusk racing team .	-2.7917
Together with a teammate Pangerl was already two times the world champion in the twelve hour driving .	-4.4657
This year he became European champion in this special discipline .	-2.5007
Roland Ballerstedt , who already calls his own two German championship titles in the Duathlon . is one .	-5.0249

On the way through mud , rivers , and jungles for free medical care	-7.0799
Dr Georges Bwelle brings free medical help to remote Cameroon villages .	-6.3158
Bwell and his team spend almost every weekend treating hundreds of patients .	-2.0387
In the West African country , there are not many doctors , only one for 5,000 people .	-2.3370

You can vote for him or any of the other heroes in the Top 10 to select him as CNN Hero of the Year .	-3.6433
The winner receives $ 250,000 to continue his extraordinary work .	-2.1056
For 21 years , Georges Bwell saw how his sick father repeatedly lost consciousness and traveled to hospitals that did not have the means to help him .	-3.8736
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaounde , the capital of Cameroon .	-8.6623
First he had only one broken arm , but then an inflammation spread to his brain and caused a hematom that would affect him for the rest of his life .	-4.6417
“ There were no neurosurgical surgeons in Cameroon , ” Georges Bwelle said . there was neurosin .	-5.2874
We would have brought him out of Cameroon had we had the money .	-4.2421
Instead , Bwell spent years accompanying his father in crowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer .	-3.4057
“ It ’ s not easy , ” he commented .	-2.0585
You can leave the house at 5 a.m. and run to the hospital to be the first , and is not the first .	-4.1702
There are many patients .	-1.4950
Some people even die because they have to wait .	-1.0354
The situation has changed little since Bwell 's father died in 2002 .	-2.1450
There is only one doctor in Cameroon for every 5 000 people , according to the World Health Organisation .	-2.4970
On the other hand , the relationship in the United States is with a doctor for 413 people .	-3.4195
But even if there was a doctor for them , most cameras could not afford to visit .	-2.7640
Two out of five people live below the poverty line and nearly three-quarters of the country ’ s health expenditure are private .	-2.5153
“ The only problem they have is poverty , ” says Bwell .	-2.2088
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life .	-0.8908
His father and so many of his compatriots suffered in Bwell the decision to do something about it .	-4.1223
Dr. Georges Bwell and his volunteer team carried out 700 free operations last year .	-1.7520
He became a doctor himself and works as a vascular surgeon in the Central Hospital in Yaoundé .	-4.2376
He also founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME , which travels to rural areas on weekends and offers free medical care .	-3.5534
Since 2008 , he and his volunteer group have helped nearly 32,000 people .	-2.0263
Almost every Friday , he and up to 30 people are forced into minibuses and ride on the roof over unsettled terrain to the villages that need help .	-6.7460
It is not always a good thing .	-2.5951
They had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud for more than once .	-3.3634
But when they arrive , they will receive as heroes : a feast dinner , singing and dance and the best accommodation the place has to offer .	-3.7176
In these villages , free medical care is really a reason to celebrate and bowl – with its wide smile and limitless energy – is happy to be part of the celebration .	-5.3092
The next morning the team starts examining hundreds of patients .	-2.1907
“ We treat 500 people per drive , ” says Blwelle .	-3.8842
You come from a radius of 60 kilometres around the village – and on foot .	-3.1645
Each weekend clinic offers medical care in a number of areas .	-2.2769
Many people are treated for malaria , tuberculosis , malnutrition , diabetes , parasites and sexually transmitted diseases .	-1.3627
Others receive crutches , donated glasses , or free birth certificates – a document that is needed for school , but many poor families simply cannot afford .	-3.6928
In the evening , the team performs simple local stunning operations .	-2.7151
The surgery usually takes place in a school , a town hall or a flat ; after the surgery , the patients come to the recreation area to make room for the next .	-10.5570
The illumination for the OP and the disinfection equipment is fed by the generator of the group and so Bwell and his volunteers work until early morning on Sunday .	-4.6321
It is an exhaustive pensum , but village musicians usually help to motivate the team .	-3.4963
“ They drown all night to stay awake and continue our work , ” says Blwelle .	-5.1807
On Sunday the team will return to the city , tired but proud of the work done .	-3.3738
The group – a mixture of Camerunian doctors and foreign medical students – carried out free operations last year and knows that its work makes a huge difference to the people it helps .	-4.3332
A man explained that the free operation of a truncation that he received now allows him to work again .	-4.7154
“ This changes the future of my family , ” the man said .	-2.2775
In addition to weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital , Bwell also works in private clinics in Yaoundé at night .	-4.2070
With this second job he finances 60 % of his non-profit activity , according to Bwell ; the rest comes from private donations .	-4.1765
“ I really do not know when he is sleeping , ” says Katie O ’ Malley , who is studying medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia in the second year , and is voluntarily working in Bwelles Group .	-4.7343
He is always in the hospital or is trying to raise money for the organization so that he can go to these campaigns .	-4.0124
For medical and health care students such as O 'Malley , who come from the US and Europe and support Bwell , this is an opportunity to gain practical experience at home that they would never get .	-4.2048
" We can be there in surgery where we help to pull blood or keep the instruments for Dr. Bwell , " explains O 'Malley .	-5.7787
That would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year .	-1.3955
Students usually pay for their trip to Cameroon and bring frequently donated sanitation material .	-3.9878
Once they are in Yaoundé , Bwell takes over accommodation , transport and instruction .	-4.7463
“ He is certainly a hero , ” says O 'Malley .	-2.3501
He dedicates his life to this organisation and his desire to help the Cameroonian people knows no limits .	-3.0559
For Bwell , almost constant work is not a burden .	-2.9548
Helping others to make a happier life and fulfill a promise he gave to his father gives him great pleasure .	-5.5625
“ I ’ m so happy when I do this work , ” Bwell says .	-2.8642
And I think of my father .	-1.3181
I hope he sees what I do .	-1.1977
I do it to make people laugh again and to relieve the pain .	-2.4652

Mastered Excellently	-2.6740
The role of Santiago , the old man in Hemingway 's novel " The Old Man and the Sea " , has been cut to Horst Janson .	-9.1303
Janson himself is an old hand in his meter , the art of acting .	-3.4639
The old man Santiago cannot fool anyone with fishing .	-3.4760
The two simply complement each other gran.	-4.2960
It is almost believed that the wrinkles in the neck of the old man , the fisherman 's young manolo speaks of , can be seen .	-5.1593
If Santiago is tired of life sitting on the chair , it is real at Janson .	-4.0359
In addition , the role of the old fisherman is through and through a character role that Janson master excellently .	-4.5803
Hemingway told the story of a fighter , a brave man who does not give up and ultimately wins the battle against the fish through his knowledge and strength .	-3.8872
Janson is on stage as an all-in-one on the stage in a wide range of distances .	-5.7615
It manages to focus the attention of the audience , so that its monologues are not a moment boring .	-3.3434
His efforts to finally pull the fish to the surface of water are so real that viewers forget that the sea consists of only blue lit water bottles .	-4.3686
Director Jens Hasselmann runs the old man in the boat in front of the fishing village .	-2.7310
In the course of the performance , he puts the respective active scene into light : The cottage of Santiago , the bar of the singer Marie-Luise Gunst , who , with her songs and her magnificent voice , captures the lifestyle of Cuba .	-7.1045
The four musicians play cuba rhythm and are also guests of the bar .	-3.0168
Tourism : Deswith the Romans	-2.5323
About 120 meters in length , a sewage channel from Roman times is maintained below Cologne .	-4.7723
Visiting Cologne , there is no way around the cathedral .	-3.9898
Around 157 meters the two towers fly into the sky and turn it into the second highest church building in Europe .	-5.9168
However , few visitors who admire the two beautiful churches estimate that there is also a lot to discover under the cathedral .	-5.4804
Rainer Schulze is an expert on Cologne Underworld .	-1.8270
The service centre of Cologne Tourism is directly at the Dom .	-3.5110
The tour starts quite unspectacular : " We start in the underground garage " , says Schulze .	-3.3989
In the 1970s , the fathers wanted to make a car-real city , and the rest of the old city wall remained just that which was not too big .	-6.6294
Most users of the park are therefore now passing the Roman remains and only hiring their car .	-5.3237
However , if you look more closely , an archaeological site separated by metal grid rods is discovered in the parking deck D2 .	-5.5732
It can be seen about five meters high ruins of handicraft stones .	-5.2886
" It is the remnants of the Roman wall that was built in the second half of the first century after Christ " , tells Schulze .	-4.2982
Before returning to daylight , Schulze leaves participants at the top level to take a look at a dark , 15 metres deep shelf .	-6.1102
This is the fountain of the old cathedral , which too .	-2.9902
The next stop of the round trip is the pretorium and the participants get down to the depth again .	-6.7366
This is the seat of the once most powerful man north of the Alps , the gateway to the CCAA .	-4.1635
What CAA means , a visitor wants to know .	-1.7535
" The abbreviation stands for " Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium " , which in German means as much as " the city of Roman law and city of the Agrippine , founded under Emperor Claudius at the site of the Altar for the Emperor 's Gallery " " " " . the of Cl. was the of , " Claudithe , " , , , the , the	-13.4196
And the pretorium is the former statutory palace , the power centre of the Roman empire on the Rhine .	-5.7432
From the front of the exhibition a tunnel access leads to the Roman sewage channel , which is maintained here at about 120 meters length .	-5.0224
" You can quietly walk along the so called Cloaca Maxima , if you want , " Schulze encourages the guests .	-5.4665
A surprise is still schools .	-2.3727
After holding the key at the checkout , he leads the group to a 16 m deep , walkable shaft .	-4.9826
" We are now in the Mikwe , a ritual Jewish bath , " he explains .	-2.1826
The Jewish community built its bath deep into the ground to reach the groundwater , which was essential for ritual washing .	-3.8105
Until today , in the lower end of the Mikwe , whose origins date back to the eighteenth century , different water levels can be seen through changing levels of the Rhine .	-4.9730
The Mikwe will be part of an archaeological zone at the Town Hall Square for which construction will soon begin .	-4.2297
However , it will be a few years before completion .	-3.3072
Almost hacked : Rerun of Rocker Process	-3.3701
A bloody attack in the rockermilieu will be reopened after more than four years .	-2.5069
A trial of attempted decommissioning , dangerous body injury and material damage against two 30-year-olds began before the District Court of Frankfurt ( Oder ) .	-5.8045
It is accompanied by strict safety measures .	-1.7009
The accused were sweeping to the offense .	-4.5932
They should have been active in the rocker scene and then belonged to the bandidos .	-3.4970
The Public Prosecutor accuses them of filling in a car in June 2009 with unknown accomplices in Finowfurt on three men .	-5.0045
All the victims were seriously injured , a man almost lost his leg .	-3.5306
The victims are said to have heard the competing group of Hell Angels .	-9.0674
One should have been a high-level member from Berlin .	-2.7799
Apparently , a multi-car pursuit was preceded .	-4.2902
According to indictment , there were turf struggles and a demonstration of power .	-3.6895
The two defendants had been released in a first trial in early 2012 .	-2.0853
One spokesman said then that it was impossible to prove that men were actually involved in the bloody absence .	-3.6643
The perpetrators had carried masks and were not recognized .	-1.8144
The Federal Court issued the judgment following the review of the prosecutor 's office and sent it back to the country court for further negotiations .	-5.7627
At present , one of the defendants is in open execution for another offence .	-3.4952
The first was the reconstruction of the workflows in the Tatnacht .	-4.4634
As a witness , the Commissioner who investigated it was invited .	-3.8463
The main focus was on mobile calls from the accused and other people who had listened to the police .	-4.5496
The trouble is that rockers almost always abide by - and do not testify - a law that they have come to expect .	-5.9990
This also applies to the victims .	-1.7524
In the first process only one of the victims had been wrapped out .	-3.2258
Prosecutor Stefan Gollier of the Public Prosecutor 's Office of Frankfurt ( Oder ) said on demand that new traces have emerged since the last procedure .	-5.4701
Eleven further days of negotiations are set for the process .	-2.0257

Only : hunger is noticeable in the trees of the people on the front-passenger and back seat .	-4.3449
Of course , this may be due to one or another cocktail or champagne !	-4.4261
What ’ s better than driving to the next drive-in to treat yourself a bit ?	-5.8202
I admit that I am happy to be with you when we get to fast food stores late night or early in the morning .	-6.0300
A few pommes , a cola , a burger - and then nix as from home and into bed !	-3.9407
But on the way back there are obvious differences between me and other hungry disco ferners .	-4.0168
What is missing for you to throw your fast-food bags out of the auto window with constant regularity ? !	-6.6912
Particularly on the weekends there are discarded paper bags on streets and car parks .	-4.9201
" Why ? " I ask myself .	-1.2867
Are people too doof to take the bags back home with respect to the next bin ?	-3.7618
It is not just paper molding the landscape .	-3.6800
The killings have also covered transport facilities , such as transport plans , and have caused accidents .	-6.3765
But what is said is not what this word means , and probably not even knows what it .	-7.2022
If you are on the road more often in the evenings , you know what a rear bench can look like after festive nights : brackets , bottles and other rubbish towers .	-8.0421
Some bags would be more or less nix , unlike the road , where no one wants to trample on the livestock of others .	-6.2109
I can see that there is already a day when cities and municipalities have to throw the wind - and the fast food chains have to pay for their bags .	-8.2389
Obama ’ s Return in Health Policy	-2.0943
After heated criticism , President Obama yesterday backtracked on his often-repeated , clear promise : “ If you like your health insurance , you can keep it . ”	-3.7436
After hundreds of thousands of their insurers received a letter of redundancy , the Republicans have in recent days accused the president of deceiving the American public .	-4.7240
Yesterday , Obama relative his original promise .	-1.4522
“ The vast majority of citizens who have functioning health insurance can keep them , ” he said in a speech in Boston .	-3.3828
In response to the numerous media reports on the redundancies , Obama urged Americans who received such communications to look around the free market for a new insurance .	-3.8049
Most citizens could obtain better , broader health insurance at the same price , or cheaper than forecast .	-4.1926
“ You get a better offer , ” he said .	-2.4545
The government described it as unsurprising that the five per cent of the population who have made an insurance would have to look after a different tariff , because their contract does not meet the new standards under the Affordable Care Act .	-6.9358
“ I want to say to these Americans quite directly : they deserved better , ” said Sebelius , at a hearing before the House of Representatives ’ Energy and Trade Committee in Washington .	-4.9086
Sebelius , who is responsible for implementing the Affordable Care Act , declared that the launch of the online platform has been “ miserable ” since October .	-3.0525
“ I am as frustrated and angry as everyone else , ” she said .	-2.1508
I am determined to regain your confidence .	-1.0360
This pledge of an outraged Sebelius to be a sitting adviser at yesterday ’ s House of Representatives hearing was received after a dispute with the Republican Billy Long from Missouri about whether she should be obliged to participate in Obamacare .	-7.6331
After more than three hours of hearing , Long Sebelius repeatedly afflicted the question of why the Affordable Care Act ’ s “ Architecture ” did not voluntarily renounce a state-sponsored insurance to pay a price for themselves at HealthCare.gov , which she now wants to sell millions of Americans .	-6.8735
Government in Jerusalem does not confirm an attack on Syrian air base .	-2.5315
An American government official who wanted to remain anonymous on Thursday alleged that Israeli fighter aircraft had attacked an air base in Syrian Latakia a day earlier .	-4.8478
The objective was ' missiles and equipment ' , which the Israeli Government feared were intended for Lebanon 's Hezbollah , according to CNN .	-3.3687
Syrian and Lebanese media , as well as the Arab channel Al-Arabiya , had previously reported that the base in the port city of Latakia had been bombarded at the night of Wednesday to Thursday , and the Israelis blamed for it .	-5.1903
The Israeli television channel Channel 2 showed satellite images of the base point in Latakia where Russian S-125 Newa defensive missiles and a battery of SA-3 missiles , according to Channel 2 , have a range of 35 kilometres and can transport explosives up to 70 kilograms .	-6.2897
Unsure the government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack .	-2.3869
But Reuter ’ s news agency quotes an equally anonymous Israeli government official in the words that he believe Israel has carried out the attack , but not sure .	-4.8222
A spokesman from the Israeli Ministry of Defence said , in any case , ' we do not comment on these reports ' .	-3.7630
In Yedioth Ahronoth , the journalist Ron Ben-Yishai stressed that the Syrian regime had already , partly successfully , tried to deliver ground air missiles to Hezbollah .	-3.6725
The Israeli government had repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to supply Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons would mean exceeding a red line that would follow a military response .	-3.3796
John Kerry declares in an unprecedented admission that US espionage has “ gone unreasonably far . ”	-3.8098
John Kerry ’ s unexpected admission indicated a softening of the US ’ s defiant stance on its surveillance programs , saying that espionage was “ inadequate too far in certain cases . ”	-5.7384
The Foreign Minister also admitted that he , together with Barack Obama , was responsible for “ Autopilot , ” when the explosive revelations of the whistleblower Edward Snowden about NSA ’ s spy activities became public .	-4.3037
The leaked information has left the US government in a diplomatic storm of indignation by its allies .	-2.7873
In a video conversation speech at the London Open Government Conference , Kerry said : “ No doubt the President and I , as well as others in the government , have heard of a number of things that have virtually been done by autopilot simply because the capacity was what was going on in the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War and , of course , 11 September . ”	-8.4009
Then , as the first senior member of the US government , he admitted that the US espionage had crossed a border , but he also stressed that no rights had been abused .	-4.8567
He said : ‘ In some cases this has gone unreasonably far ’ .	-3.3670
The President is determined to clarify and is therefore conducting a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel that abuses are taking place .	-4.3916
I assure you that the rights of innocent people in this process will not be affected .	-6.1911
Kerry insisted , however , that the NSA was a force of good , and that many lives were saved by their surveillance operations .	-3.9876
He added , “ We are facing a new world in which people are ready to blow themselves up . ”	-2.8634
There is a radical extremism in the world that is keen to kill people , blow up and attack governments .	-3.0493
So what if you could intercept and stop this before it happens ?	-3.2077
We have indeed prevented aircraft crashes , attacks on buildings and the murder of people , because we have seen these plans in the run-up to them .	-5.0322
Meanwhile , US legislators will travel to Europe to dispel concerns about the alleged American espionage and convince Europeans of the need to continue working with the US on anti-terrorism efforts , as the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said on Thursday .	-4.9625
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said that he spoke this week with representatives of the European Parliament and other people and is concerned about their threats of no longer participating in anti-terrorist organisations due to the frustration over the National Security Agency 's surveillance .	-5.5383
“ It is very important for the US ’ s national security interests that Europeans remain on board with regard to our joint efforts against terrorism , ” said Murphy , who is the first Democrat to sit in the Senate and is the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Relations and European Affairs , in an interview in Washington .	-5.2653
I also go to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism , regardless of their anger over the NSA programmes .	-3.8572
Media reports that the NSA has captured millions of telephone data in Europe have burdened relations with some US allies , although this week the head of the secret service said that the reports were inaccurate and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected and exchanged with the United States .	-5.5579
Other revelations cited from Snowden documents that the NSA had monitored the phone from Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of state worldwide .	-3.8812
The head of national intelligence services , James Clapper , defended espionage among allies as necessary and declared that this is common on both sides .	-3.8446
In all the tumult , Murphy said that his authority was preparing the congress ’ s journey to take place this year , and hoped that the delegation would include members from both parties and chambers .	-5.2945
The names of the other participating Members will be published in the coming days .	-2.4954
He said that the exact itinerary is still being worked out .	-2.9232
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the trip was to improve relations , he also said that there would be some “ serious words . ”	-3.0693
He said that European governments should be honest with their people about the kind of espionage programmes they have been using for years .	-3.4407
“ While we can change our surveillance programmes and thus protect Europeans ’ rights better , they must also accept the fact that we are not the only ones to spy , ” says Murphy .	-3.9333
Meanwhile , John Kerry will have a weekend trip to the Middle East and Poland to address the grievances about the US strategy in Syria , Egypt , and Iran , as well as US surveillance activities .	-4.1057

Australia is appealing to Thailand for prison sentences	-3.2243
A 21-year-old Sydney woman sentenced to 15 days in Phuket for mistakenly claiming to have been raped by a taxi driver has appealed against the verdict and was released on bail .	-3.2820
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty by a provincial court in Phuket on June 15 to have made a false statement , having given to the Thai police that a local taxi driver raped them during the morning hours on Sunday 10 June , while two other men held them .	-5.2929
Later , however , the shots of a video camera showed that she had safely arrived at her hotel after being separated from her Australian friend .	-4.8078
The police in Phuket interrogated Bamford for two days until she admitted that history had been conceived .	-3.7784
Until the trial , she was in police custody on .	-6.1443
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a low-security prison on the margins of Phuket , instead of a prison for adult women .	-3.6754
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks , a former Australian Rubgy League player who asked for help from the Canberra Foreign Ministry .	-3.8083
Tunks told Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was “ extremely concerned ” about the well-being of his daughter and wanted to have them back in Australia .	-3.5176
“ Of course , we are very concerned , but we hope it will be back home as soon as possible , ” said Tunks .	-3.3764
Bamford appealed against the judgment and is opposed to a bail of 50,000 Baht at large .	-3.0497
In Australian reports it has been read that in the meantime it is on holiday in Krabi in South Thailand .	-4.7356
Vonside the court was told that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and had been warned that the appeal could also lead to the imposition of a higher sentence of up to two years in a adult prison .	-4.6214
It is also possible , however , that after the recent murder of Michelle Smith in Phuket , Thailand may be trying to improve its beleaguered tourist image , and that is why there is an appeal .	-6.8553
