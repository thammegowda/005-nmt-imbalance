The Commission of the National Assembly , which is currently working on a bill for changes in names , said : ‘ The final decision on the name of the members of the National Assembly is , of course , up to the members themselves . ’	-4.7574
With the Government of Wales Act 2017 , the Welsh parliament was given the opportunity to change its name .	-2.2781
In June last year , the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals for the change of name in the House of Wales .	-5.0596
On the question of the title of the meeting members , the Commission preferred Welsh Members of Parliament or WMPs , but the MWP option received most support in a public consultation .	-4.1910
Members of the Welsh Parliament seem to propose alternative options , but the fight to achieve consensus could cause headaches for Elin JONES ’ chairman , who is expected to present a bill for these changes in the next few weeks .	-5.4849

Athens has long insisted that the name of his northern neighbour is a claim to his territory and has repeatedly objected to his application for membership of the EU and NATO .	-3.5315
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov , an opponent of the referendum on naming , has said he will ignore the vote .	-2.3586

" Historically , the old people I have spoken to have said that there was a bar and a church at every corner , " said Mr Adams .	-6.7336
'Today there is neither . '	-2.9341
He said that the disappearance of pubs is understandable .	-1.2554

Churches could be replaced by multi-family houses with property that are filled with the kind of people who will not help the remaining refuges in the city .	-9.9817
The overwhelming majority of people who buy property housing in these buildings will be white , he said , ' and will therefore speed up the day when these churches are completely closed , because it is unlikely that most of those people who buy property will become members of these churches ' .	-5.6800

St. Martin 's was taken over by a black community under the parish John Howard Johnson , who led a boycott of the retailers on the 125th street , a main shopping street in Harlem , which resisted the recruitment or promotion of black people .	-5.1635
A fire in 1939 left the building seriously damaged , but when Father Johnson ’ s community members made plans for reconstruction , they ordered the bell game .	-3.3492
Parish David Johnson , son of Father Johnson and successor to St. Martin 's , proudly called the bell game " the bells of the poor . "	-3.2623
The expert who played the bell in July called it something else : ' a cultural treasure ' and ' an irreplaceable historical instrument ' .	-3.4024
The expert , Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan , also noted that it was the world ’ s first bell play played by a black musician , Dionisio A. Lind , who switched 18 years ago to the bigger bell play at the Riverside Church .	-4.7312
Mr Merriweather said that St. Martin 's did not replace him .	-1.7484
What has happened to St. Martin in recent months has been a complicated story of architects and contractors , some of which have been brought by Church leaders , others by the bishop diocese .	-5.2771
The sacristy – the parish ’ s governing body , composed of laymen – wrote to the diocese in July , worried that the diocese would “ try to pass on the costs to the sacristy , ” even though the sacristy was not involved in appointing the architects and contractors of the diocese .	-5.5984
Some community members complained that the diocese was not transparent .	-3.4159

While Save the Children is setting up a team to travel to Palu , it is not yet certain that foreign staff can work on the ground .	-3.9658
The spokesman for the National Civil Protection Agency , Mr Sutopo , said that Indonesian officials would assess the situation in Palu in order to see whether international organisations can contribute to the aid .	-3.2230
Unfortunately , given the earthquake that Indonesia is constantly enduring , the country is not well prepared for the forces of nature .	-3.4260
While the tsunami safeguards were built in Aceh , which is not common to other coastal lines .	-3.6202
The apparent absence of a tsunami warning in Palu , though a warning has already been in force , may have contributed to the loss of human life .	-4.4117

The Cromwell parliament ’ s statue will turn into the recent monumental success of the series “ History ”	-4.5051
His banning would be poetic justice to his Taliban-like destruction by his fanatical Puritan followers of so many cultural and religious artifacts of England .	-3.6277

Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor , Thomas , in the last century .	-2.6789
Sir William Hamo Thornycroft ’ s great depiction of Cromwell testifies to the opinion that prevailed in the 19th century and is still dominant in parts of history : that Cromwell is worth celebrating .	-4.8748
Mr Goldsmith said on Sunday Telegraph : ‘ Cromwell is seen by many , perhaps more in the late 19th century than today , as a defender of Parliament against external pressure , in his case of course the monarchy .	-4.1684
Whether it is an absolutely correct representation is the subject of continued historical debate .	-3.2442
To be sure , the conflict in the mid-seventeenth century shaped the subsequent development of our nation , and Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure that stands for one side of the divide .	-4.3739
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth remembering and celebrating them . ”	-1.6538

Meanwhile , Livingston extended his unbeaten run in the division to six games , with Cheftriner Holt still having to taste a defeat since he replaced Kenny Miler last month .	-4.2416
Livingston Verts Opportunity	-2.8830
Holt ’ s players should have been leading for a long time , because they made the rangers with their direct game very difficult .	-6.9455
Scott Robinson broke through the ball , but made his attempt at the gate , then Alan Lithgow could only deflect his efforts after taking Craig Halkett ’ s head ball over the gate .	-6.3703
The hosts agreed to allow the rangers to play in front of themselves , knowing that they could disrupt visitors in standard situations .	-4.7951
And that was the way in which the decisive goal came .	-2.3407
The rangers admitted a free kick and Livingston made an opening by using Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined against Menga , who went into the criminal area by handplay and scored a goal from there .	-7.4638
At that time the ball was held by the rangers most of the time , but the hosts ’ impenetrable defense prevented Torhüter Liam Kelly from floating .	-6.3950

Scott Pittman was defended by the feet of the Rangers Torwart Allan McGregor and Lithgow was extended for another Livingstone standard situation .	-4.6154

Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland in Tony Macaroni Arena	-1.0075
A great achievement and a phenomenal result for Livingston .	-1.7106
They were all excellent together and continued to exceed expectations at this upward trend .	-3.5612
Their gaming style and staff have hardly changed since they returned to the top league , but Holt has been greatly appreciated for the way he has encouraged the team since his arrival .	-6.0363
He had so many heroes .	-0.5157
Captain Halkett provided an excellent organizing defense , while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall kept on track all the time .	-4.2925
The rangers lacked ideas , however .	-1.6413
As good as they were sometimes under Gerrard , they fell well behind these standards .	-3.1646
Their last ball left to be desired – only once did they cut the home team openly – and it is something like a wake-up call for the rangers in the middle table .	-5.0012

Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix , Las Vegas , Salt Lake City with floods ( droughts can benefit )	-2.5353
It is not often the case that Arizona is being hit by a tropical low-pressure area , but that is exactly what is probably happening early next week , when Hurricane Rosa ’ s last outpouring of power travels through the desert in the southwest and brings potential floods .	-7.5616
The National Weather Service has already issued flagship measuring devices for Monday and Tuesday for the Western Arizona in the south and east of Nevadas , Southeast California and Utahs , including the cities Phoenix , Flagstaff , Las Vegas and Salt Lake City .	-9.6190

America ’ s Artificial Intelligence Spending	-1.9817
While China is becoming more active for artificial intelligence , the US should double its research investment , Kai-Fu Lee , Investor , and AI practitioner , who has worked for Google , Microsoft , and Apple .	-3.4919
These demands emerged after US government officials made announcements about AI , despite the lack of a formal AI strategy in the United States .	-5.5391
Meanwhile , China has presented its plan last year : by 2030 , it wants to be number 1 in the area of AI-Innovation .	-4.2621
“ A doubling of spending on AI research would be a good start , given that all other countries are well behind the US , and a breakthrough in AI research is on the brink , ” said Lee .	-3.8609
The doubling of funding could double the chances that the next achievement in the field of artificial intelligence in the US will be achieved , Lee CNBC said in an interview this week .	-3.4255
Lee , whose book “ AI Superpower : China , Silicon Valley and the New World Order ( AI Superpowers : China , Silicon Valley , and the New World Order ) ” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt , is CEO of Sinovation Ventures , a company that has invested in one of the most famous Chinese AI firms , Face + + .	-3.8008

Macedonia votes in a referendum on whether to change the name of the country .	-2.2450
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether their name should be changed in the Republic of North Macedonia , a step that would resolve decades of dispute with Greece , which had blocked its accession offers to the European Union and NATO .	-4.5561
Greece , which has a province called Macedonia , insists that the name of its northern neighbour constitutes a territorial claim to the Greek territory and has vetoed the country 's entry into NATO and the EU .	-2.9902
The two governments concluded an agreement in June based on the proposed new name , but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slav majority population of Macedonia .	-2.7657
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum , and , with a boycott campaign , there are doubts as to whether the result will create the 50 % hurdle , which is a prerequisite for the referendum 's validity .	-4.3801
The question on the referendum paper was : ' Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with the adoption of the agreement with Greece ? '	-2.8090
Advocates of naming , including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev , argue that the price is worth continuing admission to institutions such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia , one of the countries to emerge from the collapse of Yugoslavia .	-3.5627
“ I have come here today to vote on the future of the country ; it is a decision for the young people of Macedonia to be able to live freely under the umbrella of the European Union , because that means a life in greater security for all of us , ” said Olivera Georgijevska , 79 , in Skopje .	-4.4659

“ I voted for my children – our place is in Europe , ” said Gjoose Tanevski , 62 , a voter in the capital Skopje .	-2.8706
Macedonia 's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev , his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted in favour of the referendum in Macedonia on the amendment of the country 's name , which would pave the way for him to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica , Macedonia , on 30 September 2018 .	-3.5177
In front of the Parliament in Skopje , Vladimir Kavardarkov , 54 , has prepared a small stage and put chairs before the tents set up by those who will boycott the referendum .	-3.5245
" We are in favour of NATO and the EU , but we want to participate with heads up , not through the door , " said Kavadarkov .	-3.6252
" We live in a poor country , but we also have our dignity .	-1.7325
If you do not want to join us as Macedonia , we can turn to others , such as China and Russia , to join us in Euro-Asian integration . ”	-2.7388
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will bring badly needed investments to Macedonia , a country with an unemployment rate of more than 20 % .	-1.8996
“ I believe a large majority will vote in favour , because more than 80 % of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO , ” Zaev said after giving his vote .	-3.2397
According to him , the result would be “ yes ” to a “ strengthening of our future . ”	-2.8291
Last Monday , the Macedonian Institute for Political Research published the results of a survey : between 30 and 43 % of voters would thus participate – less than necessary .	-3.2324
Another survey conducted by Macedonia ’ s Telma TV found that 57 % of respondents will vote on Sunday .	-2.6766
Of those who want to participate , 70 % voted “ yes . ”	-2.9165
The referendum will only be adopted if the turnout is over 50 % .	-2.2491

Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defended Brighton ’ s defense at Manchester City 2-0 victory on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester , England .	-7.3713
Aguero made his hit look incredibly easy at the 65 minute .	-2.9653
At the beginning of the game sequence , the Argentine storm received a pass in the middle field .	-4.1580
He tricked three defenders from Brighton to play .	-2.8063
Then Agüero saw himself surrounded by three shirts .	-2.4066
He bypassed a defender before running several players on the edge of the Brighton penalty area .	-3.7374
Then he left a pass and passed it to Sterling .	-2.6749
The English stormer used his first contact to play back the ball to Agüero , which then shot with right – past Brighton-Torwart Mathew Ryan to the right side of the gate .	-17.3347
“ Aguero has foot problems , ” said City-Manager Pep Guardiola the reporters .	-2.3614
" We talked about it ; he played 55 , 60 minutes .	-2.2641
That has happened .	-1.1787
Fortunately , he shot a goal at the moment . ”	-2.5778

Scherzer ’ s Going Game Crisis	-4.8212
Because national players were excluded from the Playoff competition , there was not much reason to force another start .	-3.5683
But the hard-fought Sherzer hopes to climb the hill on Sunday against Colorado Rockies , but only if there are still Playoff implications for the Rockies that have a lead over a game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West .	-5.9330
Rockies won at least one place on Friday evening with a 5 : 2 victory over the nationals , but the title win in the first league is still not certain .	-5.6348
" Even if we play for free , we can at least bear witness because we know that the atmosphere here in Denver with the people and the other team will probably be the best that we have to offer this year .	-4.3961
Why should I not make any effort ? '	-2.3586
The nationals have not announced a start for Sunday yet , but are allegedly inclined to throw Sherters in such a situation .	-5.2996

And they are determined to regain power by all means necessary , and they do not stop from Boshians and communities either .	-5.6502
They do not care who they are injuring , who they need to cross to get power and control , that is what they want , power and control , we will not give them .	-4.5558

The Labour Party is no longer a large community .	-1.3776
It is intolerant of those who say what they think .	-0.8652
When momentum activists in my local party voted to criticise me , it was hardly a surprise .	-2.0364
Finally , I am the last in a number of Labour MEPs who say that we are not welcome - just because we have said our opinion .	-3.9712
My group colleague Joan Ryan has been treated in a similar way because she has been resolutely opposed to anti-Semitism .	-3.0064
In my case , I have been criticised for the motion of censure because I do not agree with Jeremy Corbyn .	-2.5111

Most of my time as a local Labour MEP in the eight years , the GC meetings on Friday evening were just the same .	-10.4299
Unfortunately , it is not the tone of many meetings today , and the promise of a " more friendly , soft " policy has long been forgotten , if ever .	-3.7173
It has become ever clearer that different views in the Labour Party are not tolerated , and any opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to party leaders .	-3.9538
This began shortly after Jeremy took office , because the colleagues with whom I had previously thought that I had a similar political attitude expected me to turn a reverse and take positions that I would never have agreed with , whether in terms of national security or the EU internal market .	-7.0383
Whenever I speak publicly – and I do not matter what I say – there is a tirade of abuse in the social media calling for election , denouncing central-center politics , and telling me that I should not be in the Labour Party .	-5.0700
This experience was not only my experience .	-2.7759
I know , in fact , that there is more luck than some of my colleagues , since the comments that address me tend to be political .	-4.0919
I appreciate the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who are exposed to a flood of sexist or racist abuse every day but never shy away .	-3.3823
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the extent of abuse has normalized .	-2.2664
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance .	-2.1287
The reality is that we are no longer the broad church and with every motion of censure or amendment of the rules of selection , the party becomes smaller .	-5.1210
I have had plenty of advice over the last two years to pull my neck , not being so vocal , and then I would be “ right . ”	-4.9903
But that is why I have not entered politics .	-2.8537
I joined as a student 32 years ago , because of the neglect of the Thatcher Government , Labour , which had caused my classroom to literally collapse , so I tried to promote better public services for those who need it most , whether as a municipal council or minister .	-6.4073
I have never hidden my political views , not even at the last election .	-2.5181
As far as my political positions are concerned , nobody should have been in any way confused in Nottingham East , and the same applies to areas where I disagree with current .	-3.9343
To those who supported the motion on Friday , I just want to say that I do not understand why they are wasting time and energy to remain loyal to me and to the Labour Party if the country is heading for a Brexit that is damaging to households , businesses and our public services .	-4.2669
But the only message I have is not about Nottingham momentum , but about my constituents , whether Labour members or not : I am proud to serve you , and I promise you that I will not be holding any threats to vote or political opportunism from work in what I think is the best interest of all of you .	-5.9904

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose : Ayr Without Beat the Sp	-2.9047
Two late tries may have distorted the final result , but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win in this wonderful entertaining Tennent 's Premiership Match of the Day .	-4.0314

Robyn Christie von Melrose said , “ Thanks to Ayr , they have made better use of their opportunities . ”	-2.3782
Grant Anderson ’ s 14th minute , transformed by Frazier Climo , brought Ayr forward , but a yellow card for Scotland ’ s captain Rory Hughes , given for the game of Warriors , allowed melrose to speak numbers , and Jason Baggot to make a non-transformed attempt .	-4.9140
Climo presented the leadership of Ayr with a punitive shot before he scored a hit directly at the half-time , and then made a solo quest that allowed him to pass the 17 : 5 break for Ayr .	-9.1164
Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson 's attempt to transform from Baggot reduced the distance to five points .	-3.8436
After the reboot , Ayr built the lead when a truy was transformed by Stafford McDowall-Climo .	-5.8796
Ayr 's current captain Blair Macpherson then got the yellow card , and again , Melrose let the additional man pay with a non-converted Bruce Colvine attempt , at the end of a curse of heavy pressure .	-5.1595
The home side , however , came back , and when struan Hutchinson received a yellow card due to a Tackling without a ball from Climo from the penalty zone , MacPherson made a touchdown , the advancing Ayr in the back .	-6.4757

“ We are on the verge of regaining access to the Pacific Ocean , ” he promised at the end of August .	-2.3133

Independent schools in Scotland have a track record of high academic quality , which continued with outstanding results in 2018 , including single- and group success in sports , art , music and other Community businesses .	-6.2440
With over 30,000 students across Scotland , these schools , represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools ( SCIS ) , strive to offer their students and parents the best level of service .	-3.1257
Independent schools are designed to prepare students – for further training , including higher education , their desired professional career and their role as a world citizen .	-5.1713

68 % of students who have studied foreign languages have reached Higher grade A .	-4.1282

This shows that independent schools in Scotland promote foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will no doubt need in the future .	-3.1463
In the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere , language subjects rank the same as MINT subjects ( mathematics , information technology , science and technology ) .	-3.4283
A 2014 UK Employment and Qualifications survey found that 17 % of the reasons why employers had difficulty occupying jobs were attributable to a lack of language skills .	-3.4240

According to a YouGov poll with more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013 , 75 % were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to talk , and French is the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage , namely 15 % .	-3.4440
That is why the current investment in language teaching is important for today 's children .	-3.1331

Indeed , modern languages should really be regarded as “ international communication capabilities . ”	-2.4250

Trump ’ s West Virginia Rally , YouTube Channel	-2.0433
President Donald Trump is starting this evening in Wheeling , West Virginia , with a flood of election campaigns .	-8.5114
It is the first of five planned election events next week , and Trump is also visiting the Republican-friendly states of Tennessee and Mississippi .	-4.0062
While his candidate ’ s confirmation for the vague Supreme Court remains unknown , Trump must mobilize his electorate for the upcoming midterm elections , otherwise fearing that the Republicans will lose the majority of Congress if elected in November .	-5.7287
When is Trump ’ s West Virginia Rally tonight and how can they be viewed online ?	-2.2047
Trump ’ s Rally in Wheeling , West Virginia , is scheduled for 19 p.m. ET this evening , Saturday , 29 September 2018 .	-3.1317
Below you can watch Trump ’ s West Virginia Rally online via live stream on YouTube .	-3.3413
Trump will certainly respond to this week ’ s hearings on the allegations of sexual abuse against his Supreme Court candidate , Brett Kavanaugh , and his confirmation by the Senate was postponed by at least one week until the FBI investigation concluded .	-5.4870
But the main aim of these election events is to mobilize the Republicans , who face a crucial November election .	-3.7943
According to Reuters , Trump ’ s campaign ’ s goal is to mobilize volunteers and supporters next week ’ s five election events to defend and expand the majority of Republicans in the Senate and House .	-3.3379
“ The majority of Congress is top on the president ’ s agenda , so , just before the turbulent election season begins , he attends as many states as possible , ” said a speaker of the Trump campaign , who would not be named , Reuters .	-5.3215
According to the Radionetzwerk West Virginia MetroNews , the election event held this evening at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract Ohio and Pennsylvania supporters and attract the attention of the Pittsburgher media .	-5.5396
On Saturday , Trump West Virgina , the state he won in 2016 with more than 40 percentage points , will visit this month for the second time .	-2.7043
Trump is trying to help the Republicans ’ candidate for West Virginia ’ s Senate , Patrick Morrisey , who lags behind in polls .	-8.5090
According to Reuters , Simon Haeder , a political scientist at West Virginia University said that it was not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come to improve his poll numbers .	-3.5410
Ryder Cup 2018 : Team USA is ready to fight to maintain hope for the Sunday singles .	-2.8575
After three unilateral encounters , the four games on Saturday afternoon were probably what the Ryder Cup needed .	-2.9828
The vibrating pendulum is a freely invented sports concept that players have internalized , especially in competitions like this .	-3.8663
So where would it say the momentum is now ?	-1.7830
“ You have had a six-point lead and now there are four , so there is some momentum , ” said Jordan Spieth , when he retired . ”	-4.5525
Europe is , of course , in an advantage of four points , and twelve others have yet to play .	-4.9622
But , as Spieth says , the Americans feel a little windy in their sails , and there was much encouraging for them , not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas , who played together all day and each had three out of four .	-6.0058
Spieth was superior from the outset and set a good example .	-2.2468
These fierce rivals were louder when his lap continued , he sent a decisive putt to reach a draw in game 4 after he and Thomas left two points after 2 games .	-8.4979
His delight at the putting on the 15th hole with which she won the game was such that one thought he still believe in the victory of the Americans .	-5.1554
" You really need to concentrate and only worry about your own game , " said Spieth .	-3.2862
This is all that remains to each of these players now .	-2.6923
18 holes to leave impression .	-0.8550
In the last two days , Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood have been the only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas .	-2.9383
Europe ’ s strange , but admirable couple plays no errors and is simply doing everything right .	-4.9601
Moliwood was the only couple who did not get a bogey on Saturday afternoon , but they also avoided it on Saturday morning , Friday afternoon and Friday morning .	-5.2031
This race and the way in which their energy and spectators seem to flow from this omitted crowd makes them favorites on Sunday , and when the sun goes down over Le Golf National , there would be no more popular player sealed a possible European victory than Fleetwood or Molinari .	-6.1817
Probably both simultaneously in different holes .	-1.5543
Speaking of a European victory now would be too premature .	-1.7341
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short process with Sergio Garcia , who won the morning with his partner Alex Noren .	-2.1712
With a bogey and two doubles at the first nine , the Spaniards and the Swede start to a hole from which they never came out again .	-4.7944
On Sunday , no one will help you out of your hole .	-2.9428
Due to interactions between pairs , given advice , non-given advice , and the way a strategy can change in turn , it is very fascinating to watch footballs and footpieces at close range .	-6.2422
Europe has so far played better as a team and has taken a significant lead in the last day , but this Foursome-session has also shown that Team USA has the desire to fight , which some , in particular , have doubted about .	-7.3833
Europe Leads 10-6 on the Ryder Cup Finaltag	-1.3321
Europe will take advantage of a solid advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup , after it emerged from the four and four games on Saturday with a 10-6 leadership on the United States .	-5.6339
The inspired Duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the group with two victories over a fighting Tiger Woods to raise its previous record in Le Golf National to four points .	-3.7455
The European team of Thomas Bjorn , who took part in the preservation of the trophy that she lost in Hazeltine two years ago , dominated an American team with extinction in the mortal football game and won the series with 3-1 .	-6.4243
The US offered more resistance in the four and won two games , but they could not digest the deficit .	-2.7308
The Jim Furyk team needs eight points from the 12 individual games on Sunday to keep the trophy .	-3.2815
Fleetwood is the first European Rookie to win four points in a row , while he and Molinari , after a sensational weekend called " Molliwood " , are only the second couple that wins four points from their first four games in the history of the Ryder Cup .	-3.4233
After disintegrating Woods and Patrick Reed into the Fourballs , it was certain that they would beat a sobered Woods and American Rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even clearer 5 & 4 .	-6.2684
Woods , who took part on Saturday through two parties , occasionally showed brilliant actions , but he has lost 19 of his 29 matches in quadruples and quadruples and seven in a row .	-5.4447
Justin Rose , rested for the morning footballs , returned to his partner Henrik Stenson in the Foursomes and beat in a 2 & 1 defeat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – place one and three in the world .	-4.8860
However , on a pleasant , airy day south-west of Paris , Europe did not have it in its own way .	-2.4841
On Saturday , the three main winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the yardstick for the Americans .	-3.4188
They won a brave 2 : 1 victory against the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-pack and returned later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 : 3 in the four-pack after they lost the first two holes .	-4.2549
Just twice in Ryder ’ s Cup history , a team returns from a four point deficit to the singles , even though Haller Furyk ’ s page needs only one undecided to keep the trophy .	-5.4863
After two days of second prize , however , a Sunday account looks like he would go beyond it .	-4.9313
North Korea says that there will be “ no ” unilateral disarmament without confidence .	-1.6889
North Korea ’ s foreign minister said to the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions would deepen its distrust of the United States , and that it would not in any way give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally in such circumstances .	-4.3281
Ri Yong Ho , the global body ’ s annual General Assembly , said that North Korea took ' major goodwill measures ' last year , such as the cessation of nuclear and missile tests , the dismantling of the nuclear test track , and the obligation not to proliferate nuclear weapons and technology .	-5.9302
" However , there is no such answer from the USA , " he said .	-2.6723
“ Without any confidence in the US , there will be no confidence in our national security , and in such circumstances there is no way that we can disarm unilaterally first . ”	-3.4556
While Ri resumed the well-known North Korean complaints about Washington ’ s opposition to a “ gradual ” approach to denuclearization , which would reward North Korea with gradual steps , his explanation seemed significant in that it did not completely reject unilateral denuclearization , as Pyongyang did in the past .	-4.6420
Ri drew attention to a joint declaration by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a first summit between an incumbent US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12 , when Kim committed to working on a " de-nuclearization of the Korean Peninsula , " while Trump pledged guarantees for North Korea 's security .	-5.8911
North Korea has sought a formal end to the Korean War in 1950-53 , but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons .	-3.2152
Washington has also resisted calls for a relaxation of tough international sanctions against North Korea .	-2.6377
The US insists on " denuclarization first " ( first denuclearization ) and increase the pressure through sanctions to achieve its purpose in an obligatory way , and even reject the " Declaration of the War " , Ri said .	-5.9003
" The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a dream for those who are ignorant of us .	-2.8328
But the problem is that continued sanctions exacerbate our distrust . ”	-2.1759
Ri mentioned no plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump , which the US President highlighted at the United Nations earlier this week .	-2.6830
Instead , the Minister raised three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader , Moon Jae-, in the last five months , and added : ' If the party were to denuclearize South Korea and not the US , the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have reached such a deadlock ' .	-6.1746
Still , the tone of Ri ’ s speech was dramatically different from last year when he reported it to the U.N. The General Assembly targeting the US mainland with North Korea ’ s missiles was inevitable after “ Mr. Evil President ” Trump Kim called “ missile man . ”	-4.4548
This year at the United Nations , Trump , who threatened to “ completely destroy ” North Korea last year , praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm , but he also said that a lot of work still needed to be done , and sanctions must remain until North Korea eradicated nuclear disarmament .	-10.2969
On Wednesday , Trump said that he did not have a timeframe for this , saying : ' It does not matter whether it takes two years , three years or five months ' .	-3.5180
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken .	-1.3212
However , in the United States Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo said to the United Nations Security Council on Thursday that ' the enforcement of the Security Council 's sanctions must be vigorously and without flaws until we implement the full , final and verified denuclearization ' .	-5.6623
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to prevent the financing of the Pyongyang nuclear and ballistic missile programmes .	-2.3285
Pompeo met Ri on the fringes of the UN General Assembly and then said that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit .	-3.1149
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year , but his last trip was not good .	-2.3984
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made ; only a few hours later , North Korea condemned him to commit “ transitional claims . ”	-4.0479
North Korea promised at a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile base and also a nuclear complex if the United States takes ' appropriate measures ' .	-4.0519
He said that Kim told him that the ' appropriate measures ' he sought were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore , and steps to normalize relations with Washington .	-3.7074
Harvard students take part in the course to find enough peace and quiet .	-2.8752
With a new course this year at Harvard University , all students get more sleep to fight against the growing macho culture of studying the “ covered nights ” of caffeine .	-4.5838
A scientist has noted that students at a world leading university are often unsuspecting about helping themselves , even when it comes to very simple mechanisms .	-3.9079
Charles Czeisler , professor of sleeping medicine at the Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women 's Hospital , designed the course that he considered to be the first of its kind in the USA .	-3.7622
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the impact of lack of sleep on learning .	-3.0768
In the end , a girl came to me and said : ' Why is it only now , in my final year ?	-4.1027
She said that she had never told anyone about the meaning of sleep – which surprised me , " he said telegraph .	-4.9102
The course , which is being offered for the first time this year , explains to students how good sleep habits promote academic and sporting performance and improve their general well-being .	-4.1218
Paul Barreira , Professor of Psychiatric at Harvard Medical School and Managing Director of the University ’ s Health Service , said that the University decided to introduce the course after finding that students had been sleeping extremely little during the week .	-4.9555
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks .	-2.2828
In one section , there is an image of a sleeping room where students click on coffees , curtains , trainers and books to be informed about the effects of caffeine and light , and how sporting performance is affected by a lack of sleep and the importance of a sleeping time routine .	-5.9319
Another section explains how long sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack , stroke , depression , and cancer .	-3.5178
A map of the campus with interactive symbols encourages participants to think about their daily lives .	-2.1346
We know that it will not change students ' behaviour immediately .	-2.4786
" But we believe that they have a right to this - just as you have a right to know the health impact of the decision to smoke cigarettes , " added Prof. Czeisler .	-3.4069
The culture of pride making a " night " still exists , he said and added that modern technology and increasing pressure on students makes sleep deprivation a growing problem .	-4.9461
Enough sleep of good quality should be a student 's " secret weapon " to fight stress , exhaustion , and fear , he said - also not to accept sleep deprived of the brain in starvation and makes it constantly hungry .	-5.4160
Raymond So , a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology , helped Professor Czeisler design the course after visiting one of his classes last year in Harvard .	-3.6983
He said that the course had opened its eyes and inspired him to push to a campus-wide course .	-2.7782
The next step , he hopes , is to call on all doctorates to complete a similar study program before entering the Competition College .	-4.4267
Prof. Czeisler advised students to set an alarm when they should go into bed and when they should wake up , and to be aware of the harmful effects of the " blue light " emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting , which can take their circular rhythm out of the clock , leading to problems of sleeping .	-7.0548
Livingston 1-0 Rangers : Mengas Goal DesignGerrards	-2.3127
More Rangers ' external problems : After a hit by Dolly Menga , Livingston saw the 1-to-0 defeat for Steven Gerrard 's unique team .	-6.0832
The Ibrox team wanted to record their first victory since 4 : 1-triumph in February in St. Johnstone , but the team of Gary Holt added Gerrard 's second defeat in 18 matches as trainer , leaving his team behind the disappointed Ladbrokes Premiership chief Hearts .	-6.8586
Menga landed a hit seven minutes before the half-time , and an inspirational rangers list did not look as if they could achieve compensation .	-6.0849
While the rangers now fall back to sixth place , Livingston climb to rank three and lie only behind Hibernian because of the Tor difference .	-5.8846
New difficulties for the rangers emerge , as Line Judge Calum Spence had to supply a headwound after being hit by a litter item – apparently thrown out of the foreign fans sector .	-7.1191
Gerrard made eight alternatives to the side that passed Ayr and hit directly into the Betfred Cup semifinals .	-4.3911
Holt , on the other hand , raised the same Livi Elf who made a point last week , and he should have been enthusiastic about how his well-trained team did not give the opponents room for action at any time .	-6.9912
While the rangers dominated the ball ’ s property , Livingston ’ s chances were better realized .	-4.3791
You should have met after only two minutes when Mengas first collector Scott Pittman sent in the direction of Allan McGregors Tor , but the midfield player lost his big change at the gate .	-6.2085
A deep free kick from Keaghan Jacobs then went to Captain Craig Halkett , but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow was able to shoot far in the direction of the rear posts .	-4.9792
The rangers took control , but there seemed to be more hope than betraying in their own game , in the last third .	-3.2990
After the first quarter of an hour , Alfredo Morelos clearly felt that he had earned an elf meter after clashing with Steven Lawless , but Schiedsgeier Steven Thomson did not go to Columbian appeals .	-5.9236
The rangers are only two shots in the first half , but the former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was hardly enough to get away from the peace of Lassana Coulibaly ’ s head leap and the hit of a bitless Ovie Ejaria .	-6.7783
Although Livis may have been the opening striker at the 34th minute , no one can deny that they deserve it for their efforts alone .	-4.5748
Again , the rangers failed to master a standard Jacobs situation .	-2.3985
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher Scott Robinson played the ball that kept the peace and picked Menga out for a simple finish .	-2.7046
Gerrard acted during the break when he swapped Coulibaly against Ryan Kent , and the change immediately affected the game when the winner played to Morelos , but the impressive Kelly ran from his line to block .	-4.6979
But Livingston repeatedly drew guests to play exactly the kind of game they like , with Lithgow and Halkett flying long balls after long balls .	-4.6241
Holt 's team could have extended her leadership in the final phase , but McGregor was well up to refuse Jacobs before heading out of the corner .	-6.5912
The Rangers representative Glenn Middleton had another belated claim to a punishment , because he has devastated himself with Jacobs , but once again he saw Thomson pulled away .	-6.1091
Almanach : The Inventor of the Geiger Counter	-2.0060
And now one page from our Almanach “ Sunday morning ” : September 30 , 1882 , which was more than 136 years ago ... The day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm , called Hans , Geiger in Germany was born .	-3.4942
Geiger developed a method for identifying and measuring radioactivity , an invention that eventually produced the device known as the Geiger counter .	-3.7308
The Geiger counter has since become a mainstay of science , as in the 1950s of the film " Bells of Coronado " , which seemingly unlikely cowpoke scientist Roy Rogers and Dale Evans :	-3.9967
Man : ' What about everything in the world is that ? '	-2.6211
Rogers : “ It is a Geiger counter used to detect radioactive minerals like uranium .	-2.4939
When you set up these headphones , you can actually hear the effects of the atoms released by radioactivity in minerals . ”	-2.8096
Evans : “ Let ’ s say it , now it is cracking ! ”	-4.5334
Hans Geiger died in 1945 , just a few days before his 63rd birthday .	-1.2776
But the invention bearing his name continues to be used .	-2.3390
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “ see ” malignant cells .	-1.5136
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to " see " malignant cells and kill .	-1.8352
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of treatment .	-1.8280
The procedure includes the extraction of immune cells from a patient , modification of them in the laboratory .	-2.4806
You can then see a protein that is common to many cancers and then inject again .	-2.2941
A study vaccine shows promising results for patients with a number of cancers .	-2.8993
A woman treated with the vaccine that contributes to the immune system recognizing rogue cells saw her egg cancer disappear for more than 18 months .	-2.7805
The method is to extract immune cells from a patient , to change them in the laboratory , so that a protein called HER2 becomes “ visible ” that occurs in many cancers , and then inject cells again .	-10.3515
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda , Maryland said : ' Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine ' .	-2.2902
HER2 “ promotes the growth of different types of cancer ” including breast , egg , lung and intestinal cancer , Prof. Berzofsky explained .	-4.0627
A similar approach to taking patients from immune cells and teaching them how to attack cancer cells has worked to treat a kind of leukaemia .	-2.8043

It wasn ’ t Good	-2.2331
Kanye West was executed in the studio during a Saturday Night live broadcast after a bold speech praising the US . President Donald Trump said he would take in 2020 .	-6.1696
After listing his third song of the night , Ghost Town , while wearing a Make America Great Make , he hedged against the Democrats and reaffirmed his support for Trump .	-5.9861
" As often as I speak to a white person , she says , “ How can you like Trump , he is a racist ? ”	-3.0164
Well , if I were concerned about racism , I would have been out of America long ago , " he said .	-3.0047
The Saturday Night-Live Show began with a sketch in which Hollywood star Matt Damon about Brett Kavanaugh ’ s statement before the Senate ’ s Justice Committee on Christine Blasey Ford ’ s accusations that Kavanaugh had sexually involved her .	-5.0510
Although it was not aired , the film material of West 's Geschütz was shared by comedian Chris Rock in the social media .	-4.3661
It is unclear whether Rock tried to mock West with the contribution .	-2.4720
Even West had complained to the audience that he had had a hard time behind the stage because of his head cover .	-5.0839
" They bullied me behind the stage .	-1.9057
They said : ' Do not get out of the hat ' .	-6.6780
You annoyed me !	-1.9642
And then they say that I am in a given place , " he said , according to the Washington examiner .	-1.8801
West continued : " Want to see the sunken place ? " and said that he would " attract my superman curtain , because that means you cannot tell me what I should do ; you want the world to move ?	-6.9384
Trial with love . ”	-1.0795
His comments were issued by the audience at least twice , and the comedians of Saturday Night Live appeared to be postponed , Variety reported , and quoted a person in the words : “ The entire studio was dead . ”	-5.4987

“ But I will not reward anyone ( by buying his music or clothing , or by supporting his art ) , whom I believe he adopts and distributes an ideology that is harmful to my community . ”	-4.3965
It is free .	-0.7164
We also , " we added it .	-4.0601

“ The employee among my employees – whose identity , personal information , personal data , and security were affected as a result of these fraudulent and false claims – was in no way responsible for the fact that this information was read .	-4.4722
This untenable claim is utterly wrong and an absolute lie .	-3.5886
Water ’ s statement quickly led to criticism online , including by the former press secretary of the White House Ari Fleischer .	-2.9551
“ The fact that things are denied is very annoying , ” he wrote .	-3.5810
“ This suggests that it is inappropriate as a congress member .	-2.5092
If someone is accused of having done something , he must not be angry .	-2.9121
They must not be futile .	-2.3956
You must not question the plaintiff 's motives .	-1.9868
They need to be calm and let . ”	-2.7743
Fleischer seemed to compare Water ’ s response to the Democrats ’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh , accused by critics of appearing angry during Thursday ’ s hearing .	-3.4706
Omar Navarro , a Republican candidate who ran alongside the seatless water in the mid-term elections , also expressed his thoughts on Twitter .	-3.8743
“ Big , if true , ” he getweetet .	-3.1015
In their statement , Waters said that their office ' informed the competent authorities and law enforcement authorities of the fraudulent claims .	-3.8525

Review of " Johnny English – You Live Three " – Bad Parody with Rowan Atkinson	-4.5173
It 's a tradition to search any new film with a British tendency for Brexit , and this seems to be applicable to this revival of the Johnny English Action Comedy Spof-Franchise , which began in 2003 with Johnny English and was re-launched in 2011 with " Johnny English Reborn " .	-6.7253
Is the ironic self-sacrifice about the abysmal humanity the new export of the nation ?	-4.6277
For the second time , Johnny English has been licensed for glossy , rubber-, and incompetent Johnny to emulthe of his name , which with in .	-8.3326
He is , of course , the stupid secret agent who , despite his bizarre demands for smoothie glamour , got a little clouseau , a spritzer Mr. Bean , and a jacket from that guy , who contributed a single note to the flagship of the fire brigades at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London .	-7.8028
It is also based on travellers and international , mysterious Atkinson , who once cooperated in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV ads , always lagging behind chaos .	-4.8838
There are one or two beautiful moments in this latest Johnny English-comedy .	-1.9013
I loved Johnny English , who approaches a helicopter in a medieval armament and the main rotor against his helmet .	-4.7033
Atkinson 's talent for body comedy is to be seen , but the humor feels rather weak and strange superfluous , especially as the " serious " movie brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible self-confidently offer comedy as ingredients .	-4.6240
The humor feels like being directed to children rather than adults , and for me the crazy misfortunes of Johnny English are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson 's Mr. Bean silent films .	-3.8962
The everlasting premise now is that Britain is in great difficulty .	-2.2663
A cyber hacker infiltrated the UK ’ s highly secret spies network and exposed the identity of all British agents on the ground , to the horror of the service agent – a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon .	-4.9015
Emma Thompson is doing her best with this quasi-Teresa May figure , but there is not much in the screenplay with which to work .	-3.9390
Their secret service advisers inform them that , as every single active spy has been compromised , it must bring someone out of retirement .	-4.3821
And that means the great Johnny English himself , who is now a schoolmaster in a noble institution , but gives unsurpassed lessons on how to operate as a Undercover agent : some nice gags here , while English offers a school of rock academy on espionage .	-6.5568
English is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency warning and reunified with his former , long-suffering Kumpel Bough , who is played again by Ben Miller .	-7.6480
Bough is now a married man who meets a submarine commander , an outrageous Burschikose role , in which Vicki Pepperdine is not fully in effect .	-5.5620
So the Batman and Robin of Chaos at the Secret Service of their Majesty are back in action and meet on Olga Kurylenko 's beautiful femme Fatale Ophelia Bulletova .	-2.9592
Meanwhile , the Prime Minister is falling into the bann of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain ’ s computer problems : the dark Jason Volta , played by Jake Lacy .	-4.2291
English and Bough begin their odyssey of colourful high-jines : as a waiter , they ignite a French flash restaurant ; they create chaos by smuggling aboard Voltas luxury yacht ; and English triggers pure anarchy when he tries to familiarize himself with a Virtual Reality Headset with the interior of Voltas House .	-15.8234
I am sure all the registers have been drawn for this last sequence , but it is so lovingly and omitted , it is reminiscent of the television for children .	-8.5464
Several .	-2.7885
And , as with other Johnny English-films , I could not help thinking : can the British film industry Rowan Atkinson not give a role that really does justice to his talent ?	-4.3622
Labour denies having developed a plan for Britons for a four-day week that will be paid for five days .	-3.3161
Jeremy Corbyn ’ s Labour Party is considering a radical plan whereby British work only four days a week but are paid for five .	-3.0050
According to reports , the party wants business leaders to pass on the savings made by the AI revolution to workers by freeing them an additional day .	-3.0196
Staff would enjoy a three-day weekend - but still bring the same money home .	-3.0023
Sources said that the idea would " fit " with the party 's economic agenda and plans to skip the country to the benefit of workers .	-4.4323
The trade union congress has approved the changeover to a four-day week as an opportunity for workers to take advantage of the changing economy .	-12.0024
A high-level source from the Labour Party said the Sunday Times : a policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year .	-2.1158
A four-day week is an objective that is in line with the party ’ s approach to restoring economic balance for the benefit of workers and the party ’ s general industrial strategy , but that goal will not be achieved overnight .	-5.0262
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea , as the Green Party promised a four-day working week during its 2017 campaign .	-2.3184
However , the whole Labour Party does not currently support this move .	-3.1030
A Labour spokesman said : ' A four-day week is not party politics and is not intended by the party ' .	-2.9067
Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Party conference last week to realize his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy .	-2.1016
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to regain the power of ' faceless directors ' and ' profit-makers ' in supply companies .	-2.8135
The Shadow Chancellor ’ s plans also mean that the current shareholders of water companies may not recover their entire share , as a Labour Government could do ' deductions ' on account of alleged misconduct .	-6.2548
He also confirmed the plans to appoint workers in company management and create inclusive ownership funds to distribute 10 % of private sector equity to employees receiving annual dividends of up to <unk> 500 .	-5.0426
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk in “ 60 minutes ” about whether FBI investigations against Kavanaugh could change their mind .	-2.2920
The final vote to appeal to the Supreme Court has been postponed by at least one week due to an ongoing FBI inquiry into charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh , and the question is raised as to whether the FBI ’ s investigation could lead Republican senators to give up their support for Kavanaugh .	-6.4335
In a Sunday interview , Scott Pelley , a correspondent of “ 60 minutes , ” asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI ’ s findings could persuade them to change their mind .	-4.0065
Kennedy appeared more open than his colleague from South Carolina .	-2.0181
“ Anyway , ” Kennedy said .	-1.9867
" I said at the beginning of the hearing that I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh .	-1.7438
I called him after that happened after this statement came out , I said : ' Have you done it ? '	-4.0583
He was determined , targeted , unambiguous . '	-2.3991
Graham 's voice , however , seemed set in stone .	-1.9080
" I have an opinion about Brett Kavanaugh and it would need a bomb charge , " he said .	-2.9150
“ Dr. Ford , I do not know what happened , but I know that Brett vehemently contested the charge , ” Graham added with a reference to Christine Blasey Ford .	-4.2001
" None who called it could confirm it .	-3.0231
It was 36 years ago .	-1.2670

" What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it led to poverty reduction ? "	-2.3157
This Saturday , New York will host the Global Citizen Festival , an annual music event with an impressive selection of stars and an equally impressive mission to end poverty in the world .	-3.5295
This year ’ s seventh Global Citizen Festival will bring together tens of thousands of people at Great Lawn in Central Park to experience not only stars like Janet Jackson , Cardi B and Shawn Mendes , but also to draw attention to the true goal of the event : to end extreme poverty by 2030 .	-4.1311
The Global Citizen Festival , which took place in 2012 , is an extension of the Global Poverty Project , an international stakeholder aimed at combating poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it .	-3.5447
In order to get a free entrance ticket for the event , concert visitors had a whole series of tasks or " actions " , such as volunteering , an email to a leader in the world , a telephone call or another meaningful opportunity to increase the goal of combating poverty and increase awareness .	-6.8856
But how successful has Global Citizen been with 12 years left to achieve its goal ?	-3.2928
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert , a real opportunity to convince people to call for action , or simply another case of so-called " clicktivism " - people who , by signing an online petition or an online application , feel as if they were making a real difference ?	-4.5587
Global Citizen says that since 2011 , more than 19 million “ actions ” have been recorded by its supporters , pushing for a variety of different goals .	-3.7150
It is said that these actions have motivated world leaders to make financial and political commitments worth more than $ 37 billion , which will affect the lives of over 2.25 billion people by 2030 .	-2.8371
At the beginning of 2018 , the Group introduced 390 stake and announcements from its actions , of which at least $ 10 billion has already been paid or financed .	-4.0399
The group estimates that the funds made available so far have a direct impact on almost 649 million people around the world .	-3.1352
The Power of Nutrition , a UK based partnership of investors and executive organizations , has committed to “ helping children to develop their full potential . ” The organization has promised to help Rwanda with $ 35 million to end malnutrition in the country after Global Citizens have received more than 4,700 tweets .	-5.1752
“ Supported by the British Government , donors , other state governments , and global citizens like you , we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a day history , ” The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman announced the crowd in a live concert in London in April 2018 .	-3.8905
The group also said that , after more than 5,000 actions in the United Kingdom that drew it off nutrition for mothers and children , the government will achieve funding for the Power of Nutrition project of 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions .	-5.1472
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on their website , “ Why do you think we can end extreme poverty ? ”	-2.6674
Global citizens answered : it will be a long and difficult path - sometimes we will fall and fail .	-2.4083
Like the big civil law and the anti-apartheid movements before us , we will succeed because we are more powerful together .	-9.5340
The stars Janet Jackson , Weeknd , Shawn Mendes , Cardi B and Janelle Monáe will perform at this year 's event in New York , moderated by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman .	-3.8723
US , using the Navy , could build a “ blockade ” to impede Russian energy exports – Home Secretary .	-3.9623
Washington can use his navy “ if necessary ” to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets , including in the Middle East , US Secretary of State Ryan Zinke is quoted from the Washington Examiner .	-8.4173
Zinke pointed out that Russia ’ s commitment to Syria – especially when it invites the legitimate government – was a pretext for exploring new energy markets .	-3.8546
“ I believe that the reason they find themselves in the Middle East is this : they want to negotiate energy , just as they do in Eastern Europe , the southern part of Europe , ” he said .	-3.1663
And , according to the officials , there are ways and means to deal with this .	-3.7668
" The United States has this capacity , with our navy , to ensure that maritime routes are open , and , if necessary , to block , to ensure that its energy does not enter the market , " he said .	-4.5798
Zinke spoke to participants in an event of the Consumer Energy Alliance , a non-profit organization that calls itself the “ voice of energy consumers ” in the US .	-3.1799
He compared Washington ’ s approach to Russia and Iran , and found that they are actually equal .	-2.9790
" The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less to use and replace fuels , " he said , while he called Russia a " one-trick pony " with a fossil-fuel economy .	-10.1558
The opinions come while the Trump administration was on the mission to boost the export of its liquid natural gas to Europe and to replace Russia , which is a much cheaper option for European consumers .	-4.4617
Members of the Trump administration – including US President Donald Trump himself – are therefore trying to push Germany to stop the “ inadequate ” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project that , according to Trump , would turn Berlin into “ prisoners . ”	-3.7668
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11-billion dollar pipeline Nord Stream 2 , which is intended to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres , is a purely economic project .	-2.9310
The Kremlin argues that Washington ’ s opposition to the project is simply driven for economic reasons and an example of unfair competition .	-2.3631
“ I believe we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument to exert pressure , and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers , ” said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak , after a meeting with US energy minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September .	-3.5799
The US stance has provoked a backlash from Germany that has reaffirmed its commitment to the project .	-3.1514
Germany ’ s leading industrial organisation , the Federal Association of German Industries ( BDI ) , has called on the US to withstand EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow .	-4.0074

" I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy , " she said .	-1.8693
Warren did not mouth her criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court candidate , Brett Kavanaugh .	-3.1689
Warren said in a tweet on Friday : ' Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote ' .	-2.4395
However , a poll published on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren ’ s own voters did not believe that it should run in 2020 .	-3.1909

The new asylum policy by the US has reversed a 2014 appeal chamber for immigrants that can apply for asylum to undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence .	-4.7540
The Secretary of Justice of the District of Columbia Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new law ignores decades of national , federal and international law .	-9.6964
The Amicus Curiae states that , according to federal law , all asylum applications must be assessed according to the circumstances of the respective complaint and that such action violates this principle .	-4.8687
Lawyers continued to argue that policies that deny immigrants harm the US economy , because it is more likely that these immigrants will become entrepreneurs and “ do the job . ”	-4.2675
General Prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June not to grant asylum to people fleeing domestic or gang violence .	-4.2045
“ Asylum belongs to those who have to leave their homeland for persecution on the grounds of race , religion , nationality or belonging to a particular social group or on the basis of political opinion , ” said sessions in his Declaration on the Law on 11 June .	-5.2702

US ambassadors accuse China of “ bullying ” with “ propaganda advertising . ”	-2.0458
A week after an official Chinese newspaper posted a four-page ad in an American daily newspaper on the mutual benefit of US trade , the US ambassador to China Beijing suggested using the American press to spread propaganda .	-4.7392
Last Wednesday , US President Donald Trump referred to China Daily ’ s paid allowance in the Des Moine Register – the state with Iowa ’ s most sold newspaper – after accusing China of meddling in the US Congress of November 6 , which China denies .	-5.9229
US officials claim to Reuters that Trump ’ s charge that Beijing tried to interfere in the US election is a new phase in an escalating Washington campaign to exert pressure on China .	-3.1464
While it is normal for foreign countries to use ads to promote trade , Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an escalating trade war , with several rounds of tariffs on imports .	-3.7525
In an early phase of trade war , China ’ s retaliation tariffs should be expected to hit exporters in US states like Iowa , where many supporters of Trump ’ s Republican Party live .	-3.7827
Terry Branstad , US ambassador to China , and former Yugoslav Governor of Iowa , a major exporter of agricultural products to China , said Beijing has violated American workers , farmers , and businesses .	-3.4813
China , in an opinion article in the Des Moine Register on Sunday , Branstad wrote , “ now actively engages in this harassment with propaganda in our own free press .	-5.0248
“ By spreading propaganda as a paid ad in the Des Moine register , China ’ s government exploits its America ’ s valued tradition of freedom of expression and press freedom , ” Branstad wrote .	-3.5247
" By contrast , at the Beijing Street newspaper , you will find only limited dissenting voices , and you will not see any real contradiction of the different opinions that the Chinese people could have about China ’ s worrying economic development , given that the media are firmly under the control of the Chinese Communist Party , ” he wrote .	-6.8139
He added that " one of China 's most prominent newspapers contradicted the offer to publish " even though he did not say what newspaper .	-2.8278
The Republicans engulf the Kavanaugh debacle voters before the midterm elections , warn analysts .	-3.5836
Many of the top Republicans defended Brett Kavanaugh , a nominee to the Supreme Court , even though he was accused of sexual assaults , and the analysts warn that they will see a backlash in the upcoming election , particularly of women .	-4.8633
The emotions were high , and most Republicans have already predicted that they would vote for him .	-9.2472
These things cannot be traced back , said Grant Reeher , a political scientist professor at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University , on Saturday in an article published by The Hill .	-4.0895
Reeher said he doubts that support at the last minute of Jeff Flake ( Republican MP for Arizona State ) for FBI investigations is enough to reconcile angry voters .	-4.2541
“ Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow , nor in November , ” said Karine Jean-Pierre , senior consultant , and national spokesperson for the progressive MoveOn group on Friday , as a Washington newspaper reported .	-3.5435
On Friday morning , the protesters sung : “ November comes ! , ” while demonstrating in the Senate ’ s corridor , when the Republicans who control the Justice Committee decided to nominate Kavanaugh with Kavanaugh , despite the statement by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford , Mic reports .	-5.6279
“ Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be immeasurable , ” said Stu Rothenberg , an impartial political analyst , journalists .	-1.9667
“ People say that it is quite far advanced , that is true .	-3.1456
But the number could be higher , especially among suburbs and younger voters , 18-29-year-olds , who may not suffer the president , but often do not vote . ”	-4.0586
Even before Ford ’ s public statement , in which she reproduced her allegations of sexual violence against the Supreme Court candidate , analysts noted that a backlash could follow if Republicans pushed the candifor . the . . the .	-5.2466
“ This has become a shambles for the GOP , ” said Michael Steele , former Chairman of the Republican National Committee , early last week , according to NBC News .	-3.7837
“ It ’ s not just about the election of the committee or the final election , or whether Kavanaugh is put on the substitute bank , it ’ s about how the Republicans have handled this and how they have treated it , ” Guy Cecil , the director of priorities in the United States , said a group that helps to elect the Democrats , the news channel .	-8.2447
Americans , however , are divided by what Ford and Kavanaugh say .	-2.7202
A new YouGov survey shows that 41 % of respondents Ford ’ s testimony was definitively or probably believed , while 35 % said that they believed definitely or probably Kavanaugh .	-4.8239
Moreover , 38 percent said that they thought Kavanaugh was likely or definitely lied during his statement , while only 30 percent said the same about Ford .	-3.7292
On the initiative of Flake , the FBI is currently examining Ford ’ s allegations and at least one other prosecutor , Deborah Ramirez , reported The Guardian .	-3.9164
Ford told the Senate ’ s Justice Committee last week under oath that Kavanaugh had attacked them at the age of 17 .	-4.0855

According to the London Gazette , Colonel Vann conducted his battalion in September 1918 via the Saint-Quentin channel “ with very dense fog and under heavy shelter and machine guns . ”	-4.8443
Later , he stumbled to the shooting line , leading the line forward with the " biggest gallery " , before moving a field pistol one-handed and pushing the withdrawal three times .	-8.1977
Colonel Vann was killed by a German shelter on October 4 , 1918 – just under a month before the end of the war .	-3.4147
Michael Vann , 72 , said the actions of his grandfather were " something I know I could never do justice to , something that inspires humility . "	-3.2253
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid down a crane after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band .	-3.5956
Michael Vann said he felt “ honoured to participate in the parade , ” and added : “ The bravery of a real hero is reflected in the support he receives from many people . ”	-3.8550
MMA fans stayed awake all night to see Bellator 206 , instead they got Peppa Pig .	-2.6130
Imagine you stayed awake all night to watch the entire Bellator 206 event just to not see the main event .	-3.5066
There were 13 fights on the San Jose plan , including six main fights , and was shown live on Channel 5 in the UK at night .	-4.3214
At 6 o 'clock in the morning , exactly when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to compete with each other , the British spectators could have a fascinating view of how the reporting was changed to Peppa Pig .	-7.3851

A fan on Twitter described changing to a child 's cartoon as " some sick joke " .	-2.9968
" It is a government arrangement that this content was not suitable at 6 a.m. , so they had to switch to children 's programs , " said Dave Schwartz , Bellator Senior Vice President of Marketing and Communication when he was asked for the transmission .	-5.2541
'Peppa the pig , ' yes ' .	-1.1965
Bellator ’ s managing director Scott Coker said that they will work on planning in the future to include British viewers .	-3.9670
" When I think about the repeat , we will somehow get it done , " Cocker said .	-6.1890
" But it is 6 a.m. on a Sunday there and we will only be able to fix it on the Sunday of our time , Monday of their time .	-3.8935
But we are working on it .	-1.4100
Believe me when it was switched on , a lot was written and the content was not friendly .	-3.2084
We tried to repair it , we thought it was a technical error .	-1.9080
But that was not , it was a government problem .	-1.7014
I can promise you that it will not happen next time .	-1.5410
We will reduce it to five , rather than six , fights - as we normally do - and we have tried to surpass the fans and have simply gone crazy .	-4.8222

Desert Island Discs : Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality .	-2.2074
The Olympic diver Tom Daley says that he grew up with the feeling of being inferior to everyone because of his sexuality - but that gave him the motivation to be a success .	-4.7964
The 24-year-old said that he was first aware at secondary school that “ not everyone is like me . ”	-3.8910
In the first edition of Desert Island Discs at Radio 4 presented by Lauren Laverne , he said that he publicly talked about the rights of homosexuals to give other “ hope . ”	-4.0929
He also said that a victory in the Olympic Games after the birth of his first child would have become less important to him .	-4.1047
The regular presenter of the long-running show Kristy Young has been released for several months due to illness .	-3.6460
Daley entered Laverne ’ s first program , saying that he felt “ less worth ” than the others , because “ society did not accept standing on men and women . ”	-5.5302
He said , “ Until today , these feelings of little value and otherness have given me the strength and strength that I needed in order to be successful . ” .	-4.5877
He wanted to prove that he was “ something , ” he said , in order not to disappoint anyone when he leads from his sexual orientation .	-3.9204
The two-time bronze medal winner has become a top-class LGBT activist and took advantage of his presence at this year ’ s Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality .	-3.9162
He said he was speaking because he was lucky enough to live openly and without consequences , and because he wanted to give others ' hope ' .	-3.9396
The triple world champion said that he fell in love with a man , the US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black , whom he met in 2013 , what he was very surprised about .	-4.2352
Daley married the Oscar winner , who was 20 years older than he , last year , but the age difference was never a problem .	-4.3821
“ If so much is done at such a young age , ” he took part in the Olympic Games for the first time , three years later , his father died of cancer – be he hard to find someone at the same age who experienced similar high and lows .	-5.5620
The couple was in June parents of a son named Robert Ray Black Daley , and Daley said his " entire perspective " has changed .	-3.6159
“ Last year , everything for me was about winning a gold medal , ” he said .	-2.1482
“ But you know what , more important than Olympic gold .	-1.9866
My gold medal is Robbie . ”	-0.6148
His son bears the name of his father , Robert , who died in 2011 at just 40 years after a diagnosis of cancer .	-2.5802
Daley said that his father did not accept that he would die , and one of the last things he asked was whether they had their tickets for London 2012 - because he wanted to be in the first row .	-3.1366
“ I could not tell him : <unk> You won ’ t experience sitting in the first row , Dad <unk> , ” he said .	-3.4014

The Weak Mickelson sat on the Bank ’ s Ryder Cup Saturday	-2.2618
American Phil Mickelson will record a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game , but he must dramatically improve his shape so that it does not become a sad milestone .	-4.2608
Mickelson , who played for the 12th time at the event that takes place every two years , was put on the bank by Captain Jim Furyk for the Fourballs and Foursomes on Saturday .	-3.8109
Instead of being at the center of what is happening , as is often the case for the US , the fivefold Major winner split his day between contenders and rounds of practice on the golf course , hoping to overcome his depth .	-6.2253
Even at the peak of his career , the 48-year-old is never the most straightforward driver and is not suitable for the tight Le Golf National Square , where the long Rough regularly punishes failures .	-4.0943
And as if the seat were not already challenging enough , Mickelson met in the ninth match on Sunday at the British Open Champion Francesco Molinari , who won all four matches this week together with Neuling Tommy Fleetwood .	-5.0580
If the Americans lag four points behind when the 12 games start and have a hot start , Mickelsons Match could be absolutely crucial .	-5.0628
Furyk expressed his trust in his husband ; that also remained to him .	-4.0849
" He fully understood the role he had today , gave me a plap on my back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow , " said Furyk .	-3.9818
" He has a lot of confidence .	-1.8491
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has done so much in the past for these teams , and this week .	-1.7412
I probably did not think he is playing two games .	-2.5729
I had hoped for more , but it did happen and that is the way we thought we had to tackle it .	-4.9890
He wants to be out there , just like everyone else .	-1.7579
So far Nick Faldo holds the record of most played matches at the Ryder Cup , which will break Mickelson on Sunday .	-4.8191
This could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that never fully matched the heights of its individual record .	-4.3029
Mickelson has won 18 times , lost 20 times and played seven times a tie .	-3.7815
" He is funny , he is sarcastic , funny , he loves to entertain people , and he is a great guy he can have in the team room , " he explained .	-3.8563
I think the younger players had fun this week to compete with him , that was nice to see . ”	-4.1056
It offers much more than just the game . ”	-1.1788
The European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great lead can disappear soon .	-2.6628
Thomas Bjorn , the European captain , knows from experience that a great lead in the individual games of the last day can quickly become an uncomfortable thrust .	-5.0108
The Dane debuted in 1997 in the game in Valderrama , where a team trained by Seve Ballesteros had a lead of five points against the Americans , but got only slightly above the target line and won with a thin lead from 14 <unk> to 13 <unk> .	-6.2333
" It is remembered that one was in the lead in Valderrama ; we had a big lead in Brookline where we lost , and in Valderrama we won , but only barely , " said Bjorn , after watching the Class of 2018 , now leading 10-6 in the Le Golf National , Friday , and yesterday in a 5-3 victory .	-5.7653
The story will show me and everyone in this team that it is not over yet .	-2.4852
You will have landed absolutely tomorrow .	-2.9145
Get out and do the right things .	-1.9078
It is only over when the points are displayed on the board .	-3.6528
Our goal is to win this Cup , and we focus on that .	-2.6043
I have always said that I believe in the 12 players in our team , but we are dealing with a strong opponent , the best players in the world . ”	-2.9336
Added to Björn how its players played on a hard golf course : " I 'd never be premature .	-8.6623
Tomorrow is also another day .	-1.4091
Tomorrow are the personal performances , and that is another thing .	-3.4536
It ’ s great to be with a partner out there when things go well , but if you ’ re out there alone , your skills are tested to the full .	-6.3117
This is the message you have to convey to the players : to get the best out of you tomorrow .	-4.5724
Now you are transferring to your partner and he must do just as you are doing . ”	-5.1786
Unlike Björn , the opponent Jim Furyk will strive for his players to do better separately than they do as partners , except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas , who scored three out of four .	-4.8237
Furyk himself has already experienced such a spectacular turn on the final day , when he was part of the Brookline winner team , now he is a loser after the European team made the “ miracle of Medinah ” .	-6.9047
" I remember every damned word , " he said on the question of how Ben Crenshaw , the captain of 1999 , had assembled his players on the way over the last day .	-3.9014
We have 12 important games tomorrow , but you want to get started as soon as possible in Brookline , Medinah .	-4.2697
Once a dynamic has evolved , the high pressure on the middle matches is exerted .	-6.4485
We have built our layout accordingly and brought the guys out as we felt , you know we are trying to create something special tomorrow . ”	-5.6524
Thomas , along with Paul Casey , Justin Rose , Jon Rahm , Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter , was to lead the other European on top rankings , the counter-strike against Rory McIlroy .	-4.7893
I put this group of guys in this order because I think it covers the whole way , " said Bjorn about his individual selection .	-3.9047
Replacing the schedule for Germany ’ s New War Ship	-2.0183
The German Navy ’ s latest fregatte should have been deployed as early as 2014 to replace years of Cold War warships , but it will now take at least until next year , according to reports from flawed systems and escalating costs .	-5.8827
The commissioning of the Rhineland-Palatinate , the chief ship of the Baden-Württemberg class , has now been postponed to the first half of 2019 , according to the newspaper “ Die Zeit ” , invoking a military spokesman .	-4.6831
The navy should have started the ships in 2014 , but serious problems after the first delivery burdened the ambitious project .	-3.7949
The four Navy Fregatten of the Baden-Württemberg class ordered in 2007 will replace the older Bremen class ships .	-3.2416
It is assumed that they have a powerful cannon , a series of anti-aircraft and naval missiles , as well as some stealth technologies , such as reduced radar , infrared , and acoustic signatures .	-4.7775
Another important advantage is longer maintenance intervals : the newest frigates should be used for up to two years without getting to the home port .	-5.2224
But the ultra-modern warships that are supposed to enable Germany to prop power overseas will be obsolete by constant delays when they are finally put in service , as the weekly newspaper “ Time ” points out .	-6.3146
The unfortunate F125 fregate caused headlines last year , when the German Marine officially refused to take the ship into operation and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg .	-5.0867
This was the first time that the navy returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery .	-3.3921
Little was known about the reasons for the return of the ships ; German media mentioned a number of critical “ software and hardware effects ” that would make the warship useless in combat tactics .	-5.2071
Software shortcomings were particularly important because the Baden-Württemberg class ships are served by a crew of about 120 seafarers - only half of the crew on older Bremen-class frigates .	-6.1636
It was also found that the ship had a significant overweight , which would limit its performance and complicate future upgrades for the navy .	-5.5231
It is assumed that the 7.000 tonnes of the Rhineland-Palatinate are twice as difficult as ships of the same class used by the Germans during World War II .	-5.0980
In addition to flawed hardware , the price sign of the entire project - including the training of the crew - is also being discussed .	-4.7083
Instead of the EUR 2.2 billion initially proposed , the cost now seems to have reached the dwindling amount of EUR 3.1 billion ( roughly $ 3.6 billion ) .	-4.4538
In the light of recent warnings that Germany ’ s naval power is diminishing , the problems with the newest regattas are particularly significant .	-5.8325
Earlier this year , Hans-Peter Bartels , chairman of the German Parliament ’ s Defence Committee , admitted that the war fleet was indeed “ the ships that were capable of deploying ” .	-4.8144
The official said that the problem grew avalanche over time , as old ships were put out of service without any replacement .	-5.3638
He complained that none of the Baden-Württemberg Fregatten were provided by the navy .	-3.3075
The National Trust is the secret life of bats .	-1.6207
New research on a property in the Highlands of Scotland is trying to find out how bats are using the landscape for food searching .	-10.1203
It is hoped that this will provide new insights into the behavior of the unique flying mammals , which can provide guidance for future measures to protect animals .	-5.3653
The study by scientists of the National Trust for Scotland will follow common and soprano ppil lines as well as brown borehole and permanent bats in the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross .	-5.3948
Special recording equipment is placed at the main points of the accommodation in order to monitor bats during the entire season .	-4.8207
NHS employees and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys with handdetectors .	-2.3277
An expert sound analysis of all recordings determines the frequency of the bat calls and arranges the calls to the species .	-10.3564
The habitat card produced and the accompanying report should provide a detailed overview of the behaviour .	-4.8971
Rob Dewar , National Trust for Scotland NTS environmental advisor , hopes to find out which areas of the habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by the species .	-3.9670
This information will help to determine the advantages of habitat management , such as meadows and how best to preserve forests for bats and other related species .	-4.5663
There has been a sharp decline in bat populations in Scotland and the UK as a whole in the last hundred years .	-4.8198
They are threatened by construction that affects their sleeping places and the loss of habitat .	-3.4289
Wind and lighting may also pose a risk , as well as fly seiners and some chemical treatments of construction materials .	-4.9350
bats are not blind in fact .	-1.5942
In the evening hunting activities , the ears are more useful than the eyes .	-5.1076
They use a sophisticated Echo placement technique to locate errors and obstacles in their flight path .	-6.4170
The NTS , which is responsible for maintaining more than 270 historical buildings , 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country , takes bats very seriously .	-3.4154
There are ten trained experts who conduct regular surveys , inspect sleeping places , and sometimes rescue them .	-3.5795
The organization has even set up Scotland ’ s first and only dedicated Fledermaus Reserve in Dumfries and Galloway , which houses eight of the ten Scottish Fledermausartes .	-5.4606
According to David Thompson , the property is an ideal habitat for them :	-1.9940
“ Here in Threave we have a great area for bats . ”	-2.8130
“ We have the old buildings , many old trees and all the good habitat .	-2.4208
But there is still much unknown about bats and the work we do here and on other land helps us to understand better what they need to live . ”	-3.0854
He stresses that it is important to check whether bats are there before maintenance work in buildings , according to which it is possible that in the unintended destruction of a single sleeping place from mothers to 400 females and boys , an entire local population may be wiped out .	-7.4002
bats are protected ; it is forbidden to kill , harass or disrupt them and to destroy their sleeping places .	-2.8891
Elisabeth Ferrell , Scottish member of the Bat Conservation Trust , has encouraged the public to help .	-1.4980
She said : “ We still have much to learn about our bats , and for many of our species we simply do not know how their populations are . ”	-8.2920
Ronaldo denies rape claims when lawyers sue German magazine .	-2.6284
Cristiano Ronaldo has denounced rape claims against him as " fake news " and claims that people " want to promote themselves " by using his name .	-2.9741
His lawyers will sue the German news magazine “ Der Spiegel ” , which published the allegations .	-2.0101
The stormer from Portugal and Juventus was accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in 2009 in a hotel room in Las Vegas .	-3.1357
He then paid $ 375,000 to keep quiet about the incident , The mirror reported on Friday .	-3.1037
Hours after the claims were reported , Ronaldo , 33 in an Instagram live video to his 142 million followers rejected the reports as “ fake news . ”	-4.2315
No , no , no , no , no .	-0.7782
What they say today , fake news , ” said the five-time Ballon D 'Or winner in the camera .	-2.9814
" You want to apply for yourself by using my name .	-1.3844
“ That is normal .	-1.5068
They want to draw attention to themselves when they say my name , but it is part of the job .	-2.3965
I ’ m a happy person , and everything is good , ” added smiling .	-2.9166
Ronaldo ’ s lawyers are making an appeal against the magazine “ Der Spiegel ” for allegations ; according to Reuters , you spoke of “ inadmissible reporting on suspicions in the field of privacy . ”	-4.4170
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player would demand compensation for “ intangible damage equal to the severity of the injury , which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years ” .	-5.0902
The alleged incident is due to take place in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in June 2009 .	-3.0956
According to documents submitted to the District Court of Clark County in the U.S. state of Nevada , Ronaldo and Mayorga retired to the player ’ s room in a nightclub , where he raped them .	-5.9204
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo knew after the alleged incident , saying that he was “ at 99 % ” a “ good guy ” left by “ one percent . ”	-4.8205
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex , but it was agreed .	-2.2369
Mayorga also claims that she has gone to the police and have taken photos of her injuries in a hospital , but later agreed extrajudicial because she had ' fear of retaliation ' and was worried about being ' publicly humiliated ' .	-5.1985
The 34-year-old says that she is now trying to declare the agreement invalid because it is still traumatized by the alleged incident .	-3.5709
Ronaldo was on the verge of moving to Real Madrid by Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack , and moved this summer with a 100 million euro deal to the Italian giant Juve .	-5.3792
Brexit : Britain would increasingly regret losing car manufacturers	-2.5909
“ The UK would regret it in time for Brexit to lose its position as the world ’ s leading car manufacturer after Brexit , ” Economist Greg Clark said .	-4.9272
He added that it is ' worrying ' that Toyota UK told the BBC that they would temporarily stop production at their plant in Burnaston , near Derby , if Great Britain left the EU without a deal .	-3.7212
“ We need an agreement , ” Clark said .	-1.3784
The Japanese automobile manufacturer said that the effects of delays at the borders in the case of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs .	-4.4087
The factory in Burnaston , which manufactures Auris and Avensis for Toyota , produced nearly 150,000 cars last year , 90 % of which were exported to the rest of the European Union .	-2.7500
“ If Britain leaves the EU at the end of March without an agreement , I think it will be stopping production in our plant , ” said Marvin Cooke , CEO of Toyota in Burnaston .	-4.4843
Other British car manufacturers have expressed fears that the EU will leave without agreement on the modalities of cross-border trade , including Honda , BMW , and Jaguar Land Rover .	-3.0384
BMW , for example , has already announced that he will close his work in Oxford after Brexit for one month .	-2.2882
The main concerns relate to what automotive manufacturers say about the risks of the supply chain in the event of a ' no deal Brexit ' .	-3.8287
Toyota 's production facilities are based on production geared towards requirements , i.e. the parts are delivered every 37 minutes by UK and EU suppliers for special products .	-11.9414
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without an agreement , there may be delays on the border , which , according to industry indications , can lead to supply shortages and partial shortages .	-3.9494
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day of the stock in his Derbyshire plant , the company said , and so production would be stopped .	-3.3697
Mr Clark said that Theresa May ’ s Chequers plan for future relations with the EU was ‘ precisely calibrated to avoid border controls ’ .	-3.3112
We need to have a deal , we want the best deal that not only allows us to succeed today , we also want to seize this opportunity , ” he said the BBC Radio 4 programme today .	-4.5553
“ The reference not only to Toyota but also to other manufacturers is that we must be able to continue with what has become a very successful series of supply chains . ”	-4.0124
Toyota made no indications as to how long the production could last , but warned that the increase in costs could , in the long run , lead to the competitiveness of the plant and , ultimately , lost .	-7.1089
Peter Tsouvallaris , trade union representatives , and employed in Burnaston for 24 years , said that union members are increasingly worried : “ Once they have dismantled , jobs are lost forever . ”	-5.0492

Trump ’ s Rosenstein Meeting Might Again , says the White House	-2.6680
Donald Trump ’ s top-class meeting with Deputy Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein could be “ postponed another week , ” as the fight for the Supreme Chancellor Brett Kavanaugh continues , the White House was pronounced on Sunday .	-4.4016
Rosenstein supervises the work of special adviser Robert Mueller , who examines Russian interventions in elections , the links between Trump and Russia , and the presidential impediment of justice .	-3.9816
Whether or not Trump will fire the Deputy Prosecutor , and thus jeopardize Müller ’ s independence , Washington has provided a lot of gossip for months .	-4.8880
Earlier this month , the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wearing a cable in order to record talks with Trump and make it possible to remove the president from the 25th constitutional addition .	-4.0991
Rosenstein rejected an opinion .	-1.5959
But last Monday , he went to the White House , while reports had the effect that he was on the brink of resignation .	-4.8452
Instead , a meeting with Trump , then at the United Nations in New York , was announced for Thursday .	-2.0536
Trump said he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein , but then the session was delayed to avoid a clash with the hearing of the Senate ’ s Justice Committee in which Kavanaugh and one of the women , Dr. Christine Blasey Ford , accused him of sexual misconduct .	-3.5713
On Friday , Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of the claims against Kavanaugh , and further delayed a full Senate vote .	-3.1402
Donald Trump ’ s press speaker Sarah Sanders was on Fox News on Sunday .	-2.7996
After the Rosenstein meeting asked , she said : " A date has not yet been set , it could be this week , I could see that I am postponing another week , given all the other things that are going on with the Supreme Court .	-5.0347
But we will see and I keep the press always up to date . '	-2.5955
Some reporters would challenge this claim : Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September .	-2.0549
The guest Chris Wallace asked why .	-0.7510
Sanders said that the lack of briefings did not result from a reluctance to television reporters who behave like self-actors , but also said : ' I will not be against being in the gallery ' .	-5.3800
She then proposed that direct contact between Trump and the press should increase .	-2.1508
" The President performs more questions and answers than any President before him , " she said and added , without giving evidence : " We have looked at these figures . "	-4.9033
Briefings are still going to take place , Sanders said , but if the press had the chance to ask the President of the United States directly , it is infinitely better than talking to her .	-4.7794
We are trying to do a lot of it , and you have seen how we have done it in recent weeks , and it will replace a press debate when you can talk to the President of the United States himself . ”	-4.2750
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends public meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries .	-2.1909
Press conferences with one person are rare .	-1.1748
In New York , the President may have shown why this week , by making a free-running and sometimes bizarre appearance before assembled reporters .	-4.2560

But the British Government has also intensified its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario .	-1.9453
I know this must be a very worrying time for you all .	-2.1577
That is why I wanted to repeat now how much I would value the contribution of each staff , regardless of their nationality .	-3.0951

Jack Ross : “ My ultimate goal is to manage Scotland . ”	-1.0088
Jack Ross , currently the manager of Sunderland , says that his “ ultimate goal ” is to eventually become a manager of Scotland .	-3.6186
The Scot , 42 , has the challenge of bringing the North-East Club up again , the club currently ranks third in the League One and has three points behind the top .	-5.8655
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after he led St Mirren back to the Scottish first league .	-3.3396
“ I wanted to take on my country as a player . ”	-2.6057
I got a B-cap and that was 's , " said Ross to BBC Scotland 's Sportsound .	-2.9270
" But I have often watched Scotland in Hampden with my father as a child , and it is always something that brought me back .	-2.2828
" This opportunity would only come if I am successful in club management " .	-4.4634
Before Ross were Dick Advocaat , David Moyes , Sam Allardyce , Martin O 'Neill , Roy Keane , Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio Manager from Sunderland .	-1.7624
The former manager of Alloa Athletic said he was not afraid to enter the footsteps of these established managers in such a big club , and he had already rejected Barnsley and Ipswich Town offers .	-5.8794
" The success for me is currently defined by the question " Can I bring this club back to Premier League ? "	-3.1405
With its structure and facilities , this club is without doubt part of Premier League , ” he said .	-2.8200
" Building it there is not an easy task , but I would probably only consider myself successful if I can bring it back . "	-5.0411
Ross is only three years in his management career , after a time as co-coach at Dumbarton and a 15-month spell for Hearts ' coaching staff .	-2.7323
He then helped Alloa to recover from the release to the third class , and helped St. Mirren from the edge of the release in the following season to the master title .	-5.1110
Ross also says that during his player-career at Clyde , Hartlepool , Falkirk , St Mirren and Hamilton Academical , he never felt as comfortable as now .	-4.0543
" It was probably a real crossroads , " he remembered when he took over the leadership of Alloa .	-2.5439
" I really thought that the position as manager is the right one for me , more than that of a player .	-3.1671
This may sound strange because I have played well , achieved a reasonable income and also experienced some highlights .	-5.3527

The summer heat wave has increased revenue for the beleaguered British pubs , but has increased the pressure on the restaurant chains .	-4.2842
Pub and bar groups experienced a turnover plus of 2.7 percent in July - revenues in restaurants but fell 4.8 percent , according to the figures .	-5.0482
Peter Martin , the CGA consulting company , which compiled the figures , said : " Continued sunshine and England for longer than expected participation in the World Cup resulted in July following a similar pattern as in June , when the Pub search rose by 2.8 % , only that the restaurants were even more affected .	-6.4121
The fall in the catering business by 1.8 % in June has only intensified in July .	-3.5133
Beverage dominated pubs and bars were by far the strongest , with Like-for-Like numbers rising more than the restaurants fell .	-11.0524
The pubs dominated by food also suffered under the sun , though not as dramatic as the restaurant operators .	-3.3328
It seems that people only wanted to have a drink .	-3.3176
Sales for drinks increased by 6.6 % this month in the pubs and bars managed , while eating declined by 3 % . "	-3.9477
Paul Newman , an RSM analyst for leisure and catering , said : " These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April .	-3.5619
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the Out-house market .	-11.2421
It is not surprising that the restaurant groups are still under pressure , although a 4.8 % decline in sales compared with the previous year will be particularly painful , alongside continuing cost pressure .	-4.7650
The long hot summer could not have been worse for food operators , and the time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will ensure the much-needed break .	-4.2917

Milk pump advertising , comparing mothers to cows , led to controversial online discussions .	-3.0000
A dairy pump company has provoked controversial online discussions due to an ad that compares breastfeeding mothers to melk-cows .	-4.5946
On the occasion of the launch of the supposedly " first noiseless and portable milk pump worldwide " , the consumer tech company Elvie published an ironic advertising inspired by music videos to show which freedoms mothers are offered with this new pump .	-4.1070
Four real mothers dance in a hay in the midst of cows to a number with the following song : " Yes , I am melking , but you see no cock " and " If you haven 't noticed that there are no euter , it 's my breasts . "	-5.8976
The slogan goes on : " Pump off , pump off , I feed the babies , pump off , pump off , pump , I melke my ladies " .	-3.4659
However , the ad published on the Facebook page of the company has caused controversy online .	-3.6387
With 77,000 calls and hundreds of comments , the video has received mixed responses from viewers , many of whom say that it illuminates the " horrors " of the dairy industry .	-3.4099
" It 's a very bad decision to advertise with cows for this product . "	-1.9208
Like us , they must become pregnant and give to produce milk , except that their babies are taken away within a few days after birth , " one person wrote .	-3.6991
The Elvie milk pump fits unobtrusively into a Still-H ( Elvie / Mother ) .	-4.3401
Another commented : " Understandably traumatic for mother and baby .	-1.7983
But why should we not advertise with them for a milk pump for mothers who can keep their babies ?	-2.7947
Somebody else added : ' Such an outdoor acquisition ' .	-3.4338
Others defended advertising , including a woman who confessed that she found the song " urcomic " .	-3.0535
I think that is a great idea .	-1.2862
I would have received one if I had allowed it .	-3.8370
With the pump I felt like a cow .	-3.5741
The ad is a bit crazy , but I took it as what it was .	-2.0109
This is a brilliant product , " wrote a person .	-1.7291
Another commented : " This is a funny advertising for mothers who pump ( often in their jobs or toilets ) and feel like " cows " .	-2.9792
This is not advertising that praises or judges the dairy industry ' .	-3.0039
At the end of the video , the group of women reveals that they all danced with the decent pumps in their BHs .	-2.7891
The campaign 's concept is based on the recognition that many women who pump milk say that they feel like cows .	-7.5343
The Elvie Pump , however , is completely silent , has no wires or hoses , and fits needlessly into a style bra , giving women the freedom to move , keep their babies , and even go out of the pump .	-6.4624
Ana Balarin , Partner and ECD commented at Mother : " The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that a courageous and provocative market launch deserves .	-3.2226
By drawing a parallel between the expression of women and dairy cows , we wanted to focus on breast pumps and all its challenges , while demonstrating in an entertaining and comparable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring .	-3.4304

Hundreds of migrant children moved quietly to a camp on the Texas border .	-3.0810
The number of children detained with migration background rose , although monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged , partly because the Trump administration ’ s tough rhetoric and policies made it more difficult to find sponsors for children .	-4.4346
Traditionally , most sponsors themselves have been undocumented immigrants and fear being expelled if they are committed to a child .	-3.5819
The risk increased in June , when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to fingerprints , and that the data would be passed on to immigration authorities .	-3.0861
Last week , Matthew Albence , a senior official within the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Authority , told the Congress that the Agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to support unaccompanied minors .	-3.1659
The Agency later confirmed that 70 % of those arrested had no previous criminal records .	-2.8303
" Almost 80 % of people who are either sponsors or household members of sponsors are illegal here in the country and a large proportion of them are criminal aliens .	-3.5537
" We continue to follow these people " , Albence said .	-3.6907
In an effort to deal more quickly with children 's requests , officials introduced new rules requiring some of them to come to trial within a month of detention , and not 60 days after what was the previous standard , according to the accommodation staff .	-6.7073
Many will appear not personally , but via a video telephone conference to appeal for legal status in an immigration magistrate .	-4.3395
Those who do not qualify for discharge are quickly deferred .	-3.0136
The longer children remain imprisoned , the more likely they are fearful or depressed , leading to violent outbreaks or escape attempts .	-3.0802
Advocates have said that these concerns are being increased in a larger institution , such as Tornillo , where signs that a child is suffering are more likely to be overlooked because of their size .	-5.4326
They added that moving children to the Zeltstadt without having enough time to emotionally prepare them or leave friends could worsen a trauma with which many are already struggling .	-3.8798
Syria calls on US , French , and Turkish “ occupying forces ” to withdraw immediately .	-1.8120
Foreign Secretary Walid al-Moualem called upon Syrian refugees to return home before the UN General Assembly , even though the war in the country has been going on for eight years .	-3.6015
Moualem , who is also Deputy Prime Minister , said that , on the pretext of combating terrorism , foreign forces are illegal on Syrian soil , and ‘ we will deal with it accordingly ’ .	-4.4342
“ You must immediately withdraw unconditionally , ” he said to the Assembly .	-2.2937
Moualem claimed sharply that the “ war on terror ” in Syria was almost over .	-4.4358
He said that Damascus will continue to fight “ this holy battle until we have freed all Syrian territories ” from both terrorist groups and “ any illegal foreign presence forces . ”	-2.9335
The US has around 2,000 troops in Syria ; mainly train and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad .	-3.2121
France has deployed more than 1,000 soil soldiers in the war-torn country .	-2.3441
On the refugees ’ question , Moualem said that the conditions for returning were right , and he accused “ some Western countries of irrational fears ” that led refugees to stay away .	-4.1287
“ We called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate the return , ” Moualem said .	-2.7688
“ You politicize a purely humanitarian issue . ”	-2.0779
The US and the European Union drew attention to the fact that there could only be reconstruction aid to Syria when there was a political agreement between Assad and the opposition about an end to the war .	-4.0861
UN diplomats said that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold Idlib created the possibility of advancing political talks .	-3.3972
The Russian-Turkish deal prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian troops on the province where three million people live .	-2.8026
Moualem stressed , however , that the agreement “ set clear deadlines , ” which hopes that military action will be directed against jihadists , including fighters from the Nusra Front associated with al-Qaeda , “ extinguished . ”	-5.8905
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections .	-3.4394
Moualem called conditions for the Syrian Government to participate in the committee : he said that the committee ’ s work should be limited to “ reviewing the articles in the current constitution , ” and warned against interference .	-4.5514

Graham Dorrans of Rangers is Optimistic Before the Game with Rapid Vienna	-2.1597
The Rangers are hosting Rapid Vienna on Thursday , knowing that the victory over the Austrians , after the impressive equation in Spain against Villarreal at the beginning of this month , will bring them into a strong position to qualify for the Europaliga from Group G .	-5.5225
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorran from making his first appearance in the season until 2 : 2 , but he believes that the rangers can use this result as a springboard for greater things .	-5.7379

Paul Rowlett , an analyst at the US Department of Justice , has spent several hours as an expert in the field of information evaluation .	-4.1967
He outlined for the jury the movements of the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim of Jessica Chambers on the night of their death by mobile records .	-4.5213
Rowlett said he received location data from several phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers on the evening of her death , which contradicted his earlier claims , The Clarion Ledger reported .	-4.1029
The analysis of the data on Chambers cellular phone had revealed that he was in the company of his friend Michael Sanford , who was interrogated by the police .	-5.0428
Sanford said on Saturday that he was not in town on that day .	-2.0510
When asked by prosecutors whether Tellis spent the night in Sanford Truck , he replied that he was lying because his truck was in Nashville at that time .	-3.9544
Another contradiction was that Tellis said he knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died .	-2.3407
According to mobile recordings , they only knew about a week .	-7.5854
Rowlett said that after Chambers ’ death Tellis deleted text messages , call and contact information from his phone .	-2.3306
“ He has deleted them from his life , ” Hale said .	-2.8933

Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman , a mother of two children , was perplexed when she found that her new childcare , Giselle Maurice , was black when she started working in 2016 .	-4.6667
Mrs Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a briefing : " Neiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiin NOCH EINE SCHWARZING PERSON " .	-4.3841
Instead of sending him to her husband , she sent him twice to Mrs Maurice .	-1.6633
After she noticed her cartoon , a " inconvenient " Plasco Flaxman released Mrs Maurice and explained that her divorced girl , who was Afro-American , had done a bad job , and that she wanted to stop a Filipino instead , according to the New York Post .	-7.0877
Mrs Maurice was paid for her work on one day and sent home for a user .	-2.1069
Now Maurice sues the couple for compensation for the dismissal and demands compensation of $ 350 per day for the six-month full-time job for which it was originally discontinued , even without a contract .	-5.1209
" I want to show them , they look , what is not done , " she said the post on Friday and added : " I know that discrimination is . "	-4.0619
The couple gave counter to claims , and said that the decision to end Maurice 's employment ratio was reasonable and that they acted for fear because they could not trust her after she insulted her .	-5.7499
" My wife sent her something she did not want to say .	-1.7758
It is not racist .	-0.4442
“ We are not racists , ” her husband Joel Plasco of the Post Office told .	-2.6270
" Would you entrust your children to someone you insulted , albeit from a fault ?	-3.7552
Your newborn baby ?	-0.6407
Hardly . ”	-1.2001
Plasco said that his wife was seventh month pregnant and not in best constitution , and called the lament “ blackmail . ”	-3.9715
'You want to attack someone ? '	-1.5808
This is not a very nice thing , added to the investment banker .	-2.2369
During the dispute , the public quickly condemned the couple in the social media and attacked them for their behaviour and their way of thinking .	-3.6349
Paddington publishers feared that readers could not identify with a speaking bear , revealing a new letter .	-2.6604
Bond ’ s daughter Karen Jankel , who was born shortly after the adoption of the book , said about the letter : It is hard to be able to read it for the first time before publication .	-4.0093
“ It ’ s very amusing – now that we know about Paddington ’ s great success . ”	-2.3681
She said that her father , who had previously worked as BBC cameraman , was inspired to write a children ’ s book from a small toy bear , would have remained optimistic if his work had been rejected , and she added that the 60th anniversary of the book release after his death last year was “ bitter sweet . ”	-4.6994
On Paddington , whom she called the “ very important family member , ” she still says that her father was proud of his ultimate success .	-3.9816
" He was a rather quiet man , and he was not a bosque person , " she said .	-3.8784
" But because Paddington was so real for him , it was almost like having a child that achieves something : You are proud of the child , even though it is not your act .	-4.0948
I think he saw Paddington ’ s success a little like that .	-1.7750
Although he was his creation and his vision , Paddington himself always paid tribute . ”	-3.5392

When she landed her daughter was taken to Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice , where doctors tried to save her life in vain .	-3.1903
" Nad regularly called to say that it was really bad that she probably did not manage , " said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse .	-4.3841
Then I got the call from Nad , saying that she would die in the next two minutes , and I had to abandon her .	-3.3424
And I did it .	-0.8001
I said : " Tashi , I love you so much , treasure .	-1.5117

The medicine that had given her doctors to keep pumping her heart slowly decreased and left her body .	-5.0373
It had died some time before and this brought everything to a halt .	-3.3198
I simply had to sit there and wait , knowing what happens .	-1.7638
I could not howl or scream because I was surrounded in the situation by families and other people .	-2.5407
I really had to tear down .	-2.4573
Finally , Mrs Ednan-Laperouse , saddened about the loss of her daughter , on board the aircraft with the other passengers , who did not think of the torment she was going through .	-5.5156
“ Nobody knew something , ” she said .	-1.6310
" I had lowered my head , and tears fell down all the time .	-4.0536

Sharon Davis and Kelly Humhreys have posted cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring news and phone numbers that people can call when you need help .	-3.6385
Mrs Davis 's son Tyler was 13 years old when he suffered depression and at the age of 18 he managed to recover .	-3.9538
“ I want no parent to feel as I do every day , ” she said .	-1.6167
Mrs Davis , 45 years old and from Lydney , described her son as a promising chef with infectious smile .	-2.2934
" He was known for his smile .	-1.2612
Everyone said that his smile clarified every room . ”	-1.7928
But he had abandoned his job before his death , because he “ went very badly in psychology . ”	-4.7109
In 2014 , Tyler , who was eleven years old , found his brother after he had taken his life .	-2.4293
Mrs Davis said : ‘ I am constantly concerned that this could have a domino effect . ’	-2.6204

FBI investigations have begun , and Brett Kavanaugh ’ s future is at stake .	-1.2925
“ I thought that if we could indeed get something like what he has asked for - an inquiry which is limited in time and scope - we could perhaps reach a little consensus , ” Mr Flake said on Saturday , and added that he fears that the committee is “ falling apart ” in the midst of a deep-rooted party-political blockade .	-7.2081
Why did Mr Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate ?	-1.5956
Their reluctance is simply due to the timing .	-1.3440
It is only five weeks before the interim elections , on 6 November – if the Republicans do badly , as expected , they will be greatly weakened in trying to advance the man who is elected to the country ’ s highest court .	-6.4439

After all , the majority of poultry from North Korea receives South Korean citizenship .	-3.7944
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans illegally crossed the border since the Korean War ended in 1953 .	-1.9857
Most flee China , which has the longest border with North Korea , which is easier to cross than the strictly guarded demilitarized zone between North and South Korea .	-2.5571

This happened in Singapore after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un , when they largely agreed on the nuclear-free Korean Peninsula .	-2.7575
But , on Saturday , North Korea ’ s foreign minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the US for the lack of progress since .	-3.6954

Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh hysterical and says that he is not suitable for the Supreme Court service .	-3.0379
The leader of the democratic minority group , Nancy Pelosi , called Brett Kavanaugh , “ hysterically ” the candidate for a seat at the Supreme Court , and said that he was inappropriate from the temperament to serve the Supreme Court .	-4.4784
Pelosi made the comments at an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin , Texas .	-2.1072
“ I couldn ’ t differ from thinking that if a woman had ever behaved so , she would have called it “ hysterical , ” Pelosi said about her response to Kavanaugh ’ s statement before the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday .	-5.3338
Kavanaugh dismissed the allegations that he had sexually attacked Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both young people were .	-4.4410
During his opening speech , Kavanaugh was very emotional , sometimes he almost went and fought with tears when he spoke about his family and his high school years .	-3.6006
He also explicitly condemned the democrats in committee and called the accusations against him a “ grotesque and coordinated reputation campaign ” organised by liberals angry that Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election .	-4.0869
Pelosi said she believed that Kavanaugh ’ s statement proved that he could not serve the Supreme Court because he showed that he was prejudiced against democrats .	-4.1348
“ I believe that he himself disqualified with such statements and the way in which he can be influenced by the Clintons and the Democrats , ” she said .	-8.2859
When she was asked whether , in the event of her confirmation and a democratic majority in the House of Representatives , she would seek an ammunition against Kavanaugh , Pelosi was reluctant .	-4.5609
“ I want to say this : if he does not tell the truth to Congress or FBI , he is not only inadequate for the Supreme Court service , but also for the service to the court where he is currently engaged , ” Pelosi said .	-6.2879
Kavanaugh is currently a district judge in D.C. Appointment court .	-10.5334
Pelosi added that she was a democrat worried about possible Kavanaugh rulings against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade , because he stands for conservative justice .	-3.6519
Kavanaugh evaded questions in his confirmation hearings as to whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court rulings .	-4.8347
“ It ’ s not time that a hysterical , prejudiced person goes to court and we expect to say , “ Is this not wonderful , ” said Pelosi .	-5.5478
And women must abide .	-1.1258
It is a real hedgehog , months and years full of rage , and it cannot shoot it without wearing .	-5.6126
" We cry when we become angry , " said Mrs Steinem 45 years later to me .	-2.5112
'I do not think that this is unusual , is it ? '	-2.5432
She continued : “ I helped a woman in the executive who told me that she was also wearing when she became angry , but she developed a technique whereby she became angry every time she began to cry , to the person with whom she spoke , said : “ You like me to think that I am sad because I cry .	-6.9175
I am angry ' .	-1.3167
And then she simply continued .	-2.6654
And I thought that was brilliant . ”	-1.1094
tears are allowed as a valve for anger because they are fundamentally misunderstood .	-2.6911
One of my strongest memories of an early job in a male-dominated office in which I once cryed with indescribable anger was that I was packed by an elderly woman at neck , an eclectic manager before which I was always scared - who dragged me into a staircase .	-5.8167

Patricia Schroeder , then a Democratic Congressman from Colorado , supported Gary Hart in his presidential election .	-2.3680
In 1987 , when Mr. Hart was known to have had an unmarried affair aboard a boat called Monkey Business , he was out of the race . Ms. Schroeder , deeply frustrated , thought that there was no reason why she should not run as president .	-5.5737
“ It was not a well thought-out decision , ” she told me 30 years later .	-2.5699
" There were already seven more candidates in the race , and the last thing they needed was another .	-1.5939
Someone called it ' snowwittchen and the seven dwarves ' .	-3.7683
Because the campaign was already underway , it was behind in obtaining funds , and so it swore that it would not participate in the race unless it collected $ 2 million .	-5.5732
It was a lost battle .	-1.1520
She found that some of her supporters who gave $ 1,000 to men would give her only $ 250 .	-3.2747
“ Think that I get a lot of laurels ? ” she wondered .	-4.1817
When she delivered her speech and announced that she would not launch a formal campaign , she was so overwhelmed by emotions - gratitude for the people they had supported , frustration with the system that made it so difficult to collect money and address voters instead of delegates , and anger at sexism - that it was suffocated .	-4.3489
“ One might think I had a nervous collapse , ” Schroeder recalls how the press responded to them .	-3.8552
" One would have thought that Kleenex is my company sponsor .	-2.2048
I remember thinking about what they would write on my tombstone .	-1.8734

How to Add China ’ s Trade War to Beijing	-2.6813
The opening salves of the trade war between the United States and China have been eagerly stunning and an end to the disputes is not in sight . A gap between the two countries can be beneficial for Beijing in the long run , say experts .	-5.6844
US President Donald Trump issued the first warning early this year by taxing important Chinese exports , such as solar panels , steel , and aluminum .	-2.9495
The introduction of new tariffs on US-imported Chinese products worth $ 200 billion ( <unk> 150 billion ) this week led to a dramatic escalation of the situation .	-3.2150
Each time Beijing revanched in tangible terms , the tariffs rose from five to ten percent to American goods worth $ 60 billion .	-5.6537
China responds to every blow of the US with a backlash , and it is unlikely that the world ’ s second-largest economy will fall in the near future .	-4.5096
To deflect Washington means giving in to demands , but bending publicly to the United States would be far too blamble for Xi Jinping , the president of China .	-4.9067
But if Beijing makes good use of its opportunities , the trade war with the US can have a positive effect on China in the long term , by reducing the interdependencies of the two economies , experts say .	-5.0998
“ The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions for economic turbulence in one of the two countries is much more dangerous than observers had previously assumed , ” says Abigail Grace , a scientific colleague at the Center for New American Security , a think tank with Asia ’ s focus .	-4.2378

The government continues to rehabilitate the terrorists ’ destroyed areas in order to restore normality .	-3.2102
Now there are all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country , which they have had to leave on the basis of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods .	-4.5427
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011 .	-1.7623
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid .	-1.5197
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would welcome assistance in rebuilding the devastated country .	-2.2835
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional support or assistance from countries that have funded the insurgency .	-2.8372
