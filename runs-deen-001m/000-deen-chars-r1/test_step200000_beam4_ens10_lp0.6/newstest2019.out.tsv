The idea of investing in the beauty market has come from the fact that supermarkets are looking for ways to use the shelves that were used earlier for television , microwaves and household goods for new products .	-4.0042
Sainsbury announced that the offer of beauty products is doubled to 3000 products by adding trademarks such as Revlon , Essie , Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw to the product portfolio .	-3.3467
Existing ranges of L 'Oreal , Maybelline and Burt 's Bees will also receive more space in brand areas , just as they are found in shops such as boats                  	-5.8947
The supermarket chain also revives its own brand “ Boutique ” , which has popular vegan products in offer for young buyers .	-3.2709
In addition , the Perfume Dealer Fragrance Shop tests concessions in two Sainsbury 's shops , opened first last week in Croydon , South London , while a second end of this year is opened in Selly Oak , Birmingham .	-5.5548
Online shopping and relocation to the daily purchase of small quantities of food in neighbourhood stores mean that supermarkets must do more to move people to visit .	-3.0875
Mike Coupe , the head of Sainsbury 's , said that the sales offices will increasingly look like goods houses , since the supermarket chain tries to combat discounters like Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food .	-3.3888

Instead , he said , the US continued the sanctions to maintain pressure .	-2.5344
Trump adopted a much more optimistic attitude in his speech .	-2.3405
“ We are going well with North Korea , ” he said .	-1.6736
“ We wanted to have war with North Korea .	-1.6717
Millions of people would have been killed .	-1.2088

He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have brought positive results such as the ending of missile tests , the liberation of hostages and the transfer of the mortal remains of American soldiers home .	-2.9627
And he defended his unusual approach when he spoke about relations with Kim .	-1.9278

The spokesman of the national disaster protection agency , Mr Sutopo , said that Indonesian officials would assess the situation in Palu to see whether international organisations can contribute to the aid measures .	-3.0163
Given the earthquakes that Indonesia constantly endures , the country remains unfortunately not well prepared for natural forces .	-3.2511
While the tsunami protection rooms were built in Aceh , which is not usual for other coastlines .	-2.7940
The obvious lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu , although a warning has already been in force , should have contributed to the loss of lives .	-3.0668
Even under favourable conditions , travel between the many islands of Indonesia is difficult .	-2.1924

US Should Double Artificial Intelligence	-1.4833
While China becomes more active for artificial intelligence , the US should double its research investment , says Kai-Fu Lee , Investor , and AI practitioners working for Google , Microsoft , and Apple .	-2.6318
These demands were created after members of the US Government made announcements on KI , although the US lacks a formal AI strategy .	-3.5078
Now , last year , China presented its plan : by 2030 , it wants to be number 1 in the field of KI innovation .	-2.8785
“ Doubling expenditure on KI research would be a good start , given that all other countries are far behind the US , and a breakthrough in KI research is brief , ” said Lee .	-3.6038
Doubling funding could double the opportunity that the next achievement in the artificial intelligence sector in the US , said Lee CNBC in an interview this week .	-3.0656
Lee , whose book “ AI Superpowers : China , Silicon Valley and the New World Order ( KI superpowers : China , Silicon Valley , and the new world order ) ” was released this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt , CEO is CEO of Sinovation Ventures , a company invested in one of the most famous Chinese companies , Face + + .	-3.3300
In the 1980s , he worked at the Carnegie Mellon University on an KI system that defeated the highest-level American Othello player , later with Microsoft Research and President of Google ’ s office .	-4.1860
Lee recognized and asked the former US government technology competitions , such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( US Defense Research Authority ) , when the next would take place to identify the next visionaries                        	-5.7177
“ Researchers in the US often have to work very hard to preserve government subsidies , ” said Lee .	-2.3707
“ Not China is responsible for the flow of high-level scientists , but companies , ” noted Lee .	-6.3074
Facebook , Google , and other technology companies have stopped universities ’ coryphies in recent years to work on KI .	-2.8760
Lee said that a changed immigration policy could also help the US to strengthen their KI efforts .	-2.6780

Macedonia votes in a referendum on whether the country 's name should be changed .	-2.3849
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether to change their name to ' Republic of Northern Macedonia ' , a step that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that had blocked its accession offers for the European Union and NATO .	-3.4107
Greece , which has a province called Macedonia , insists that the name of its northern neighbour is a territorial right to the Greek territory , and has inserted a veto against the entry of the country into NATO and the EU .	-3.2235
The two governments concluded in June an agreement based on the proposed new name , but nationalist opponents argued that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority population of Macedonia .	-2.8150
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he will not vote in the referendum , and in view of a boycott campaign , there is doubt as to whether the outcome will create the 50 % hurdle , which is a prerequisite for the validity of the referendum .	-5.1360
The question on the voting paper on the referendum was : ' Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with the adoption of the agreement with Greece ? '	-2.4531
Advocates of name change , including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev , argue that it is worth continuing the price of inclusion in bodies such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia , one of the countries to emerge from the collapse of Yugoslavia .	-3.3816

Macedonia ’ s Prime Minister Zoran Zaev , his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted in favour of the referendum in Macedonia on the change of the country ’ s name , which would pave him the way for accession to NATO and the European Union in Strumica , Macedonia , on 30 September 2018 .	-3.3638
Before Parliament in Skopje , Vladimir Kavardarkov , 54 , has prepared a small stage and prepared chairs before the tents set up by those who will boycott the referendum .	-3.4894
" We are in favour of NATO and the EU , but we want to participate with the heads upwards , not through the service door " , said Kavadarkov .	-4.2524
“ We live in a poor country , but we also have our dignity .	-1.7702
If you do not want to take us as Macedonia , we can turn to others , such as China and Russia , to join us in Euro-Asian integration . ”	-2.7268
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will bring urgently needed investments to Macedonia , a country with an unemployment rate of more than 20 % .	-2.3454
“ I believe that a large majority will vote in favour , because more than 80 % of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO , ” explained Zaev after his vote ’ s table .	-5.1692
According to him , the outcome would be “ yes ” to strengthen our future .	-2.2277
Last Monday , the Macedonian Institute of Policy Research published the results of a survey : between 30 and 43 % of voters would therefore participate in the vote – less than necessary .	-2.8137
Another survey carried out by Macedonia ’ s Telma TV found that 57 % of the respondents will vote on Sunday .	-3.0282
Of those who want to participate , 70 % spent voting “ yes . ”	-2.4675
The referendum will only be adopted if the turnout of the election is over 50 % .	-3.1752

It has become increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party , and every opinion is assessed whether it is acceptable to party leadership .	-3.1269
This started shortly after Jeremy 's time , because my fellow Members with whom I had previously thought that I had a similar political attitude , expected that I would undertake a turn and take positions with which I would never have agreed , whether in terms of national security or the EU internal market   .

Climo stretched the leadership of Ayr with a criminal staff before he reached a match directly at the mid-term and then made a solo experiment with which he was able to get into the 17 : 5 break-up for Ayr .	-5.6226

Independent schools in Scotland have a track of success at the top quality of academics that continued in 2018 with outstanding results of examination , with single and group success in sport , art , music and other Community enterprises .	-4.7929
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland , these schools , represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools ( SCIS ) , aim to offer their pupils and parents the best level of service .	-3.2091
Independent schools are aimed at preparing students for further education , including universities , their desired professional career and their role as citizens .	-3.4838
In the education sector , we have the opportunity to develop and implement a tailor-made school curriculum , with modern languages still popular and desirable in schools .	-3.1970

The examination results of this year show that languages are at the top of the tables with the highest existing quotas in independent s     .                ,  ae t  s .	-8.3208
68 percent of students who have studied foreign languages have achieved the so-called “ Higher Grade A ” higher class A.	-4.7261
The data collected by the 74 member schools of the SCIS showed that 72 % of the students reached a “ higher grade A ” in Mandarin , while among the students who learned German , French and Spanish , reached 72 , 69 and 63 the Note A .                                              	-8.3863
This shows that independent schools in Scotland promote foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future .	-2.4739

A survey by the British Commission on Employment and Qualifications in 2014 showed that 17 % of the reasons why employers had difficulties in occupying free jobs are attributable to a lack of language knowledge .	-3.6024

According to a YouGov survey with more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013 , 75 % were unable to speak foreign language well enough to hold a discussion , and French is the only language that is spoken with a double-digit percentage , namely 1 %         .	-4.3480
That is why the current investment in language teaching is important for today 's children .	-2.5015

Schools in Scotland are different with regard to their language offerin .	-9.6963
Some schools focus on classical modern languages , while other languages will be the most important for Britain in 2020 , such as mandarin or Japanese .	-2.7215
Whatever your child is interested , a number of languages will always be available in independent schools , with teachers specialised in this  fiele .	-5.9489
Independent schools in Scotland want to offer a learning environment that will prepare children well , and they should be given the necessary armor for their success , whichever the future may bring .	-5.9406

It is the first five planned election events next week , and Trump also visits the republican-friendly states of Tennessee and Mississippi .	-3.4869
While the confirmation of his candidate for the vacant place in the Supreme Court still outstanding , Trump must mobilize his constituency for the forthcoming intermediate elections , otherwise it is to be feared that the Republicans will lose the majority in Congress when el  in N November      .	-5.3009
When is Trump ’ s West Virginia Rallye tonight and how can you view it online ?	-2.1335
Trump 's Rally in Wheeling , West Virginia , is planned for 19 a.m. tonight , Saturday , September 29 , 2018 .	-2.6664

Trump will certainly respond to the hearings taking place this week regarding the allegations of sexual abuse against his candidates for the Supreme Court , Brett Kavanaugh , whose confirmation in office must be carried out by the Senate has been postponed by at least a week until the conclusion of FBI investigations .	-4.3808
However , the main objective of these election events is to mobilize the Republicans , who face a decisive choice in November .	-2.8863
According to Reuters , the aim of Trump ’ s campaign is to mobilize volunteers and supporters with the five election events next week to defend and expand the majority of Republicans in the Senate and House of Representatives .      e          h                       	-8.1779

Ryder Cup 2018 : The team USA is ready for the fight to maintain hope for Sundays singles .	-10.5283
After three unilateral encounters , the four games on Saturday afternoon were probably exactly what the Ryder Cup needed .	-2.7865
The vibrant pendulum is a freely invented sports concept that players have internalized , especially in competitions like these .	-3.3362
So where would they say the momentum now ?	-1.8283
“ They had a six-point advantage and now there are four , so that is probably a bit of momentum , ” said Jordan Spieth when he withdrew for the day . ”	-3.5283
Europe is , of course , in advantage of 4 points and twelve others are to be played .	-3.1500
However , Americans , as Spieth says , feel something wind in their sails , and there was much encouraging for them , not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas , who have played together all day and have three out of four points .                 ha                 	-6.8266
From the outset , Spieth was considering and moving forward with a good example .	-3.5049
These bad cries became louder when his round continued , he decreased a decisive putt to achieve a decision in game 4 after he and Thomas reset 2 points .	-4.7237
His joy about the putt on the 15th hole with which she won the game was so thought that he still believed in the victory of the Americans .	-3.2483
" You really have to focus strongly and worry about your own game , " said Spieth .	-2.6498
This is also everything that still remains for each of these players .	-2.6331
18 holes to leave impression .	-1.0434
In the last two days , Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood have been the only player with more points than Spieth and Thomas .	-2.9280
Europe ’ s strange , but admirable couple plays mistakenly and simply does everything right .        e it .	-8.4910
" Moliwood " was the only couple that did not reach a bogey on Saturday afternoon , but they avoid them also on Saturday morning , Friday afternoon and on Friday morning the back nine                 	-4.9593
This run and the way in which their energy seems to flow from and from this omitted amount of viewers , makes it the favorites on Sunday and when the sun goes over Le Golf National , there would be no more popular player who seals a possible European victory than Fleetwood or Molinari .	-4.5513
Probably both at the same time on different holes .	-1.8958
Already talking about a European victory would be too has               	-6.9235
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short process with Sergio Garcia , who was victory with his partner Alex Noren morning .	-4.4049
With a bogey and two doubles on the first nine grubbing the Spanish and Swede into a hole from which they never came out again .	-7.8657
On Sunday there is no one who helps you from your hole .	-2.3169
Because of the interactions between the couplings , the given advice , the non-given advice and the way in which a strategy can change in the manual , it is very fascinating to observe fourballs and foursomes from nearest proximity .	-4.1176
Europe has been better playing as a team so far and taking a clear lead in the last day , but this Foursome session has also shown that the team US has the desire to fight what some , especially stateside , have doubted .	-4.3602
Europe ’ s Ryder Cup Finaltag	-1.9400
Europe will use a solid advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after it emerged from the four- and four-games on Saturday with a 10-6 leadership over the United State   .     ee             e e e   , e  	-8.9435
The inspired Duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the group with two victories about a fighting Tiger Woods to bring its balance sheet to four points in the Le Golf National .	-3.2136
The European team of Thomas Bjorn , who came to maintain the trophy that she lost in Hazeltine two years ago , dominated an American team fighting for tomorrow ’ s fourball , and won the series with 3-1 .	-3.8369
The US offered more resistance in the four and won two games , but they could not digest the deficit .	-2.3810
The team of Jim Furyk needs eight points from the 12 individual games of Sunday to keep the trophy .	-2.4574
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points , while he and Molinari , after a sensational weekend " Molliwood " , are only the second couple that wins four points from their first four games in the history of the Ryder Cup .	-3.2732
After destroying Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs , it was certain that they would beat an even clearer 5 & 4 woods and the American rookie Bryson Dechambeau .	-3.5453
Woods , which has slipped on Saturday by two parties , showed occasionally brilliant actions , but he has now lost 19 of his 29 parties in four balls and four balls and seven in a row .	-4.4330
Justin Rose , rested for the morning fourballs , returned to his partner Henrik Stenson to the Foursomes , and struck one and three in the world in a 2 & 1 defeat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka .	-3.1776
On a pleasant , airy day southwest of Paris , Europe did not have it in its own way .	-2.5567
The triple main victors Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the scale for the Americans on Saturday with two points .	-2.9909
They won a brave 2 : 1 victory against the Spanish Jon Frame and Ian Poulter in the four-pack and later returned to beat poulters and Rory McIlroy 4 : 3 in the four-pack after losing the first two holes .	-3.4607
Only twice in the Ryder Cup history , a team comes back from a four-point deficit to the singles , although Halter Furyk 's page needs only one decision to keep the trophy  .        e                  e            	-8.6805
After two days of secondary occupation , a Sunday account looks as if he were going beyond them .	-3.1907
North Korea says that there will be “ no way ” unilateral disarmament without trust .	-4.7653
North Korea ’ s Foreign Minister said to the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions would deepen its distrust of the United States and that the country would under no circumstances give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally .	-3.3832
Ri Yong Ho said to the annual General Assembly of the World Body that North Korea took " significant goodwill measures " last year , such as stopping nuclear and missile testing , reducing the nuclear test area , and the commitment to nuclear weapons and nuclear technology .	-4.2403
" However , there is no response from the US " , he said .	-2.5174
“ Without any confidence in the US , there will be no confidence in our national security , and in such circumstances there will be no way that we first disarm ourselves unilaterally . ”	-3.1042
While Ri returned to the well-known North Korean complaints about Washington ’ s resistance to a “ gradual ” approach to denuclearization , which would reward North Korea with gradual steps , his declaration seemed important in that it did not completely reject unilateral denuclearization , as Pyongyang did in the past .	-3.7780
Ri referred to a joint declaration by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a first summit between a US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June , when Kim committed to " denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula " , while Trump promised guarantees of North Korea 's security .	-3.5985
North Korea sought a formal end to the Korea War in 1950-53 , but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons .	-2.8385
Washington has also resisted the demands for a relaxation of the hard international sanctions against North Kore     .	-5.0941
The US insists on " denuclearization-first " ( first denuclearization ) and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its purpose in a mandatory manner , and even reject the " Declaration of War End " , said Ri                    	-5.3543
" The perception that sanctions can force us into the knee is a desire for the people who are ignorant to us .                    	-6.0291
But the problem is that continued sanctions exacerbate our distrust . ”	-2.0473
Ri did not mention any plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump , which the US President highlighted earlier this week at the United Nations .                   	-4.7091
Instead , the Minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the last five months and added : " If the party were not in this matter of denuclearization of South Korea and not the United States , the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have entered such an impasse " .	-4.3968
Nevertheless , the tone of Ri 's speech was dramatically different from last year when he reported to the U.N. The General Assembly , which took the US mainland with North Korea ’ s missile , was inevitable after “ Mr. Evil President ” Trump Kim called “ missile man ” on a suicide mission .	-4.2182
This year at the United Nations , Trump , who threatened last year to “ destroy ” North Korea , has praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm , but he also said that much work had to be done , and sanctions must remain until North Korea destroyed denuclearization .	-3.4341
On Wednesday , Trump said that he did not have a timeframe and said : ' It does not matter whether it takes two years , three years or five months ' .	-2.9311
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken .	-1.8863
However , in the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo , the UN said that , on Thursday , the Security Council 's enforcement of the Security Council sanctions must be energetically and without defect continued until we realise the full , final and verified denuclearization . '	-7.8999
Since 2006 , the Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea in order to prevent the funding of Pyongyang ’ s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes .	-2.6736
Pompeo met Ri on the edge of the UN General Assembly and then said that he will travel back to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit .	-2.9784
Pompeo has already visited North Korea this year , but his last journey did not go well .	-2.1387
He left Pyongyang in July , saying that progress has been made , and only a few hours afterwards condemned North Korea have made him “ similar demands . ”	-3.9717
North Korea promised this month at a meeting with moon to dismantle a missile location and also a nuclear complex when the United States takes ' appropriate measures ' .	-5.9946
He said that Kim told him that the ' relevant measures ' he wanted were security guarantees promised by Trump in Singapore , and steps to normalize relations with Washington .	-3.0254
Harvard students take part in the course to find enough peace .	-2.1450
With a new course this year at Harvard University , all students get more sleep to fight against the growing macho culture of the studies of the caffeine-tuned " nights " .	-3.8214
A scientist has noted that students at a world leader in university are often unnoticed when it comes to helping themselves , even when it comes to very simple mechanisms .	-3.4579
Charles Czeisler , professor of sleep medicine at the Harvard Medical School and specialist at the Brigham and Women 's Hospital , designed the course that , in his opinion , is the first of his kind in the US .                	-4.9169
He was inspired to start the course after having made a talk about the effects of sleep deficiency on learning .	-3.1874
At the end of the day , a girl came to me and said : ' Why is that only now , in my final year ?	-3.2702
She said that ye have never told someone about the importance of sleep – what surprised me , " he said the telegraph .	-3.1856
The course offered for the first time this year explains to students how good sleep habits promote academic and sporting performance and improve their general well-being .	-6.0384
Paul Barreira , Professor of Psychiatry at the Harvard Medical School and Managing Director of the University 's Health Service , said that the University had decided to introduce the course after it had found that the students would have slept extremely little during the week   .	-7.5401
The 1-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks .	-1.9239
In one section there is a picture of a dormitory where students click on cups , curtains , trainers and books to be informed about the effects of caffeine and light and about how sporting performance is influenced by sleep deficiency and the meaning of a sleeping time routine .	-4.1336
Another section explains to the participants how long-term sleeping trains can increase the risk of heart , stroke , depression and cancer .	-3.4203
A card of campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their everyday life .	-2.4216
We know that it will not change the behaviour of students immediately .	-1.8020
" But we believe that they have a right to it - just how you have a right to know the health effects of the decision to smoke , cigarettes , " added Prof. Czeisler .	-8.8038
The culture of pride exists a " night " , he said and added that modern technology and increasing pressure on students makes sleepers a growing problem .	-3.7912
Having sufficient sleep of good quality should be the " secret weapon " of a student to combat stress , exhaustion and fear , he said - not even to increase , because sleeping training enables the brain to famine mode and makes it constantly hungr                  	-6.2435
Raymond So , a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology , helped Professor Czeisler to design the course after having visited one of his classes in Harvard last year in his first year .	-3.3652
He said that the course had opened his eyes and pushed him inspired to a campus-wide course .	-2.5463
The next step , hopefully , is to ask all Docotorands to complete a similar study programme before entering the Competition University .	-3.0865
Prof. Czeisler recommended students to put an alarm when they go to bed and when they should wake up , and to be aware of the harmful effects of the " blue light " that is broadcast from electronic screens and LED lighting , which can bring their circadian rhythm out of the cycle , which leads to problems with sleeping .	-4.4532
Livingston 1-0 Rangers : Mengas Goal Erdet Gerrards Men	-2.2940
Further external problems by the Rangers : After a match of Dolly Menga , there was 1-to-0 defeat in Livingston for the diverse team of Steven Gerrard .	-4.1306
The Ibrox team wanted to record its first victory since 4 : 1-Triumph in St. Johnstone in February , but the team of Gary Holt added Gerrard ’ s second defeat in 18 games as a trainer that returned his team by eight points behind the disappointed Ladbroke ’ s Premiership chef Hearts .	-4.1063
Menga landed seven minutes before the mid-term and an inspirational Rangers site did not look like it could balance .	-12.3267
While the Rangers now fall back to the sixth place , Livingston climbs on rank three and are only behind the tordifference behind Hibernian .	-3.3072
New difficulties for the Rangers are characterized because a headwound had to be provided at line judges Calum Spence , after hit a litter – apparently thrown out by the external fans sector .	-5.2808
Gerrard made eight changes to the side that passed to Ayr and fighted directly into the semi-final of the Betfred Cup .	-6.2253
By contrast , the same Livi Elf , which declined a point for the Hearts last week , and he would have been enthusiastic about how his well-trained team did not leave the opponents space for actions at any  t                                     w 	-9.0824
The Rangers dominated opportunities for ball ownership , but Livingston improved .	-9.2673
You should have met after just two minutes , when Menga ’ s first storefront Scott Pittman sent to Allan McGregors Tor , but the midfielder player delayed his great change at the gat                  	-6.1843
A deep release of Keaghan Jacobs then went to Captain Craig Halkett , but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only shoot far towards behind posts .	-3.1752
The Rangers took control , but there seemed to be more hope than confidence in their own game , last third .	-2.6705
Alfredo Morelos clearly believed that after the first quarter of an hour had earned a penalty after he collided and Steven Lawless , but arbitrators Steven Thomson did not include the calls of the Colombians .	-4.2636
The Rangers were only two shots in the first half , but the former Ibrox guardian Liam Kelly was hardly calm of Lassana Coulibaly ’ s head jump and the head of an unprecedented Ovie Ejaria .	-4.1957
Even if Livi ’ s opening matches may have been contrary to the game ground in the 34th minute , nobody can deny that they deserve it alone for their efforts .	-3.5206
Again , the rankers failed to master a Jacobs standard situation .	-2.1263
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher Scott Robinson played the ball that preserved the peace and picked Menga out for a simple finish .	-3.0066
Gerrard acted during the break when he exchanged coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the change immediately affected the game when the wing player played to Morelos , but the impressive Kelly ran from his line to block .	-3.5208
But Livingston repeatedly moved guests to play exactly the kind of game they like , with Lithgow and Halkett fagting long b         balls       an  ex .      e  t  's      e	-10.9483
Holt ’ s team could have expanded their leadership in the final phase , but McGregor was well on to refuse to refuse Jacobs before Lithgow had passed over .	-6.2987
The Rangers representative Glenn Middleton had another delayed entitlement to a punishment because he had prevented Jacobs , but again he saw Thomson away        e                     ha     	-8.3291

Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda , Maryland said : ' Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine ' .	-2.2926
HER2 “ promotes the growth of different types of cancer , ” including breast , eggstock , lung and colour cancer , declared Prof. Berzofsky .	-3.1970
A similar approach to taking patients immune cells and teaching them how to attack cancer cells has worked when treating a kind of leukaemia .                        	-6.2534

It was Not Good	-2.3866

The Saturday-Night-Live show began with a sketch in which Hollywood-Star Matt Damon said about Brett Kavanaugh ’ s statement before the Senate Justice Committee on Christine Blasey Fords ’ accusations , Kavanaugh had made it sexually necessary .	-3.7149
Although it was not broadcast , West ’ s film material was shared by Komiker Chris Rock in the social media .	-2.9862
It is unclear whether rock has attempted to spot West with the contribution      .	-7.8935
West , too , complained about the fact that he had been difficult behind the stage because of his head cover .	-3.5112
" They were harassing me behind the stage .	-7.9448

Try to love . ”	-2.2198
His comments were quitted at least twice by the audience with calls , and the comediants of Saturday Night Live seemed to be moved , reported Variety , and quoted a person with the words : “ The whole studio was totenstill . ”	-5.2526
West was used as a later replacement for the singer Ariana Grande , whose former friend , the Rapper Mac Miller , died a few days ago .	-2.6110
West surprised many with a performance of the song " I Love it " , when Perrier Bottle dressed .	-2.6634
West got support from the head of the conservative group TPUSA , Candace Turner , who twittered : " This is for one of the most courageous spirits : Thank you for RESISTANCE TO THE MAFIA . "	-3.4508

" Game of Thrones " -Star Kit Harington lives toxic malevolence	-2.1425
Kit Harington is known for his severe role as Jon Snow in the brachial medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones of HBO .	-2.6589
But the actor , 31 , has annoyed himself about the stereotype of the machohero and said that such roles on the canvas lead to small guys often feeling that they must be hard to be re   e  .	-11.0506
Kit said to The Sunday Times Culture , he believed that something was wrong and asked how to address the problem of toxic male in the <unk> MeToo era .	-5.3620
Kit , who recently married his Co-Star Rose Leslie , also 31 , admitted that he considered to be very important to solve the problem .	-2.7537
I personally feel quite strong at the moment - what have we done wrong with male ? , he said .	-2.7644
What have we taught to men in their young people in terms of the problem we are now seeing ?	-3.0324
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity by its very masculine characters .	-2.4862
He continues : What is innate and what is taught ?	-2.0228
What is taught on television and on the street gives the small boy the feeling that they must have this particular side of man ?	-5.3517
I think that is really one of the major questions at our time – how can we change that ?	-2.5128
For young men , something has obviously gone wrong .	-2.5464
In the interview , he also admitted that he would not make Game of Thrones precursors or continuations when the series ends in the next summer , and added that he was ready with battlegrounds and horses .	-3.5333

In the large majority of new cases , the virus was transferred by gender traffic , which is a change to the past .	-3.1406
Usually , HIV spread quickly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions .	-2.4571
But the number of people sick to HIV has been reduced to nearly zero , said Chinese health officials at a conference in the Yunnan provi  .	-3.1194
Compared with the previous year , however , the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people .	-5.9768

Maxine Waters denies that an employee has leaked the data of GOP senators , criticizes the accusations as “ dangerous lies ” and “ conspiracy theories ” .	-2.7425
The US MEP Maxine Waters rejected allegations on Saturday , according to which one of its employees should have published personal data from three Republican US senators on the Wikipedia sites of the legislator     .            e an  o               	-8.6405
The democrat based in Los Angeles is convinced that the claims of members of the ultralinked wing and on websites have been launched .	-3.1071
“ Lies , lies , and even more recurring lies , ” Waters shared an opinion on Twitter .	-2.9387
According to reports published , the private addresses and telephone numbers of the US Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina , as well as the US senators Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch , both from Utah .	-3.2554
The information appeared online Thursday , posted by an unknown person on the capitol hill during a hearing of the Senate on the accusations of sexual misconduct of the candidate for the Supreme Court Board Kavanaugh .	-3.4265
The data of the three senators were released shortly after Kavanaugh 's survey .	-2.4752
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the sources of the jobs has been linked to Waters ' office and have published the information of an employee in Waters reports Hill .	-3.6436
“ This unfounded accusation is completely wrong and absolute lie , ” said Waters .	-7.9873
“ The employee among my employees – whose identity , personal information , personal data and security were affected as a result of these fraudulent and false claims – was in no way responsible for leaking this information .	-3.3996
This unsustainable claim is completely wrong and an absolute lie .	-2.5869
Water ’ s declaration quickly led to criticism online , including the former White House Ari Meat Secretary .	-3.0492
“ That thing is denied is extremely annoying , ” wrote meat .	-2.4273

Meat seemed to compare Water ’ s response to the criticism of the Democrats to judges Kavanaugh , accused by critics of appearing too angry during the hearing on Thursday .	-3.4817
Omar Navarro , a Republican candidate who candidates in the mid-term elections next to the seatless Waters , also expressed his thoughts on Twitter .	-3.5923
“ Big , if true ” , he has tweeted .	-5.5645
In her statement , Waters said that her office ' has informed the competent authorities and law enforcement authorities of fraudulent claims .	-3.0481

Review of " Johnny English – Man lives only three times " – badly occupied parody with Rowan Atkinson	-2.3057
It is tradition to seek suggestions in every new film with British tendency to Brexit , and this seems to be applicable to this revival of the Johnny English Action Comedy Spoof franchise , which began with Johnny English and was restored in 2011 with " Johnny English Reborn " .	-4.5422
Is the ironic self-satire about the abyss of mankind the new export opportunity of the nation ?	-2.7756
In any case , Johnny English has received the license for the second time to remass things , and his name shows wonderful that he is a comic creation with great range designed for non-English-language cinema visitors .	-4.6973
He is , of course , the stupid secret agent , who , despite his bizarre claims of Smoothie Glamour , received a little Clouseau , a sprayer Mr. Bean and a clack from this guy , who contributed a single note to the guiding melody of fire carriages at the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in London in 2012 .	-4.8579
It is also based on the traveller and international , mysterious Atkinson , who has once participated in the Barclaycard TV displays that have now been forgotten .	-3.8398
There are one or two beautiful moments in this latest Johnny English comedy .	-2.0068
I loved Johnny English , who approaches a helicopter in a medieval armor and shortly beats the main rotor against his helmet .	-2.9013
Atkinson 's talent for body comedy is to be seen , but the humor feels quite weak and strangely unnecessary , especially as the " serious " marks such as 007 and mission impossible offer comedy as ingredients self-confidently                             im	-7.3954
The humour feels rather than whether he is directed to children rather than adults , and for me the crazy miss skills of Johnny English are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson ’ s Mr. Bean-Stummfilme .	-4.0344
The everlasting premise is now that Britain is in great difficulty                  	-6.3225
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the highly secret British network of spies , revealing the identity of all British agents on the ground , horrifying the service agent – a regrettably small role for Kevin Eldon .	-3.3079
It is the last straw almost for a prime minister who is a pompous and contested personality and has already suffered a complete meltdown of political unpopularity .                                                                                                    	-15.1037
Your intelligence consultants inform that , since every single active spy has been compromised , someone must get retirement .	-3.3257
And that means the tollpatschige Johnny English himself , who is now employed as a schoolmaster in a noble facility , but gives unsurpassed lessons about how to operate as a Undercover agent : some nice gags here , while English offers a School of Rock Academy on spying .	-4.0490
English is reunified for an emergency briefing to Whitehall and reunified with his former long-suffering Kumpel Bough , which is played again by Ben Miller .	-3.3970
Bough is now a married man who meets a sub-boat commander , an over-encouraging , burshikose role in which Vicki Pepperdine is not entirely applied .	-3.7512
So , the Batman and Robin of the chaos at the secret service of their majesty are back in action and meet at Olga Kurylenko ’ s beautiful Femme Fatale Ophelia Bulletova .	-5.6593
Meanwhile , the Prime Minister is dangerously in the banner of the charismatic tech billionaire , which claims to be able to solve the UK ’ s computer problems : the dark Jason Volta , played by Jake Lacy .	-3.7014
English and Bough begin their odyssey of colourful highjinks : as a waister , they ignite a French Flash restaurant ; they create chaos by smuggling on board Volta ’ s luxury yacht ; and English triggers pure anarchy when he tries to familiarize with a virtual reality headset with the interior of Voltas House .	-4.3412
All the registers have certainly been drawn for this last sequence , but so complete and omitted it is , the whole reminds of children 's television .	-4.3325
Rather moderate .	-1.3009
And , like the other Johnny English films , I could not be able to think about thinking : can the British film industry Rowan Atkinson not play a role that is really just his talent ?	-4.1121
Labour denied that a plan for British had been developed for a four-day week for which five days are paid .	-2.9312
Jeremy Corbyn ’ s Labour Party examines a radical plan where Britain works only four days a week , but five .	-2.9881
According to reports , the party wants company leaders to pass on the savings reached by the revolution of artificial intelligence ( AI ) to workers by freeing them an additional day .	-3.3230
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend - but still bring the same money home .	-2.6544
Sources said that the idea would ' fit ' with the economic agenda of the party and plans to tilt the country in favour of workers .	-2.9904
The Trade Union Congress has approved the changeover to a four-day week as an opportunity for workers to use the changing economy .	-2.8391
A high-level source from the Labour Party said the Sunday Times : a review of politics is expected to be announced before the end of the year .	-2.5988
A four-day week is an objective which agrees with the Party 's approach to restoring the economic balance in favour of workers and the general industrial strategy of the party , but this objective will not be achieved overnight .	-3.9149
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea , as the Green Party promised a four-day working week during its 2017 election campaign .	-2.6289
However , this advance is currently not supported by the entire Labour Party .	-2.7163
A Labour spokesman said : ' A four-day week is not a party politics and is not intended by the party ' .	-2.6257
Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to specify his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy .	-2.4424
Mr McDonnell said that he was determined to regain the power of ' faceless directors ' and ' profit makers ' in supply companies .	-2.5161
The Shadow Chancellor 's plans also mean that the current shareholders of water companies may not retain their entire share , because a Labour government could make deductions due to alleged misconduct .	-3.7694

Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are talking in “ 60 minutes ” about whether FBI investigations against Kavanaugh could change their opinions .	-6.4441
Due to an ongoing FBI investigation into accusations against judge Brett Kavanaugh , the final vote to appoint the judge to the Supreme Court was postponed by at least one week , and the question of whether the FBI ’ s investigation results could lead to republican senators to abandon their support for Kavanaugh .	-4.4839

But how successful has Global Citizen been to achieve its goal with 12 remaining years ?	-2.2072
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert , a genuine way of convincing people , calling for action , or simply another case of so-called ' clicktivism ' - people who feel as if they feel a real difference by signing an online petition or an online application or thereby sending a tweet ?	-4.1440
Global Citizen says that since 2011 , it has recorded more than 19 million “ actions ” by its supporters that pushed for a variety of different goals .	-3.2467
It states that these actions have motivated world drivers to make financial and political commitments to the value of more than $ 37 billion , which will affect more than $ 2.25 billion by 2030 .	-3.3060
At the beginning of 2018 , the Group led $ 390 operations and announcements from its actions , at least $ 10 billion which had already been paid or financed .	-3.4247
The group estimates that the funds provided have had a direct influence on almost 649 million people around the world .	-2.6340
One of the most important commitments is The Power of Nutrition , a partnership based in Britain by investors and executive organizations that have committed itself to helping “ children develop their full potential . ” The organization has promised to support Rwanda with $ 35 million to end malnutrition in the country after more than 4,700 tweets have been received by Global Citize    .	-8.3999
“ With the support of the British Government , donors , other governments and global citizens like you , we can make sure that the social injustice of malnutrition is one day ’ s history , ” announced The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman of the quantity of mankind in a live concert in London in April 2018 .	-3.8656
The group also said that , after more than 5,000 actions in the United Kingdom , which aimed to improve the food of mothers and children , the government will achieve the financing of the Power of Nutrition project " 5 million women and children with food interventions .	-3.7526
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on your website , “ Why do you think that we can end extreme poverty ? ”	-2.4611
Global citizens replied : it will be a long and difficult path - sometimes we will fall and fail .	-2.2956

US Could Build a “ Blockade ” through the Navy to Hinder Russian Energy Exports – Home Affairs	-6.1646
Washington can “ resort ” to his naval to prevent Russian energy from reaching the markets , including in the Middle East , is quoted by the Washington Examiner ’ s U S I                                              	-8.9653
Zincs said that Russia ’ s commitment to Syria – particularly in activities at invitation to the legal government – was a pretext for exploring new energy markets .	-3.2299
“ I believe the reason why they are in the Middle East is more following : they want to negotiate energy , just as they do in Eastern Europe , the southern part of Europe , ” he said .	-2.8538
And , according to officials , there are means and ways to deal with this .	-7.0063
“ The United States has this ability to ensure that sea routes are open and , if necessary , to block to ensure that their energy does not come onto the market , ” he said .	-3.0932
Zincs spoke to the participants of an event by the Consumer Energy Alliance , a non-profit organization that calls itself a “ voice of energy consumers ” in the US .	-3.1930
He compared Washington ’ s approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran and found that they are actually equal .	-2.7290
" The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less in using and replacing fuels , " he said while calling Russia a " one-trick pony " with an economy dependent on fossil fuels .	-2.8748
The opinions come while the Trump administration was on the mission to boost the export of its liquid natural gas to Europe and replace Russia , the much more favourable option for European consumers .	-2.9892
Members of the Trump administration – including US President Donald Trump himself – are therefore trying to move Germany to a stop of the “ inadequate ” Nord Stream-2 pipeline project that , according to Trump , would make Berlin “ prisoner . ”	-3.5996
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $ 11 billion pipeline Nord Stream 2 , which is to double existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres , is a purely economic project .	-2.8965
The Kremlin argues that Washington ’ s resistance to the project is simply driven for economic reasons and an example of unfair competition .	-2.2081
“ I believe we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument to exert pressure , and that consumers should be able to elect suppliers , ” said Russian energy minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September .	-3.2867

The Minister of Justice of the District of Columbia Karl Racine said in an opinion on Friday that the new law ignores decades of national , federal and international law .	-2.5735
The Amicus Curiae states that according to the Federal Law , all applications for asylum must be assessed in accordance with the conditions of the relevant actions and that such action violates this principle .	-4.1365
Lawyers continued to argue in writing that the policy that refuses to enter immigrants damages the US economy because it is more likely that these immigrants become entrepreneurs and “ do the necessary job . ”	-3.5201
General Prosecutor Jeff Sessions depended immigration judges in June no longer granting asylum to people fleeing domestic or gang violence .	-3.0205

Ambassadors China ’ s “ Mobbing ” with “ Propaganda Advertising	-3.0497
One week after an official Chinese newspaper presented a four-sided display in an American daily newspaper on the mutual benefits of US China trade , the US American American Ambassador in China Beijing put forward the American press to spread propaganda .	-3.9010
Last Wednesday , President Donald Trump referred to the paid supplement of China Daily in the Moine Register - the state with the most sold newspaper of Iowa - after accusing China of interfering in the US Congressional Elections of 6 November , which disputes China .              ha       ha b                    	-8.7937
US officials claim to Reuters that Trump ’ s accusation of Beijing tried to interfere in the US elections is a new phase in an escalating Washington campaign to exert pressure on China .	-2.8987
It is normal that foreign states show advertisements to promote trade , but Beijing and Washington are currently in an escalating trade war with several rounds of tariffs on imports . T                                i a   s e	-8.8968
At an early stage in the trade war , China ’ s retaliatory tariffs should meet Chinese and US experts in US states like Iova , where many supporters of Trump ’ s Republican Party live .	-3.1272
Terry Branstad , US American Ambassador in China , and former long-standing Iowa governor , a significant exporter of agricultural products to China , said that Beijing has violated American workers , farmers , and companies .	-3.3108
China , wrote Branstad in an opinion article in Des Moines Register on Sunday , “ now operates strongly through propaganda ads in our own free press .	-3.3263
“ By spreading propaganda as paid advertisements in the Moines register , China ’ s government is using the estimated American tradition of freedom of expression and freedom of the press , ” Branstad wrote .	-3.4225
" By contrast , you will find only limited voices at the level of newspaper in the streets of Beijing and see no real reproduction of different opinions that the Chinese people could have on China ’ s disturbing economic development , given that the media are firmly in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party , " he wrote .	-4.4929
He added that ' one of China 's most prominent newspapers contradicted the offer of publication ' , although he did not say which newspaper .	-2.9281
The Republicans are graying with the Kavanaugh Debacle electorate from the Midterm elections , warni a Anal Stat              	-5.7433
Many of the top Republicans defended Brett Kavanaugh , a nominee that is the Supreme Court , although he has been accused of sexual attacks , and the analysts will warn that they will see a retaliation in the forthcoming elections , especially women .	-4.3083
The emotions were high , most Republicans have already said that they want to vote for him .	-2.2529
These things cannot be returned , said Grant Reeher , professor of political science at Maxwell School of Syracuse University , on Saturday in an article published by The Hill .	-5.0722
Reeher said that he doubted that last minute support from Jeff Flake ( Republican MEP for the state of Arizona ) for investigations of the FBI is sufficient to reconcile angry voters                                	-7.2906
“ Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow and not even in November , ” said Carine Jean-Pierre , senior consultant and national speaker for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday , as a Washington newspaper reported .	-3.1159

“ Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be immeasurable , ” said Stu Rothenberg , an impartial political analyst , the journalists .	-2.1070
“ People say that it is quite advanced that this is true .	-2.6943
But the figure could be higher , particularly with the internal electorates in the suburbs and younger electorates , 18 to 29 years who do not suffer the president , but often do not vote . ”	-4.3347
Even before Ford ’ s public statement , in which they carried out their accusations of sexual violence against the candidates for the Supreme Court , analysts noted that a backlash could follow if Republicans drive candidacy forward .	-7.4157
“ For the GOP , this has become a wrong chaos , ” said Michael Steele , former chairman of the Republican National Committee , early last week , according to NBC News .	-3.2679
“ It is not simply about the committee choice or the final election or whether Kavanaugh is placed on the substitute bank , it is about how the Republicans handled this and how they have treated it , ” shared Guy Cecil , Director of the US priorities , a group that helps to choose Democrat  to                            e .  ”	-10.0563
But the Americans are divided about the Ford and Kavanaugh statements .	-2.4270
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 % of Ford ’ s respondents definitely or probably believed while 35 % indicated that they believed definitely or probably Kavanaugh .	-3.2524
Moreover , 38 % said that they thought that Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his statement , while only 30 % said the same about Ford .	-2.6444
At the Flake initiative , the FBI is currently examining the accusations of Ford and at least of another prosecutor , Deborah Ramirez , reported The Guardian .	-2.9710
Last week before the Senate Justice Committee said under Eid that Kavanaugh had attacked it at the age of 17 .	-2.6057

Mickelson , who played for the 12th time at the event that took place every two years , was placed on the bank by Captain Jim Furyk for the Fourballs and Foursomes on Saturday .	-3.1064
Instead of being at the heart of the event , as so often for the US , the five-time Major winner shared his day between fires and exercise rounds on the golf course , in the hope of overcoming its depth .	-3.9427
Even at the height of his career , the 48-year-old is never the most straightforward driver and is not suitable for the narrow Le Golf National Square , where the long Rough regularly punishes failures .	-3.3445
And as if the place alone were not enough , Mickelson meets in the ninth match on Sunday at the British Open Champion Francesco Molinari , who won all four matches this week together with Neuling Tommy Fleetwood .	-3.8174
If Americans have four points behind the 12 single games and have a hot start , Mickelson ’ s match could be absolutely crucial .	-3.2498
Furyk expressed his confidence in his man ; whatever left him .	-2.5108
" He fully understood the role he had today , gave me a flap on the back and put his arm around me and said that he would be ready tomorrow , " said Furyk .	-7.2913

This is the message you have to convey to the players : tomorrow to get the best out of yourself .	-3.1824
Now you pass to your partner and you have to be full of use . ”	-3.4759
In contrast to Björn , Jim Furyk will seek to ensure that his players cut better than they do this as a partner , except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas , who have got three of four points .	-4.3056
Furyk himself has already experienced such a sensational turning at the end of the day , when he was part of the winner team in Brookline , now he is one of the losers after the European team has completed the “ Miracle of Medinah . ”	-4.3136

Re-Shifting the German Warship Schedule	-8.2080
The latest frigate of German naval naval should have been served in 2014 to replace warships coming from the Cold War period in order to replace years of warships from the Cold War , but , according to reports by local media , it will take at least until next year .	-5.7096
The commissioning of the “ Rheinland-Pfalz ” , the guiding ship of the brand new fregattens of the Baden-Württemberg class , has now been postponed to the first half of 2019 , so the newspaper “ Die Zeit ” with appeal to a military speaker .	-4.2193
The naval ships should have operated in 2014 , but serious problems after the first delivery were burdened by the ambitious project .	-3.3332
The four frigates ordered by the Marine by the Baden-Württemberg class will replace the older ships of the Bremen class .	-3.2594
It is assumed that they have a powerful cannon , a series of air defense and ship defense missiles and some Stealth technologies , such as reduced radar , infrared and acoustic signatures .	-3.4858
Another important advantage is longer maintenance intervals : the latest fregattes should be usable for up to two years without getting up to the home port .	-3.5201
However , the state-of-the-art warships that Germany should enable overseas power projection will already be outdated by constant delays when they are finally served , as the weekly name “ The Time . ”	-4.3188
Last year , the unfortunate F125 ship provided headlines when the German navy officially refused to operate the ship and returned to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg .	-3.7697
This was the first time that after delivery the naval ship had returned to a shipbuilder .	-3.0323
There was little known about the reasons for the return of ships ; German media mentioned a series of critical “ software and hardware defects ” that would make the warship useless in combat           .                    h ,	-7.5596
Software shortcomings were particularly important because the ships of the Baden-Württemberg class were served by an occupation of around 120 seafarers - only half of the occupation on older frigates of the Bremen class .	-3.6362
The vessel also turned out that there was a significant overweight , which would restrict performance and make future upgrades more difficult for the navy .	-5.8322
It is assumed that the 7,000-tonnes “ Rhineland-Palatinate ” is twice as difficult as ships of the same class used by the Germans in the Second World War .	-3.2122
In addition to flawed hardware , the price shield of the entire project - including the training of the crew - becomes the topic .	-7.3695
Instead of the EUR 2.2 billion originally estimated , the cost has now apparently reached the dignity of EUR 3.1 billion ( around $ 3.6 billion ) .	-3.7507

Brexit : Britain Would R   L       Los Car Ma                        	-6.7152
“ The United Kingdom would regret it if it were to lose its position as the world ’ s leading car manufacturer after Brexit , ” said Economic Minister Greg Clark                       	-5.8932
He added that it was " worrying " that Toyota UK of the BBC said that they would temporarily stop production in their work in Burnaston , near Derby , if Britain were to leave the EU without a deal .	-3.8037
“ We need an agreement , ” said Clark .	-1.4506
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the effects of delays at the borders in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs .	-2.6710
The work in Burnaston , which manufactures Auris and Avensis for Toyota , produced almost 150,000 cars last year , of which 90 % were exported to the rest of the European Union .	-2.8193
“ If Britain leaves the EU at the end of March without an agreement , I believe that it is on our plant to produce stops , ” said Marvin Cooke , CEO at Toyota in Burnaston .	-4.1095
Other British car manufacturers have expressed fears of leaving the EU without agreement on the modalities of cross-border trade , including Honda , BMW and Jaguar Land Rover .	-2.6569
BMW , for example , has already announced that his work in Oxford will be closed for a month after Brexit .	-2.7689
The most important concerns relate to what the automotive manufacturers say about the risks of the supply chain in the event of a " no deal Brexit " .	-2.8588
The production facilities of Toyota are based on needs-oriented manufacturing , which means that parts are delivered every 37 minutes by suppliers from the United Kingdom and the EU for special production .	-3.6013
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU on 29 March without an agreement , it can be delayed at the border that , according to industry data , can lead to shortages of delivery and partial shortages .	-3.5981
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day of stock in his work in Derbyshire , said the company , and thus production would be stopped .	-2.8587
Mr Clark said that Theresa May ’ s Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is “ precisely calibrated to avoid these controls at the border . ”	-2.7628
We have to have a deal , and we want the best deal that not only enables us to succeed , we also want to take this opportunity , ” he said the Today programme of BBC Radio 4 .	-3.7641
“ The indication not only of Toyota , but also other manufacturers is that we must be able to continue with what has become a very successful series of supply chains . ”	-3.0067
Toyota did not make any information about how long the production stop could take , but warned that , in the long run , costs could suffer the competitiveness of the work and finally lose jobs .	-3.9906
Peter Tsouvallaris , trade union representatives , and have been employing in Burnaston for 24 years , said that trade union members are increasingly concerned : “ In my experience , jobs are lost forever ” once they are dismantled .	-3.8282

The Trump meeting with Rosenstein could once again postpone , the White House	-2.7669
Donald Trump ’ s high-class meeting with the Deputy General Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein could be " postponed another week " , because the fight for the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues , read the White House on Sunday .	-4.0531
Rosenstein supervises the work of the special adviser Robert Mueller , who investigates Russian interventions in the elections , the links between Trump and Russia and the possible disability of the judiciary by the President .	-3.4031
Whether Trump will or not fire the Deputy General Prosecutor ’ s Prosecutor , and to endanger Müller ’ s independence , Washington has given much support for months .	-4.0672
Earlier this month , the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the wearing of a cable to record discussions with Trump and make it possible to remove the President from the 25th Constitutional Addition .	-3.0456
Rosenstein rejected an opinion .	-1.2172
But last Monday he was in the White House , while reports held that he was just before the resignation .	-3.4306
Instead , a meeting with Trump was announced for Thursday at that time in the United Nations in New York .	-2.5475
Trump said that he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein , but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a clash with the hearing of the Senate Justice Committee in Kavanaugh and one of the women , Dr Christine Blasey Ford , who accused him of sexual misconduct .	-3.2427
On Friday , Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into claims against Kavanaugh , and further delayed a full Senate voice .	-3.0361
Donald Trump ’ s press speaker Sarah Sanders was seen on Fox News on Sunday .              T      	-5.3408
Asked about the Rosenstein meeting , she said : ' A date for this has not yet been set , it could be this week , I could see that I was deferring another week , given all the other things that go before the Supreme Court .	-4.1722
But we will see and I always keep the press informed . '	-1.9976
Some reporters would challenge this claim : Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September .	-2.4885
The guest Chris Wallace asked why .	-1.2362
Sanders said that the lack of briefings does not rely on an aversion to television reporters who , like self-representatives , are behaving , but she also said : ' I will not be against them being on the gall  ' .                                         a 	-8.6288
She then proposed that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase .	-1.8339
'The President carries out more questions and answers than every President before him ' , she said and added , without evidence : ' We have looked at these figures ' .	-3.2582
Briefings will still take place , Sanders said , but should the press have the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly , that is infinitely better than talking to her .	-3.4030
We are trying to do a lot of this and you have seen how we have done in recent weeks , and it will replace a press conversation when you can speak with the President of the United States itself . ”                     	-5.5916
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in public meetings or press conferences with visiting dignity media .	-2.4145
