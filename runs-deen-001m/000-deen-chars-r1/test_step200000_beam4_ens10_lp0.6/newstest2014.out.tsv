Gutach : Even more security for pedestrians	-1.6338
They are not 100 meters from each other : Tuesday in Gutach the new B 33 pedestrian light at the village car park has been operated - in the view of the older town hall .	-4.5170
Two installations so close together : intention or civil strike ?	-3.3208
This question clearly answered Gutach ’ s mayor yesterday .	-1.9751
" The town hall was installed at that time because it secures the school route , " explained Eckert yesterday .	-2.8784
The Kluser traffic safely both cyclists and bus passengers and the Bergle inhabitants .	-3.0317
Yesterday 's official system is important for the Sulzbachweg / Kirchstra<unk>e crossroads .	-3.0126
We have the museum , two churches , the spa park , the bus stop , a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area <unk> Grub <unk> .	-3.0399
" At the high traffic and pedestrian revolution , another traffic light had to be found in their safety , " said Eckert .	-4.6913
This also confirms Peter Arnold from the Office of Offenburg .	-2.4489
" According to current measurements , around 12 000 vehicles on the B 33 every day are the municipality of Gutach , of which around 10 % of them are heavy traffic , " stresses Arnold .	-4.6847
Therefore , the construction of another traffic is more than necessary : " Security simply proceeds here " , said Arnold .	-3.4750
Overall , four traffic looks have been carried out , a roundabout has also been considered , but because of the closeness in the Sulzbachweg / Kirchstra<unk>e crossing area   r d '   .  T    i w    h w h a s . T 	-10.1038
According to Arnold , everything was tested at the location of traffic masts previously : " With an extra wooden tribe for us with particularly long tribes of loaded transporters we have tested whether these vehicles can exit from the Sulzbachweg to the B 33 without transferring the traffic masts " .	-5.7991
The approximately EUR 15 000 expensive traffic lights itself is the " most modern thing there is currently on the market " explained Arnold .	-3.9607
The complex is equipped with colourful LEDs , which shine so strongly that the lights are well detected by drivers , for example , in deep sunshine .	-4.5313
And economically it is also : the older lighting systems use about 100 watts , the new eight watt .                       i e  e 	-9.3323
There are three lights per direction per   di           	-5.5028
Arnold explained the technology of the new plant : This is equipped with two radar sensors .	-2.5117
Press the pedestrian the traffic button , the top radar sensor tests the traffic location .	-2.4565
If the road is free , it comes directly green for the pedestrian , if not , it takes about 15 seconds .	-2.6656
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase can be stopped for the pedestrian .	-2.3400
" If a group or handicapped people go over the road , the green phase is extended , so everyone comes safely about the road , " explained Arnold .	-3.6969
Of course , the driver must think here as a partner and watch the road .	-2.8716
This was not the case yesterday : hardly the traffic for pedestrians green , an upper class vehicle through - with bright red .	-3.5164
Josef Winkler has been writing the needs of his childhood and youth from the soul for more than 30 years .	-3.9648
The disasters of its Catholic village childhood - linguistic , slopelessness to raw violence and stumbling sexuality , closeness and friendliness - have often described the Carinthian poet .	-4.1616
The Büchner prize winner is mainly known as prosautor , theatre texts are rare in his work .	-3.6625
Collage made of prosatexts Gerhard Fresacher provides for its performance " Weather lights at the tongue leader " , which is now to be seen in the Garage X at Petersplatz , therefore collage of prosatexts together .	-4.6090
The theatre maker combines elements from the autobiographically characterized novel " Der Leibeigene " ( 1987 ) with prosaminiatures from " Leichnam , his family believing " ( 2003 ) .	-3.5341
On the largely empty stage - important requisite : a crushed sofa , where it is suggested and masturbated - the eight-headed ensemble is dependent on the text material .	-3.9328
Director Fresacher seems to have little trust in the text .	-5.3965
The 70-minute performance overturns the template with a wealth of directives , known from the repertoire of post-dramatic forms of game .	-3.4446
The actresses , in particular , are sometimes questionable in the scenic implementations .	-3.9971
They are tacked hard with the head under water , tacked to the wall with their evening tr .	-4.0598
Informed in cellophane or locals , they stack on dangerously high plates by staging , either monologizing them loudly or completely mutated on the stage floor .	-4.5838
The text , however , is hardly communicating in this intense way .	-6.3385
The best moments have the evening when sung - the bandwidth ranges from Deep Purple to popular songs .	-2.7164
Only towards the end will the rotated performance come to peace , and Winkler ’ s absurd humor flashes up .	-4.6423
A blackbox in the car ?	-1.3379
American road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the declining highway system , and believe that the solution has been found in a small black box that finds space in the armature board of each car .	-3.7598
The devices recording every kilometre driven and reporting information to the authorities are the core point of a controversial attempt by Washington and the planning offices of the states to revise the outdated system for financing US roads .	-3.8995
This is usually rather boring area of road planning has suddenly exposed an intensive debate with colourful alliances .	-3.4761
Libertarians have allied with environmental groups and argue that the government use the small boxes to record the driven kilometres – and possibly where they were driven – and then use the information for calculating tax modest                              	-7.4920
The Tea Party is horrified .	-1.5864
The American Civil Rights Association ( ACLU ) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of data protection concerns .	-2.6057
But , while Congress cannot agree on action , several states are no longer waiting .	-2.8041
They are currently checking how to change to a system over the next ten years when drivers per driven mile pay .	-3.1817
Thousands of drivers have already tested tachographs , some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring .	-2.0979
This is really a must for our country .	-1.6974
“ It is nothing that we may only use , ” said Hasan Ikhrata , Managing Director of Southern California Assn. of Governments , who plans to record the driven miles from all California drivers in the state from 2025 .	-3.7076
The way in which we pay these taxes will ch   .	-2.2879
The technology for this is t             	-5.4560
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund , financed from the taxes paying US Americans at the fuel pillar , is broken .	-3.6667
But America is no longer as much danced as before .	-2.5620
Cars use less petrol .	-1.1091
The state mineral oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon ( less than 4 Eurocent per litre ) has not increased for 20 years .	-2.4865
Politicians dare not dare to increase tax even to a cent at high prices .	-3.1340
“ The gas tax is simply not future-free , ” said Lee Munnich , an expert on transport legislation at the University of Minnesota .	-3.0227
Its state has recently equipped 500 cars with tachographs to test a mile-based payment system .	-2.5618
“ This is the most sensible option in the long term , ” he said .	-4.6538
Bureaucrats call it a mileage-based user fee .	-1.8174
It is not surprising that the idea of urban liberals is accepted , because the tax could , for example , be used to influence driving behaviour in such a way as to reduce traffic and climate-harmful emissions .	-3.9923
The Californian planners rely on the system of developing strategies to achieve the ambitious legally enshrined objectives of the state on climate change .	-3.3721
But the Republican Bill Shuster from Pennsylvania , chairman of the House Transportation Committee , has also stated that he sees the most viable long-term alternative in it .	-2.9731
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are also due to the idea of paying drivers after the route that has been returned .	-3.9377
“ This is not a tax that disappears in a black hole , ” explains Adrian Moore , Vice-President of Reason guidelines .	-2.4957
People pay directly for what they get .	-1.3482
The movement is also supported by two previous American transport ministers , who called on Congress in a report in 2011 to move towards mile-based billing .	-3.1297
The US Senate approved last year a $ 90 million expensive pilot project that would have included 10,000 cars .	-2.4967
But the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the initiative and responded to the concerns of Members from rural areas who represent people who , in everyday life , often have to resort to miles on the road to work o   or            .              	-6.4268
Several states and large cities are nevertheless moving in this direction at their own fist .	-3.0020
The most committed is Oregon , which currently recruits 5,000 drivers for the country ’ s largest experiment .	-2.8816
These drivers will soon pay the mileage fees instead of the mineral oil tax to the state .	-2.3910
Nevada has already completed a pilot project .	-1.3264
New York City also considers such a c           .	-4.5521
Illinois tests it to a limited extent with trucks .	-1.9419
And the I-95 coalition , including the Transport Ministries of 17 states on the east coast ( including Maryland , Pennsylvania , Virginia and Florida ) , is currently examining how to introduce the change .	-3.0650
The concept is not a universal hit .	-1.1426
In Nevada , where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with the equipment , drivers were sceptical about the idea that the government could pursue each of its movements .	-3.1107
“ Concerns about Big Brother and such things were a major problem , ” explains Alauddin Khan , Head of Strategy and Result Management at the Transport Ministry of Nevada .	-2.8475
People did not want it .	-1.1403
When the test arrived , the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website : “ It would be relatively easy to turn the tachographs into sophisticated monitoring equipment . ”	-3.6118
There is no need to build a huge , bulky technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals .	-2.7266
Nevada belongs to a number of states which are now looking for affordable technology , with which the state can collect the driven kilometres , but not exactly when and where .	-3.5572
In that way , Khan , the public would also be more reassured .	-2.6363
Hunting after this technology has led some authorities to a small start-up company called True Mileage in California .	-2.3691
The company was originally not appearing to help federal states tax drivers .	-3.2422
Instead , it was their goal to take foot in an emerging market for vehicle insurance where drivers should pay on the basis of the driven miles .	-6.2155
But the devices they test are also interesting for the road planners , because they do not work with GPS and provide limited information that is regularly uploaded by modem .	-3.3345
“ People are rather prepared to participate in when their speed and locations are not recorded , ” explained Ryan Morrison , Managing Director of True Mileage .	-3.0866
Some of these public pilot programs made great mistakes .	-2.0109
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways of implementing this .	-1.9214
In Oregon , the planners experiment with giving drivers a number of selection options .	-2.4153
You can choose a device with or without GPS .	-1.6842
Or they do not choose any device at all and pay a flat charge instead on the basis of the miles driven average by all the inhabitants of the st                            	-7.5340
Other places hope to sell the concept of a mistrustful public by equipping devices with more functions than with less .	-3.0927
In New York City , transport officials want to develop a taxation device that allows parking fees to be paid , insurance only for driven kilometres , and speed data collected by other vehicles in real time , thanks to which drivers can evade congestion .	-4.7045
“ Drivers would be motivated to participate by the added value of the advantages the system offers , ” said in a city planning document .	-3.0859
However , some transport planners wonder whether talk about paying per mile is not just a huge diversion manoeuvre .	-2.8716
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay stated officials that Congress can solve the problem of bankrupt Highway Trust Fund simply by increasing fuel taxes .	-5.9521
An additional unique fee or an annual tax could be imposed on drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume little petrol , so that they also pay a fair share .	-3.4456
“ There is no reason for operation , if an aspirin is sufficient , ” explains Randy Rentschler , the Head of Legislation and Public Affairs of the Commission .	-2.9656
If we do that , hundreds of millions of drivers are concerned about their privacy and many other things .	-2.5938
King Field : Small Team Beats Waker	-2.1868
The voluntary fire brigade handled its autumn test despite shortages of personnel with Bravour .	-3.6702
Only eleven man participated in the exercise .	-1.6962
Department commander Hans Kammerer had chosen the property of Feder in Burgberger Strasse in his exercise assumption .	-3.8452
A short circuit should be created when sawing .	-3.6767
The emerging fire and smoking development injured two people , but one of them could send an emergency call .	-3.0093
After the first review of the situation by Hans Kammerer , two respirators of the defence made themselves prepared to enter the building .	-3.9089
After a short time , it was possible to find the first person and guide it to the free .	-3.4947
The second person had to be borne .	-1.5007
This was not so easy because it was also a close stairway to overcome .	-3.2574
The building , a workshop with integrated stable for two horses , was not easy to secure .	-2.2720
It stored a lot of wood and also strawballs in it .	-2.6100
Furthermore , there were electrical machines for woodworking .	-2.7236
The first delete attack was carried out by the tank in the vehicle .	-2.6253
Another direction took place through an overflow hydrant in about 100 meters distance .	-3.5156
Three delete attacks have now been designed .	-2.2373
The building also used a hollow blasting tube .	-3.1861
Hans Kammerer also demonstrated what staff available with little available .	-4.0439
In serious cases , support for the Königsfeld daily operation group is carried out .	-3.5594
The commander was satisfied with the exercise .	-2.0836
Important networking of universities and companies	-1.8997
At his visit to the Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald district , President Guido Wolf also enlisted in Titisee-Neustadt where tomorrow 's workers come from .	-3.8226
At the High Black Forest Centre , he addressed this important issue together with the Managing Directors of Vocational Schools , as well as the circle gymnasium and the Chairman of the Paren                 	-6.3302
" Education is an important location factor " , stressed Claudia Stehle , director of the Hans-Thoma school , which presented the networked school project educational centre University Forest .	-3.3566
Wolf impressed himself with the model projects for training .	-3.2650
Since 2011 there has been a successful cooperation between the funding centre , the circle gymnasium and the professional school centre .	-3.4730
He also praised family friendliness in the county .	-2.3138
" It is important not only to have the family phase in view , but also because of demographic change the phase of maintaining members ' care , " explained Wolf .	-3.5593
He also indicated that more and more employees were concerned about the care and care of their families .	-3.4819
" Without employers ' support , the resulting burden on employees can lead to an end to the employment relationship , " said Wolf .	-2.7687
But nobody can afford to lose qualified workers , he said further .	-2.0463
Another particularly important factor is the networking of universities and companies .	-2.1427
" Because anyone who has met the benefits of the region already during his studies will remain with his acquired knowledge and his skills often to the regional economy , which contributes to strengthening the region , " the President of the Land was convinced .	-4.7793
Only if sufficient training places were offered can the need for professionals be met                               ee   	-8.5684
In his opinion , the location advantage of the district is its beneficial situation in the southwest of Germany , close to France and Switzerland .	-3.3193
He also experienced the efforts already made to develop public transport on his railway from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg .	-3.0274
" Remain tenacious and ensure that public transport is better " , he explained to the address of the local politicians present .	-2.9862
Experience an Entertaining Afternoon	-1.6536
For 15 years the Kaul family has been inviting Dietinger seniors to coffee , cakes and then to a vesper .	-3.3020
In the past , the older fellow citizens were welcomed in the restaurant .	-3.1799
Meanwhile , this afternoon will take place in the care secret St. Josef .	-5.2965
The residents looked forward to the delicious cakes and cakes .	-2.2824
Later there was salad .	-2.0597
With common melodies , Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich maintained .	-2.3994
The more than 100 years old natural stone wall as the front delimitation of the old school court to the Kirchstra<unk>e should be placed once again on the recovery plan of the city of Bräunlingen .	-4.8951
In the days before the Kilbig , a small angle wall , stabilization and static discharge of the over a hundred years old natural stone wall was installed in the first work of renovating the front school court .	-4.2127
Alexander Misok from the Bräunlinger Town Office provides for the further approach to include the local monument office in planning and create a reconstruction concept for the old wall .	-5.0121
Afterwards , a cost calculation should be made by professionals who will then be put on the table to the Council of Local Decision and to define the further approach .	-4.4096
A decision on this is likely to be taken next year .	-2.1711
Following the renovation , paving and tree planting of the old school courtyard within the two side wings of the 1912 , school must be built as a follow-up measure , the restructuring wall from ground to renovation and put on new underbuilding .	-5.3443
The historical , one hundred years old definition wall of the old school court to the Church Road is particularly through water and frost damage , since no drainage is present , renovation needed and has an arch forward .	-4.8465
Deep cracks in individual stones show weather damage , but the wall is currently not at risk .	-7.3243
A state-of-the-art wall is a prerequisite for a school courtyard used by students , which has been done by the current fortification                    	-6.4299
Originally , school recovery was even planned in 2008 / 2009 , but high unplanned expenditure brought a delay .	-3.7457
One important word about the historical renovation of school walls , which has already been used for film recordings , will be the most important of the country             .	-5.7945
If the specifications come from this page , then the city of Bräunlingen hopes for subsidies from the monuments .	-3.6313
The students of the Bräunlinger Primary School , which are now being informed again in a well-renovated old school building with new aula , can soon use the old school c                 .	-8.3092
<unk>zdemir wants to receive jazz training in Stuttgart	-2.1014
In the ongoing discussions about the future of the music universities in Baden-Württemberg , Cem <unk>zdemir , Germany ’ s Chairman of the Greens , has now also been enabling himse t .	-4.7509
" I think it is wrong to give up the holistic training at the Stuttgart Music Academy , " said <unk>zdemir the " Stuttgart News " .	-3.4270
Jazz and classic are just at the jazz site of Stuttgart .	-3.0282
This contradicts <unk>zdemir , who applies in Stuttgart as a favourite for a direct mandate during the federal election on September 22 , the Green Red Government .	-6.5970
This is based on an expert study a reorder of the five music universities in Baden-Württemberg .	-3.6334
Afterwards , the course of jazz and pop should be shifted from the Stuttgart Music Academy at the Mannheim University of Museums .	-7.1326
US Border : " Super Tunnel " to Drug Smuggling	-2.2080
At the border between Mexico and the US , investigators have discovered and decommissioned a " super tunnel " to smuggling drugs .	-2.5480
As the US customs authorities said , the more than 500 meters long tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity , rail transport and a ventilation plant .	-3.5262
Three suspects were therefore arrested , eight tonnes of Marijuana and almost 150 kilograms of cocaine were confiscated .	-2.4848
According to the information , the tunnel was not yet used .	-11.2372
" These cartels are stupid if they think they could go through under the radar , " said the US Southern California District General State Prosecutor , Laura Duffy , at a press conference before a storage house in San Diego , where that was an end to the tunnel .	-4.1827
Insured Duffy : " If you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them , we are determined to make this a huge waste of your dirty money " .	-3.6496
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a permanent fight against drug cartels .	-2.2820
Since 2006 , more than 77 000 people have been killed in Mexico concerning drug crime .	-1.9897
Constructed by Experts	-1.2317
Because of the expensive equipment of the tunnel , the investigators assume that he was designed by architects and engineers and that the construction took up around a year .	-3.5369
The track was equipped to use electrically operated cars there .	-2.9071
On the Mexican side , access is located in a building that is 80 meters from the border .	-2.5374
According to the authorities , a head of 20 meters leads to the depth of the actual tunnel entrance .	-4.5593
The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 meters height and 90 centimetres width .	-2.3673
It would have also been appropriate to promote illegal immigration in the direction of the US      .	-3.2935
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine fund .	-1.9804
The third , a Mexican , was taken because of the confiscated Marijuana .	-2.6332
All three are threatened as the maximum penalty of lifelong freedom , as officials said .	-2.8559
Since 2006 , eight such tunnels have been discovered , the press conference in San Diego has continued     .	-5.9767
But it is the first time that such a tunnel construction was found cocaine .	-2.5244
Normally , cocaine is smuggled in smaller quantities , not through tunnels .	-2.2639
This shows the " despair " of the drug gangs , whose traditional routes have now been cut off , said Bill Sherman of the DEA drug training DEA in San Diego .	-6.2356
They would do everything possible to get to the US .	-1.9048
No details have been announced about the arrested persons , at least one was Mexican , it was said .	-3.5004
They must expect prison penalties up to ten years .	-2.2989
2014 Will Be Geisinger Festival	-1.6020
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250 .	-2.1023
Returning to the first reference mention is increasingly closer .	-3.8206
When the year ends in good eight weeks , the anniversary year is at stake .	-5.6224
Intellectuals and church houses have been mentioned for the first time in 794 .	-3.4863
In churches a document has been made in which both places are mentioned     .	-3.6007
On 15 March there should be an official starting point for the anniversary year , and since voices currently do not have any hall , this performance will take place in the place where both were first mentioned 1250 years ago , in Church houses .	-5.3163
Within the framework of the anniversary a number of events are planned in both Geisingen and Church houses .	-3.1760
Church houses will be 1250 in July at a festival weekend from 18 to 20 July .	-3.0167
Celebrate again .	-1.5011
On Friday with a festival , Saturday and Sunday with a festival around the Church Valley .	-2.5613
This weekend is also the Church House Church Festival .	-3.2396
Music Director Rudolf Barth has written an order composition for the city on the occasion of the anniversary .                       	-6.6775
On June 21 , together with the sun celebration of the Black Forest Association , on 12 July in the Arena with fireworks and on December 13 , as the first concert of city music in the new hall .	-4.0777
This will be finished in the anniversary year and the official date is last September , 27 and 28 September .	-3.5312
On the occasion of the Geisinger City Anniversary , a new chronicle is also being published .	-3.0137
" But it should become a chronicle not only of vocals themselves , but a printed work on today 's vocals , which consists of minds , church houses , leipzigs , outfings and good madings , " said Walter Hengstler .	-4.9852
And the spirit of today celebrates 2014 birthday , in 1974 today 's space was completed with the communities .	-3.9852
The new chronicle will be presented in Geisingen on 21 or 22 November in the new hall .	-2.9860
2014 , however , is also a year with many anniversaries .	-2.3588
The Strohglonki noise starts on 8 February with a customs evening on the occasion of its 60th anniversary , the harmony of Gutmadingen will be 90 years and has the festival banquet on 29 March and then celebrates the district music festival from 1 to 4 May .	-4.6591
The Altenwerk Leipferdingen will be 40 years old , the Geisinger School has been at the new location for 50 years and celebrates this on May 10 , the Polyhymnia Leipferdingen music association will be 150 years old and celebrates this within the framework of the Well Feast from July 4 to 7 .	-4.5608
The city of Geisingen was mentioned for the first time in 764 in a donation document owned by the St. Gallen monastery .	-3.2591
The documents were manufactured in churches ( houses ) , which was then a judicial place .	-3.1507
Both communities are therefore mentioned in the same documents .             	-4.6558
Celebrating this 1250-year-old accordingly in 2014 , in addition , the community reform is still behind   4     y                  	-7.0350
Council is taking the track systems	-2.9378
Should the railway transition " Am Hirschen " be converted to increase road safety ?	-3.1461
Yes , the local councils have decided .	-1.5682
Shiltach must take EUR 220 000 into hand for this .	-2.7935
Deutsche Bahn wants to improve the Kinzigtal railway this year .	-2.4888
In particular , safety of railway transitions should be increased - regularly there are nationwide collisions of trains with other vehicles .	-3.8452
If the communities agree to the reconstruction measures , they must participate with one-third in the costs , the rest share the railway and the covenant .                    	-6.2536
Schiltach 's city tree master Roland Grie<unk>haber explained the Council of Local Council the special characteristics of the transition " Am Hirschen " .	-3.6914
There , the city plans to build an exhibition in the height of the tunnel mouth there west of the train track .	-4.0100
There could also be larger vehicles , for example those who transport long wood , in counter-traffic without having to                    	-6.9098
Grandholders therefore proposed to construct a necessary support wall in such a way that the city can disseminate the subsequent road in due course to ensure a smooth flow of transport .	-4.1629
This was controversially discussed in the Council of Municipalities because some Councils doubted the need for road proliferation : Thomas Kipp , with his expression , brought the mood of critics to the point : ' Do we have to take so much money for so few vehicles ? '	-4.4895
Mayor Thomas Haas contradicted : The railway transition " Hirschen " is regularly used for long-wood transport .	-3.1281
Even wood from the area " Kuhbach " is partly transported over this route , because up to 20 meters long vehicles could not use the route on the Häberlesbrücke because they could not turn into the main road there .	-4.1441
In addition , the route serves as a redirection for those vehicles which must not use the tunnel when the main road is locked , argued Haas .                   	-5.8672
Since it is important to see that church mountains and castle tunnels need to be rebuilt and renovated , as is currently the case in Wolfach , the railway transition " Am " Hirschen " can also be an important transport significance for a longer period of tim                    .	-6.9224
The Councils agreed to investigate what costs would cause the intended spread of the road .	-6.7397
Nevertheless , the majority of these were agreed to the reconstruction of the railway transition with the measure that the necessary support wall will be built in such a way that the city can expand the subsequent road " railway station " where necessary for meeting transport to around 5.5 meters .	-5.1870
The reconstruction of the railway transition at the Gerberei Trautwein could , on the other hand , affect access to the highly increasing " Geroltzhäuser Weg " .	-4.3396
The administration had investigated the reconstruction plans of the railway from the Breinlinger engineering office because it had doubts about whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhäuser Weg would be without any f          	-5.1238
The investigation came to the result that it is not possible to exclude that the inclination conditions of the road could lead to longer vehicles sitting .	-3.8042
The responsibility for this is in turn bearing the city as a road builder  .         T is       the       	-9.8635
The reconstruction can therefore affect liabilities .	-3.4194
Because both wooden and turning worked in the current state of expansion , you should not agree to the reconstruction of the transition , Haas argued .	-4.2273
At this point , too , the risk of a collision of turn with a transitional vehicle is significantly lower than the other railway transitions , because it is directly next to the centre where there is a good visibility connection .	-4.9644
Even trains from the main railway station would have to be at this point as far as there is no collisi . T                              	-9.3915
The majority were refused to reconstruct this transition , because the city of Schiltach would have to " expand " the problem with sitting vehicles , so the Councils can withdraw from responsibility after the construction work can be concluded .	-5.1392
As unproblematic , the body considers the conversions to the railway transfers " Before Heubach " and " Before Kuhbach " , for which crossing agreements have already been reached with the railway .	-6.9426
Esa decides on large space missions : missions for billions	-2.0053
Remote planets , gravity waves or black holes - European space agency experts must now agree on two major projects they want to start in the next few years .	-3.3678
30 suggestions were chosen , five are still in the race .	-5.2297
Distant worlds .	-1.4213
More than 1000 planets in other stars have already found astronomers .	-2.1344
Whether there are at least some of them , none knows .	-2.3832
The selection is difficult : Should you look for gravitational waves ?	-2.7210
Or rather explore the origin of cosmos ?	-4.9829
Or discovered according to similar planets a                    	-9.9993
These questions are precisely those responsible for the European Space Agency Esa .	-2.2725
For their programme " Cosmic Vision " , they are looking for ideas for two large space projects that should bring about crucial progres en in researches .	-5.8423
The budget for such " L missions " is about EUR 1 billion .	-2.6894
The start will probably be 2028 and 2034 .	-1.6508
In early September , Paris met the elite of European space research to discuss proposals for such missions .	-2.3062
30 ideas were debated , five of them have now come into the closer choice .	-2.8553
Many bodies examine the proposals , have followed by researchers .	-3.5584
In the next few days , a final decision should be taken by the scientific programme committee .	-2.5657
Overall , four major questions have selected the Esa to which the Cosmic Vision programme initiated in 2007 should find answers .	-3.4039
What are the conditions for the emergence of planets and life ?	-1.8186
The exact transactions in the creation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus also the emergence of planets that reverse these stars - are still in the proverbial darkness .	-4.2526
A large infrared telescope in all could penetrate this darkness   e   .   T                	-8.0309
And if a star has a planet , under which circumstances can life be created  t             	-5.9958
To address this question , the space telescope " Cheops " will be launched in 2017 , which will examine 500 planet systems already known in our nearest environment more closely .	-6.5313
But the possibilities are limited , cheops is a small mission with a budget of EUR 150 million .	-2.3871
With larger instruments , the astronomers could display similar planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres , searching for " biomarkers " : gases that are considered an indication of biological activity .	-3.8281
How does the solar system work ?	-1.1702
This question should ultimately inform the conditions for the emergence of life .	-3.6260
An important role plays the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field as well as the particle radiation wit       p   s                              	-7.3746
In our solar system , these operations can be examined examples .	-2.7577
With the " Solar Orbiter " , the Esa has already approved a mission of the M class ( there is a budget of about half a billion euros ) for this issue .	-3.5741
The probe will start in 2017 and watch the surface and activity of the sun closely .	-2.8212
Jupiters and his moons are of great interest to researchers .	-2.1022
They want to find out the role of the giant planet in the development of the solar system .	-2.2994
For this , the Esa provides the first of the total three L missions of the " Cosmic Vision " programme .	-2.9043
The probe " Juice " ( Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer ) is expected to begin its trip in 2022 .	-2.8071
Eight years later , it reaches Jupiter and should examine the atmosphere of the planet , as well as the icy moon Europe , Kallisto and Ganyme   .	-5.1195
What are the basic physical laws of the universe ?	-1.5008
The World Valley offers many opportunities to study matters under extreme conditions and to examine whether the natural laws we know are still valid there .	-3.6886
Perhaps divergences that could pave the way for physicists to a new theory under which all known natural laws can be united .	-3.8051
How did the universe emerge and what is there ?	-5.8868
Our cosmos was created by the bang 13.7 billion years ago .	-2.3247
In addition to the stars , planets and living beings we consist of , there are dark matters whose gravity holds galaxies and clusters together , and dark energy that accelerates the expansion of the world all .	-7.2065
So far , researchers have neither known what physical laws were valid in the first second fractions of the bang nor what Dark Matter and Dark Energy consist of .	-3.3341
With " Euclid " , the Esa has already approved an M mission whose start is planned for 2020 .	-3.5841
With a special telescope , the probe should examine the distribution of the matter in the universe for the first time in the entire sky , thereby allowing for conclusions on the nature of dark matter and dark energy .	-4.2297
Who Could Make the Race	-2.1973
Of the 30 proposals , at the end of the selection procedure , only two other proposals will   remai        	-4.9841
The best opportunities for granting a L mission have , in the opinion of many experts " E-Lisa " , a demanding concept for the proof of gravitational waves .	-3.7758
Physicists understand changes in the structure of space time that Albert Einstein predicted nearly 100 years ago .	-2.7077
They have not been proven to date .	-2.1547
Elisa could manage to do that , hope the scientists behind the projec  e            	-6.4276
The mission provides for a detector consisting of two or three probes , which is stationed in all .	-3.1179
Unlike plants on earth , it could also demonstrate gravitational waves created by the bang , thus providing new knowledge about the emergence of cosmos .	-4.2668
Four other proposals are still competing for the second L mission : a large radio telescope called ' Athena ' , which is intended to explore black holes , ' Icy Planets ' , another mission to the outer planet of the solar system , ' Prism ' , a mission to measure the cosmic background radiation , and the ' Exoplanet Finder ' , which is supposed to feel and investigate similar planets .	-4.8418
Amongst other things , proposals for the sample return transport of Mars , the exploration of moon , venus and asteroids , as well as solar physics , are already extended .	-4.4495
Snowden is ready to “ cooperate ” with Germany on US monitoring .	-2.4402
Edward Snowden , the whistleblower of the US secret service , has explained that he is prepared to travel to Berlin and to say before the German Bundestag if the American National Security Agency and its Director Keith Alexander do not give answers about their activities .	-4.0108
The German MEP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden on Thursday in Russia , where this asylum has been given to discuss with him the statement in Germany .	-2.9045
In a letter from Snowden , which was presented to the media in Berlin on Friday , it writes : “ Although the result of my efforts was demonstrably positive , my government continues to treat a divergent opinion as a loyalty and attempts to criminalize political expression with penalty threat , where no defence is possible . ”	-4.8274
But saying the truth is not a crime .	-1.8975
In the letter , Snowden writes that he is convinced that support for the international community can convince the American Government to make the charge against it .	-3.5108
The US Department of Justice includes spying and theft of state ownership .	-2.5391
The German Home Affairs Minister , Hans-Peter Friedrich , said against time online : “ When Mr Snowden is ready to speak with German representatives , we find ways to enable that . ”	-3.7701
Relations between the United States and Germany are burdened by the claims that the NSA has listened to Chancellor Angela Merkel 's mobile phone .	-2.9049
Thomas Oppermann , the honourable Member , who led the parliamentary committee responsible for the intelligence service , declared that we should take the opportunity to listen to Snowden as witnesses if this is possible , “ without jeopardising him and ruining the relationship with the United States completely . ”	-5.5380
Strong , a Green MEP , published an image of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed .	-2.6559
He was accompanied by two German journalists in his visit to Russia .	-1.8345
Ströbele said that , according to the lawyer of the former NSA staff , Snowden cannot return to Russia when he leave the country .	-3.0916
If Snowden says in Germany , he needs an assurance that he is “ safe ” there , so the Member .	-3.1097
Snowden explains in his letter that he suffered from a “ serious and ongoing ” persecution campaign that displaced him from his homeland .	-3.4480
However , it is affected by the global response to “ my act of political expression . ”	-2.5354
Citizens around the world , as well as senior politicians – including in the United States – have described revelations about an uncontrolled system of comprehensive monitoring as a general merit .	-3.2868
In his letter , Snowden makes an offer of cooperation to the German authorities “ when the difficulties around the humanitarian situation have been resolved . ”	-2.9083
Frontier Airlines charges for hand baggage	-1.8195
Frontier Airlines plans to demand up to $ 100 of passengers who want to stow hand baggage on their flight .	-2.6529
Frontier Airlines intends to calculate up to $ 100 for a piece of hand baggage and 2 dollars for coffee or limonade , even though in the announcement on Wednesday , passengers should keep the whole c            e                       e     e	-9.3272
The new charge is valid for hand baggage in the baggage baggage , small bags under the seat are still free  e           bag                 	-8.7523
Frontier explained that USD 25 would be charged when the fee was paid in advance , and $ 100 for travellers who were only paying at the flight close .	-4.3674
Frontier-Speaker Kate O 'Malley said that the fee of USD 100 is aimed at moving travellers to take care of the payment in advance .	-3.2922
“ We do not want to charge this amount , ” she explained .	-4.5858
Airlines began in 2008 to demand charges for the first and second baggage piece .	-2.7766
Passengers who tried to circumvent them have therefore luggaged into the hand baggage as much as possible , meaning that the baggage spaces are often overfilled by the seat .	-4.3751
Fees are a way of moving passengers less on board .	-2.3652
O 'Malley said that the new fee is not really about earning money .	-2.0610
It is about the most loyal customers of Frontier , who would have made it clear that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find space above the seat .	-3.5764
Passengers who buy your tickets on the airline 's website do not have to pay .	-2.2408
This means that a passenger may be allowed to take a baggage free of charge on the Frontier aircraft , but the next person must pay $ 100 for a comparable baggage .	-4.0421
O 'Malley explained that the website of Frontier and the check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers were informed about the charge before they could come to the climb .             	-4.8122
The new hand baggage fee of Frontier will only enter into force in the summer ; there is no exact date yet .	-6.9205
Passengers often shine above baggage surcharges and other charges , but airlines are happy to accommodat it  .                      	-7.5254
They argue that the transportation of luggage should cost money and passengers should pay this service if they wish i    .	-3.5087
Many on Wall Street see the new baggage fees as a sign that airlines take enough money to cover the costs of air travel after years of losses .	-7.7748
Most of them have so far left the fingers of charges for hand baggage .	-3.0061
Spirit Airlines Inc. required three years ago the first charges for hand baggage and later Allegiant Air , also a cheap flyer .	-3.1808
The only other airline company with such a charge is the Hungarian Wizz Air , declared the airline consultant Jay Sorensen , who is closely following the additional fe      .  The only   extra cha is the extra fee .	-6.4269
He estimated in a December 2011 report that the Spirit hand baggage fee will bring USD 50 million a year .	-3.0617
Sorensen , who previously had a leadership at Midwest Airlines , recently flew with Spirit and was curious what would expect him at the flight clock if passengers were faced with the unusual hand baggage fee of the company .	-4.3124
“ The boarding process was one of the most smooth in my career in aviation , ” he said .	-2.4972
I expected to see teeth cnirches and hand-tangible discussions at the flight climbing .	-3.7952
“ The plane was full , ” he explained , “ and the boarding ran as lubricated . ”	-2.3710
Frontier also follows the 2 dollars required for coffee , tea , limonade or juice .	-2.3701
The company explained that passengers who bought Limonade or Juice , who are likely to keep the whole can and coffee free of charge                 	-6.1931
Water is still free .	-1.4268
US Airways soon tried to demand money for refreshment drinks in 2008 , but made this reverse seven months later , after passengers had complained and not any other large society were drawn up .	-7.1097
Frontier ’ s step to charge fees for hand baggage if passengers do not buy directly with the airline is the latest initiative to direct customers to their own website .	-3.5936
Airlines pay online travel agencies such as Orbitz 10 to 25 USD per sold ticket .	-2.3669
This gives all companies an incentive to move passengers to buy directly instead of an online travel agency .	-2.8576
However , Frontier has gone furthest in this area .	-2.9234
In September , the company began to provide only half so many frequent flyer miles when booking via an online travel agen       .	-3.7783
On Wednesday , the miles were reduced to 25 % of the flight route .	-2.4846
A third-party flight trip with Frontier over 1000 miles is therefore only 250 miles to customers .	-4.0549
Passengers can also book spaces exclusively when buying directly on the Frontier website .	-2.7927
Frontier has a loyal customer base in Denver , but the business shrinks and the company loses money .	-2.9275
The revenue decreased by 9 % and the flight capacity shrinked almost 13 % in the first quarter , as is read in the financial report published on Wednesday by the Mother Group , Republic Airways Holdings Inc . .	-3.7794
Republic has tried to get the finances of frontiers under the sale of the company .	-2.8168
Sayings Come from the Bible	-1.7301
Well 40 women visited the last women 's breakfast this year in the evangelic church community Bisingen .	-2.6596
Theme of the day in the municipality were " sayings from the Bible " and " Middle Ages " speeches .	-3.2595
Zita Köhler , the chairman of the Church Community Council , entered the biblical sayings after breakfast .	-3.3711
" Proverbs contain lifestyles , regulations or warnings , " she explained .	-2.7372
It compared several sayings with the relevant Bible stations and explained the importance .	-3.0790
She called sayings like : wood eye is vigilant as scales fall from the eyes , throw an eye on someone who gives the Lord in the sleep , his hands innocent .	-3.6528
Several times , the supporter also advised her listeners on what saying it was .	-3.3830
The Middle Ages ' speeches adopted Christel Dehner : all good things are three , blue , do something .	-7.4080
She explained the importance and origin of the speeches she called ' bridges in the past ' .	-2.6565
Finally , a raffle has been lost .	-2.9633
The prices were covered on a table and were humorously written before they were passed to the winners .	-3.0544

Learning instead of unemployed : Pilot project for unskilled tourism	-2.4796
A pilot project for the tourism industry is launched at the Mecklenburg Seenplatte .	-6.3217
Under the leadership of the Federal Agency , 49 women and men who are already working as unskilled in the industry should be qualified for three winters to specialists for hotels and restaurants .	-3.6367
" New is that the six-month courses end with conclusions , " said Carmen Wiechert from the Neubrandenburg working agency .	-2.8957
The benefits are varied : the participants would not be unemployed , the companies would get trained professionals that were increasingly lacking in hotels and restaurants , and the Agency does not have to finance unemployment .	-3.9071
The Industrial and Commercial Chamber of Commerce in Neubrandenburg and the Deutsche Hotel- und Rüstättenverband ( Dehoga ) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern are also involved in the project .	-3.2689
NSA explains that an “ internal error ” and not hacker are blame on the crash of the site	-3.2214
The shadowy National Security Agency declared late Friday that a mistake had paralysed its public website a few hours and not hackers , as was claimed online .	-3.3408
“ NSA.gov was not available for a few hours this night , as an internal error occurred during a planned update , ” the spy agency explained in a message sent by email .	-3.7991
The problem will be fixed this evening .	-7.8329
The claim that the default has been caused by a distributed Denial of Service Attack ( DDoS ) is not true  .                                        	-9.6556
In the early evening hours , online server trackers noticed that the NSA website was unavailable for at least six hours and that this was not accessible for some users .	-3.8820
Previously , a speaker of the NSA declared that the sensitive internal network of the authority was “ in no way ” compromised .	-3.0840
Secret information is not at risk , the speaker .	-1.7992
At least one group of hack tivists used to paralyse the NSA website with a DDoS attack .	-2.4788
In such attacks , the target website will be flooded with page calls until the servers are overloaded and the website collapses .                	-5.1248
Cybertactics are relatively simple and the attacks do not serve to enter the internal network of the target system .	-2.5581
The earlier super-secret NSA , whose nickname once No Such Agency ( no such authority ) , has become in the bright light of the public and is subjected to sharp criticism following the revelations that have been known in recent months about its extensive monitoring program at home and abroad – a result of secret NSA data stolen and published by the disillusioned former NSA employee Edward Snowden .	-5.1559
The growing controversy about the intelligence service fueled initial speculation about the incident today is the result of a targeted cyperoperation .	-3.3577
Easily falling is the number of people without jobs in October by 22 to 1,                 	-4.9081
Although the quota was 3.1 % better than last year , and also better than in September , " we would have hoped more " , says Monika Felder-Bauer , Deputy Officer of the Agency for Work in Sonthofen .	-3.8393
Because numerous businesses have so far been responsible for settings .	-3.5616
One reason for this is according to field farmers : " We have little specialists in crafts , healthcare and old care " .	-4.0725

Loss of profit at Bombardier after declining in delivery and orders	-2.9579
The Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15 % decline in the net profit on Thursday , after pressurising through declining orders and deliveries on aircraft in the third quarter , as well as contractual problems in the railway party .	-4.3787
Bombardier with headquarters in Montreal also published no flight test data for his brand new CSeries aircraft and did not give new information about whether the aircraft could go into commercial use under the ambitious timetable next September .	-3.8072
On the journey flight of the test aircraft one and a half months ago , only three further starts have so far followed , which makes it questionable whether the test phase runs as planned .	-4.3308
The results remained behind the forecasts and led to a course of more than eight percent on the Toronto stock exchange .	-3.2636
Cameron Doerksen , analyst at National Bank Financial , reduced his assessment from “ outperform ” to “ sector perform ” on Thursday that shares have a limited potential for the next one to two quarters .	-3.3823
“ While weaker delivery numbers were largely expected on aircraft , we are very clearly disappointed by margin development in the transport sector , ” Doerksen said in a customer letter .	-3.7114
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries if the test program is moving forward for the aircraft .	-2.8076
However , if no new orders are announced in the coming months , we expect the market to become more sceptical to the program                                                 	-9.7762
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft can catapult the company into the lower market segment currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus .	-2.5997
The first test aircraft was presented to the public in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delays .	-2.5944
But so far , binding orders for the CSeries with 177 are moderate , since potential buyers want to wait for the results of the flight tests and see whether the company ’ s claims are relevant to fuel efficiency and cost savings potential of the new nozzle aircraft .	-4.0971
There are currently 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies .	-2.0428
Chairman Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will achieve its target of 300 binding orders at the beginning of the commercial use of the jet .	-6.5492
The corporate governance also insured on Thursday against analysts and media , the programme is in the date plan .	-6.7557
“ The test aircraft has no longer remained on the ground than expected , ” said Beaudoin at a telephone conference and added that the aircraft ’ s standing time had been set ground testing and software updates .	-4.0221
Every manufacturer plans differently .	-1.8224
We have decided to make a first flight and then append a revision period , which we have done .	-2.9136
This is happening throughout the flight programme .	-1.6635
The second of five test aircraft will probably start in the next few weeks , the remaining brief afterwards , was said by the company .	-5.9707
However , analysts remain sceptical whether 12 months after the Jungfernflug of the first customer can operate an aircraft of CSeries .       i a         is  the one w	-8.3710
Bombardier explained it checked the planning for the commissioning ( EIS ) and will update them in the next few months .	-5.4853
“ The slow progress of the flight test – even if they apparently correspond to Bombardier ’ s internal planning – reinforces our view that the commissioning of the first quarter of 2015 , ” said Doerksen                   	-5.8469
In the third quarter with the end of September 30 , Bombardier ’ s net gain fell to $ 147 million or 8 cents per share of $ 172 million or 9 cents per share per year .	-6.9519
The adjusted profit per share is unchanged 9 cents .	-1.9657
Sales gave slightly low and fell from 4.2 to $ 4.1 billion .	-2.7314
Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and $ 4.56 billion sales , saying Thomson Reuters I / B / E / p    .	-3.5293
The world ’ s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer indicates that he has delivered 45 aircraft in this quarter , a decline of 57 last year .	-2.8891
The net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26      .	-2.6610
The order book in the air and space parts was $ 32.9 billion on 30 September and was unchanged to 31 December .	-3.2827
“ In the field of aerospace , the results were disappointing within the framework of our requirements , but the low order intake and market conditions as a whole were disappointing , ” said Beaudoin .	-3.7771
Sales in the aerospace part fell by $ 13 % to $ 2 billion .	-2.4664
Bombardier , the world ’ s largest railway manufacturer , announced that turnover in this spart has risen by almost eleven percent to $ 2.1 billion .	-3.0671
The order book in the transport party was $ 32.6 billion on 30 September and was thus easily increased to 31 December .	-3.4071
The profit margin in the field of transport was affected by settlement problems in some large contracts .	-3.1454
According to corporate governance , there will be new provisions for the fourth quarter .	-4.0636
In the afternoon trade on Thursday , the Bombardier share continued by 8.5 % , and was $ 4.83 , after announcing that the Google Financial Board Patrick Pichette will switch to the Board .	-4.2920
The Brazilian Embraer SA , the world ’ s third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier ’ s closest rival , reported a ten-percent decline in quarterly profit on Thursday .	-4.5461

Cocaine-dependent lawyer , who warned drug boss about police investigation , must prison	-2.4441
Basharat Ditta , 42 , provided information to underworld size	-2.0925
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction	-2.5511
He was condemned by the Liverpooler Crown Court to three years imprisonment	-2.2636
A well-known criminal defender warned a drug baron against a major police investigation because he was afraid that his secret drug addiction could be detected was condemned to three years imprisonment .	-3.5216
Basharat Ditta , 42 , supplied Underworld Size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about investigations on his activities in drug trafficking after he was compromised by his own cocaine   .	-5.7371
The criminalist lawyer with the top nickname “ Bash ” was arrested in his house in 2011 after the Scarborough police monitored that he represented in an earlier drug procedure .	-4.3388
Officials observed how Scarborough ( 32 ) delivered three bags cocaine at the house of the lawyer in Blackburn , Lancashire , while they were with colleagues at a meal of the Chamber of Law .                           	-6.8652
The investigations contributed that Ditta regularly consumed class A drugs after testing cocaine traces in his hairs , on his wallet and credit card had e         .     A                               ,  	-12.3989
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011 , he tried to provide information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners .	-2.7236
All four suspects were monitored by the police within the framework of a large investigation procedure for heroin and cocaine trading in Lancashire , Cumbria , Merseyside , Berkshire and W Wes    Y                   	-5.4034
Together with 32 other people , they were arrested later , after the police ensured a series of house searches heroin and cocaine in the value of 1.5 million pounds and 200,000 pounds of cash .	-3.4827
Ditta , 42 , gave information to the criminals further because he feared his drug addiction can become public .	-2.5864
Today , Ditta , who works for the Forbes Solicitors firm in Blackburn , was found and condemned for guilty on the Liverpooler Crown Court after a three-week procedure in two charges for disability of the judiciary .	-4.1499
He gave cocaine ownership in an earlier survey .	-2.9006
The lawyer was transferred after the police found out in their investigations against Scarborough that it was in regular phone contact with Ditta in February 2011 .	-3.4001
Two investigators followed the suspect and saw how he went to Ditta ’ s house and there put drugs below the waste tonne of the lawyer with a purity of 60 % in a black golf glove .	-3.7443
Shortly after he delivered the drugs , Scarborough regularly phoned with Ditta , who was in the football stadium of the Blackburn Rovers in Ewood Park .	-3.5345
The lawyer returned home , drugs recovered and then nine communications were exchanged between the two .	-2.9214
Before court , Ditta was a “ regular consumer ” of cocaine after discovering class A drugs in his hairs , his wallet and on his credit cards .	-3.6359
Ditta was arrested later , but disputed to take cocaine and said that he spoke to the alleged dealer because it was his client , and claimed that their discussion was subject to the “ lawyer secret . ”	-3.7275
During his arrest , Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a series of credit cards , but they were ensured and a hair test was taken .	-2.9131
At the police intervention he said that he would call an office and client at home for legal affairs both in his private address and in the workplace .	-4.0437
It was known before the court that he had called for important arrests of drug trafficking , some of which he had represented before , and informed what the investigators knew about them .	-3.9278
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said : “ A criminal lawyer should know better than anyone else that you do not break the law . ”	-2.6574
Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal defender because he has too much involved with certain clients .	-3.3234
The relationship in question is not simply that of a drug dealer , but of a drug trafficker who provides his lawyer with drugs                        who is      	-8.7367
Part of his communications was undoubtedly legitimate , because he was the lawyer of these people .	-2.4966
But that was far beyond the borders of a normal relationship between lawyer and client .	-2.3999
He worked as far as possible to police investigations so that they could continue to deal with their criminal activities .	-3.3522
Mr Ditta disreputed his profession .	-10.4507
He stood too close to certain clients , especially Scarborough , and allowed his independence to be compromised .	-2.3856
Ditta pointed out every misconduct of itself and said : “ If I were a corrupt lawyer , which I am not , and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough , I would not wait 15 hours , but would do so immediately . ”	-3.6697
But after the hearing , Superintendent Lee Halstead said from the police in Lancashire : “ Mr Ditta has taken the step from a criminal defender to a criminal at the moment when he began to buy drugs from organised criminals . ”	-3.4015
His cocaine dependence led to hopeless compromise and made him supportive of the motives of leading members of organised crime that commissioned him to obtain valuable information about police investigations .	-3.8558
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure trust and confidence in the public .	-2.2045
Ditta has gone behind this confidence and tried to get away behind the facade of his profession                  	-7.4371
The Serious and Organised Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigations against Ditta , which also led to condemnation in three cases because of the ownership of cocaine and judicial obstacles , which underlines our determination to bring criminals to justice .	-3.4273
This case should be a warning for criminals and shows that none of the arms of the law can escape .	-2.7521
We find you and bring you before court .	-2.1966
Scarborough himself was condemned to 14 years imprisonment after guilty of conspiracy for heroin , cocaine and cannabis trading .	-2.9637
Thirty-five more people involved in drug trafficking have been condemned to total punishment of 153 years for drug offenders .	-7.3520
On his website , Ditta published an area with questions and answers about himself that his dream job was to represent clients in the death cell in America , his ultimate guest when dinner is Mohammed Ali and opportunity inequality is the motivation for his work .	-3.7615

At the end of the celebrations from the occasion of his 160th anniversary , the song Dunningen will frame two God services with the " Deutsche Messe " by Franz Schubert .	-4.0028
After the great success of the musical " Rock my Life " , which the viewers enthusiastically enthusiastically spring this year , the song branch will enrich two God services with the performance of the German Fair of Franz Schubert .	-4.5037
On Saturday , October 26th , this exceptional fair will be heard from 19 during the evening fair at St. Martinuskirche Dunningen and Sunday , October 27 , at 10.15 a.m. at the St. Johannes Baptistkirche in Lackendorf .	-5.6623
The so-called Deutsche Messe with the original title " singing to the celebration of the holy victim of the fair " , D 872 , is a spiritual musical work of the composer Franz Schubert dating back to 1826 and was considered almost revolutionary at the time of the emergence .	-4.4906
The trade fair is listed in the context of the God 's services , as the client Johann Philipp Neumann had  in m   s   .	-4.6974

Haslach : Skepticism is Growing Confidence	-2.6496
For example , the 2015 elections to the Parish Council will change fundamentally in the Haslach ( SE ) Soul A Unit .	-3.9026
There is only one common parish council for all six parishes .	-2.0370
On Saturday the bodies of Haslach , Hofstetten , Mühlenbach , Fischerbach , Steinach and Welschensteinach prepared for changes in a joint meeting .	-2.9176
Because there is nothing more to change the fundamental decisions of the diocese and it is up to the parish communities to implement them as satisfactory as possible .	-3.7223
During the course of the day , it was particularly clear : the scepticism against the new is softening but increasingly confident   .      e            	-7.6526
From the ideas and expectations of the innovations in 2015 to concrete proposals on the future composition and the size of the parish Council of Paris , the extremely constructive talks of the six bodies with the main officials of the Soul Organisation team were enough . The              e  e   	-6.4664
Regionaldekan Georg Schmitt explained the newly taken guidelines for soul organizations in Archdiocese Freiburg by means of a presentat    .                           	-7.1640
Afterwards , the SE Haslach , as a church community , constitutes a corporation of public law that enters into the rights and obligations of the six individual church communities so fare .	-7.2426
There will only be one common parish council and a foundation board in which the Paris force is represented .        T                          	-8.9814
At least two elected members should be represented from each parish , and the six parishes are formed on the ground .                             	-7.8264
Their task will be to promote the church life in the place .	-2.7163
The question of the finances of the individual parish community then showed significant needs for discussion .	-3.6871
The innovations provide for accumulated credit to be preserved in the parish .	-3.0956
The liabilities , on the other hand , are transferred to the overall com .        ,            	-7.9607
There have been great concerns , particularly with regard to the major investments which then make all parishes .	-3.7648
" In the past , only investments have been made in projects that could be managed by individual parishes alone " , relativised Haslach 's parish chairman Bruno Prinzbach .	-3.8029
Practical experience with a common body for five parishes described Barbar Knights , the chairman of the body in the Seelsorgeunit Schutterwald-Neuried .	-3.5084
They had made themselves a task in 2006 , ' one is going to remain , five ' and had to say that this is not so easy .	-4.3268
The bodies of the Haslacher Seelsorge Unit then answered the questions about the future composition and size of the Common Council of Parish and the practical work of the community teams .	-3.7306
Drafting will be concretised in further meetings and decided in another joint meeting of all six bodies next spring .	-3.3149
At the end of the day , parish community Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the Soul Organization Unit , which was approved by a clear majority     .	-5.7525
In Pfullendorf , the Electricity	-1.7291
The citizens of Pfullendorf must adapt to higher electricity costs .	-2.3604
As the managing director of the city works , Jörg-Arne Bias , confirmed opposite the S<unk>DKURIER , a four-member family of pulling villages account for 70 to 90 Euros a year .	-4.5012
The essential reason for the forthcoming price increase is the increase in the so-called EEC survey from 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt hour .	-3.3186
Every year in October , this system is reset by the four operators of the large electricity roads .	-3.7437
These are the additional costs that they create from the energy transition , which they can collect through an electricity price .	-4.3011
The works of Pfullendorf form the last link in this chain .	-2.2614
The Supervisory Board of the Energy Company has even forecast a higher deal , as Jörg-Arne Bias reports .	-3.4481
Now the specific payments would have to be calculated before the city works could inform their customers of the exact price increase next week .	-7.3068
" We go out of an increase of 1 cent plus x , " says Bias , with the number rather near the 2 cents .	-3.5380
Traffic light in the Red : Waiting Time  :	-6.4708
Sometimes a traffic is simply not green .	-2.0981
The contact loop in the street does not respond , or the light mark is defective .                           	-6.8799
What should we do - with red ?	-2.7752
If an affected long enough waited for a red light and the crossing is free , he can continue , explains the Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine " Motorcycle " .	-3.9014
The waiting time must be " appropriate " , which can be interpreted differently from case to case .	-2.8762
Becker advises to have at least five minutes before the traffic disturbance is out .	-3.8550
However , anyone who continues despite red light must be aware that he is fully blamed for an accident caused by it .	-3.7378
Anyone who tolerates less than five minutes may not wait long enough , warns Becker and refers to a decision by the Hamm Supreme Court                                         	-8.7681
In the negotiated case , a driver after about three minutes of duration had ignored the traffic and had to respond to a negligent red light violation .	-3.5744
In fact , the traffic was not defective , but leaped little later to green .	-3.3682
A ban on driving has been spared because of the specific situation - but the fine was not      e        	-6.4459
Local Council is pleased with solid budget	-2.3698
Whenever it comes to municipal meetings in the budget , Mayor Ralph Gerster has laughed well .	-2.8754
The community bag in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and debt has no longer known the administration since 2005 .	-2.7967
The 2012 financial year can also be achieved as a full success in this regard .	-2.9051
This was clear in the idea of the 2012 annual accounts .	-2.5605
As Andrea Rothmund explained , the administrative budget , with approximately EUR 7.6 million , had been higher than planned .	-2.8373
The surplus of the administrative budget is also about EUR 1.8 million above the approach .	-2.7196
In particular , the surplus owes higher trade tax revenues and the community 's share of income tax .	-3.6039
The asset budget was again clearly above the planned values .	-2.8055
Instead of the earmarked EUR 1.5 million , it was EUR 2.5 million last year .	-2.4267
" This is essentially because of the higher administrative application , " said Rothmund .	-3.4789
Since in the financial year 2012 less investment was made than planned , the reserve introduction has also been higher .	-3.8362
Overall , the general reserve could be increased by around EUR 2.1 million to a total of EUR 4.9 mi                        	-4.9032
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for the good work .	-1.7389
" Such a work is not simply shaken from the sleeve , " Gerster praised with a view to the annual accounts .	-3.5519
He and the local councils were visibly looking forward to the go numbe             	-5.2362
It may sound paradoxically , but these good figures could soon cost citizens expensive .	-2.7669
Through the good financial position , the community has been able to renounce high rates in the past .	-3.4383
This , however , has often reduced subsidies from the country according to the Gerster  .           e tee      	-9.2761
There are conditions for these subsidies from various compensatory stocks .	-3.1684
Amongst other things , the cities and communities that apply for grants must provide certain lif rate    .        I        a      	-9.0937
" We have to look at the subject of lifting rates because in the years to come , investments for which we would like to have subsidies , " announced the former in this context .	-4.5416
Nagold : Hugo Wermter has been in Chorus	-5.1605
At 60 years as a singer , Hubert Wermter ’ s history at the men ’ s singing association Caecilia is almost twice as long as that of the autumn festival , where he was solemnly honored .	-3.9427
Hubert Wermter was on the stage as usual in the colours of his men 's singing club    .	-3.4698
Even after 60 years of age , singing with the choir that has now become more than won than loved .	-5.0771
In the association , Wermter was also active , including 28 years as a member of the committee .	-2.5887
He received several awards for his commitment and commitment : Jörg Kohr , pastoral reference on behalf of the Caecilia Association Rottenburg-Stuttgart , presented him - since the choir is also a church choir - a declaration of the Association and a honorary letter signed by Bishop Gebhard Fürst .	-4.6469
His singer colleagues presented him with the documents of the German choral association and a serious interior .	-3.6992
In addition to the honour , the 31st autumn festival was carried out in the usual railways : With the MGV Betra , the songwriter Saltstetten , the singer department of Baisingen and the local music association , the full maringers loaded a colourful mixture of different choirs and singing styles that managed the around 400 visitors .	-5.6108
The MGV Full Maringen opened with atmospheric songs such as " Im Weinparadies " and " Fun , her Brothers " .	-5.2524
Her honor singer Hubert Wermter prepared a small standch for honour - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart 's " Federa          "        e   e          	-9.9072
The men 's singing association Betra also sang classical choral songs such as " hunting advertising " by Julius Wengert , " Weit , weit , weit " von Hubert Goisern und das Volkslied " Wann du durchgehst durchgehst durchs Valle " .	-4.2299
The song base Salzstetten provided for the festival with his mixed choir and women 's group - the " Impulschor " .	-4.4567

He said that the new media tribunal “ will always be prejudiced , because it is an extended arm of the government , ” and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya ’ s position in the global economy .	-3.0127
“ I hope the President will listen to us and we appeal to him to reject this draft legislation and send back to Parliament , ” he said .	-2.8996
According to the newspaper The Star , the government takes the new law “ the media effectively into a stranglehold , ” but , on the other hand , The Standard , Democracy and Freedom of Speech in Kenya would have “ suffered a serious blow , ” and asserted the draft as “ draconian . ”	-4.0701
The adoption of the law belongs to a number of measures to strengthen national security in deployment of attacks by armed Islamists on the Westgate shopping centre in September .	-3.3592

Mr Max Maier , please come to Gate 24 .	-1.3108
Like this , there will no longer be at Vienna Swedish Airport .	-3.2440

Creating a more relaxed atmosphere is the aim of this innovation .	-2.0490
As Airport-Speaker Peter Kleemann announced towards Radio Vienna , Vienna Airport follows an international trend with the adjustment of performances affecting individuals .	-3.9553
Among other things , airports in Copenhagen , Frankfurt or Dubai are already refraining from noisy calls .	-3.2100
By losing these transfers - on average , around 200 personal calls by the speakers on one day - it will be more calm at the airport in the future .	-4.7307
" It has also been shown in experience that these individual transfers were relatively little perceived , but at the same time also all other information about changed flight climbing or departure here goes below , " said Kleemann in conversation with the radio station .	-4.6263

Milk and Egg Alternatives a Overview	-2.3448
Vegan nutrition requires vegetable alternatives to eggs , milk and milk products .	-1.8425
For example , pointed tofu with plant coating is a quark set .	-3.3790
Others call the vegetarian confederation to Worldvegantag on November 1 .	-3.2619
The vegetarian confederation of Germany proposes a series of vegan alternatives on 1 November :	-2.8508
Pure plant margarine is a good alternative to butter , Yoghurt replace with soyayogurt .	-2.6872
Instead of milk , soya , port , almond or rice milk can be used .	-2.0223
Conventional plant sanitation replace conventional strike .	-4.0751
There are also vegetable alternatives to eggs .	-1.7540
Half crushed , mature bananas , for example , can replace an egg as binding means in a cake .	-2.6401
Also 50 grams of apple must or a dining spoon milled slopes plus three dining spoons of water are suitable for this .	-4.2928
Lockers become doughs instead of eggs , for example , with a mixture of a tea spoon of backpowder , a dining spoon and three spoons of mineral water .	-4.2991
But also 50 grams of soyayogurt or silk tofu can fulfil this purpose .	-2.7885
According to the Vebu , around 800 000 people are now vegan in Germany , so purely vegetable .	-2.9707
Sleepless in New York	-0.9437
On the way to their host families in Weymouth , Massachusetts , the students of the Black Forest gymnasium know the American city of New York .	-2.9638
After eight hours of flight it went right to Brooklyn Bridge , overlooking the heart of the city , Manhattan .	-3.3950
There was already a fascinating view of the world-famous skyline , which makes it a special attraction in the evening .	-3.5555
By shifting time , students were nearly 24 hours on legs , but faithful to the motto " The city does not sleep " the day was decided on Times Square .	-3.6137
Despite Shutdown , the freedom statue could be reached by a ferry on the second day and walked on foot .	-3.3619
Afterwards , the financial centre was about Wall Street to the memorial of 11 September .	-3.3168
On the third day , the students from the 373 meters high viewplatform of the Empire State Building won an overview of the fascinating large city and enjoy the view .	-10.2585
Afterwards , the hectic driving of the New York streets went over the Rockefeller Center to the Central Park , which offered an ideal opportunity for a short relaxation in the aut s .                          e	-7.6755
After a short flight from New York to Boston , students have now arrived in their host families and experience the school day at Weymouth High School .	-3.2159
Also this year , a Hubertus Fair is celebrated at the Hülsbergstra<unk>e on the name of the Holy Hubertus in the parish church of St. Marien  .	-6.7925
St. Hubertus was a rather reckless hunter , converted by a vision and later appointed to Liege 's bishop .	-3.4185
The hunting bubble group of Westphalians under the direction of Brigitte Kluth musicians on performers ( natural horns in the mood Es ) after old , originally French melodies .	-3.9096
The bubbles wear riding clothes because they primarily accompany riders , horses and hundreds on slepping hunts musically .	-4.1287
The formal trade fair takes place on Sunday , November 3rd at 11.30 a.m.	-2.7241
The newly designed opschlag shines with a new cafe .	-1.9606
One that invites you to stay and recover .	-2.5573
One that wants to make the name the programme .	-1.9218
According to Lexicon , Déjà Vu is a psychological phenomenon which is expressed in the feeling of having experienced or seen a new situation .	-3.6175
In case of visiting the same name café at Opschlag in the Kreisstadt Kleve in view of the University of Rhine-Waal , it does not have to stay with the pure Déjà Vu feeling .	-4.2130
After all , the café has the goal of making an actual stay not only thoughtful but always handful to experience .	-8.3601
Because it 's just fun and just beautiful .	-7.6433
A look at the inner life on Opschlag 8 gives the viewer a good feeling on hike .	-3.4807
The state-of-the-art but not cool café ambience looks like a place to feel well                 	-5.3286
Here the team pampers with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the top the guest with various coffee or cocktail variants .	-3.1096
There are delicious cakes or individual fresh baguettes .	-3.0022
The owners , both 33 years old , have already made a name before the opening of the jewelry café at the Opschlag as a gastronomer : in Kranenburg they led the " Art Lounge " .	-3.8573
From the move to Kleve to the Opschlag the sympathetic café lovers hope for more audience .	-2.9294
Not least by the university .	-2.2015
" We do not have a certain target group , " stresses Daniel Büttner .	-2.6959
Rather , the two young students here want to address the same seniors and all age classes in between .	-3.5197
Apropos Café lovers .	-1.3111
The sympathetic holder couple is behind coffee enjoyment .	-2.5392
Enjoys the fragrant hot brew in different variations .	-7.2240
Expressofan	-1.9253
Daniel Büttner is rather the Expresso fan and Mirjam van der Stelt die Cappuccino-Trinkerin .	-2.2260
" This is a baguette - that is my thing " , betrays them to the NRZ .            	-5.1635
Two events already gave us at the bright café .	-2.6657
One thing is better   sa   .	-3.3042
Because the port festival took place rather outside - the Café Déjà Vu did not benefit from i            	-4.9887
But there was also the ring night .	-1.8674
" Beautiful , successful and funny " , the two 33-year-olds found .	-2.2475
But not everyone 's matter .	-1.7350
Perhaps Daniel Büttner is not therefore an excellent fan of event evenings : " You cannot make it all right now . "	-7.5737
And with an event I only address those who are interested in the special event .	-5.6659
That is why events will be more exceptional to us .	-2.4900
" We want to disrupt the very normal operation as little as possible " .	-2.4976
In other words , Déjà Vu stands for reliability .	-2.3151
With regard to the quality of the products offered here , as well as the team and the beautiful environment at the Opschlag in Kleve .	-2.9939
The road that develops more and more into a catering mile .	-2.3972
For the pleasure of many glasses , the guests from close and far away and the students who discover the guest rome and therefore the Café Déjà Vu for                 	-6.8751

In the association local of the restaurant " Witteborg " in Dinker enjoyed all the harmonious coexistence in the sign of music .	-3.9215
Traditionally , the Foundation Festival is always the appropriate festivity to make honours .	-2.7863
This time Rolf Wagener was pleased with the special award " Singer of the Year " .	-3.0849
" You have written not only much for us , but have also turned so many rounds for us , for that our warm thanks , " said Chores Erich Schlotmann .	-3.8049
The awards for participation in the appearances and choir samples this year went to the Dieter Schulze Choir Leader with 44 participations , followed by the Chairman of Horst Pier-Ribbert , the Chairman himself , and the last year 's singer of the year " Friedrich Winkler with 42 participations .	-9.3041
Place five Notenwart Artur Brückner .	-2.6182
A particularly thankful thanks to the Board of Management of Association Ange Pier-Ribbert , who once again had charmed a menu of the extra class and who was to Gerda Pier-Ribbert for the table decoration .	-4.9292
The MGV " Friedrich-Wilhelm " always meets its regular choral samples at 9.45 p.m. in the Association Loc every Tuesday .	-5.9170
" New song-joyed voices are welcome at any time " , says Schlotmann .	-3.2193
UN Announces New Poverty Reduction	-2.2065
The United Nations is now beginning to draw up a number of new objectives to replace the Millennium Development Goals announced twelve years ago to combat poverty .	-3.3368
In the run-up to the UN Summit on Sustainable Development , which began in Rio de Janeiro in the evening , Australian diplomats played a key role in the introduction of “ sustainable development goals ” to replace the Millennium Goals that expired in 2015 .	-3.4566
They were included in the final draft document adopted by global leaders , including Mrs Gillard , at the summit .	-2.1449
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at the summit that the time had come to “ think beyond national interests . ”	-2.5916
“ I am pleased that the member states have agreed to tackle a process that should be agreed with universal , sustainable development goals , ”       h s     said .      T              e               	-10.1864
“ These objectives will build on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the framework for development after 2015 .	-2.7909
I will not spare any effort to implement this mandate given to me by the Member States to achieve our vision of the sustainable development goals built on the success of the Millennium Goals . ”	-3.1662
Although the SG Achim / Baden has been without victory for four days , the handball upper ligists continue to prevail .	-3.5591
Trainer Tomasz Malmon is no doubt at all .	-2.4101
Everyone is still fully motivated in the matter .	-2.1438
Nevertheless , I hope that we will finally win again .	-2.5492
" Because I already do not know how such a victory tastes , " Malmon expects a success experience from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II      .	-4.1068
Even though the third league reserve from Fredenbeck has not yet removed trees , Malmon warns the finger in advance .	-3.7348
Many players I myself trained in the A youth .	-2.9856
Therefore , they will be particularly motivated against their ex-coach .	-2.5470
" It also needs to be seen whether there is still an amplification from the first in the process , " shows the SG-Coach .	-4.6745
In order to return to the track of success , the Malmon team must increase compared to the past appearances .	-3.2292
Above all in the coverage work and the switch game , it hapered enormously .	-10.6516
Recycling of opportunities must also definitely be better .	-2.3944
So I hope my players finally got the head during the short break .	-2.5863
Security concerns in Mozambique grow in the face of clashes between influential personalities	-2.4682
Thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo under the vigilant eyes of the statue of Samora Machel , the founder of the state and the first President of Mozambique to adopt peace in a rare public demonstration .	-3.4012
“ We want peace again , we want stability , ” said Vanessa de Sousa , Managing Director of an investment company .	-2.3131
Fearing the country ’ s future , it has exchanged its business clothes against a T-shirt with the address “ We demand security ” in Portuguese and joined the amount on Thursday in the capital ’ s independence place .	-4.2663
For two weeks nearly day , there have been reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo , which have been among the worst combatants since the peace agreement over 20 years ago .	-3.4463
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement , which initially supported by the White ruled Rhodesia and later by the South African apartheid government , was endeavouring to destabilize the country ’ s independent government .	-3.7123
Under the 1992 Peace Treaty , it became an opposition party .	-1.9715
Analysts consider it unlikely that the country falls back into an expanded conflict , but recent events have worried foreign investors and locals .	-3.1223
There is a lot at stake for the rapidly growing economy , because the discovery of huge gas reserves off the coast and coal bearings in the northwest could bring investment of more than $ 50 billion in the coming years , such as Rio Tinto , Vale from Brazil , Eni from Italy , and Anadarko .	-4.3113
The ruling Frelimo party , the dominant force since 1975 , and Renamo have blamed each other for tension .	-5.4438
Renamo claims that the government had provoked recent clashes by attacking its members on 17 October in the province of Sofala , a traditional high castle of Renamo .	-3.1451
The attacks on former rebels escalated when government forces attacked Renamo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama , the leader of the group , declared Renamo ’ s speaker against the Financial Times .	-3.1640
The government blames Renamo for clashes and accuses the organisation of having attacked soldiers .	-2.2154
President Armando Guebuza has tried to downgrade concerns about instability .	-1.7411
Towards AFP , the French news agency , he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama considered itself a “ loser , ” who “ wants to use all his remaining forces to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government . ”	-3.5518
Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they want to avoid war .	-1.8394
But the concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted with the words that Renamo issued the 1992 peace agreement .	-2.8359
Towards the FT , he said that he meant that Frelimo did not respect the agreement anymore .	-2.9381
“ Our vision is to resume negotiations , seriously , ” said Mazanga .	-1.8988
Previous talks between the parties have contributed little to resolving the tensions fired by a number of clashes this year .	-2.9001
“ We have two adult men here ( Guebuza and Dhlakama ) who clash the heads , ” says Joseph Hanlon , teacher at Open University and Mozambique experts .	-3.3810
None of them is well in negotiations and none is prepared to make the necessary concessions .	-2.4659
Renamo , which is pressing for electoral reforms , has already stated that it will boycott local elections in November .	-2.6635
Presidential and parliamentary elections are planned next year .	-4.6777
Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as the attempt of a sicking movement to achieve concessions and financial benefits from the government        .	-3.9430
Renamo ’ s electoral successes have been shrinking since 1992 , while a newer party founded by an earlier Renamo member Movimento Democrático de Mo<unk>ambique ( MDM ) , probably will improve in the elections .	-6.4310
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – whose resignation is under way if his second term ends next year – wants to destroy the country ’ s democracy .	-2.9482
“ He does not want multiparty democracy , he does not want transparent elections , he does not want peace because he does not want to give up the presidency , ” said Mazanga .	-2.9964
It is unclear what Renamo capacities have , but it has made unrest attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important North-South connection .	-3.4897
Most of the fights took place in the province of Sofala , which is several hundred kilometres north of Maputo , but where Beira is located , the port , the mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale use to export coal .	-3.9218
In June , Rio suspended the use of the railways for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the route .	-2.5795
Mazanga responded cautiously to the question of whether Renamo will repeat this threat .	-2.1759
Renamo wanted “ the international community to warn that things are not good in Mozambique , ” said Mazanga .	-4.3711
Instability has increased the frustration of the government , says Fernando Lima , head of Mediacoop , an independent media company , because many people have already concerned about corruption , slow progress in development and a recent wave of abduction .	-3.6153
“ People think that the government and the President are responsible for the future of the country and he should be the one who finds solutions to the problems , ” he explains .	-2.8835
Omar Sultane , a demonstrator , said that people just wanted stability .	-1.6616
“ No one interests Renamo and Frelimo , they just want peace and usable roads , ” he explained .	-2.5319
Children should get myths and legends as “ models for life , ” an author means .	-2.7045
The stories of Thor showed that “ brutal force has no chance against clever tricks , ” and the Artus legend demonstrate how important it is to have a dream .	-2.7167
But many of the myths are “ too far too wild , too offensive , and in some cases too dirty to be taught at schools , ” so Crossley-Holland called for a “ careful selection ” of age-just works .	-3.7442
“ I find it wonderful that myths and folklore are already part of education in America , ” he said .	-2.1362
I have proposed this as a plan for twenty years .	-1.9043
In addition , for authors and teachers who are “ excessively didactic ” , children would be “ completely disabled , ” because in entertaining stories the messages would be “ underscored . ”	-4.1395
Crossley-Holland , who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales , explained : “ You can pursue certain intentions , but you should keep them in mind as possible . ”	-3.3991
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an author writing for children is the need to convey hope .	-2.8796
Not everything has to be simplified or lead to the happy end , but there is an immanent sense of good and evil .	-2.2408
This must be underscored , revealed by history and not explained .	-2.8917
This is the old story of showing instead of telling .	-2.3401
Hansjakob Drags into Freihof	-2.5767
100 years ago , Heinrich Hansjakob referred to his age residence in Haslach , on Sunday his last years were alive in the " Freihof " .	-3.3266
The many viewers were enthusiastic about the extremely short-term scene game .	-2.5104
From arrival to awarding honorary citizenship to his death , screenbook author and Hansjakobdarsteller Alois Kraftzcyk had designed an entertaining piece which was applauded under the direction of Cornelia people .	-4.1203
Marcus Zagermann took the audience as a spokesman with the ten different scenes , explained connections and bridged time jumps from youth to nearby retirement .	-3.2136
On 22 October 1913 Hansjakob comes home to his children 's sky , into his free courtyard .	-4.6161
And then the scene game began in which Alois Krafczyk once again shined in his paraderol as the great son of the city .	-3.2222
He presented still with the two-panner and " Black Forest Foxes " by Erich Becherer from Mühlenbach .	-3.8501
He was not only received from the audience with a lot of applause , but his sister Philippine welcomed him .            ( 1 )         	-7.4343
Billy Sum-Hermann understood it incredibly good to engage in the role of sisters and gave her enormous life in mimic and gesture .	-3.1690
Between the individual game scenes , the Mühlenbach farmers ' chapel played appropriately selected pieces of music and thus rounded off the performance .	-3.8316
In order to award honourable citizens , Haslach ’ s mayor Heinz Winkler gave himself the honour that , in representation of the then official holder , Hättich , together with part of the City Council , made his expectations .	-4.9027
Their expectations then made the three king singers who led Hansjakob to the call : " Oh how beautiful , there will again be youth memories of my own three-king time " .	-5.2438
With their song " O Jesulein " they enjoyed the audience in the courtyard as well as the stork day children with their loud " Heraus , Heraus " .	-3.7095
His criticism of the Official Church then expressed Hansjakob just as much as his concerns about the excesses in agriculture , the consequences of industrialization or the effects of war .	-3.5100
He found his retirement site in the hometre , behind his tomb chapel on the fire at Hofstetten .	-3.7520
" A troubled spirit finally found his peace and had gone forever , " it was at the end of the scene game .	-3.6286
A lot of applause and many commendable words were from the audience for performance .	-5.0399
Basketball : The Hope of Neckar Giants	-1.6496
The opportunities for the remainder of the League of the sportively declined Ludwigsburg Bundesliga Basketballers have increased .  This is why  t       has	-7.4805
Because there should be a wildcard procedure , then there is now a competitor less for the Neckar Giant .	-2.8175
The Hamburg Towers basketball project refrains from applying for a possible news square .	-3.1372
" We will not participate in the Wildcard procedure " , said ex-national player Pascal Roller , who has been setting up the concept for a proficient club in the Hanseatic City since 2012 .	-3.6586
A first breath was not to hear from Ludwigsburg .	-2.8727
" We did not deal with the Wildcard procedure until Düsseldorf receives no license , " said Neckar-Giant Boss Alexander Reil of our newspaper .	-3.3190
Until 23 May , Aufsteiger Düsseldorf Baskets can submit documents to the Arbitration Court and prove its economic Federal League Suitability .	-6.7063
So far , however , the license has been denied twice to the Rhineland          	-4.7896
The arbitration court is the last resort .	-4.2082
Haigerloch : Church of the evening meals in the Point	-4.2742
As a contribution to the 150th anniversary of the Evangelic Church in Haigerloch , the cultural and tourist office of the city dedicates the last of its public topics on Sunday , October 27 , the evening meal church .	-4.0511

Snowden Might Say in Russia	-1.9264
The former US intelligence expert , Edward Snowden , could also make statements in the US speaker in his Russian asylum .	-3.2919
Representatives of the Federal Prosecutor ’ s Office may either ask questions in writing or make personal meetings in Russia for the 30-year-old        .	-4.8672
This reported the Interfax Agency , invoking non-named circles , which are familiar with the situation .	-3.0185
Such a question can be resolved intergovernmentally , it was said .	-3.0037
A Snowden exit from Russia is practically excluded .	-2.4035
" In this case he loses his refugee status " , the agency quoted its source .	-2.1327
Because Germany is ally of the US , Snowden threatened to deliver there , it continued to s             e             	-9.3516

Court blocks decision on the NYPD	-12.9330
On Thursday , a Federal Appeal Court in the United States blocked the order of a judge calling for changes to the Stop-and-Frisk Program ( “ Stop and Search ” and “ Search ” ) of the New York Police Department , and abandoned the judge of the case .	-4.4881
The 2nd US Appeal Court declared that the decisions of judge Shira Scheindlin would be suspended until the city was appealed .	-3.5669
The judge judged in August that the city violated the Constitution with the way in which the programme for the continuing and questioning of people was implemented .	-3.5306
The city appealed against its assessment and the remedies arranged , including the decision to set up a monitoring centre to support the police in amending their directive and the relevant training programme .	-3.8353
The Appeal Court heard the arguments on the requested suspension on Tuesday .	-2.4621
The appeal report stated that the judge must be exempted from the case , because she violated the Code of Conduct for US judges , by determining that a judge should avoid the appearance of partiality ; this was partly justified by a number of media interviews and public statements in which she publicly responded to the criticism of the Court .	-4.8021
The judge had judged that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people because they inappropriately targeted black and Latin American men with the Stop-and-Frisk Programme .                      	-5.8518
She appointed an external position to monitor the implementation of substantial changes , including reforms in guidelines , training and supervision , and ordered a pilot program with a quarter of cameras where most controls were carried out .	-4.2210

In 2004 , four men , who belonged to all minorities , submitted complaints that were developing into a collective act .	-5.5567
Supporters of changes to the NYPD Stop-and-Frisk Programme say that changes will end unfair practices and create a more trustworthy and more effective police and influence the way other police presidencies use the regulation .	-3.5804
Opponents believe that the changes would dampen the police ’ s moral , but not crime ; they would also waste money and do not solve the broader problem of a police under pressure after the disappearance of thousands of jobs in the last decade .	-4.3917
The judge pointed out that she did not end the stop-and-frisk practice that was constitutional , but reform only the kind of implementation of controls by the NYPD .	-2.9736

Coulson used telephone hacking for checking a tip .	-2.2602
The former news of the Word editor Andy Coulson supposedly used “ telephone hacking , monitoring , and confrontation ” to confirm an incorrect tip about an affair of the then Interior Minister , Charles Clarke .	-3.6732
In May 2005 , Andrew Edis QC declared the court in Old Bailey , News of the World heard a wrong rumour that Clarke had a relationship with his “ attractive special adviser ” Hannah Pawlby .	-3.7068
The newspaper commissioned the private detective Glenn Mulcaire with hacking Pawlby ’ s voicemails , and pursuing them , but Coulson also called them and left behind news as the court learned .	-3.9879
“ According to the Public Prosecutor , Coulson , who is now editor of NotW , is no one who is facing the apartment of people and hopes to stage them in fresh action , but one who likes to face people with a story to see their reaction , ” Edis said .	-4.6973
He said that NotW uses three procedures to investigate stories : telephone hacking , monitoring and confrontation .	-2.4894
The publisher is personally involved in the third method .	-1.7313
Obviously , he knows of the second , of monitoring , cannot be anything else .	-3.1005
What about the first ?	-1.4819
Do he know about the telephone hacking ?	-4.8611
He disputes this , but we say , “ And whether he knew of it . ”	-2.5685
Rumors about an affair clarkes were first taken up by the feature editorial of NotW as a source that was sexually interested in Pawlby : “ Do not waste your time , she is combined with Charles . ”	-3.6672
A band with voice mails from its phone of at least three occasions was ensured in Mulcaire ’ s apartment in August 2006 .	-2.8363
The investigators also found entries on the detective computer where Pawlby and their sisters were stored as “ projects ” .	-5.2328
At the time when the research received the grandparents of Pawlby received anonymous calls asking for information about them , Edis explained .	-3.2240
Meanwhile , the former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup supervised the monitoring of the movements of Pawlb     .	-3.2909
On 18 June 2005 , Coulson left her a voicemail with the following content : “ I have a story that we want to put out tomorrow , which I would like to speak with Charles . ”	-5.0865
Edis explained that Coulson ’ s activities in this story followed the same pattern as in other important personalities , such as the former Interior Minister David Blunkett .	-3.3965
The swore heard on Thursday that Coulson Blunkett faced an affair with a married woman when he himself lied with the co-accused Rebekah Brooks , who was married then .	-3.4684
Coulson and Brooks dispute to have conspired with others to hack phones between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006 .	-2.8893

But he refused to spare football from the planned 75 % tax on income of more than EUR 1 million per year , which all companies of the country should pay for two years from 2014 .	-3.4820
The opposite was also hard .	-2.4030
The strike announced at the end of November will now be pulled through , informed the Chef Association of Professional Clubs ( UCPF ) , Jean-Pierre Louvel .	-4.0418

Cry : No Absolute Protection	-1.9969
" We want to involve the inhabitants in the planning early stages , " opened Mayor Jens Häussler the citizens ' information event on the flood protection concept in Gechingen .	-3.5582
Around 80 participants had come to the community hall to explain the planned measures to ask questions , express concerns and introduce ideas .	-3.2272
Häussler made it clear that ' the ultimate decisions take members of the Council of Municipal Council ' .	-3.2152
The flood , the Gechingen on 15 May 2009 , was unprepared , was a significant event that raised the question of protective measures for the future , says Häusseler .	-4.0045
A river area study was commissioned with the neighbouring community of Aidlingen , which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen        .	-5.5711
" The protection of as many built plots as possible is the objective " , says Häu<unk>ler .	-3.2729
The planning of protection against a flood expected according to German weather service is statistically every 100 years .	-3.1522
Climate change is taken into account by a 15 % supplement .	-1.9624
This is called " HQ 100aKlima " in professional circles .	-2.5436
The water masses that led to significant damage in Gechingen in 2009 corresponded to a 1000-year-old flood .	-3.1712
" Absolute protection does not exist , but relative improvement can be achieved , " says Häu<unk>ler .	-2.8437
In order to achieve the protection of HQ 100aKlima , around four million euros must be invested in Gechingen , with the community expecting some 70 % of national subsidies .	-4.2527
But householders pointed out that there is only promotion if an overall concept is implemented .	-3.1437
The community must depend on the participation of citizens .	-2.9418
An extensive planning and approval procedure must be completed .	-2.0087
In the best case , the implementation can begin in 2016 .	-2.3932
Among other things , the protection concept presented last week in the Council of Municipal Council ( we reported ) provides for local measures in the influence of the River Irm from the Stamheimer Valley .	-3.5476
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept , participants used the opportunity to introduce their concerns .	-2.6264
Among other things , it was questioned why no longer insulation and restraint pools are planned to protect the place .	-3.6239
Gregor Kühn , professional planner of the engineering office Wald and Corbe from Hillsheim , who presented the concept , emphasized that it needs the interplay of all the measures presented to achieve the desired goal in the sum .	-4.2446
Moreover , the most economical solution is to be found , says Joachim Wald by Forest and Corbe .	-2.9406
There was discontent among the investors in the altort who , even in normal thunder rains , have repeatedly suffered from overloading the channel network .	-5.2780
The problem is well known for the administration and first measures have already been taken .	-4.5025
However , Häusseler pointed out that the Channel Systems Directives are others than for flood protection and should not be mixed .	-3.1769
The community is obliged to interpret the channel network in such a way that two to three years of rain could be sold .	-3.2617
Dimensioning sanitation channels would swallow millions .	-5.8557
Heavy Injured After Clash	-2.2908
In the early Friday afternoon , two drivers were hardly injured on the road 44 near Revensdorf at a frontal clash .	-3.7087
The police immediately blocked the road completely , but could first say little about the accident .	-7.1705

On Wednesday , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) published a series of guidelines for dealing with food allergies from children to schools .	-2.7174
These are the first such directives that the US Government has published , because the number of children with food allergies is increasing .	-3.1249

Germany is the first European nation to recognise a third sex for children born with unclear genitals .	-2.3479
Newborn no longer is assigned rigidly male or female .	-2.3852
Under the new law , parents will no longer have to explain a gender for such children , but can “ indefinitely ” or “ not defined ” on the birth document .	-3.9619
The aim of the law is to take the pressure of parents to ensure that they do not have to make any rushed decisions on operations for a gender allocation in newborn communities and to combat discrimination against intersexuals .	-8.6814
According to BBC years later , an intersexual person said : “ I am neither man nor woman . ”	-2.2714

Wallis Simpson may have been intersexual .	-1.5050
The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed , but most experts in the United States are advised to use the best available information on gender allocation if a provision is not possible , and not wait for the psychological and physical development of the child before , if anything , choosing an operation .	-4.1443
The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher , who specialized in the problem of gender identification , said that the new German law “ sounded after a good thing . ”	-2.8031
Intersexual children are an ethical dilemma .	-1.2659
“ Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgical intervention , but most children do not apply , ” he said .	-2.5706
You can make a gender allocation without operation and then wait for the identity to develop .	-3.1298
The scientific data about how a child develops its gender identity at all is not very close .	-2.6923
Nobody knows why it is happening .	-1.3159
It is like the secret why people are homosexual .	-1.9761
A report to the European Commission in 2011 states that intersexual people are distinguished by transsexual or transgender persons , because their status is not gender-related , but by their biological constitution , which is neither exclusively male nor female , but typically both of them , or not clearly defined as one of them .	-4.3254
These characteristics showed themselves in sexual characteristics such as muscle mass , hairing , breasts and stature , priority sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals , or in chromosome structures and hormones .	-3.8960

In 2011 , dozens of French members of the strictly Catholic country signed a petition that “ gender theory ” should be removed from schoolbooks .	-2.3422
The US Catholic Online website has also spoken against German law , with the explanatory statement : “ When the world is distorted into a new state where gender is a decision , but not sexual activity , then we twist two other pillars of civilization . ”                                                          	-10.5367

Children need stability and security .	-1.0131
Historically , children who were born with both male and female gender parts were called hermaphrodites , after the attractive Greek God who had both sexes .	-3.2489
Ten years ago , medicine regarded the sex as something that can be extinguished and then rebuilt .	-6.2029
But now the ethical foundations of an operation are doubted , after now knowing how complex the gender identity is , and that doctors can also be wrong , because they do not know how the child feels to grow up with the sex they assigned .	-4.2311
“ In the middle of the 20th century , one called a psychiatric emergency , ” said Drescher .	-2.7292
If such a child was born , you called not the psychiatrist , but the surgeons .	-2.4280
The ruling theory about the treatment of children with non-clear genitals dates back to Dr. John Money from Johns Hopkins University , who thought that gender is formable .	-6.0277
He characterized the term “ gender identity ” and argued , social and environmentally-related offences – such as parents educate a child – interacted with the genes and hormones of a child and characterized whether or not a person considered a male or female                                   	-7.5855
But in a case known under the title of John / Joan in 1966 his theories were controversial .	-2.9180
He returned to the parents of a boy whose penis was separated from a compatible circumcision to caster the child quite completely and also to remove his hodes and then draw it as girls .	-4.9013
“ Money presented this case as a successful example of conversion , which he was not , ” said Drescher .	-2.3344
When the boy was about 15 , he switched back to male sex and married a woman .	-2.2001
But with 38 he celebrated suicide .	-2.2920
According to Drescher , there are still doctors who would practise this model .	-2.0918
But in the 1990 ’ s , with the Internet ’ s entry , survivors of these gender operations have entered the public “ not happy with the outcome . ”	-3.4100
For example , Jim Bruce , a 36-year-old author from Montana born with XY-male chromosomes , but ambiguous genitals .	-2.5960
Doctors were not clear whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he can never lead a “ satisfactory life ” as a man .	-2.9845
So his external organ and hodes were surgically removed shortly after the birth of 1976 and he was made as girls .	-3.5013
At the age of 12 he received female hormones .	-1.6073
“ I knew I am not a girl , ” he explained to ABCNews.com	-1.9314
I was unhappy , but it was really difficult to ask questions .	-1.6502
At the age of 18 he should receive a vaginal plastic .	-1.8603
But because he was depressive and knew that something was not true , he demanded his medical acts .	-7.1931
What he found out was shocking .	-1.1094
I was sterilized with my birth – and nobody has ever said th       .	-3.7583
Bruce was born with a DSD where his body could not produce enough testosterone to develop genitals .	-2.6066
After learning the truth , he switched to male identity , received Testosteron injections and caused his breasts to remove .	-3.1661
It has become infertile through the operation .	-1.9897
Today he is fighting for others in one organization called Interface Project for intersexuals to be perceived as normal .	-5.4814
But Anne Tamar-Mattis , Managing Director of the Advocates for Informed Choice legal group based in California , ensures that German law “ can “ encourage stamping and stigmatizing . ”	-3.3986
“ Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and assign the child not to “ assign ” them .	-3.5124
We fear that favours intervention .	-5.5677
We think it would be better to allocate male or female gender and then wait .	-2.3817
But we do not yet know how the law will affect , so we can only speculate .	-2.1056
Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports Australian law , because “ it allows adults to recognise as a third sex . ”	-2.7435
“ Adults should be able to take their own decisions on their legal sex , ” she explained .	-2.2112
The German law is about assignment to birth .	-7.1880
This is not a battle at which you should force young children at this time .	-2.7343
If they are adults , they can decide on their own bodies .	-2.2931
But Dr. Arlene Baratz , a breast radiologist from Pittsburg , who has a daughter with a sexual disturbance and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group , says that German law “ authorised ” both parents and children .	-3.2924
Katie , the daughter of Baratz , was born with male chromosomes , but has a DSD complete andrug resistance .	-2.3159
Due to the receptor defect of the target cells for Testosteron developed female characteristics .	-2.8276
She has a vagina , but no Uterus and no eggs .	-2.1908
Today is Katie 29 and married ; she is working at the University of Pennsylvania as a staff in child psychiatry .	-4.8874
While it is infertile , it hopes to be able to get a child through adoption or surrogacy .	-2.9709
“ The law gives parents space , which does not have to make decisions overthrown , ” said Baratz .	-2.8453
It gives them the time to make different tests and clarify things and so gives them time before writing “ male ” or “ female . ”	-9.0173
In this way everything is right – you draw the child big and love it .	-3.0486
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy the parental luck .	-2.7020
And we do not have to make an operation that can no longer be reversed .	-2.8426
“ This includes children in the decision and eliminates the fear that parents surround because they think they would not do the right thing , ” she explained .	-3.3792
Ultimately , the child decides about the gender that fits better to him – and that is wonderful .    Th  i            .  T     	-7.9856

The criminal police were identified on Friday .	-2.3031
Until now , the police inspection Kempten can look back on a quiet Halloween night .	-2.8389
The officials were only called twice to acquire children who threw them against home facades                   	-6.4897
Since homeowners recognized this in time and removed the egg remains in the same way , no damage should have been caused .	-4.1491
In addition , some Sylvesterböllers were also finished in the city area , but no damage has been caused here .	-4.7313
A resident in the Bishop-Freundorfer-Weg reported that his car was wrapped with clopaper and his cycling blondings were developed .	-4.0995
Until the police arrived , however , the man has found his cycling blocks immediately close to everyone , which is why the police did not have to work further .	-4.5249
Living with a Future Prospect	-1.7781
Actually , Waltraud Ries lives dreamlike .	-2.3768
The house is situated in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with a lot of green , an old tree stock , nice neighbours and not too much traffic .	-3.2495
The city is only a few minutes away from public transport  .	-5.6495
" You hopefully do not fear spiders ? " asks Waltraud Ries and shows a fat spider on the door frame .	-3.7710
I have been looking for a new apartment for my husband and me for some time .	-2.0256
But you know how difficult it is in Stuttgart .	-1.5672
The reason , however , is not a spinning phobia , but the concern to no longer manage the many staircases to the house and in the apartment it explains .	-4.6177
Moreover , since a meniscus operation , the mid-fifties have had to learn about their own body , which means moving with handicap from floor to floor .	-3.6124
Recently , a book of her appeared on the subject of ' Happiness living in age - What is the best for me ? ' .	-4.1732
'Our apartment is the best example of what does not go at all ' , starts to tell it .	-2.6520
When she moved into the Maisonette apartment more than 20 years ago , it was just a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green .                  a s   b	-5.6865
Today , in the middle of fifty , Waltraud Ries thinks differently about thi     .	-3.6492
She also knows , however , that it is one of the few people who deal with the issue of ' living at age ' .	-3.2714
Most of them displace as long as they are concerned .	-2.7943
Old are always only the others ' , says them smiling .	-8.3927
Only when the pressure of passion is really large are thoughts .	-3.4800
'Then it can be too late ' , so giants .	-5.4181
In her book , the interior architect presents 17 dwelling models for a self-determined living at age .	-3.1407
'What shape you choose is always an individual decision ' , explains it .	-2.7858
D i solution does not exist for age .	-1.6108
Even those who can afford the age residence in Tuscany or Brittany should always consider that he can also become ill .	-3.2789
And : ' Without good knowledge of the national language you also combine in the Dolce Vita , ' the specialist author gives the willingness to settle .	-4.0063
Under their models , classic care models , alternative residential forms or the often quoted pensioner WG are found .	-3.3106
At the Age , everyone has his ticks and macks	-2.9177
'For me such a residential community would be nothing ' , it means with an eye force .	-3.7448
Even not as in a student WG with a common bathroom and a kitchen .	-3.0342
'At age , you simply need its withdrawal rooms ' , says Ries .	-3.5009
Nevertheless , that a senior residential community can work , the book author does not want to exclude it .	-3.2759
However , this must be different from the classical student World C      .	-4.2610
And sometimes you just want your peace , ' she believes .	-2.8873
With this opinion , it is at least not alone in the capital of the country .	-3.0679
" Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own apartment " is also the experience of Theresa Rütten , the head of the citizens ' service life at the age of the capital .	-3.3909
Your service advises people on the subject of ' older ' .	-2.4742
That is why older people often would often take inconvenience and restrictions to stay in their usual environment , as well as the experience of the Warentest Foundation .	-4.1033
Today there are many ways to make the house or the apartment accessible .	-2.9426
Ries recommends all those who deal with the age-right rebuilding of their home or their apartment , thoroughly inform themselves and not the first best craftsmen .	-4.5826
Today there are also specialists for age-right reconstruction .	-2.8015
Even in the apartment , this can be realized one or the other , and if it is only the toilet seat increase , the interior architect clarifies .	-3.7813
But the existing apartment cannot always be transformed age-free and therefore accessible , even if it is still so beautiful .	-3.8518
This experience had to make Waltraud Ries .	-1.7826
Although you could install a staircase lift within the apartment , which would also be paved with stairs to the housing door would be far greater obstacles .	-4.0598
She will continue until she found the ideal object for herself and her man .	-4.9386
Before the move it grays more than in front of the spider at its home door .	-3.7665
The US Wants to Follow Snowden	-2.7344
The US has not changed its position on former US intelligence staff Edward Snowden .	-2.1996
He will continue to be accused of providing unauthorized secret information .	-2.5444
He must therefore face a criminal procedure in the United States , Jennifer Psaki , in Washington .	-2.6549
Nor would the recent statements by Snowden change anything .	-2.7149
Previously , after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow , Germany ’ s Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele appealed to the US not to threaten him further .	-3.1896
Psaki stressed that these are statements by a Member of Parliament , not a German Member of Government .	-3.4815
Intelligence service provider Edward Snowden is prepared to talk to German authorities in principle .	-3.1027
First , however , he wants to clarify his situation .	-2.3167
This has clarified the former NSA employee sought in an unaddressed letter published by Green politicians Hans-Christian Ströbele on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwarded to Federal Government , Bundestag , and General Bundesanwalt .	-4.2612
The letter has the following wording :	-2.0417
The Responsibilities	-5.7949
I have been asked to write to you regarding your investigation on mass monitoring .	-2.4174
I am called Edward Joseph Snowden and was employed by the United States by the National Security Agency ( NSA ) , the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) and the Defense Intelligence Agency ( DIA ) .	-3.4413
In the course of my employment in these institutions , I was witnessing systematic breaches of my government , which led me to act from a moral obligation .	-3.4956
As a result of the publication of these concerns , I suspended a serious and ongoing heat that forced me to leave my family and my homeland .	-2.9063
I am currently living in exile and enjoying temporary asylum that grants me the Russian Federation under international law .	-2.7205
I am encouraged by the response to my political action , both in the United States and elsew              	-4.8818
Citizens around the world and also high officials - including the United States - have judged the revelations on a system of comprehensive surveillance that nobody is guilty of accountability as a service to  t  t           .    e          e  a              	-9.3763
These espionage revelations revealed many proposals on new laws and guidelines aimed at the formerly hidden abuse of public trust .	-3.4180
The benefits of society from these insights are increasingly clearer ; at the same time , the risks taken in purchase have been visibly reduced .	-3.3635
Although the result of my efforts was demonstrably positive , my government remains treating dissent as a loyalty and seeks to criminalise and charge political expression .	-3.6111
Nevertheless , the truth to speak is not a crim                  	-7.2320
I am confident that the United States Government , with the support of the international community , will have this detrimental position .	-2.9131
I hope that if the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved , I will be able to participate appropriately and legislatively in the good information of the facts regarding the statements made in the media , particularly with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports .	-4.0292
I look forward to a conversation with you in your country as soon as the situation is clarified and thank you for your efforts to respect the international law that protects us all .	-2.8534

" The building is in good hands " says Winterlingen 's mayor Michael Maier .	-1.8474
The municipality has sold to a private person to the former kindergarten in the garden road .	-7.6705
The Council of Municipalities agreed to the sale in its recent meeting in the non-public part .	-3.0079
The building changed its owner at a " reasonable " price .	-2.1371
" The community is satisfied " emphasizes Maier .	-2.0001
There were EUR 100 000 in the budget .	-1.7633
It is not yet clear how the new owner wants to use the former kindergarten .	-2.0455
The Mayor is right that Winterlingen has handed over responsibility for the building before the winter to someone else and therefore no longer has to pay for the entertainment of the house , how to heat , look after the garden and relax .	-4.5550

Report : Obama campaign considered replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton	-1.8602
The closest advisers of President Barack Obama have considered in secret to replace Vice-President Joe Biden in the 2012 election campaign by Hillary Clinton , the New York Times .	-3.0574
The revelation is the most considerable surprise of the long-awaited work by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann on the 2012 election campaign , “ Double Down : Game Change 2012 ” .	-2.7774
The time lies a copy of the next book , and reported on Thursday evening that the President ’ s topberaters had carried out “ extensive group sessions and surveys at the end of 2011 ” to find out whether it looks better for Obama ’ s diminishing hope of re-election when he leaves Biden .	-7.8806
According to Jonathan Martin , the Times ’ national correspondent , the book thoroughly draws the history of the efforts of leading employees of the campaign and the White House , namely the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley , to measure the effect on the poll values to exchange former Secretary of State Clinton against Vice-Presidents . The                     h                   	-8.3714
The potential change was a strictly held secret within the Chicago campaign infrastructure and the Oval Office .	-2.9056
Only half a dozen of the closest advisers of the President – including Daley , the former Obama campaign leader , Jim Messina , and the former White House consultants , David Axelrod , and David Plouffe – knew about the intended change .	-3.5469
Double Down claims that Daley was at the top of the efforts to exchange Biden , despite their “ narrow , personal relationship , ” before deciding against such chess after the data showed that Clinton ’ s candidacy “ would not significantly improve Obama ’ s opportunities . ”	-4.5582
In an interview with Martin , Daley confirmed that the government had actually considered replacing bids with Clinton .	-2.3189
“ I expressed a whole series of things that should be considered , and that was one of them , ” Daley declared the magazine .	-2.7591
It must be remembered that the President had terrible poll values at that time , so we thought , “ Around God ’ s will , what do we do ? ”	-3.6654
While Daley called the investigations “ offered care , ” Martin said to CNN ’ s Anderson Cooper that significant effort had been operated during the re-election campaign to find out whether such a train pays out in terms of the ballot boxes .	-4.2426
“ In campaigns , not so much money is spent on surveys and focus groups if you do not seriously think about something , ” Martin declared AC360 .	-3.1882
But it is not clear whether Obama knew his team was thought about an exchange .	-2.3812
Martin said to CNN , he asked Daley whether his then boss knew about the potential change .	-2.5933
Although Daley said that he did not believe that the President was “ aware of possible change , ” the former Head of Staff assumed that it was “ possible ” that Obama knew of     i                                  	-7.9437
Martin added that “ Double Down ” did not provide a definitive response to the question of whether Obama ’ s political spending would have achieved desk .	-3.3467
Cooper asked Martin whether he seriously thinks that Obama did not know anything about whether to let bids fall into the elections .	-3.5505
“ Possible , ” Martin responded .	-1.7263
What happens on the way with my email ?	-2.1996
E-mail actually means electronic letter .	-2.2641
Did the Internet service design e-mail similar to the traditional mail technically implemented the postal secret ?	-4.6076
In the concept of early Internet services , the priority was to make communication possible .	-2.8423
Therefore , the basic technical protocols did not respect the creation of a stable foundation for a listening change of l  e                                        	-10.8792
Therefore , a conventional email is more open to an open postcard than a sealed letter .                  o a        	-6.8994
When user sends an email to " Benni " , are the computers of the two directly connected ?	-2.8153
The email program or browser from Anna sends the mail to the mail server of your service provider in the first step .	-2.7082
For example , if it has a GMail account , the Google would be .	-2.1708
This mail server sends the content to the provider using Benni .	-1.8516
On the track the mail can run via several other servers on the Internet .	-2.6371
Bennie can then call the content with his provider .	-2.0480
Will conventional emails be read on their way through the network ?	-1.9769
Most mails are read several times by software robots on the way .	-4.9280
The provider of the sender usually checks whether the mail causes a damage program as an annex .	-3.8028
A virus check is also made on the receiver systems .	-10.5130
Moreover , the providers check whether this is an unwanted and undesired spam mail that is deleted or at least sorted into a spam folder .	-3.8362
Do the robots have another task ?	-1.5585
For systems like GMail , the robot also determines the information that Google needs to place context advertising .	-2.3666
When Anna and Benni communicate via GMail about their upcoming holiday trip , Google can display appropriate links to holiday o                         or  a    	-8.7556
Read also unknown people the emails with    ?    ..  ? !       ?	-9.7820
The probability that unauthorized people read an email is extremely low .	-2.4290
In theory , that is possible .	-2.0073
In companies , administrators often have the opportunity to read electronic mail .	-2.0642
Law enforcement authorities and intelligence services also have legal opportunities to intercept or take note of e-mails . This is also the cas effective o       	-6.1588
In addition , possible illegal speakers come to this .	-3.3359
Is it possible to protect emails against reading ?	-1.7694
With an encryption according to the OpenPGP standard , an email can be encrypted effectively against reading .	-2.5889
With high technical effort , it is also possible to conceal the metadata of email communication so that even without further recognition of who has communicated with whom .	-3.6801
How important are Yahoo and Google on the email market in Germany ?	-1.6814
According to an investigation of Convios Consulting from August 2013 , Yahoo and Google play a subordinate role in the mainly privately used mailboxes .	-3.4438
While the shares of Yahoo mail last had fallen , GMail from Google could significantly place .	-3.9191
Sharing Mother in the  Fo And Cashie                  	-7.7678
When his mother died , a man from Wolfsburg forged a plan .	-2.0229
He begraded the dead in a forest - and continued to cash their pensions and money .	-3.2154
In order to cash further pensions and care money , a 67-year-old Wolfsburger buried his dead mother after the police investigated in the forest .	-3.5390
First of all , he covered the death of the 89 years , then he removed the money for more than one and a half y                     	-6.5410
Now , the 67-year-old must be responsible for fraud , as a speaker said on Friday .                	-5.2224
So the man hidden the woman in a forest near Helmstedt .	-1.9226
The man was suspected already in May : at that time , no more drugs were needed for the needy mother .	-3.7191
The pensioner told the investigators that his mother was travelling to Spain .	-1.9956
Because the officials strangely occurred , they continued to determine .	-3.2090
It turned out that the two had lived in a common apartment for more than 15 years , and he had last maintained it .	-3.6025
Finally , the 67-year-old gave the death of his mother .	-2.5128
According to the police , obduction did not make any evidence of capital crimes .	-3.0859
Does ice cream light in the dark ?	-2.5193
A British entrepreneur has developed the first in the darkness of bright ice – using sources .             .. ,         , a 	-8.0373
Charlie Francis made use of the fluorescent characteristics of the sea and created a bright delicacy .	-3.1557
The idea came to him after reading a research about sources and convincing Chinese scientists to produce artificial protein .	-7.7161
The ice cream responds when consuming with the tongue , which raises the pH value in the protein and triggers the light .	-5.8313
Chris explains that the dining ice responds to the heat in the mouth and lighted – the more you lick , the brighter it becomes .	-3.2398
Charlie , founder of the ice cream company “ Lick Me I 'm Delicious ” , says : “ The product is incredible , but still in a very early production phase , and so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds . ”	-3.4199
The protein used in the ice cream responds with the tongue with a neutral pH value .                             	-6.8206
When the mouth heats the protein , the pH value and the ice lights .	-2.4048
We have tested it over the last few months and it seemed ideal to bring it to Halloween onto the market because it has this wonderful light effect .	-3.3525
It is probably the most expensive ice cream I have ever manufactured , because the lighting material is four times more expensive than g .	-5.1749
Every bullet costs me about 140 pounds .	-1.7200
But it tastes it delicious .	-2.0373
Charlies experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual flavours , including beer , cheese , beef and leaf gold .	-2.6726
But its latest creation should become even more ambitious .	-2.0960
He says : “ I would like to develop an invisible ice cream . ”	-1.8081
This is impossible in itself because of the light break caused by the ice crystals that consist of ice cream ; but I suspect that we find a way to create it .	-6.7241
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a source produced by Chinese scientists artificially .	-9.8371
TSV Morsum is still in the Handball Association League after six days of play .	-3.1176
The team of Ingo Ehlers will now come to Derby against the TSV Daverden , who celebrated his first victory last weekend .	-4.0047
This game will begin the season new for us .	-2.4780
" I hope that we finally have the head free , " Ehlers behaves optimistically .	-2.6169
He finally has his complete cader , except for the permanent injured Hendrik Blohme .	-3.7584
Like us , Daverden is putting on speed game .	-3.5307
We must therefore keep our error rate small .	-2.4331
First and foremost , however , it is important to increase the coverage , which has left anything but a safe impression .	-4.0487
Daverdens Coach Thomas Panitz is much more relaxed after the first season victory against North Horn .	-2.7673
Of course , the game was a house number .	-4.2694
But that is why we are still far from the favourite , because in Derby everything can happen             . I a l 'a      	-8.2983
However , Panitz wants to start a series in Morsum .	-2.7409

For this , the A-Youth Joost Wind<unk>us , who is active with double game law at the A-Youth Federal Ligist HC Bremen , celebrates his season debut .	-4.1013

Halloween 2013 : In Numbers	-1.3618
When I was small , Halloween had something magical .	-1.5271
My sister and I was allowed to eat sweets , stay late and clothe us for the neighbourhood .	-3.3966
Today I have become the Halloween muffle .	-2.2367
Over the last two years I have not been prepared to distribute my apartment from sweets , and I think it will not do this year either .	-3.8635
But , according to statistics , I am a black sheep in Halloween .	-8.3335
The majority of Americans – $ 158 million to be precise – celebrate Halloween this year , spending a total of $ 6.9 billion on sweets , costumes , and decorations , such as the US Association of Retailers ( N                          	-5.9791
One thing I am pleased with each Halloween then is the trend values .     I     ha a                     e	-11.3159
The costumes will represent approximately $ 1.2 billion of the $ 6.9 billion spent , the NGF .	-2.8806
This year , unlively items are the last cry .	-2.9839
Women no longer need to cover themselves in sexy clothing , they can now also embody tempting food such as pizza , hamburger or carrots .	-3.5883
As far as men are concerned , I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead , and I bet the Daft-Punk space men will create it into instagram feeds this year .	-3.0888
According to Google , the most searched costumes are zombies , batman , pirates and witches .	-2.6585
I suspect it is nothing traditional .	-2.3897
Last year we dressed our dogs and were not alone in my astonishment .	-3.0532
Indeed , Americans spend $ 330 million this year on costumes of their pets , the NGF .	-2.3686
These are a lot of hot dogs .	-1.8806
As far as can be concerned , we are not ambiguous .	-2.9677
Americans will spend $ 1.9 billion this year , say The Nielsen Company .	-4.6112
These are about 270 million kilograms of chocolate , loudscapes , bonbons and rubber barches .	-2.9394
So good news for the 41 million people , according to the US Trade Department , who draw through the quarter with the saying of “ sweet or saures     .    e        	-5.2607
Indeed , we will buy more than 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and eat nothing .	-2.3700
The only thing we do not want to consume is the sugar-sweet Candy Corn ; yet 15 million kilograms are sold around Halloween , so the National Association of Sweetware Manufacturers .	-3.2496
These are about nine billion maize grains .	-5.0784
It is a puzzle that I could not solve yet .	-2.1316
Nothing belongs to Halloween as buildings in which it is spukt  .	-8.2646
They have great names like “ Terror Behind the Walls ” ( which is by the way in a real prison ) , “ Howl-O-Scream ” and “ The House of Shock ” .	-3.0122
Indeed , there are 1,200 officially recognized spukhouses in the United States that achieve $ 500 million in revenue , says America Haunts , and this includes the wonderful photos on which they are pinkling into the trousers and then putting the friends on Facebook where they will not get rid of them again , and then the type on which one stands leaves a comment like “ nice face expression . ”	-5.8569
But let us finally come to the bites .	-2.9524
Charlie Brown familiarized us with the Great Kurbis , when we were children , and the carving of a curbis latern is like the jewellery of the Christmas tree – something we have done from small to small       .	-4.5884
Fortunately , the “ baby in the Kürbis ” trend began only last year thanks to Pinterest , so most of us have grown up with cutting the Kürbis and not sitting in it .	-3.4099
This year , Americans will spend approximately $ 106 million on bits , the US Census Bureau .	-2.7350
The curbis laterns , who are slowly bothered in the pre-garden , are probably from Illinois , where 245 million kilograms were harvested this year .	-6.8621
If you want to point correctly , call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa , California , and catch something lively from their 921 kilos of heavy Kurbis .	-4.0964
Housing Fire in Helmbrechts : Rescue forces mount coaled bodies	-3.3951
The fire brigade had to return in Helmbrecht on Thursday evening .	-3.1040
A three-family house in the county district of Hof begins during the night to Friday fire .	-3.2603
The rescue forces have a coaled body from the house .	-2.7703
Rescue forces have found a coaled body in a triple family house at a fire in Helmbrecht .	-3.3639
Whether it is a resident is still unclear , as a spokesman of the police in Bayreuth said .	-2.6665
On the late Thursday evening it burned on the ground floor of the house .	-2.3365
When the fire brigade arrived , the flames already beaten from a window .	-2.7073
The forces were in the apartment and found the body in a room .	-2.8116
This and another room burned completely .	-3.3271
The entire ground floor has been damaged     e .    Te      e   	-8.2131

The building can no longer be inhabited .	-2.3915
The precise cause of the fire was not clear first .	-2.0951
Germany ’ s largest national church has started an offensive to advertise the profession of the pastor .	-2.8341
Background is a possible deficiency : The Evangelical Loutheran Church of Hannover expects the number of its current pastors to halve around 1,800 pastors after the present situation until 2030 .	-4.4567
For young people today , the profession is very attractive and offers good future prospects , said Pastor Mathis Burfien ( 43 ) in conversation with the Evangelical Press Service .	-3.0393
It is attractive to determine the working and day process itself .	-2.2523
For the first time , with Burfien , the Church of Landeskirche has charged a pastor in a full place to enthuse young people for the study of the theology .	-4.2121
At present , less and less young people decide to study theology after Abitur .	-2.2897
Burfia returns to the process of deception : " God 's voice is quiet , the world is loud " .	-2.7110
The profession of great freedom and diversity was characteried .	-8.7058
I am a calendar of my dates and I can set my priorities where it is important to me .	-3.2813

Announced Land Rover Rally Ser .	-4.3461
In the interior you will find racing seats and six-point belts as well as an open-air system .	-3.3919
The options range from reinforced brakes , a service package with care for bowler works mechanics and logistical support to vehicle storage between events .	-2.9588
Drew Bowler , Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport , explains : “ The Rally customers who come to Bowler have changed . ”	-2.4455
They are not all experienced racing drivers , but people who are looking for tension and adventure as well as for a reachable path to world-class events .	-3.1681
We are pleased to be able to open this path in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format opens up new opportunities to experience the different rally disciplines in Britain and abroad and prepare newcomers for the straps and the reality of Rally Raid .	-4.0933

Called fire brigade to save a digging , which celebrated 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rock lead in a quarry .	-4.6628
Cockerspaniel-Hündin Ruby had run after a smaller traffic accident .	-3.6987
Three days later , she was discovered by a walker in the quarry in her misleading position	-2.6404
Fire fighters saved the dog from safe death	-3.5358
The fire brigade succeeded in bringing in security a high level on a 15-meter high level in a rock wall .	-4.7956
The nine months old cocker spaniard Ruby was running after a road accident on Sunday afternoon and survived alone three days before she was saved on Wednesday from a q       .	-4.4091
Scott Alderson , 25 , and his girlfriend Becky Hall , 20 , who belongs to the dog , came to the stone break Flappit in Denholme , West Yorkshire to receive Ruby again and to thank the fire fighters of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service .	-3.8029
They desperately sought for their missing dog and published assistance in social networks when she was dismantled into the quarry following the small road accident .	-4.1022
About 14 : 15 on Wednesday , a walker who executed his dog saw the stranded Ruby on the 15 meters high paragraph in the quarry .	-3.7177
The technical rescue team of the Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the place and rubbed to save Ruby , which was then transported in a dog box at the top .	-4.5064
Andy Clayton , specialist of the technical rescue team , said : “ She was in a dangerous location .	-2.1627
It was located in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and the ground .	-2.9356
She did not move a muscle during her rescue – she was like stiff frozen .	-2.8533
But now it is good .	-1.8746
She has then eaten a few dog cakes .	-2.3490
That was a rather unusual approach .	-2.4510
The fact that the dog has been discovered is unbelievable .	-7.9703
Peter Lau , specialist of the technical rescue team , said : “ Ruby had a giant luck . ”	-2.2916
It was possible that it was very difficult or worse .	-2.1839
Ruby was brought to the veterinarian , but nothing except exhaustion and dehydration .	-3.3085
Becky Hall from Halifax , West Yorkshire , said : “ When rescuing it was frightening . ”	-2.9811
I could not believe that it was really there above .	-2.3504
It was wonderful to keep them back in the poor .	-1.7628

In an explanation , a representative Jaggers said 70 , on Thursday , that he “ categorically denied that he had ever made attempts to approach Katy Perry . ”             e                   	-8.1910

George Kerevan : European unbundling gives the Scots the election	-1.8320
A new day , a new horror of independence .	-1.5685
This time , we are warned that an independent Scotland is needed to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership . Th           w    a               w    	-9.6407
This provides the keyword for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a barbed-wire limit along the Hadrianswall .	-2.6128
Indeed , the Strathclyde proposal highlighted the possible economic benefits that would bring more freedom of travel in the rest of Europe , but this has not played a role in the headlines – expectations .	-3.9922
Nor has anyone mentioned that EU member states often benefit from their strict rules if it is more favourable to them .	-2.9325
Since Scotland does not belong to the Schengen area at the moment , continuing non-compliance with Brussels would be only a small concession in exchange for what we really want from the Scots .	-3.5528
So it is not a story .	-6.0821
And one that has come so far in the years that it already equates a fossil : the first time I heard the “ independence means passport controls ” duck at least 40 years ago .	-3.7273
An interesting point is lost in the constant repeating of this ancient history        .         a  e e         	-10.4427
Why should we expect an independent Scotland to dance after European pipes ?	-5.4538
Why the London yoke is exchanging for Brussels , especially now ?	-3.0278
These are the real European news : the great plan for the unification of Europe has stalled aft th     war     .	-4.4932
With the euro crisis , the European project died officially .	-1.9701
Everywhere in the EU , parties are gaining ground that are hostile to the EU or throwing the euro as a common currency overboard .	-3.5006
Even in Germany , the Euroskeptic Party Alternative for Germany – founded just a five million votes for itself in the federal election in September – was able to expel the Free Democrats effectively ( the equivalent to the British Liberal Democrats ) .	-4.1874
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federalist Europe .	-1.8182
The current economic crisis , however , is a turning point .	-2.2293
Because of the strict austerity policy imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank in connection with the forced jacket into which the respective national economy is needed by maintaining the single currency , many people believe that the European project has gone too far .                              	-6.2551
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments causing excessive budget deficits – that was only the case in Greece .	-2.2880
Instead , the Eurosystem has fixed its members on exchange rates that are beneficial for German exporters – and that is what German politicians want .	-2.9768
Without the possibility of devaluing the local currency , southern Europe will find itself again with a built-in productivity disadvantage with Germany .	-3.0407
The only way is to cut wages and public spending – spurred by Berlin .	-2.1169
Behind the current budgetary and monetary problems lies a deeper European productivity problem .	-2.0441
As a result of the “ green ” energy directives regulated by Brussels – a code for subsidising French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – European industry pays the double for electricity and four times for gas compared to the United States .	-3.2389
This is a paralysing cost disadvantage , as we have already seen in Grangemouth .	-2.3445
All of the world ’ s wage definitions do not protect European petrochemical industry from being pushed into the corner of cheap American shale gas .	-3.5436
As a result , a revolt is up , particularly in France , the EU 's former cheerleader .	-3.0005
Following the war , France ’ s political elite saw the EU as a vehicle with which Germany could be kept in check and Paris could lift at an equal level with Washington .	-3.7102
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy , and has expressed Europe its own economic policy , fighting the French economy that has been falling .	-3.7934
The result : Marine Le Pen ’ s right-wing , EU-anti-EU National Front has just gained a decisive election , thus referring the governing socialists to three .	-3.7529
The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 % of votes – a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a division in the right spectrum would automatically mean benefits for the left .	-3.3730

It wants to use the EU elections next year to forge an anti-EU , anti-common currency bloc in the European Parliament .	-2.3161
If the anti-EU parties cut off well in these elections – and that is very well possible – then for the first time such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament .	-3.1538
This is the point I want to make : in the not too distant future , the growing resentment against the EU and the single currency will come together to abolish the euro .	-3.2419
The EU will not disappear , but it will be more like the “ Europe of ( sovereign ) nations , ” which General de Gaulle favored .	-2.6565
Germany and some of its satellite economies may stick to the euro , but France and Southern Europe will return to their own currencies .	-2.3918
I expect Britain to distance itself from this project in the hope of flattening itself with the US .	-2.7326
But Washington ’ s growing interest in the Pacific region suggests that Britain will be in the Atlantic rain alone .	-2.3830
Where does Scotland remain ?	-2.0836
We can decide to be a region of small England ( in the last consequence ) .	-2.4137
Or we can defend our own economic interests – which includes saying Berlin and Brussels what they can do where they are .	-2.9279
I suspect that Scotland could drive very well in a more loose European connection if we keep our own currency .	-3.1866
Cooperation with other similarly thought-out countries is easier in an unfederated Europe of nations .	-2.2384
Otherwise , we should consider it equal to Norway and keep our economic independence .	-2.1931
The SNP administration in Scotland is , remarkably , the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe and has won a spectacular majority in 2011 because of the rejection of the proposed ( and proposed ) cuts to be responsible for the Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem coalition .	-3.9500
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to choose an independence now just to impose austerity policy on Berlin and Brussels .	-2.6639

Should a mother be concerned when her daughter grows breasts and shamhairs at the age of seven or eight years ?	-2.6310
At the Annual Conference of Children 's Association American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando , Florida , the pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz declared that these early physical changes were relatively normal under American girls and represented a new stan  every year .	-6.0817
“ I spend a lot of time reassuring parents – usually this is no sign that the puberty now enters quickly , ” explained Kaplowitz .	-3.5041
Obvious advertisements of development , such as growing breasts , shame and axle hair , as well as body smell , are showing in the pas   in the  earlie .	-6.3370
Nevertheless , there was only a slight shift in the age of the menarch ( appearances of the first rule blood ) over the last 40 years .	-3.6779
In the United States , the average age is 12.5 years , somewhat less than 12.75 in 1970 .	-2.2245
“ When the development of the breasts begins , it takes at least two to three years to menarch , ” said Kaplowitz , also the author of the book “ Early Puberty in Girls : The essential advisor to deal with this often problem .  ”                    e d ’               	-8.8795
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty moves forward .	-2.2844
It is controversial , which is indeed the beginning of puberty , but it is “ early ripe ” when the breast enlargement is accompanied by an age of eight years ago .	-3.8909
In most cases , the process slows or stagnates – something that a child medicine can monitor closely .	-2.4921
For faster moves , tests could be displayed by an endicronologist so that serious problems like tumors or cystes can be excluded .	-3.3393
There are treatment methods for delaying an early menstruation and defense of another consequence : the early ageing of bones , which can ultimately lead to inhibition of growth and thus small body growth in adults .	-3.9144
The recommendations for medication or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child , the speed of development , the growth rate and emotional maturity .	-3.0500
Psychosocial aspects are also important .	-1.1395
Kaplowitz is reticent about medicines , but he admits : “ The oppression of puberty can mitigate behavioral problems and the feelings of girls , unlike their people ’ s age . ”	-3.9849
The other major problem is understandable : parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have the period .	-2.0945
“ They are concerned about the pregnancy risk or about how they handle the hygiene side , ” said Kaplowitz .	-3.0836
“ It was a shock , ” remembers a woman whose daughter received with ten days .	-2.6325
Even though there were first signs and we talked about menstruation , it was not emotionally prepared .	-2.5344
She came frightened and excited from school to home because she was the first in her friends circle .	-2.8816
There are many comprehensively published theories about the causes of early puberty .	-1.8378
But there is no coherent evidence that hormones in milk or other food , chemicals in the environment , or sexual messages in the media would be caused .	-2.6356
Boys are similar to girls earlier .	-2.6009
Kaplowitz believes that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of obesity .	-1.7723
He supported the implementation of a study in 2001 on girls at the age of six to nine , who produce a link between body fat and entry into puberty .	-3.5417
Other studies support this conclusion , but there are many other factors that played a role .	-2.0759
In that country , African and Hispanic girls tend to reach the puberty rather than their white people .	-2.6283
There are different explanations for this .	-1.5874
Globally , an early puberty seems to be influenced by all possible things , from economic conditions to climate to genes .	-2.6056
Another puzzle : Although boys are growing face and shame hair earlier , the trend towards a full former puberty is not as marked as girls .	-3.8563
Other doctors at the AAP conference highlighted the complexity of the issue .	-2.1708
The emergence of acne and shamhair is distributed even in babies and infants .	-2.8249
“ We must be careful how we identify the real beginning of puberty , ” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman , a pediatric endocrinologist at the Goryeb Children ’ s Hospital in Morristown , New Jersey .	-6.4326
Parents should not hesitate to consult their children ’ s doctor , as they should speak with their child .                  	-5.4432
“ This can mean that you have to conversations earlier than expected , ” said Kaplowitz .	-3.2943
If you remain calm , the child normally reacts well .	-2.4328
Girls who flourish early need the insurance that the process is a normal part of life , even if he enters earlier than intended .	-2.8800
Jumbo manufacturers dispute in the face of major orders abo                     	-9.3754
Between leading aircraft manufacturers , there has been a discussion about the width of seats in the tourist class on long-haul flights , which indicates the tone for a bitter clash on the Dubai Airshow this month  .              e                        	-8.4701
The dispute is about the seat width that passengers are offered for long flights in the tourist class – not always those who work most to airlines , but this expelled space represents the key to the efficiency claims of the latest aircraft of Airbus SAS and Boeing Co . .	-11.6416
Airbus called for an industry standard this week , which requires a width of at least 46 cm ( 18 inches ) in the tourist class , but the American Archrival Boeing says that the airlines should                        	-6.4306
The dispute comes at a time when aircraft manufacturers are competing to sell even larger versions of their two-engine long-range flyers and expect record orders at the event of 17 to 21 November .	-3.9957
How the rear part of the aircraft is designed – especially whether there are nine or ten seats – is crucial to the specified economic results to provide the new “ mini-jumbo ” design .	-3.6862
Boeing claims that its modernized “ 777X ” covers 406 people in the tourist class , who are over 17 inches wide and so allow ten per seat .	-3.9454
Airbus explains that the competitive version of the A350 carries 350 people in 18 inches wide seats in the tourist class , with nine per series .	-3.2695
Aircraft giants often share technical details with advertising in the specialis  p  p       p                  an 	-10.4951

Recently , the company presented an advertisement that could be the start of a new advertising war and showed donors a picture in which three people sit together in a restaurant , and the title : “ Would you accept that ? ”	-4.0117
“ Boeing proposes long-haul flights in seats that are closer than regional turbo props , ” says Airbus leader John Leahy .	-2.5213
Given changing dietary habits , people are thicker , but aircraft seats have not changed radically .	-2.6674
Between the early 1970s , when Boeing 747 defined the modern long-range journey , and the end of the century has increased the weight of the male average American by 10 % between 40 and 49 years , the US Ministry of Health .	-3.5177
The scope of the male average American in the 21st century is 100.8 cm , according to US health statistics .	-3.2245
Airbus says that its rivals are considered a seat concept from the 1950s , when the average body scope of the freshly baptized “ Jet Set ” was narrower .	-3.9022
One has carried out Airbus , investigations that showed that an additional customs ( 2.54 cm ) per seat increased sleep quality by 53 % .	-3.8035
Boeing disputes the figures of Airbus on the seats and says that it is not at the discretion of the manufacturers to decide how airlines make the balance between air tariffs and institutions .	-3.4884
The company also explains that , according to investigations , the experience of the aircraft depends on more than the seat width .	-3.1706
“ It really amounts to giving airlines flexibility so that they can do what they believe to be successful , ” explains the aircraft expert Kent Craver of Boeing .	-3.4062
They do not want us to dictate what it makes profitable .	-2.1818
They know their business better than anyone else .	-1.4896
Passengers are talking about more freedom of elbow , but for manufacturers it is becoming increasingly an issue that can affect sales .	-3.9145

As Reuters reported for the first time in July , the seat layout is the driving force behind the discussion of the new jets .	-7.9003
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 % more efficiency per seat in their latest two-engine long-haul designs than the market leader in this segment , the 365-seated Boeing 77-300ER .	-2.7602
The Boeings statements on the results depend partly on the fact that the 777X is compared with its ten seats per seat with the original design of nine seats in the 777 .	-3.4402
The increased costs per unit are still lower than in currently used machines with ten seats per seat .	-2.9934
“ Boeing therefore quetsches more seats in his aircraft to make it more competitive to our products , ” says Kevin Keniston , Head of Passenger Comfort at European Airbus .	-3.0252
On the other hand , analysts , full cabins with ten seats per seat in existing 777s indicated that many passengers decided to closer arrangements , which could be accompanied by cheaper fares . The                                         	-8.9563
“ Eighteen customs width would be great for passengers , but the reality is : from an economic point of view , the Airbus offer is controlled by the threat of the 777 , ” says Mary Kirby , expert for cabin establishment , founder and editor of Runway Girl Network .	-3.6241
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats , but a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose .	-2.4017
The world travelling jet sellers are even contributing to their competition .	-4.2976
Even if they arrive at comfort , all manufacturers also offer jets with highly compressed design for cheap airlines and regional flights .	-3.2294
Airbus offers an A350 with ten-seated rows , but has not yet sold according to its own statement .	-2.7383
Until recently , Airbus highlighted the importance of more adaptability of the cabins and offered wide seats for some jets on the corridors .	-7.1923
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets , experts say that the reputation for a new industry standard will probably be charged , but could distract from the wave of 777X sales .	-3.3567
New Anti-Nicotine Vaccine Could Make Garaus	-2.5161
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could spoil fun in smoking .	-2.2266
A single dose of vaccine has been able to protect mice for a life against nicotine insearch .	-3.0670
Prior to testing people , further attempts are needed , which can take some years to continue , but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said that the first results are good .	-3.7863
“ We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to stop , trying all the methods available on the market , but have had to see that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches , ” said Cornell .	-3.7064
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been changed in such a way as to contain genetic information on the production of nicotine antibodies .	-2.7829
The virus selectively infects the liver cells that then produce a permanent power of antibodies .	-4.4841
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain , which does not experience a nicotine high .	-3.0123
In attempts , vaccinated mice that nicotine was administered contributed to its normal level of activity .	-3.1321
By contrast , mice without vaccination would have taken a “ time ” , the researchers explained , a sign that the nicotine reached their brains .	-7.5664
The experiments are described in the Science Translational Medicine .	-4.2405
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies .	-1.5674
Vaccinations had to be given so often that they were expensive and impractical to maintain the antibody level .	-2.5603
But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be much lower , because it transforms liver cells into antibody factori .    T   i    a   e .      	-6.3336
As Professor Crystal said , a future vaccine could be administered for people if he is quite sure to try children before they were tempted to try a cigarette , thereby preventing n insearc     .   T  '                 	-7.0595
More likely , smokers would use it to stop .	-1.8380
“ They know that if they start to smoke again , they feel no longer pleasure because of the nicotine vaccine , and that helps them to stop the habit , ” he explains .	-4.1168
British scientists said that the results were interesting , but at the same time warned that further research was needed .	-2.3486
Tripodi denied that Obeid had affected	-3.0652
The former minister of the Laboratory Joe Tripodi from New South Wales starts an investigation by state corruption supervision .	-3.2641
The former NSW minister denies that the rules on maritime packaging have changed to his political mentor Eddie Obeid , who had hidden participations in three plots in state-controlled countries .	-4.0168
The Independent Commission Against Corruption ( ICAC Independent Commission against Corruption ) extended its investigations on the question of whether Obeid had influenced various state ministers to extend legal contracts on the Circular Quay , where the two restaurants and a café operated without tendering following their expiry in August 2005 .	-5.0778
Now it is identified because of the accusation that Obeid ’ s hidden interest in the plots after Tripodi ’ s previous deputy staff Lynne Ashpole said accordingly on Thursday .	-11.2300
In many years of talks that began in 2005 , the government had pushed for public tenders for the Picture Contracts .	-3.2537
The powers were opposed to it and wanted longer duration times .	-3.5597
In 2009 , the leadership contracts for companies at the Circular Quay , which brought $ 2.5 million a year , were extended without public tendering .	-4.2829
Tripodi , who was port minister from February 2006 to November 2009 , originally supported public tenders .	-2.6264
But he is disputing the amendments to Obeid 's request , which , as Tripodi confirmed , had pushed for the government 's legal regulations to be reformed .	-9.5421
One of the ICAC presented phone calls showed conversations from August and September 2007 between Obeid , Tripodi and Steve Dunn , a leading official who changed to the Ministry of Port after working under Obeid in the Fisheries Authority .	-4.0311
“ Was the issue discussed in these telephone calls asked the drafting of commercial conciliation arrangements ? ” , Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi asked .	-4.0813
“ No , ” Tripodi replied .	-1.4241

Today , a proposal for discussion by the government was published after the former Laboratory Members , Maxine McKew , condemned the government ’ s comments on foreign workers , because they could be insulted by Australia ’ s neighbours .	-3.8473
“ Volume explanations such as foreigners should install behind – and , first , Australians – are a very unpleasant return in times when trade unions called for a protected labour market , ” she said today to the Australia India Institute  .                               	-7.5170
Historically , this said that white labour should be protected – and if some in the region heard an echo of this historic artifact , I would not be surprised .	-3.2232
The proposal for discussion outlines twelve measures which were once considered by former Minister for Immigration Chris Bowen                 	-6.0010
Immigration Minister Brendan O 'Connor , who was willing yesterday to talk about human trafficking in Sri Lanka , has implemented five of the recommended changes that others are still considered .	-3.3504
If the “ authenticity criterion ” is adopted , someone who requests a visa could be checked whether “ the application is real in cases where the applicant is related to or personally linked to the owner or a relevant person of the supporting company . ”	-4.0304
Companies could also be obliged to account for the number of 457 visa holders after companies that wanted to support only a small number of workers in the past have finally stopped hundreds .	-3.8124
Meanwhile , a 35-year-old Sri-Lankan asylum probably died of a heart infarct after arriving this week with a boat of refugees on the Christmas Island .	-8.4911
The disturbed nine-year son of the man , who came to Australia with him , has been supported by an adult cousin since the death of his father on Wednesday , who was also on boat .	-3.8475
Australian authorities brought the man to Christmas Island Hospital , where he died .	-1.8555
A study has been announced by the British Government to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland .	-2.3473
The work of HS2 Ltd is proposed to achieve high-speed connections between Scotland and the North of England with the beginning of Phase 1 in 2026 .	-3.2832
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said that the project “ will bring Britain closer together . ”	-1.9050
The Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown declared that he was very pleased to work with the British Government on this pla                  	-5.2191
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed railway connection between London and the West of Midla                       e       a 	-8.1213
After phase 2 , there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds .	-2.3592
In June , the government corrected the estimated costs of constructing the high-speed road between London and Northern England from 32.7 billion to 42.6 billion   pou  .	-6.6632
The British Government , which is in talks with Transport Scotland , has charged HS2 Ltd to seek further route capacity and travel time improvements for Northern England and Scotland .	-3.3919
This includes the possibility of a travel time from ultimately three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London .	-2.4816
Baroness Kramer said : “ Our goal for HS2 is a truly national route network that brings together Britain and its cities closer together . ”	-2.7510
We are progressing with HS2 because it brings enormous advantages .	-2.4135
Without it , we face a capacity crisis in our railway network .	-2.0268
But it is also about the connection between 18 British cities , including Glasgow and Edinburgh , which is improved thanks to HS2 .                     	-5.3746
Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael commented : “ Today ’ s announcement is good news for Scotland . ”	-2.1385
In the name of the Scottish Government , Keith Brown Carmichael called for “ unmistakable ” commitment to the Scottish integration into the HS2 network    to                   	-6.1926
Brown said : “ The high-speed rail connection contributes to the potential of enormous economic benefits for Scotland , but at the same time Scotland ’ s economic power also provides an argument for quick rail links throughout the UK . ”	-3.7913
That is why we are pleased to work as a partner of the British Government and to examine the options for high-speed railway links in Scotland , which creates benefits for all and complements the Glasgow-Edinburgh connection that the Scottish Government is already planning .	-5.7313
I look forward to examining the inquiry report with the British Ministers next year and jointly deciding the next steps .	-2.8302
Regulations on electronic equipment on aircraft remain in force in Australia	-2.7157
Australian air passengers must continue to switch off tablets and smartphones at startup and landing , despite efforts in the United States to relax the rules for such devices .	-3.5542
The US Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) allows US airlines to change their requirements so that passengers on their equipment read , see or play videos during critical airports e-books , provided that they are in “ flight mode . ”	-6.1102
During most of the flight , passengers are already allowed to do this , but many people find it annoying that they cannot read their e-books when they start and land .	-3.3441
Australian societies are observing the decision to implement US airlines must do vast amounts of work , but do not pursue direct plans to change their rules .	-4.0273
The CASA air traffic authority also declared that the announcement would be looked at , but emphasised that the restrictions on the use of electronic equipment in critical air stages in Australia are still applicable .	-4.3509
“ The CASA currently does not have specific regulations on the use of electronic devices in the aircraft , ” was stated .	-3.5284
The subject is subject to provisions that airlines suggest maintain safety at any time and passengers must follow the safety instructions given by cabin personnel .	-3.5606
Virgin has already held talks with the CASA about an extension of its Wi-Fi entertainment system on flights and explained that it is open to change , but they would have to be initiated by the legislator .	-3.9025
“ We would welcome a review of the authorisation of electronic devices by the CASA , because we are convinced that this would improve the customer ’ s experience after offering ( wireless entertainment ) during the flight , ” said a speaker .	-3.4179
Qantas said that the current regulations will remain until further .	-3.1073
“ Our current directives provide that electronic devices must not be used when they start and landing , and we currently have no plans to change , ” explained the company .	-3.7261
The FAA arrangements apply to US airlines .   T      i   e    e  e e e .  	-13.3966
However , we are always interested in developments in regulations that passengers can benefit and will certainly look at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it .	-3.1111
The decision affects US societies differently according to the age of the fleet .	-2.5922
They must prove that their aircraft can tolerate radio disorders through mobile devices , and change manuals , training materials , hand baggage programs and customer submission .	-3.3969
“ After an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet , it can allow passengers to use portable , lightweight electronic equipment such as tablets , e-book readers and smartphones at every height , ” the FAA announced .	-3.2802
In rare cases in bad terms , the crew will show passengers while landing turns off the devices .	-3.5425
The group also recommended to stow heavier devices when launching and landing safely under the seat or in the subjects over the seats .	-5.2351
Before the review derby against Schalke , co-travelled BVB supporters with light missiles had provided ugly scenes in the Veltins Arena .	-5.6850
Borussia Dortmund then announced hard consequences .	-1.9703
Before the Friday match of the Federal Football League against VfB Stuttgart , the Ultras reacted with one silence - first .	-3.1335
It was an unusual , almost spectacular acoustic that offered the viewer until just before the attack of the Federal Game between the German Vicemaster Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart in the Signal Iduna Park .	-4.0903
To hear were mostly the guest fans with their vocals .	-3.0210
The South Gallery , by contrast , where the most loyal of the faithful - and loudest - BVB fans stand , was initially extremely quiet : no singing , no slaughter cries .	-4.4242
The podest of the Capo , which otherwise coordinates the common fire , remained unoccupied .	-3.0268
And on the front of the gallery , together , a large flag was blowing up " Section Stadium Ban " .	-4.6047
Only as Torhüter Roman Weidenfeller entered the place as always as the first BVB player , branded short-term jubles .	-3.9685
When his team colleagues followed , there was vocal singing and worming scar - but not everywhere .	-3.6843
There was nothing in the central blocs 12 and 13 of the South Gallery .	-2.5307
Norbert Dickel also listed the positive experiences of the last few days - Derby victory , victory over Arsenal , extension of Trainer Jürgen Klopp - did not ensure celebrations .	-3.7843
Only five minutes before the attack the Capo explored his podium - and the tension that had just been tangible up until then was in a loud cry , when thickel as usual queried the mood on the ranks in the stadium .	-6.3345
The last thing was the South Gallery at the turn - and finally here was as usual the loudest place in the stadium .	-4.1728
And at the latest when the South Gallery called " Derby winner stands on " , everything was again as always .	-4.2186
Silence previously was a response to the events of the past few days .	-2.3380
Immediately before Revierderby at the FC Schalke 04 , some of the co-travelled BVB supporters had fired light rockets into the spectators and onto the square - almost the Torhüter Roman Weidenfeller met .      e                     	-7.8930
The game was delayed because of the chaotic scenes .	-2.2713
BVB-Boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had received the tops of the Dortmunder Ultras in his office - and believes Watzke 's words , this was a rather uncomfortable date for the fan representatives      events .	-5.9340
" There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra movement , " the BVB boss announced on Thursday evening at a podium discussion in Frankfurt .	-2.9758
As an immediate measure , Watzke prohibited Ultras a choreography for the home game against the VfB Stuttgart      .	-3.3065
" I have prohibited that " he explained .	-2.6973
We cannot give up the zero tolerance policy on pyrotechnology .	-1.8311
In addition , the ultras have shown different possibilities of punishment - until Tuesday they have time to decide for one .	-3.8287
Otherwise , the BVB will set a sanction by the end of next week .	-2.4829
" This will be decisive " , insured watzke .	-2.7726
You can eagerly see how the reactions in the South Gallery are .	-3.5942
Pfandhouses booming in Singapore , as the crisis in the middle class has arriveed .	-5.9506
In a shopping house in the Bendemeer shopping centre in Singapore , Janani Amirthalinga exchanges a golden arm ripe , a ring and a few earrings to pay the school fees of its daughters .	-3.4132
“ My husband and I have just bought a house , because my whole money is in it , ” says Amirthalinga .	-2.9237
Although she deserves 3,000 Singapore dollars every month ( about 1,730 euros ) as administrative staff , and her husband also works , monthly family income is not enough , she explains .	-3.4375
Indeed , demand in parts of South-East Asia – where household debt is increasing – is so great that ValueMax , where she has made her exchange , became the third house listed on the Singaporean stock exchange this week .	-3.6074
Pledging jewelry is not only a fast way to get money – 1,300 Singapore dollars in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan .	-3.2623
Typically , pfandhouses in Singapore demand an effective year rate of 17 % , which is just above the 15.4 % required by the United Overseas Bank , a local lender with a branch in the same shopping centre .	-3.6309
Pfandhouses , however , offer the advantage that there is no review of creditworthiness or income evidence here , which is why loans are possible faster than banks .	-3.6488
For this reason , millions of people in the region turn to pandhouses after families feel the pressure through rising living costs and increasing budgetary and consumer debt .	-3.5096
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans because of a loose fiscal policy in the developed economic areas , families with lower and middle-income pandhouses are seeking to compensate for the difference in falling economy .	-4.1093
This week , the Standard & Poor 's rating agency called growing budget debt , mainly through rising mortgages , a risk factor for Asian banks ' creditworthiness .	-3.2127
Malaysia , Thailand and Singapore , according to the agency ’ s assessment , have the highest budget debt in Asia relative to GDP .	-2.8029
Malaysia , with 80 % of GDP at the top of the list , is an increase of 60 % still in 2008                                     	-8.9976
Economists are also concerned about the high consumer debt in Thailand , which has come out just this week from a technical recession .	-3.0663
On Thursday , the data continued to show an existing weakness of exports and consumer demand .	-2.9431
“ In the end , this means that , given the rising cost , middle- to lower segment people ( the income scale ) will try to complement their incomes wherever possible , ” says Song Seng Wun , economist at CIMB , a Malaysian bank .	-3.8706
Historical levels of gold prices over the last two years have increased the trend to pledge personal items , as people are taking the opportunity to turn the jewelry of the family into cash .	-3.5971
In Singapore , about 70 percent of the pledged items are in the 200 pfandhouses of the city country Gold .	-3.6093
People say : “ The gold price looks good , let us pledge gold chain and return back next month . ”	-2.8893
The largest Thai fond house operator , EasyMoney , has experienced a 20 % increase in customers in recent months in his branches .	-3.3667
The growth in the pand business is so strong that ValueMax , operator of the Bendemeer branch and 15 others in Singapore , want to expand not only to neighbouring Malaysia – where the company operates four houses – but also outside Asia , says Yeah Lee Ching , Managing Director of ValueMax .	-4.0876
The company finances this with 60 % of the 66 million Singapore dollars this week with the stock exchange in Singapore .	-3.3163
While some lenders have entered the crossfire because of high interest rates , Yeah explains that pfandhouses not only offer more favourable interest rates than other lenders , but also directly increased debt .	-7.6844
“ Customers rent objects they already have , and the liquid of personal values does not increase budget training , ” she explains .	-3.6977
The bond business is increasingly accepted as a short-term , secure financing  .	-12.1115
Nor are all people who use the bond in financial difficulties .	-2.6223
Rich people from Singapore also come into the branches of ValueMax to pledge gold bars and Rolex watches , for which they receive up to 60 % of the purchase price in cash .	-3.1140
Customers from any social layer come to us .	-2.4066
“ These include wealthy people who borrow something for business or investment in the short term , or small businesses that must bridge bottlenecks in the cash flow , ” says Yeah .	-3.4416
Sometimes they simply need money very quickly .	-1.6663
NSA sucks data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help .	-2.2242
The intelligence service university Edward Snowden has a principle interest in helping Germany educate the increasingly bright NSA speed affair .	-4.3674
After the Green Member of the Group of the European Parliament , Hans-Christian Ströbele , the surprising meeting with Snowden in Russia was about the conditions under which the ex-intelligence staff would say at a German Public Prosecutor or before an inquiry committee .	-4.8453
Snowden referred to his complicated legal situation , said Ströbele to the ARD magazine " Panorama " .	-2.2887
Bailout package over 325 million Australian dollars for Tasman Health Care	-2.3967
The Australian Government is linked to the hard conditions linked to the bailout package of more than $ 325 million for Tasman healthcare to ensure that the government of the state cannot waste money .	-3.3991
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that Commonwealth will take “ immediate measures ” to avert a crisis caused by an ageing population of the island state , a higher quota of chronic diseases and system restrictions .	-3.0875
Funding for a period of four years was decided after government discussions with independent Tasman MEP Andrew Wilkie .	-2.8365
“ The government has created an emergency bailout package that , in our view , addresses the unique challenges facing the state , ” said Plibersek today .	-3.5819
The 325 million dollar package includes $ 31 million immediate aid for elections .	-2.8873
Another 2600 operations , including orthopedic interventions and treatments for gray star , should remove residues .	-2.9534
Moreover , there are money for day hospitals in Hobart and Launceston , better care for stationary stays , specialist training , mental health services and the introduction of a system for electronic recording of health data in local hospitals .	-3.5483
“ These investments correspond to the ideas that I have told clinic staff that they are the best way to improve the Tasman health system , ” said Tanya Plibersek .	-3.1862
The Minister insisted on a strict reporting and accountability by the Tasman Government .	-2.1266
The state must maintain the current level of financing in order to be able to receive money from the Commonwealth and report on where the additional money has been spent .	-3.5873
A three-headed Commission is established and should ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible .	-2.6795
As Wilkie said today , the $ 325 million would benefit little if “ they were not accompanied by real reforms that put the public Tasman health system on a more sustainable course . ”	-3.4454
Nevertheless , he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent help , which he first expressed to the Prime Minister at the beginning of                            	-5.3114
“ I am confident that federal aid will make a major contribution to taking the state ’ s public health system from the worry list , ” said Wilkie .	-2.9322
According to the government of the state , these elections will largely compete the recent cuts .	-2.6468
But the opposition ’ s health spokesman at federal level , Peter Dutton , believes that today ’ s announcement is just a “ pavement solution . ”	-2.8818
“ We are in today ’ s position because the laboratory government has deducted $ 430 million from the health system , ” he said to ABC TV .	-2.7314
It cannot be that a state government is almost half a billion dollars out of the system and that the Commonwealth is inserting 300 million and then doing as if the good news is good .	-4.3164
Dutton called for Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the bailout package for additional bureaucracy is spent .	-2.6532

Syria has destroyed its possibility to produce chemical weapons , such a monitoring group	-5.0036
Syria has destroyed important facilities to produce chemical weapons and poisonous gas munitions , explained the global chemical weapons monitoring group on Thursday , while there were serious clashes in the north of the country near one of the locations where presumably toxic substances were stored .	-3.9425
Also on Thursday , a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people have soon been killed since the civil war began soon .	-2.8775
The announcement of the Organization for the Ban on Chemical Weapons ( OPCW ) came one day before the date .	-2.7146
1 . November , which the Damascus organization based in The Hague had set to destroy all facilities for the production of chemical weapons or make “ inoperable ” , including all machines for mixing chemicals on toxic gas and filling ammunition .	-4.1370
The conclusion of this process , which is basically the first stage of destruction , is an important milestone of an ambitious timetable aimed at destroying all Syria ’ s chemical weapons by mid-2014 .	-2.9125
Destroying facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons .	-1.9149
Damascus , however , must start destroying existing weapons and stocks .	-2.2729
According to assumptions , there are about 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons in the country , including Senfgas and Nervengas Sarin .	-2.4427
The announcement came at a time when fighting was held on Thursday in the city of Safira , saying that there was a production facility for chemical weapons and storage sites , as the Syrian Monitoring Centre for Human Rights based in the United Kingdom .                                       e      	-8.8265
The activist group that follows the number of deaths through a network of activists in Syria declared 120,296 people died on Thursday .	-2.9469
These are 61,067 civilians , including 6,365 children .	-1.7920
On the part of the government , 29,954 of them belonged to President Bashar Assad 's army that 18,678 are government-friendly fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militias .	-2.7553
Also among the dead were 2,202 deserted army soldiers and 5,375 opposition fighters , many of them foreigners .	-2.6366
On 25 July , the UN estimated the number of deaths in this conflict since March 2011 to 100,000 .	-2.1562
This number has not been updated so far .	-1.8705
The conflict has forced about two million people to flee the country .	-1.9991
Assad ’ s troops have been fighting against the rebels for weeks in Safira , many of which have many links with al-Qaeda groups .	-2.7071
The observatory said that there were losses on both sides on Thursday , but did not call details .	-2.2707
The fighting underlines the danger exposed to chemical weapons inspectors , because their mission to liberate Syria from its toxic arsenal of weapons is a race against the time in the midst of a rough civil war .	-3.7144
According to the OPCW , which is closely cooperating with the United Nations , the team is now convinced that it has seen and experienced its destruction of all important production and mixing / filling facilities mentioned by Syria . ”	-3.7084
That is why “ no further inspection activities are planned . ”	-2.5376
Earlier this week , the inspectors declared that they had completed the first round of checks and visited 21 out of 23 of the sites specified by Damascus .	-4.5896
Because of security concerns , visiting two institutions was not possible , the inspectors said .	-2.7995
On Thursday , the OPWC declared that the two locations were “ abandoned ” according to Syria ’ s statement ... and the objects of the chemical weapons programme available had been shifted to other facilities that were inspected . ”	-3.9653
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two facilities that the OPCW inspectors could not visit .	-2.3668
Syria has presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons , which must be approved next month by the OPWC Executive Committee .	-2.8099
“ I draw the hat before the bravery and courage you have all shown in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever executed by this organization , ” said Ahmed Uzumcu , the Director-General of the Monitoring Organization in a comment published by OPCW .	-3.7070
For three years now , mainly Sunni Muslim rebels have been fighting in this civil war against Assad ’ s government and its security forces , many members of the Alawites , a secession of Shia Islam .	-3.2256
With regard to further developments , the head of the observatory , Rami Abdurrahman , said that there was a strong explosion on Wednesday in an air defense facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia .	-3.1366
The cause of explosion was not known , he explained .	-2.1812
Anger about Bali ’ s Bomber Players	-2.7282
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who died in 2002 at the Bali bomb attack responded to the judgment for the last of the incursions put before the court because Umar Patek should be shot off in their view .	-5.2710
Patek , who was on flight almost ten years as one of the most sought-after people of South-East Asia , was condemned yesterday for his role in building explosives for the bombing attack into a prison of 20 years .	-4.2807
He could be redundant after 15 years of punishment .	-2.8433
The 45-year-old was guilty of the mass murder because of the attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta , in which 202 people died , including 88 Australians , and many others were injured                 	-5.1535
There was also a debt in a number of terrorist charges , including a wave of explosive attacks on churches in Indonesia in the year 2000 .	-4.1831
The Public Prosecutor had called for a lifelong prison sentence , even if it is called the death penalty for the man , who , because of his reputation as a masterful bomb farmer , is called “ demolition man . ”	-4.3347
The decision has raised painful memories at June Corteen , a mother from Perth , who lost their 39-year-old twin fabrics Jane and Jenny in the devastation caused by Patek and his conspiracy nearly ten years ago .	-4.0971
With tears fighting she said that patek should have been condemned to death .	-2.2975
I really think it should follow in the footsteps of the other guy .	-2.1941
“ You should put him before a shooting command , ” said Corteen towards AAP .	-3.2126
I must live every day with the fact that I will not get any more grandchildren and I will never see my daughters anymore .	-2.8559
The Sari Club was made equal to the ground when a huge bomb exploded on 12 October 2002 shortly after 23 : 00 in a small loader parked before the night club .	-4.4630
Peter Hughes was in Paddy 's Bar , where only 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber attacker caused a backpack filled with explosives .	-5.2480
He fell into coma for a month after the attack and “ died ” three times , while he depicted a life conservation system .	-3.7861
Hughes said that Patek deserved the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cell Jemaah Islamiah – Amrozi , Mukhlas , and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the bloodbath and were executed four years ago .	-2.7018
Really , this type should be given the death penalty above all .	-2.8211
Let him live – no , there is no reason to let him live .	-2.0400
Twenty years after killing 202 people and having injured many hundreds is not much .	-2.5601
Patek is the last of the Bali bomber who was in court .	-2.7140
He was almost a decade of arrest , but was finally taken up in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad in January 2011 , where US armed forces killed Osama bin Laden just four months later .	-3.6848
During the negotiation , a FBI agent said that intelligence reports had provided the indication that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of rebuilding the link between South-East Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda .	-3.3009
“ He has not failed , ” said Corteen .	-2.3338
Until recently , he has shown no repentance of how much suffering he has added to others .	-2.9711
The judgment was made before the ten-year anniversary of the attack this year , committed with memorials in Bali and Australia .	-3.0954
“ There will be many tears this year , ” said Corteen .	-1.5281
Patek can still appeal against his judgment .	-2.0069
FAA : Passengers can now use electronic devices in aircraft ( but no mobile calls )	-6.4879
Passengers can now hear from departure to landing their electronic equipment for reading , working , games , music and using films , but not telephoning with the mobile phone , so the new guidelines published on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) in the USA .	-3.8635
But passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately .	-1.6844
How quickly they would be implemented depending on the respective airline , FAA staff Michael Huerta declared at a press conference .	-2.9403
The airlines must demonstrate to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new directives and that they have updated the training manuals of the air staff and the regulations for the confidence of the devices according to the new rules .	-4.3267
The FAA has already said that it has received plans from some airlines which want to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft .	-3.2791
Delta and JetBlue were also among these airlines               	-6.6396
“ Depending on the state of the plan , we could authorise the extended use of electronic equipment very soon , ” the FAA announced in a statement .	-3.2055
Currently , passengers must switch off smartphones , tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed .	-2.9051
They can only restart them if the aircraft has reached a height of three kilometres and the captain gives the green light .	-3.1288
When entering the landing flight , passengers must switch them off again and not restart them before the aircraft has ended .	-4.0394
According to the new directives , airlines whose aircraft could be guaranteed against electronic disruptions , allowing their passengers to use the devices in startup , landing and rolling fields , the FAA explained .	-4.0680
Most new commercial aircraft and other planes that have been transformed into larger heights for the use of Wi-Fi should meet the criteria .	-3.4585
Laura Glading , President of the Professional Association of Professional Air Accompanies , welcomed the changes        .	-5.9488

FAA may raise bans on certain electronic equipment at startup and landing	-6.7966
Last month , Mark Rosenker said the National Transportation Safety Board , the National Transport Authority , that safety experts for national transport issues on CBS News , mobile phones would still be considered a risk .	-4.0936
“ Mobile phones are really a problem , not only because they could potentially cause disruptions in navigation equipment , but because we know from the FCC that transmission from the air can also disrupt broadcasting masts , ” says Rosenker .	-3.7610
A consulting committee in the industry created by the FAA to investigate this issue recommended last month that the government allow broader use of personal electroni    equ .	-8.1014
In recent years , pressure on the FAA has increased to relax restrictions on use .	-2.2089
Critics such as the democratic Senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri believe that there are no valid security reasons for banning .	-2.6984
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to implement because the use of the devices has become omnipresent .	-2.9750
Some studies talk about this , which , up to one third of passengers , forgets or ignores the switching of the device .	-3.4983
The FAA began in 1966 to restrict the use of electronic equipment by air travellers after reports on disruptions to navigation and communication equipment by passenger companies had become known by UKW radios , which were then the latest technology trend .	-4.5588
New aircraft are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft , but they are also designed so and approved by the FAA that they do not make up electronic interferences .	-3.1502
Airlines have been offering passengers Wi-Fi for some years when the air height is reached .	-2.9671
The planes adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also more insensitive to interferences .	-2.4964
The overwhelming majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for greater use of electronic equipment under the new directives , Huerta said .	-5.5628

Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers ' Association said that he believed that the disruption by the devices is real , even if the risk is minimal .	-3.2394
Other Committee members said that there are only single reports of pilots who speak for disruption of aircraft systems through the devices , and most of them are very old .	-3.3561
However , the Committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to order the devices through passengers in the case of instrumental landing in   poor vi                     	-7.4926

Released birds saved by North Sea Drill Island	-3.2135
An air rescue service to the coast of flown birds , which was exhausted on a North Sea drilling island , has been redundant into n     .	-4.4873
The water rall was flown last month with a helicopter to Aberdeen , where it was puppled by the Scottish animal welfare organization SPCA in their rescue centre in Alloa .	-3.5928
Colin Seddon , Head of the Centre , said : “ This water rall was likely to be a winter bird of northern Europe stopped by the strong winds over the North Sea . ”	-3.3408
Apparently , the exhausted bird seeked refuge on the drill island .	-2.3015
He added : “ He could no longer fly further , so we were contacted with the request for help . ”	-2.8802

Is Europe 's elite prepared to do business with Britain ?	-1.9849
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy to a table and defining what those who want to change prosperity and work in Britain in our relations with the EU want .	-3.6285
To this end , we have commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey under British economic leaders and asked them what they think about Britain , the economy and the E        . T                         e	-8.2264
YouGov questioned more than 1,000 executives from the economy , which are part of British corporate sizes , sectors and regions .	-3.8470
The results of the survey will surprise many .	-1.6523
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now exporting outside Europe and focusing on countries that modernise and grow while states in the EU are st        e                    m                      h  	-10.9048
They want new trade links with countries such as China , India , and Brazil to be favoured from the government side , rather than stopping the long and strict process of reforming the obscure EU institutions .	-3.5090
In their view on certain legally regulated issues – from cartel law to product legislation – the majority of economic leaders believe that control over these key competences should be recovered to Westminster .	-3.6044
There was general discontent about the internal market , because , according to the companies , the costs of Brussels ’ rules would now overwhelm the benefits of being part of Europe ’ s trade area – even 40 % of large companies agreed to the most traditionally European-friendly .	-4.0915
Finally , and this is probably the most , our survey of economic leaders revealed that a clear majority of Britain wants a course towards changing the agreement and a relationship based on trade not on policy .	-3.8107
This recognition , which is found in companies of all sizes and leading corporations , shows that the economy is pushing for a “ useful change ” that returns the stitch of action to Britain .	-4.1860
There is a lot – an amendment to the agreement and better conditions for the United Kingdom would lead to a 16 % change of opinion in favour of remaining in the EU in a referendum                       	-5.8795
The Prime Minister should have no doubt : this survey shows that the British economy is behind his plan for the renegotiations of British conditions for EU membership .	-2.7347
It also shows that companies expect a significant postponement of power back to the UK from renegotiation .	-5.9299
A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary after the eurozone is moving towards a closer economic and fiscal union .	-2.7146
The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain , as the outcome of our survey shows , which means greater attention to trade and fundamental change in the Brussels approach to rules .	-7.8864
Alexei Miller of Gazprom refers to pipeline in Bulgaria as the beginning of a new gas era	-2.5109
The construction beginning of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria is the start of one of the largest European energy projects , explained by the Gazpro              	-4.6929
“ Today ’ s event is a milestone : the construction work on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline , the largest and most important project in Europe , ” said the Chairman of Gazprom , Alexei Miller , on Thursday in a statement .	-3.2542
The project is a key element in the energy security of the entire European continent .	-1.9196
South Stream should ensure more diversity in Russia ’ s export routes through Europe .	-2.7030
A contract dispute between Gazprom and its counterpart in Ukraine , where the majority of Russian gas is stored for Europe , ensures an increased risk in conventional routes , as officially heard .	-3.5550
Miller said that the direct link with Bulgaria , a member of the European Union , means that the geopolitical risks linked to transit countries have been “ forever . ”	-2.8836
Bulgarian consumers receive gas from South Stream at favourable rates when the entire project is operating in 2015 .	-2.8751
According to Gazprom , construction works in other subordinate countries should begin on the planned route at the end of the year .	-2.8365
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic metres of natural gas .	-2.2874

Consultation before the Royal Commission : Two YMCA staff accused of accusations against Jonathan Lord of sex offenders	-6.0372
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales ( NSW ) have been charged before 2011 accusations against child care Jonathan Lord from Caringbah in 2011 , as the Royal Commission has learned for sexual abuse of children .  T                              	-7.4988
But , in the opening statement before the Commission , the YMCA had said that ' the organisation never had to do with an incident of sexual child abuse ' .	-3.4575
Managing Director Phillip Hare was asked about one case in which a YMCA employee had been charged with child pornography , and another in which a sports teacher of the YMCA Caringbah Hall was condemned by him for the abuse of his entrusted children .	-9.2086
Hare said Gail Furness , a lawyer assisting the Commission , that he knew from the first case but did not know the second .	-2.7038
He acknowledged that the YMCA ’ s opening statement towards the Commission was also inaccurate in the claim that ‘ there have been external reviews of the YMCA , which recognised the YMCA as the forefront of child safety ’ .	-4.2740
Evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA was informed that it received the second lowest assessment of four possible in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities ( Ministry of Education ) in August of the year .	-3.1142
Hare , who started with the YMCA with 21 , acknowledged that the management had failed “ from me to downward ” in the attitude of Lord and not ensured that employees had been aware of their commitments to report infringements of the child safety directives .	-7.9184
Lord was condemned at the beginning of the year for sexual proceedings on twelve boys during his two-year activities for the YMCA  .         wa  a     c . ,  	-8.1536
He was condemned to at least six years in prison .	-1.6732
Hare disputes , however , that the YMCA would have a cultural problem that employees have prevented Lord from reporting infringements of children 's safety .	-3.6723
The employees said that they had observed infringements , including that Lord was alone with children , privately maintained them as babysitters , seated them on his shot , to one thing he loved it , and children playing with his mobile phone  .                                    	-8.8840
Danielle Ockwell , whose superior lord was asked for training for child protection , because she was concerned about his behaviour , said that the child service director Jacqui Barnat , who was the presented lords in the YMCA Caringbah , was “ very intimidating and most of the time was very unnear . ”	-4.4783
The managing director stated that he would not accept statements that they would not have trusted to refund their presented report .	-3.8568
Instead , he said , her friendship with Lord had affected their judgment , which is why they would not have reported it .	-6.8835
Hare said that he had told the Board of Directors of YMCA NSW that the lesson that had to draw the organization from the “ Jonathan Lord Incident ” did not affect the reporting by employees , and the Board of Directors agreed to him .                      	-6.4332
Hare said that the decision to push the employees to sign confidentiality obligations shortly after the accusations occurred was made by the managing director of the YMCA , Liam Whitley .	-3.5748
He said that this should prevent contamination of evidence , but what had been “ over-friendly ” and badly implemented .	-3.3514
The YMCA NSW was in the time when Jonathan Lord was employed there between 2009 and 2011 , not a safe organisation for children , stated Professor Stephen Smallbone by Griffith University , experts for sexual child abuse , the Commission .	-3.5501
He explained that there were “ serious problems ” in the attitude , review , construction , training and supervision of employees .	-2.9822
The hearing was postponed by 20 December .	-1.5255
Tony Blair said that he would use the chance to return as British Prime Minister , but acknowledges that a comeback is unlikely .	-2.7755
In an interview this evening on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his departure from office , the 59-year-old announced his views on various domestic issues .	-3.2281
Since its resignation in June 2007 after a decade as Head of State , Blair has largely avoided speaking on British politics , and mostly restricted its comments to foreign policy and its role as the Quartet of Peacemakers in the Middle East .	-3.9037
The question of whether he would like to return to the office of the Prime Minister was quoted by the evening standard from London with the words : “ Yes , sure , but it is unlikely that this happens , so ... ”	-3.6621
When the horse show experts found in horses in Cardiff to cure the horse of the year , they were aware that a hard competition fight was charged .	-4.3047
But none was prepared for the three years old Fenton Kirkland .	-1.8976
The Knirps , which is not even in the kindergarten and has taken his first steps only a few months ago , and his Shetland-Pony Toffee went loosely through the three rounds and got the first prize – with 30 adult opponents behind them .	-6.9416
The inseparable couple , both large , were praised for their appearance , behavior and style in the annual competition organised by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff .	-3.6079
In his performance in competition against men and women with elegant melons he had set up his plate cap in a frequent angle and led the two years old potatoes through the ring .	-3.8455
Fenton was praised by the jurors for its natural abilities to deal with the pony , which lay far above its age .	-3.1584
And Toffee received best notes for his appearance and his personality .	-2.5316
Fenton had received potatoes last March as a gift to his third birthday and since every day with the Shetland-Pony .	-3.7770
His mother , Donna , 30 , said : “ Fenton and Toffee are a great span . ”	-2.2961
They had to compete against the entire field of participants and went from the square with gold pocals and rosette .	-3.6619
It was only the second time that he had taken part in competition with substances , and we were all enthusiastic when he wo .	-6.0772

Howells told : “ The whole audience was like electricized and all have fired and clapped it . ”	-3.0686
He ran on sand the entire length of the Arena and although he looked so tiny , he has done fantastic work .	-3.4548
Fenton is crazy to animals – he loves horses , tractors and farms and has two chickens to take care of .	-2.6131
As he has started , it will not take long until he is on the “ horse of the year ” look – and I am sure he will cut off well       .	-3.9905
A speaker of the annual horse show said : “ Fenton is only three , but he knows how he must deal with his pony . ”	-6.9233
Together they are a great team .	-1.5299
The jurors evaluated fentone and potatoes afterwards how well they would have beaten and presented in the s        .	-4.3171
They respect good cooperation between pony and leader – and there were Fenton and Toffee the best in the ring .	-3.1101
I am sure that Fenton ’ s sweet clothing has contributed its part to this , that really fitted perfectly to the occasion .	-3.2613
Chinese Newspaper Should be “ Reformed ”	-2.1316
A Chinese newspaper calling for the release of a reporter accused of diffaming should be reformed explained a press regulator .	-2.9943
The New Express based in Guangzhou had printed a rare public call to release the journalist Chen Yongzhou .	-2.4092
But Chen later admitted that he adopted bribes to falsify reports on a partial company .	-2.9279
Now the New Express is being subject to “ comprehensive rectification , ” the regulatory authority explained .	-2.9527
The “ Rectification Order ” was produced by the Authority for Press and Publications , Radio , Film and Television in Guangdong .	-2.7946
Preliminary investigations showed that the New Express , which belongs to the Yangcheng Evening News Group , had published several unaccurate reports on the Zoomlion listed company between September 2012 and August 2013 .	-3.2842
“ The editorial management of the New Express was disordered , ” announced the regulatory authority in an explanation .                          	-6.5620
She said that one had decided to “ impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou and escape his reporter license . ”	-5.2380
In addition , “ the Yangcheng Evening News Group has been dependent on carrying out full rectification of the New Express and recommending that the relevant New Express responsible be identified and immediately reviewed the New Express ’ leadership team . ”	-5.9852
Chen wrote several articles for the New Express , where he reported alleged financial irregularities in a manufacturer of construction machines called zoomlion .	-3.0365
Having been arrested , the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and faced his journalistic work .	-2.5036
But then Chen occurred on state television and admitted that he published false reports against payment  .e.	-5.5984
“ In this case , I have damaged Zoomlion as well as the entire news industry and its ability to gain public confidence , ” he explained to the state news station CCTV .	-3.4391
I did it primarily because I was on money and glory .	-2.1487
I have become clear that I have acted wrongly .	-7.9353
Following Chen ’ s excuse , the New Express published an excuse on the front page and declared it failed to check the reports correctly .	-10.0814
Various well-known suspects have recently put confessions on television .	-3.1419
Experts say that confessions are still being forced routinely , despite changing the law at the beginning of the year when the authorities were banned to force someone to accuse themselves .	-7.4949
Drug tunnel with its own railway between the US and Mexico	-2.0246
One of the most refined tunnels for drug smuggling between the US and Mexico , which was fully equipped with lighting , ventilation , and electrical railway operation , has now been discovered .	-3.1738
The US authorities described the 120 times 90 centimetres measuring tunnel as one of the most sophisticated passages they ever found .	-2.9175
The tunnel which runs in the zigzag pattern over a length of just six football fields combines storage halls near Tijuana , Mexico , and San Diego , USA .	-3.4500
In the area there are countless inseparable storage halls , which make it easier to hide lorries loaded with drugs                              	-7.8773
The tunnel was closed before drugs could be transported unrecognised , the authorities explained .	-2.3290
In the discovery of the tunnel , eighth and a half tonnes of Marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were ensured , the records of the court .	-3.0618
Three men who , according to the statement of the authorities as drivers , were charged because of the ownership and the intended sale of Marijuana and Cocaine .	-3.3781
They are threatened with a guilt of prison penalties between ten years and lifelong .	-2.8083
In Nogales , Arizona , smugglers rely on an extensive underground network of disarmament channels .	-2.4631
The tunnel is the eighth big passage discovered since 2006 in San Diego .	-2.0036
Some of the biggest tunnels were discovered after the Marijuana harvest in Central Mexico in October , which faces the drug cartels facing the challenge that they can quickly bring their products to consumers .	-3.4685
In 2010 , authorities found a just 640 metres long passage with tracks that were from a kitchen in a residential house in Tijuana to two storage houses in San Diego .	-3.8768

In an interview , however , Bloom said that he and Kerr still love .	-2.3279
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents of the two-year Flynn .	-1.8745
Actor Orlando Bloom expressed himself on the separation of his wife , Topmodel Miranda Kerr .	-2.7678
In an interview with US journalist Katie Couric , who should be broadcast on Friday ( local time ) , Bloom said , " life sometimes does not go just as we plan or hope " .	-2.8975
Kerr and he himself still loved , emphasized the 36-year-old .	-2.4349
" We will support each other and love as parents of Flynn " .	-2.0977
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010 , in 2011 their sonks were born Flynn .	-2.4296
According to Lexica , veganism is subject to vegetarianism , but it is very different from this .	-11.3130
Because while vegetarians allow the consumption of crowds , ice or a strong Edamer , these dishes are not on the menu of a vegan .	-4.2514
Milk , cheese , egg , next to the waiver of meat and fish , the vegan leaves from all consumption of animal products - also honey is denied .	-3.8140
What remains , one may wonder , but if you look at it , the vegan nutritional world is characterized by a considerable wealth of ingenuity .	-4.1936
" Bread strokes are very popular " , explains Ute Henkelmann , the owner of the local reform house , who has a variety of special products for vegans .	-3.4117
Reuben Proctor also visits the shop in the Domgasse .	-3.1265
For 13 years , the native New Zealand has lived vegan , in Lampertheim he finds ( almost ) everything he needs to live . " In 1997 I pu my diet and became vegetarians " .	-3.8326
At the turn of the century the next step was taken and I became Vegan .	-2.5963
" But the conviction came not only because of nutrition , but because of the footwear , " says Proctor , who prefers normal leather .	-3.4649
He recognized that there are also other everyday concerns without animal produc .            I  a             e	-9.3416
First and foremost vegan is an ethic .	-2.0819
" I do not want animals to die for me " , Proctor expresses the maxim of vegans extending to the whole consumer behaviour .	-3.1021
Instead of mourning behind Burgern , Rühreiern oder Ruhreiern , the vegan has quickly discovered very new products , the enthusiasm increased .	-4.0623
" It is a double bonus " , says Proctor today , " actually presents vegan no waiver , no ascess , but it is an enrichment " .	-3.5169
And it is precisely these conditions that some still mean so well-meaning attempts .	-3.8580
" The addiction factor is a very decisive factor that lets you give up many quickly , similar to smoking , " Proctor offers a comparison .	-3.7011
And apply one : " Certain flavours are not to be fixed on the animal " .	-3.9202
Often it is the spices or the type of preparation that make up the taste .	-2.6239
" You can also produce the same effect in another way , " shows the vegan .	-3.1169
To a barbecue festival , for example , Proctor brings eggs , champignons and a few vegan sausages .	-4.2731
It pays attention to a well-balanced , varied diet , where it should be definitely tasted .	-4.3846
Of course you want to have something between the teeth , that is legitimate .	-2.2967
" It should taste , but this is not only to reduce to animal food , " said Proctor .	-2.6725
Health damage to eating disorders , another widespread assumption , have not suffered .	-2.2462
For me , the changeover had a positive aspect .	-2.0585
I do not accept a foreign cholesterol and have an increased vitamin share .	-2.7217
There are high-performance athletes that feed exclusively vegan .	-2.3230
" My blood values are perfect , I let me often check " , betrayed Proctor .	-2.5144
In particular , many vegansimus critics warn against the lack of vitamin B12 .	-2.1523
" Since animals are fed with feed rather than grass on pasture , it is questionable whether in the meat you buy in the refrigerator , the vitamin B12 share is high , " Proctor finds .	-3.9952
For vegans there is also the possibility to take the coenzyme in the form of tablets .	-2.5777
" My B12 values are in order " , he explains .	-1.5466
Large ways do not need to go Proctor for food procurement .	-2.7433
After all , there are basic food everywhere and every supermarket has now soya milk and other products .	-3.4829
All I need is on site .	-2.1038
Only from and to buy something special .	-2.3927
" Many people overlook the fact that only the finished products are expensive , but so it behaves with " ordinary " finished products as well known " .	-3.7755
Anyway , the preparation of vegan courts is far more favourable and less time-consuming than is commonly accepted .	-3.0059
" In the kitchen there is much to discover , with a few small tins you can get good if not partly better results " , says Proctor .	-3.5933
Margarine instead of butter , somewhat more backpowder and carbon acid instead of egg , with its vegan cheese cakes , Proctor could also bring his silencers to amazing .	-4.2905
Family festivals give the vegan a new spice .	-2.8392
This has momentum when you cook together .	-14.0372
" The situations that can emerge are as different as the people themselves , " says Proctor .	-2.4452
Of course , he has already been sceptical .	-2.9960
Do not taste my food anymore ?	-1.9789
" Should I feel bad now because I drink milk ? " - on such questions you have to act as a vegan with fingerprint sensation .	-3.9673
" I do not reject people , I am part of this society , " Proctor does not want an enclave date .	-3.0228
And , more precisely , the everyday world does not appear as veganfremd as it suspects - and the vegan does not accept as much in everyday life as they are .	-5.0466

Tax for foreign real estate owners against London ’ s Speculation Bubble	-2.0167
The Treasury has provisionally calculated the CGT measure , but still waits for the final decision of Chancellor George Osborne , who imposed a tax of 7 % in the 2012 budget on apartments that cost more than two million pounds , and annual charges for buyers , apartments as a company and not as individuals .	-4.3088
The revenues from the Tax on Housing Property in the Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea districts , which were 708 million pounds in the fiscal year 2012 / 13 , already exceed the revenue for Northern Ireland , Wales , Scotland , North-East , Yorkshire and the Humber region .	-4.4464
Cook said : “ Following the increases in the tax on high-price apartments and the introduction of the legislation against dealing with it , one can hardly claim that high-quality properties are too low , regardless of the effects of the obsolete community tax system . ”	-4.3659
“ But this step could make some foreign investors more restrained in purchasing real estate in London , or preventing owners from selling from it , ” he added .	-3.2567

Scientists could throw more light on what connection the tail of a dog is with his mood .	-3.4120
Previous research had shown that happy dogs with the tail woven more to the right ( from the point of view of the dog ) , while it was the left for nervous dogs .	-5.2751
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive and respond to these subtle differences .	-2.3421
Professor Georgio Vallortigara , a neuroscientist at the University of Trient , said : “ Man is well known that the left and right brain half respond differently to stimuli that create positive or negative emotions . ”	-3.4984
Here we tried to look at this in other species .	-1.9717
He also noted that the right brain half of the movement of the left is and vice versa , just like humans , and that the two hemispheres played different roles in feelings .	-3.9579
To learn more about how dogs respond to the sidelined torque of their species , researchers monitored the animals while these films looked at other dogs .	-3.5697
They measure the heart rate of the four legs and analyzed the behavior .	-2.5332
Probably we will soon understand why the cock is moving in the one time in the other direction .	-3.0842
Professor Vallortigara said : “ We have shown the dogs films with dogs – either a naturally faithful version or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects , and thus we could control the tail movement more left or right . ”	-3.6640
When the animals saw how an otherwise unpressed dog has moved the tail to the right ( from the perspective of the gentle dog from seen ) , they remained completely relaxed .                     	-6.2513
But was the tail primarily to the left ( again from the perspective of the dog that weddles ) , so their heart rate rose and they looked unsettled .	-4.7900
Professor Vallortigara does not deliberately communicate the dogs through these movements .	-2.2373
It is rather convinced that the dogs would have learned from experience in what movements they should worry and when not .	-4.9476
He said : “ If you have different encounters with other dogs and link the tail to a direction more with friendly behavior and the right produces a less friendly behavior , then you react on the basis of these experiences . ”	-4.5446
The researchers say that the knowledge of dogs , veterinarians and trainers could help better understand the emotions of their animal .	-6.2089
John Bradshaw , expert on dog behavior and guest scholarship at the Faculty of Animal Healing Customers at the University of Bristol declared that this was not the first study when investigating whether left and right is important for dogs .	-4.2205
Last year , a team of the University of Lincoln emerged that dogs turn the head to the left when they view an aggressive dog , and right when it is a satisfied dog .	-3.5687
In a different research at the University of Victoria in Canada , the following was : “ Dogs go rather to a robot dog when , tail <unk> left wonders and not to become troubled rather than the Italian study . ”	-5.0116
According to his statement , the differences could therefore stem that the dogs in different studies did not interpret the animals in the films or the robot dogs as a dog .	-3.4079
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could help , he explained .	-2.1607
“ Although there are considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two brain halves are used for different purposes , many of the details still need to be determined – and dogs are no exception , ” says Bradshaw .	-3.4560
But , because their behaviour can simply be recorded , it will probably not take long to understand why the tail sometimes moves in one direction , sometimes in the other .	-3.5871

Pope Francis appoints first Cardinals	-5.8432
Pope Francis will first appeal to new Catholic Church cardinals , as the Vatican announced on Thursday .	-2.9668
Cardinals are the highest clerics in the Catholic Church after the Pope and they are also choosing a Pope , so that Francis will appoint the first group of men who will eventually participate in the election of his successor .	-3.5866
There are currently 201 cardinals .	-1.4407
However , a cardinal that has reached an age of 80 can no longer participate in the Pope ’ s election – a group of 120 “ eligible cardinals . ”	-3.1095
In an explanation where the message was announced , Pater Federico Lombardi , a spokesman of the Vatican , will take place a meeting of all the cardinals before the ceremony is held to appoint the new cardinals , which are also known as a consister .	-4.0941
“ Pope Francis decided to announce its decision to convene the Consistorium in February in advance so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from all over the world can be planned , ” said Lombardi .	-3.3296
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of eligible cardinals will probably have fallen to February .	-2.4811
He explained that a Pope usually appointed as many cardinals as necessary , so that the number of eligible cardinals are again 120 , and as many cardinals as he wants .	-7.5083
The Consistorium next year is important because it is the first since the election of Francis in March this year , said Valero .	-3.1032
There is currently some overhang on the part of Europe and , in particular , Italy .	-2.6722
“ It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore the balance , ” he said .                                   	-5.6122
40 % of Catholics live in South America , but they have only a tiny number of cardinals .	-2.1308
The Cardinals will also be the first to appoint a group of eight cardinals from all over the world since the formation of the Cardinal Council established by Francis .	-9.4384
In the past , the Pope decided everything alone .	-1.6356
“ Now Francis has selected these eight cardinals to help him , ” said Valero .	-2.0559
He said that it was “ well possible ” that Francis would ask the Cardinals for the Council .           	-4.4323
But so far we have not been in this situation – that is all very new .	-2.9427
Valero said that typically the bishops from large places would be called Cardinals , but Francis is “ full of surprises – so we do not know who he appoints . ”	-3.2982
GM calls for new pickup trucks in the USA to repair the seat rejection	-3.1225

In some of the cars , there may be a defect in the mechanism for the resetting of the front seat length .	-3.2128
For this reason , they do not meet the Federal Guidelines for Vehicle Safety at head restraints .	-3.0505
“ If the head restraints are appearing from the back to the vehicle , it is possible that the head restraints do not protect the occupants correctly , so that there is an increased risk of infringement , ” was read on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ( NHTSA ) website .	-4.8678
The recalled models were manufactured between 1 August and 10 September .	-2.0328
The delivery of GM trucks began in June and represents the most important start of the leading American car manufacturer since insolvency-related restructuring in 2009 .	-3.3310
GM informed vehicle owners about the defect in the first octoberhalf .	-2.3135
NHTSA was unable to check the notification letter for the 16-day government shutdown , which had a negative impact on car sales in October .	-3.3004
The sale of the Silverado and Sierra trucks , which were redeveloped for the model year 2014 , increased by 20 % in the first ten months of the year , explained GM on Frida                   	-5.2095

Nathaniel P. Morris is a student in the second year at the Harvard Medical School .	-2.1859
I am currently reading a terribly sad book .	-4.4654
It is a book that I believed that it would lead me during the second second year of my medical studies and give me hope again .	-3.5431
It is called “ The Audacity to Win ” ( Courage to win ) and describes the Memoirs Barack Obama for the 2008 presidential election .	-3.2195
When I finish with my patients ' writings and go to bed in the evening , the book returns me to a time when politics could inspire millions and rob the breath of a speech .	-4.7653
The election became a landslide victory and news speakers inside the historic importance of this hour .	-7.9427
My classmates went before joy and my parents collected all newspapers they could find .	-2.5113
A young team of visionaries was on the road to the White House and the nation was ready for change .	-2.3578
When Obama switched to office in 2008 , he had approval values       8              .	-8.8168
And then I close the book .	-1.1242
Switching to the present is an evil awakening as if you are taken from a dream .	-3.3206
It is difficult to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague memory , a sad reminder of missed opportunities .	-2.5172
Indeed , something has changed in the years since I first voted .	-2.4984
But it is simply nothing I could have imagined .	-1.7226
I recognise the great and versatile things that Obama has achieved , from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for health insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq , the end of the forced concealment of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden           .	-4.0135
I too believe that the party political adetactics have tipped too many aspirations to make our nation move forward : immigration reform , a public option for health insurance and the closure of Guantanamo Bay , to name just a few .	-3.9956
However , after countless times I defended the Obama administration to colleagues and families , I end up with my statement att                    	-6.7781
I have achieved a point of political despair .	-1.5594
Republican blockade policy cannot explain why the listening of foreign leaders or the killing of innocent children by drones overseas .	-10.4146
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data about American private life and why whistleblowers are punished , disclose government misconduct .	-2.9987
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki , an American citizen , was murdered without procedures , still manages public financing and expenditure limits during the presidential elections                                                     	-10.1342
It does not justify the results of a report which states that the White House ’ s efforts to calm up the media are the most “ aggressive ... since the Nixon Government . ”	-2.9120
And , recently , it cannot apologize for a simple website to be designed in more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act .	-3.2566
I do not know whether it is what I should have expected .	-1.6753
Whether I should have understood with 18 that government work could contradict its previous political campaigns .	-2.4928
Obviously , the Members ' Office is not a predictable course , as an opposition party and accidental events such as the Newtown massacre characterise public discussion .	-3.3648
But when I look at the examples above , they seem largely elected by the government itself .	-2.6743
And that bothers me most .	-1.8619
I have elected Obama again in 2012 , not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy              	-4.5612
With Romney , a confusing and ungornous alternative was that he did not seem to set his direction and positions .	-3.2726
I had the impression that a second term for Obama , free of pressure from future elections , would fulfil the hope that we had heard for so long                    	-5.5517
But , with the decline in Obama ’ s approval values below 45 % this week , the return to 2008 has become so harder by this book .	-3.4153
It arouses me the longing for the many promises that have dissolved in air .	-2.9128
This week I read a section in the book that describes how Obama had to stuck a serious loss against Clinton in the pre-elections in Pennsylvania .	-2.9951
In a meeting with the electoral assistants following the decision , he said to his employees that they would have to come back to the course and follow the purpose of their cau       .	-4.5084

Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate , which are important for deciding whether the CO2 and mining taxes are deleted or cut .	-3.0280
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and that the daughters of Abbott would personally benefit from the laws .	-2.5981
“ He is in a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave , because if one of his daughters becomes pregnant , he has a direct interest in whether or not she receives holidays , ” said Palmer .	-3.3261

RBS Suspends Two Forex Traders	-1.6072
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange department , so two people familiar with the situation ; this is another indication that the global authoritarian investigation into the alleged manipulation of the monetary market is rapidly receiving drivi                	-5.9528
Some of the world ’ s largest banks , including UBS , barclays , Deutsche Bank , and RBS , confirmed that they cooperate with the authorities in the world ’ s largest financial market investigations , where USD 5.3 trillion change the owner every day .                                   	-6.4547
The two dealers would be the first RBS employees suspended in the expanding investigation that the scandal for the Libor Interbanking business would be .	-3.9814

“ Our investigations on this subject continue and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulatory authorities , ” said the Bank two w w w                 .	-7.6691
Last month , the situation indicated that the RBS had recorded the records of emails and instant messages sent by and to an earlier dealer to the British Supervisory Authority , the Financial Conduct Authority .	-3.4483

UBS announced this week that she had taken steps against some of her employees after the Swiss Regulatory Authority Finma had declared that she examined an alleged manipulation of the foreign exchange market in a number of Swiss banks .	-3.6998
At least six authorities worldwide – the European Commission , Finma , the Swiss Competition Authority Weko , the FCA , the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently dealing with accusations that bankers should have discussed transactions in the monetary market .	-3.6447
HSBC , Citigroup , JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also initiated internal investigations or received information requests from authorities , said the situation familiar per       p .	-4.1199
Banks combine instant messages and emails from several years in search of cases of misconduct .	-2.6393
The news about these investigations has undermined traders in an area that has been one of the most profitable investment banks ’ trading units in recent years , but this year has been under pressure because low volatility in currencies restricts the opportunities for speculators .	-4.2530
Some bankers have tried to downplay the affair and said that it is almost impossible to manipulate the extensive and highly liquid foreign exchange market , but leading traders believe that this is not necessarily true .	-3.0410
A leading trader noted that , despite the enormous daily volume in forex trading , the fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use of its own internal platforms by banks leads to “ influence the market with very low Ticket prices . ”	-3.9846

Referentin is Professor Johanna Rahner .	-1.7168
The Ecumenical Conversation Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Evangelic Church Communities Salem , the Salem Castle and the Cultural Office of Lake Constance .	-2.8777
Johanna Rahner wants to go into the forum of how people today classify the ' last things ' after death .	-3.1873
If people have known too much of this over the past centuries , setting on the images of heaven and hell that have still characterized our ideas , " the contemporary prophetic lessons are characterized by the hopes of completion rather than a certain embarrassment or even linguistic o                             	-8.3297
" The greater hope is Christians and Christians belonged to religious criticism , " says the referent .	-2.7183
You have provided us with so many question marks that the exclamation marks seem to have come to us ' .	-3.2577
Johanna Rahner continues to say : ' But the crucial challenge remains the annoyance of death ' .	-2.3903
The question of those longing ' who dreams that at the end everything may be good ' .	-3.5388
Johanna Rahner , born in Baden-Baden in 1962 , studied Catholic Theology and Biology at the Albert-Ludwigs-University of Freiburg from 1982 to 1989 .	-2.3513

The God Service accompanied the group Laudato-Si in the morning , in the afternoon of the youth choir The Spirit .	-3.1352
With the reception of the company acrament , young people said yes to their baptism and requested the power of the Holy Spirit .	-2.8680
The companies have prepared themselves in recent months , under the direction of Diakon Reiner Dehner and the help of many members of the community on the great festival .	-4.1755
In different projects , they learned to know different tasks of Christian community life and together experienced the Youth Day in Unterpower Valley .	-7.8935
Illmensee : Second mountain bike race enthusiastically enthusiastically p   eee  p ...	-5.3914
There were 214 bicycle riders to Illmensee when weather was beautiful to manage the course over the hills around the lake .	-5.3332
This informs Ulrich Knobel from the Illmensee Sports Association .	-2.5021
Among the participants , in particular on the short distance over 15 kilometres and 300 metres of altitude , also numerous everyone wheeled who wanted to exercise their hobby in competition atmospher        .	-6.7802
Two junior drivers of the German top class were also at the start in this competition : Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came with the recommendation for good placements at the German Championships .	-3.6829
These two expected themselves from the field .	-2.8055
As in the previous year , Felix Bader could save a small time advantage and defended his title as a total victor of the short distance .	-3.4466
Pascal Greubel was able to place itself on square two .	-3.3855
At the ladies it was Theresa Duelli from the team nightmare that managed to win at the top of the winner .	-3.9605
On square two and three came Anne Adel from Illmensee and Leonie Drivers from Owingen .	-2.6058
A pleasant development is the growing number of drivers living or working in the community .	-2.6334
Not only in terms of performance was the whole range of athletes .	-6.5095
The age structure also ran over ten years at the youngest up to more than 70 years at the oldest starters .	-3.5280
In the main race , more absolute top athletes were at the start this year .	-2.9650
Four drivers were able to stop from regional top drivers .	-2.9484
Including Philipp Pangerl , a mountain bike half professional from the Black Tusk Racing team .	-2.6139
Pangerl , together with one team colleague , was already twice the world champion in the 12-hour driving     ho  .	-4.7494
This year he became European Champions in this special discipline .	-2.0508
With Roland Ballerstedt , who already calls his own German master title in Duathlon .	-3.2391
After 45 kilometres and 900 metres of altitude , there was a wimper beating final in the destination in front of the three lakes hall .	-4.8891
Pangerl raste as the first on the target line .	-2.1593
Only one second behind this was the Routinier Ballerstedt able to secure the second place in total    r           e  d '       a 	-9.7378
At the same time , Hermann and Warthmann came to the goal as a third of the overall rating .	-3.3075
In ladies and gentlemen , Christiane Cohsmann was the most time race in the main race .	-3.0414
The second place secured Areane Blersch from Binzwangen before Natascha Werner from Stuttgart .	-2.8979
Athletes and helpers were very satisfied with the smooth and well-organized expiration of the event .	-2.8698
On the way through mud , rivers and jungles for free medical care	-2.4085
Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical help to remote villages in Cameroon	-2.0227
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend treating hundreds of patients	-2.2901
In the West African country there are not many doctors , only one for 5,000 people .	-4.7578

Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 of the CNN Heroes of 2013 .	-1.9756
You can vote in the top 10 for him or one of the other heroes to choose him to the CNN Hero of the Year .	-2.6736
The winner receives $ 250,000 to continue his exceptional work .	-2.1407
For 21 years , George ’ s bwave saw how his sick father always lost consciousness and travelled to hospitals who did not have the means to help him .	-3.5175
Jamef Bwelle was injured in 1981 in a car accident near Yaoundé , the capital of Cameroon .	-2.2370
First he had only a broken arm , but then an inflammation expanded to his brain and caused a hematom that should affect him for the rest of his life .	-3.3707
“ There were no neurosurges in Cameroon , ” said Georges Bwelle .	-2.0925
We would have published him from Cameroon if we had had the money .	-2.1423
Instead , Bwelle spent years of accompanying his father into overcrowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer .	-6.4947
“ It is not easy ” , comments Bwelle .	-2.1399
You can leave the House at five a.m. and run to the hospital to be the first , and yet it is not the first .	-3.1883
There are many patients .	-1.3161
Some people even die because they have to wait .	-1.6776
The situation has hardly changed since Bwelle ’ s father died in 2002 .	-1.8969
In Cameroon there is only one doctor for 5,000 people , so the World Health Organization .	-2.4022
On the other hand , the relationship in the United States lies with a doctor for 4 1 peo                           e	-8.3016
But even if there were a doctor for them , most Cameroons could not afford to visit .	-2.4269
Two out of five people live below the poverty line and almost three-quarters of health expenditure in the country are private .	-2.3896
“ The only problem they have is poverty , ” says Bwelle .	-1.8562
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life .	-1.2341
His father and so many of his compatriots suffered to see the decision in Bwelle to do something about it .	-2.9644
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team conducted 700 free operations last year .	-8.0704
He became a doctor himself and works as a fake surgeon in the Central Hospital in Yaou      .	-6.7506
In addition , he founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME , which travels to rural areas at weekends and offers free medical care there .	-3.0848
Since 2008 he and his volunteer group have helped almost 32,000 people .	-2.0086
Almost every Friday he forces and up to 30 people into small buses and travel to the villages that need help with the corrupted medical equipment .	-10.3150
Not always everything is smooth .	-1.9177
Already more than once they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud .	-3.0498
But when they arrive , they will receive like heroes : a festival , singing , and dancing , and the best accommodation the place has to offer .	-4.5640
In these villages , free medical supply is really a reason for celebrating and waving – with its broad smile and its borderless energy – is pleased with the happy celebration .	-4.2149
Next morning , the team begins with the investigation of hundreds of patients .	-2.1702
“ Per journey we treat 500 people , ” says Bwelle .	-2.5000
They come from a radius of 60 kilometres around the village – and this on foot .	-2.7689
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas .	-2.3976
Many people are treated for malaria , tuberculosis , malnutrition , diabetes , parasites and sexually transferable diseases .	-2.2231
Other crutches , donated glasses or free birth documents – a document required for school , but many poor families simply cannot afford .	-3.1117
In the evening , the team executes simple operations with local stunning .	-2.2775
The operations usually take place in a school , the town hall or an apartment ; after the intervention the patients are up and go to the recreational area to make space for the next .	-3.9508
The lighting for the OP and the disinfection equipment is fed from the generator of the group , thus working the wave and its volunteers to the early hours of the morning on Sunday .	-3.6030
It is a strict pensum , but the village musicians usually help keep the team motivated .	-2.6847
“ You drum all night to keep waking and continue our work , ” says Bwelle .	-2.6468
On Sunday the team then returns to the city , tired , but proud of the work done .	-2.8459
The group – a mixture of Cameroon doctors and foreign medical students – has carried out 700 free operations last year and knows that , with its work , it has an enormous difference for the people it helps .	-3.8141
A man explained that the free operation of a breakdown that he received has now enabled him to work again .	-3.4068
“ This changes the future of my family , ” the man said .	-2.2269
Besides the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital , Bwelle works at night in private clinics in Yaoundé .	-3.0194
With this second job , he finances 60 % of his non-profit activity , says Bwelle ; the rest come from private donations .	-3.1153
“ I really do not know when he sleeps , ” says Katie O ’ Malley , who studied at Drexel University in Philadelphia Medicine in the second year , and voluntarily worked in Bwelle ’ s group .	-3.3177
It is always either in the hospital or is trying to raise money for the organization so that it can go to these campaigns .                      	-6.5617
For medical and nurse students such as O 'Malley , who come from the US and Europe and support the wave , this is an opportunity to gain practical experiences that they would never get at home .	-3.4168
“ We can be with operations where we help to tap blood or keep the Dr. Bwelle instruments , ” explains O 'Malley .	-9.0925
This would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year .	-1.8486
The students usually pay their trip to Cameroon and usually bring frequently donated sanitation material .	-3.2861
But once they are in Yaoundé , Bwelle takes over accommodation , transportation and guide .	-6.6483
“ He is quite undoubtedly a hero , ” says O 'Malley .	-2.2553
He dedicates his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroon people does not know limi                               h	-7.9282
The almost constant work is not a burden for the wave .	-2.7281
Helping others to a more happier life , thus meeting a promise that he has given his father , is preparing him great pleasure .	-3.9189
“ I am so happy when I do this work , ” says Bwelle .	-2.5077
And I think of my father .	-1.3394
I hope he sees what I do .	-1.2884
I make it to bring people back to laugh and to alleviate the pain .	-2.1536

Mastering the Fight	-1.6982
The role of the Santiago , the old man in Hemingways Novelle " The Old Man and the Sea " , is Horst Janson cut on body .	-2.7298
Janson is himself an old hare in his metier , the art of acting .	-2.4245
The old man Santiago cannot do anything about fishing .	-3.0361
The two simply complement themselves greatly .	-6.1381
It is almost thought to be able to see the wrinkles in the neck of the old man , of whom the fishing young Manolo spe .	-7.7892
If Santiago tires of life bows on the chair , that is real at Janson .	-2.6826
In addition , the role of the old fishermen is through and through a character that Janson excellently masters .	-2.7882
Hemingway told the history of a fighter , a courageous man who does not give up and ultimately wins the fight against fish by his knowledge and also his willingness to        .	-4.4270
Janson is on the stage in large routes as a sole player .	-3.7896
He manages to focus the attention of the audience so that his monologues are not boring m                       	-6.6190
His efforts to finally draw the fish to the surface of the water are so real that the viewers forget that the sea consists of only blue-lit water bottle .            e                  a  s  .     e 	-10.6067
Director Jens Hasselmann lets the old man act in the boat before the fishing village .	-2.3606
In the course of the performance he puts the active scene into light : the cottage of Santiago , the bar of the singer Marie-Luise Funst , who sings with her songs and her magnificent voice the feeling of life of Cub .                         	-6.8538
The four musicians play Cuba 's rhythm and are also guests of the bar .	-2.3388
Tourism : Descending to the Romans	-1.4134
A wastewater channel from the Roman period is received on around 120 meters length below Cologne .	-3.4693
Those who visit Cologne are not over at the Duo .                       	-8.2048
Around 157 meters the two towers are in the sky and make it the second highest church building in Europe .	-3.5186
But only a few visitors that amaze the two filigrant church towers are aware that there is also a lot to discover under the Cathedral .	-3.6703
Rainer Schulze is an expert in Cologne Underworld .	-1.7740
Meeting point for its guided tours is the service centre of Cologne Tourism directly on the Duomo .	-2.5568
The tour starts quite unspectacular : " We start in the underground car park " , says Schulze .	-2.7139
In the seventies , the city fathers wanted a car-friendly city , and therefore the remains of the old city wall remained only what was not too big .	-6.3530
Most users of the parking house are therefore past the Roman remains today and only display their car .	-4.0941
But anyone who looks more closely discovers an archaeological finding separated by metal grids in the parking deck D2 .	-4.0852
There are about five metres of high ruins made of large stones .	-3.4381
" There are remains of the Roman city wall built in the second half of the first century after Christ , " tells Schulze .	-2.7072
Before returning to the daylight , Schulze leaves the participants at the upper park level to throw a look into a dark , 15 meters deep coat .	-8.5233
This is the well of the old cathedral , which is unfortunately hardly perceived .	-2.8169
The next station of the tour is the pretorium , and here the participants go down to the depth .	-3.4420
We are experiencing the headquarters of the once-powerful man north of the Alps , the pretor of the CCAA .	-2.5988
What CCAA means is a visitor .	-1.7416
" The abbreviation stands for " Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium " , which means in good German as much as " City of Roman Law and City of the Agrippines , founded under Emperor Claudius at the very place of the Altar for the Emperor " .	-6.3765
And the pretorio is the former Statthalter Palace , the Roman Empire ’ s Power Centre in the Rhine .	-2.9763
From the advance of the exhibition , tunnel access to the Roman sewage water channel , which is received here on around 120 meters length   .      a s o t t . T	-8.1550
" You can quietly go along the so-called Cloaca Maxima if you want " , Schulze munters the guests .	-3.4756
Surprise still has school .	-2.0627
After getting the key at the box , he leads the group to a 16-meter deep , committable chess .	-4.1565
" We are now in the mikwe , a ritual Jewish bath " , he explains .	-2.1446
The Jewish community built its bath deeply into the ground to come to the groundwater , which was essential for the ritual washings      e   .	-7.9167
Until today , different water stands are readable by changing levels of the Rhine in the lower end of the mikwe , whose origins date back to the eighth century .	-4.2397
The mikwe will be part of an archaeological zone on the town hall square for which the construction works will soon begin .	-3.6351
But some years will pass until completion .	-3.0981
Leg almost chacked : Rerun of Rocker Process	-2.9837
A bloody attack in the rocker emily is reopened after four years .	-2.5241
A process because of attempted death , dangerous body injury and damage to two 30-year-olds began before the Frankfurt district court    .	-4.3382
It is accompanied by strict safety provisions .	-1.7983
The defendants are silent on the breakdown  .             	-6.2423
They should have been active in the rocker scene and heard one of the bandidos at that time .	-2.7805
The Public Prosecutor raises them in a car in June 2009 , together with unknown complices in Finowfurt , to have stocked on three men .	-4.7168
All the victims were hardly injured , a man would have lost almost his leg .	-2.5686
The victims should have heard of competing grouping Hell 's Angels .	-2.5539
One should have been a high-level member of Berlin .	-4.6278
Preceded , apparently , a persecution hunt with several cars .	-3.0152
According to the charge , it was about review fighting and a demonstration of power .	-2.8614
The two accused were released at the beginning of 2012 in a first procedure .	-2.3836
A court speaker said at the time that it was unable to prove that men were actually involved in the bloody fault .	-3.3591
The perpetrators had borne masks and were not recognized .	-2.2705
The Federal Court of Justice urged the judgment following the revision of the Public Prosecutor 's Office and referred it back to the Court of Austria for a new negotiation .	-3.9687
One of the defendants is currently because of another dose in open enforcement .	-3.3580
The starting point was mainly the reconstruction of procedures in action .	-3.9945
As a witness the Commissioner was investigating then .	-6.4590
In the centre , mobile talks were talked about the defendants and other people who had listened to the police  e          we w     	-8.8868
It is difficult that rockers are almost always complying with a law for them - not saying .	-4.1101
This also applies to the victims    e    .    T           	-8.1436
In the first process , only one of the victims had packed out .	-2.2848
Public Prosecutor Stefan Golfier of the Prosecutor of Frankfurt ( Or ) said on demand that new traces have emerged since the last procedure .	-3.4683
11 other days of negotiation are set for the process .	-2.7123
The District Society Does  Not Think	-3.0373
The night was long , the music loud and the mood good , but at some point it goes home .	-2.9368
Only : In the buildings of people on the front-passenger and residue , the hunger is noticeable .	-3.4352
Clearly , one or two cocktails or sects may be responsible for this !	-2.8406
What is closer than driving to the next drive-in to get a small thing ?	-3.7455
I admit that I will be happy to arrive at Fastfood Holen late night or early morning .	-4.1702
A few pomes , a cola , a castle - and then nix as from home and into bed !	-2.8602
But on the homeway , the obvious differences between me and other hungry Disco generators can be noticed .	-3.6255
Because what must one miss that you throw your fast food bags out of the car window with an ever-regularity ? !	-4.6306
Above all on weekends there are thrown away paper bags on street edges and o  parents .	-7.0998
'Why ? ' , I wonder .	-1.7330
Are people too doof to take the bags with home respective to the next waste bucket ?	-2.9493
It is not just the case that the paper product negotiates the landscape .	-2.2747
Bags have already hidden transport facilities like guiding planks , thereby causing accidents .	-3.4135
About what said ' district society ' , but probably does not even know what this word means .	-3.8198
If you are more often on the evening , first with several people in the car , you know how a backbank can look after celebrated nights : plains , bottles and other waste tower there .	-4.9025
There would be more or less nix too - unlike the street , where none wants to trample on the food remains of othe                  	-7.9489
I already see the day when cities and communities will have to flourish the space - and the fast food chains for their bags must be demanded .	-4.4427
Obama ’ s Health Withdrawal	-1.9970
According to serious criticism , yesterday , President Obama made a withdrawal in his often repeated , clear promise : “ If you like your health insurance , you can keep them . ”	-3.5980
After hundreds of thousands of their insurers have received a letter of termination , Republicans have received the president in recent days that he has misled the American public .	-3.7394
Yesterday , Obama relativated his original promise .	-1.6878
“ The vast majority of citizens who have functioning health insurance can keep them , ” he said in a speech in Boston .	-2.5575
In response to the many media reports on the terminations , Obama called on those Americans who have received such communications to look around the free market after a new insurance .	-3.2569
Most citizens could thus receive better , more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or more favourable than predicted .	-2.9197
“ You come a better offer , ” he said .	-1.8460
The government called it little surprise that the five percent of the population , who have completed an insurance , would have to look at another rate as its treaty does not comply with the new standards after the Affordable Care Act .	-4.0207
“ I would like to say quite directly to these Americans : you deserved better , ” said Sebelius at a hearing before the Committee on Energy and Trade in Washington .	-3.2455
Sebelius , responsible for implementing the Affordable Care Act , stated that the launch of the online platform had been “ miserable ” since October .	-2.7574
“ I am as frustrated and angry as everyone else , ” she said .	-2.3299
I am determined to regain your trust .	-1.3713
After a dispute with the Republican MEP Billy Long from Missouri , this statement by an appointed Sebelius to a behind her seated consultant at yesterday 's hearing in the House of Representatives , whether it should be obliged to participate in Obamacare .	-5.1938
After more than three hours of consultation , Long Sebelius repeatedly asked why the Affordable Care Act ’ s “ architect ” did not voluntarily renounce government-sponsored insurance to complete a fare at HealthCare.gov , which she wants to sell millions of Americans .	-3.9799
Government in Jerusalem does not confirm attacks on Syria ’ s air base .	-2.4014
An American government official who wanted to remain anonymous on Thursday claimed that Israeli combat aircraft would have attacked one day before an air base in Syria ’ s Latakia .	-3.7612
The objective was ' missiles and related equipment ' , which the Israeli Government feared that they were designed for Lebanese Hezbollah , according to CNN .	-6.8929
Syrian and Lebanese media , as well as the Arab transmitter Al-Arabiya , had previously reported that the base in the port city of Latakia was destroyed on Thursday night , and that Israelis made responsible for t                       	-6.5810
The Israeli television channel 2 showed satellite images of the base in Latakia , where Russian defense missiles from the type S-125 Newa and a battery of SA-3 missiles , which , according to Channel 2 , have a range of 35 kilometres and can transport explosives up to 70 kilograms .	-4.3731
The Government in Jerusalem has officially not confirmed the attack .	-4.8511
However , Reuter ’ s news agency is also quoting an anonymous Israeli government official with the words he believes that Israel has carried out the attack , but is not sure .	-3.5227
One speaker from the Israeli Department of Defence certainly said : ' We are not commenting on these  r '               . A '    	-6.7463
The journalist Ron Ben-Yishai emphasized in the daily newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth that the Syrian regime has already succeeded earlier , partly successfully , tried to provide ground air missiles to Hezbollah .	-3.4841
The Israeli Government had repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to provide Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons means crossing a ' red line ' that would follow a military response .	-2.8185
John Kerry explains in an unprecedented admission that US spying has “ gone too far inappropriately . ”	-3.0799
With an unexpected admission , John Kerry indicated a softening of the US ’ s defensive position in relation to its monitoring programs by saying that spying had “ gone too far in certain ca  .            ha     e                          	-9.9036
The Minister for Foreign Affairs also accepted that he joined Barack Obama in dealing with the responsibility for switching to “ autopilot ” when the explosive revelations of the Whistleblower Edward Snowden became public on NSA ’ s spy activities .	-6.5094
Through leaked information , the US government has been in a diplomatic storm of indignation from its allies .	-3.2084
At a video connection at the Open Government Conference in London , Kerry said : “ Without question , the President and others in the government have experienced a number of things that have expired via autopilot , simply because the ability to do so insisted on the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War and , of course , on 11 September . ”	-4.8947
Subsequently , he was the first high-level member of the US Government to admit that US expying has crossed a limit , but also stressed that no rights had been abused .	-3.9307
He said : “ In some cases this has gone inappropriately too far . ”	-2.6799
The President is determined to clarify and therefore carry out a thorough investigation so that no one must feel there is abuse here .	-3.2255
I assure you that the rights of innocent people in this process are not affected .	-1.9863
Kerry insisted , however , that the NSA was a power of good and saved many lives through its monitoring processes .	-2.9469
He added : “ We have a new world in which people are prepared to blow themselves into the air . ”	-2.5664
There is a radical extremism in the world that is forgetting to kill people , blow into the air and attack governments .	-8.9013
