Munich 1856 : Four cards that change your view of the city	-2.0510
An irritation where young people are to meet today .	-3.3026
A chapel where the S-Bahn tunnel is now being digged   .	-6.2733
Small gardeners manage the former reason of farmers .	-1.9663
The oldest official card in Munich promotes exciting stories at days .	-2.3702
It nerves if maps are not up-to-date .	-1.8939
This knows everyone who had to get away from time to time because the Auto-Navi showed a green meadow instead of a bypass .	-4.3944
The historical maps of the digital Bavarian atlast , an offer of the geoportal of Bavaria of the state government , are far from current - but therefore very interesting .	-4.0197
Especially if you compare them with current online cards .	-2.1765
Then it is clear how cities and communities have changed since the 19th century in the dissemination area of Munich Merkur .	-2.9411
The digital Bavarian atlas is a carpet that is not recognized as such .	-2.8941
More detailed cards , so-called urposition leaves , have been incorporated into the large overview card for cities and communities .	-7.2292
These were created according to the Bavarian survey administration between 1810 and 1864 and responded to the first survey of Bavari                      	-5.8976
Your client : Napoleon .	-1.1204
The French army leader occupied Bavaria since spring 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .	-2.3598
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic inclusion of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .	-2.7939
Although the French troops finally deducted with the peace of Lunéville on 9 February 1801 , today ’ s neighbours were creating the idea of a flat-covering Bavarian car            ,              	-6.8907
Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph further promoted the project , founded the " Topographic Bureau " - and thus the Bavarian survey management .	-3.2518
The urposition sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and is like all others on the website of the Bavarian Land Librar     .	-3.7599
The comparison earlier / today is the most impressive example of the capital .	-2.7393
The city has extended in all directions and has grown together .	-2.5059
An example of this is submission , which is still relatively isolated in the 1856 map .	-3.2316
Sendling was 21 years after creation of the map , i.e. in 1877 , when Munich was involved .	-4.0768
Today lies in the middle of the city .	-2.7510
The houses of Untersendlings focus around 1856 along the current Plinganserstra<unk>e , which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser only in 1878 , a leader of the insurgency of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705 .	-3.5886
Where today the Western Park is , you see nothing as a field - at first glance : a smaller card with dozens of lines and numbers appears : handwritten numbered floor pieces from the so-called " workshop " from which the principle tax was derived .	-4.8215
Small plots no longer show farmers there today - but rather the small gardeners of the " Land in Sun " system                           	-8.8394
A large green area is characterized by Untersendling north .	-2.4618
The Theresienwiese , since 1810 the site of the Oktoberfest , was in fact a meadow in the 19th century - not a concrete desert .	-3.5912
On the other hand , the historical card gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine .	-2.0920
In the urposition sheet you read not only the street names " at the Gasteig " or the hill " Auf der Fünten " - but also in large letters " Irren Anstalt " in the area of today 's Au-Haidhausen district .	-4.4312
Yes , here on the Auerfeldstra<unk>e you once blocked people with choices .	-3.1092
In 1858 / 59 the Munich circle irritation was created " Auer Lüften " .	-4.1591
From 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the establishment - those psychiatrists brought in connection with the death of King Louis II .	-3.3380
" He was progressive for his time and ended , for example , the chain of so-called mistakes .	-2.9808
He has also prohibited the staff from using violence against occupations , " says Hermann Wilhelm , Head of the Haidhausen Museum , who has dealt with the institution for an exhibition .	-3.5621
For 280 patients , first space was extended to 500 seats .	-3.1140
At some point , this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the circular organization in Haar 1905 .	-3.4996
Since 2006 , the Isar Amper clinic Munich East has been one of Germany ’ s largest psychiatrists .	-3.2381
On the area of the former Auer Anstalt , young people are now meeting in Munich ’ s Salesianum .	-3.1778
The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth home with training companies .	-2.6392
West lies the football pitch of the TSV Munich East , eastern residential houses from the 1980s .	-3.2878
In 2015 , the children 's house " Casa Don Bosco " was built in architectural approach to the original construction of the Irrish Institute , which was destroyed in bombing attacks in the Second World War .	-4.4143
The Marienplatz was recorded in 1856 as the " Haupt Square " , the Kaufingerstra<unk>e was " Kaufinger Gasse " .	-3.2750
The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .	-2.4935
The bombs of the Allied people put many holes into the city in December 1944 .	-2.8412
There has been a great deal to date - at the Marienhof .	-3.4121
The English Institute , small business houses and a call chapel from the Middle Ages were once at the Marienhof , where these days the preparatory works and on 5 April 2017 were the spatenstich for the second S-Bahn tribe .	-4.2247
The slider can compare the old Munich card with today 's air picture - and fill in the hole at the Marienhof .	-3.4894
Civil rights group publishes travel warning for Missouri	-2.0297
The National Association for the Promotion of Colors has issued a warning for colourful people travelling to Missouri because of the discriminatory politics and racist attacks .	-3.2731
" The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri , which will enter into force until 28 August 2017 , calls on African-American travellers , visitors and missourians to pay particular attention to travel throughout the state and to make extreme caution , because a number of questionable , racial-based incidents are recently occurring and noted here " , says in the opinion of the group .	-5.4091
A recently adopted law of Missouri , which makes it more difficult for people to win discrimination complaints , as well as the law enforcement authorities of the state aimed disproportionately at minorities , led the group to publish the travel warning , said NAACP .	-4.3018
" They have violations of civil rights that happen to people .	-2.1052
They are stopped because of their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , " said the President of Missouri NAACP , Rod Chapel , the Kansas City Star .	-2.9103
'We hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not yet heard ' .	-2.1970
It is the first warning issued by the Organization for a State in the USA .	-5.2051
The group quoted incidents such as racist offences against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .	-2.6242
Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no petrol during the journey and was custodian by the Missouri police without being accused of being accuse o cr  .	-7.2350
The Council also refers to a recent report by the Missouri General Prosecutor Office , which shows that black drivers in the state are stopped 75 % more often than white .	-9.7883
" The recommendation is that people are aware and that their families , friends and employees know what could happen in Missouri , " said Chapel .	-2.5446
'People must be prepared to bring deposit money or let the relatives know that they travel through the state . '	-3.0400
Missouri recorded 100 hatred crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FBI 's hate crime report programme , which classify the state in relation to the number of such injuries to the 16th rank of the country .	-3.7474
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law , which would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discriminati .                            	-6.4710
Previously , the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the States had adopted immigration laws committing local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration violations , which will contribute to further race profiling .	-3.7485
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but recently interest groups have used the measures in response to certain laws and trends within the US .	-3.2813
The Fence Project is Elementary	-2.5491
The Fischerbacher Weidezaun project is a success project and will continue next year .	-2.0869
The CDU MEPs Peter Wei<unk> and Kordula Kovac have given an image on the ground .	-2.8915
At the Schwendemann family ’ s right-wing court , representatives of the Fischerbach CDU Local Association met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two Members .	-3.6726
Markus Schwendemann granted insights into his operation , where he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and just as many young animals and houses holiday guests in five apartments .	-3.7787
The " Black Forest Milk " is the alternative marketing route for the milk of his cows , so swenderman .	-3.0707
On the table of the holiday guests comes exclusively from regional points of view .	-3.4057
As he is also BLHV chairman of Fischerbach , he called the fence project " elementary importance " .	-2.9254
I cannot gain profitability on such steep economi                	-7.1990
The greenland area provides a great deal of work and much must be processed with the motor sense .	-3.3845
" We have to fight here with the conditions and with topography " , emphasised swender .	-5.3731
In 2003 , he took over parental operations and managed them without chemical plant protection and fertilizers , even if he did not have a bio-operation .	-3.7221
For mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : " The local municipality has recognized the importance of the fence project and is glad about leader support " .	-3.7994
Farmers would have to be supported in the expense of EUR 3 000 to 4 000 per hectare .	-3.1667
It is hoped that this will make it possible for the reforestation of the areas to be drawn a while .	-4.2611
" The biggest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and thought about how they continue to bring their operation , " emphasized the Mayor .	-3.6413
Farmers are often in criticism	-1.6558
In 2013 , a total of 25 parcels were fenced by eleven participants through the passion funding .	-3.8227
The open surface is 40 hectares , which must not be forested by at least 202 .           a                            	-11.1115
Of the total cost of EUR 71 500 , half was supported by leaders , one quarter weared the town of Fischerbach .	-3.4102
Thus , the farmers remained EUR 12 610 , which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of wild fence .	-2.7744
" The great advantage is the durability of the fences " , explained swenderman    e .	-4.8565
Kordula Kovac stressed : " You are doing a really good job , without farmers and farmers it is not " .	-3.3679
Also for Peter White stood : " Here are the best food produced " .	-3.3013
The Landscape Care Directive ( LPR ) Baden-Württemberg enables government promotion of fences .	-2.5268
The aim is to keep the Black Forest open .	-2.1003
The presence of a support scheme called the LPR is preconditional .	-3.2992
In addition , the fencing area must not be tight manageable ( hanging over 35 % ) and must therefore be threatened by reforestation .	-4.1825
For the Fischerbacher Weidezaunprojekt 2018 , the request from eight participants with 24 parcels who want to build almost 16 kilometres of fence .	-3.4179
The open area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros .	-3.1278
Is nothing sacred any more ?	-4.0377
The White House of Trump Now takes the Statue of Freedom	-2.3650
The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .	-2.2721
The Americans appreciate them as well as any other - hence the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein at Firdos Platz in Baghdad in 2003 .	-3.5030
Stephen Miller , one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN on the president 's proposals to restrict legal immigration with the freedom sta                                    	-6.6339
To stay fair , Miller did not attack the statue itself .	-1.8105
A horde of boat owners and liberty imitators would have lynched him if he had done so .	-1.9744
But he attacked their importance , and in particular the importance attributed to it when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus was added in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , his base .	-3.5213
When Miller Acosta said : " I do not want to go into a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world .	-3.2439
The poem you refer to , which was added later and is not part of the original statue of freedom . '	-2.7373
Miller is factually right , but as he himself put it , it is not really about history .	-2.9929
It is about the contemporary response to the embarrassing words of Lazarus , the only where a state invites not only any old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : ' Your tires , your poor , / your afflicted masses , who then see to breathe freely , / the miserable waste of your rich coasts ' .	-4.6547
There was never a time when the " miserable waste " was better seen on our screens .	-2.2479
Miller was not involved in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Trump ’ s US are not welcome .	-2.5812
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural conflict : it is indeed a conflict on America ’ s importance .	-2.6798
Lazarus - and their friends who were committed to placing their words on the basis of their death - knew very well that they took a high political action .	-6.1139
The sculpture should show the links between French and American Republicanism by representing the female embodiment of freedom in a depressed classical picture .	-3.2424
Lazarus changed this importance : In her poem , the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received one voice .	-2.7349
And she gives herself a very different name : mother of the exilers .	-2.2751
The connection of poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism .	-2.2453
And just like Lazarus changed the importance of the statue , people from the right wing wanted to switch this back for a long  t   e .     I     m . A  	-7.5063
The great screen Rush Limbaugh , a kind of John of the Baptist for Trump ’ s coming , argued in 2010 that the freedom statue was not invited to anyone , but rather an early neo-conservative that brings the American flame to the renowned world : “ Lady Liberty is going forward .	-4.6646
It should bear the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .	-2.1711
The torch should not enlighten the way to the United States ' .	-9.3718
Limbaugh has been rather unusual here .	-2.8697
The importance of the statue is a question of the position of perception .	-2.2300
The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted but hopeful people after long and often terrible trips on the decks of ships .	-3.4106
In the truest sense , it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and an opportunity to improve their lives .	-2.8633
Your statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they must hear .	-2.5636
That , of course , is not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to recognise . It is not the             	-6.3171
Their torch should not enlighten the way , but ignite the hatred that is its only source of power .	-2.9260
World Championship 2017 : Neil Black praises Scottish members of the Unit                  	-6.2690
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots belonged to the team of B      B    .                  	-5.4098
The United Kingdom 's Light Athletics Director , Neil Black , says that the 16-member Scottish quota in the World Championship Championship will make a massive contribution to the tea  .	-6.1029
A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which starts on Friday .	-2.2290
Black believes that ' something special in Scotland must develop ' and the UK 's light athletics must learn something from it .	-5.5167
" We welcome it , and we try to understand it , and we will continue it until we find out , " said Black .	-2.1282
" I speak with people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think that it has something to do with what they have done .	-2.2513
The Scottish athletes think that it has something to do with what they have done .	-1.9854
British Light Athletics : It has something to do with what they have done .	-2.0230
And also with the type at the road corner .	-2.1619
Whatever the combination of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . '	-4.4399
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal contenders , including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will take Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m route , while Eilidh Doyle was elected from the team to team captain .	-3.9256
" Eilidh is quite modest .	-1.3712
Your captain 's speech was incredible ' says Black .	-2.0524
" A number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the space and felt very proud and were very motivated .	-2.7261
The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh brought quite naturally were great . '	-3.1101
The Commonwealth silver medal winner , who will take place in her fifth World Championships at the 400 m hurdles , says that it is " incredible " that 16 Scots are in the British team .	-3.8156
Scotland ’ s best total number of athletes at the World Cup was seven , reached in 1983 and 2015 .	-2.5903
The Muir middle runner leads on this road and has set up five British and two European records last year .	-3.5877
It will participate in the 1,500 metres and 5,000 metres running .	-3.0860
Chris O 'Hare , which runs 1,500 metres , is another Scot , which should be observed after a great season which included the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games .	-3.7458
Doyle remembers her first World Championships when the only other Scot in the Team Lee McConnell was .	-2.7594
The team captain says that they are " enormously proud " of the fact that many of their compatriots will not only belong to the team , but also , in some cases , to the medals and the finals .	-3.8602
" The special thing to be team captain is that she was elected by the other members of the team , so it was anyway a great honour , but to know that my team colleagues voted for me and voted for me , makes it something very special for me , " she added .	-10.0271
" Obviously I am very proud of all the Scots belonging to the team .	-1.9200
It only shows how far we have come .	-1.8328
And they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to rise on podiums .	-2.3049
What is my speech as a captain ?	-1.9174
Yes , I think it went good .	-1.4969
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation , because we have a home World Cup .	-2.7155
It is therefore really important to place on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back in the Olympic Stadium .	-3.1255
I get a second opportunity to go out and compete there , and it will simply be such a great atmosphere outside .  '	-3.3174
Block critics about Facebook : Do not apply for a public office if you cannot contract the unity of voters .	-2.9568
The father of our country knew something of bad press .	-1.6864
Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long for the newspapers to beat him for all , from domestic politics to his political principles .	-3.1627
He shattered with criticism , safe .	-3.1108
But he did not silence his critics .	-1.3886
Because in 1783 , Washington said : ' Freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupidly and mute , like sheep , we are going to slaughter ' .	-3.7980
This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan , who must work to be more like Washington .	-2.2218
Hogans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinions on their official Facebook p  .     Hogan 's staff  h    expresse     expressi	-8.0692
And the American Civil Liberties Union therefore sued him earlier this week .	-1.8212
The staff of the governor dismissed the complaint as frivol , and the online comment was full of a backlash with " Well , and ? " .	-3.4638
" It is only Facebook " , said many people .	-1.7551
But it is important .	-0.9519
And it is particularly important when it is a type like hogan .	-1.9308
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state that is amazingly popular .	-2.0758
He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation .	-2.0462
Hogan is not a reactionary head head .	-1.3260
He has shown a firm hand in leading his state and strict compliance with the principles .	-2.4545
He was also very sent to use Facebook as a primary means to connect to his voters and play his hairless head to chemotherapy on his side .	-2.9288
Therefore , blocking people who come to the side of the governor is a public forum that is called official and unnecessary and dangerous for employees paid with public tax dollars .	-3.9381
In an interview with The Washington Post , Hogans spokesman Amelia Chasse defended the actions of the governor and argued that blocking comments was nothing more than a moderation .	-2.8446
But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hate-fulfilled people who vibrate the sticks online .	-2.7825
The post spoke with some of the real people who were blocked by Hoga                    	-7.0860
And these are just real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur and a parish , no troll .	-2.8143
They all said that their comments were respectful , reflective and not profane .	-1.9765
The pairer quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan ’ s Catholic faith .	-2.4055
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie , Md . , was not hateful , but she asked about hate crimes .	-2.1024
" I commented politely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current messages , " she wrote in the comments of the news shipment " The Post " .	-3.1635
" I do not appreciate this idea either when a number of people take a stand on the same subject , they are disregarded by some rather than a so-called collective approach and not recognised as a large group of citizens concerned " .	-4.5448
What the employees of the governor called " concentrated spam attack " would likely call others " advocate " .	-10.0582
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment .	-2.2458
It is much cleaner than in previous times if we had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical leading articles or to arrest and silence protesters .	-3.5881
But that is exactly what happens just now .	-2.3999
Hogan is not the first public official to criticize Facebook and other social media .	-1.9518
President Trump is sued by Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed .	-1.5966
One of the first milestones on this issue fell in Virginia last week .	-1.8411
The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County violated the First Amendment , according to US district judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria , when she banned a voter from her Facebook page .	-3.1867
And in Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin ( R ) also received a visit from the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter .	-4.2470
That should not be so difficult .	-1.4923
At present Washington , the time of affordable port had a similar effect to the Internet .	-2.7002
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800 , and anonymous writers followed his leadership .	-2.9251
And even then , Washington had anonymous trolls .	-1.5116
The people who used pseudonyms such as " Juricola " , " Valerius " , " Belisarius " and " Portius " wrote all letters of newspapers that defeated Washington 's decisions         .	-3.9637
Petitions which criticised his position on the Treaty of Amity , Trade and Shipping with Britain overwhelmed his office , according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project .	-3.2875
But he did not silence them .	-1.5636
Freedom of speech , divergence and discourse belong to the basis of our nation .	-2.2661
And true leadership means accepting that .	-1.4892
Ronan Rafferty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club	-2.0033
Former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope for domestic comfort over the next three days , as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian will organise the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .	-3.4052

" I have not been able to defend the Extremadura Open because it was taken from the program in the year after I won it .	-2.9648
Coming back to this part of the world is magical .	-1.5067
It is a wonderful place to play golf .	-1.6217
The memories of last year come back and it was something special for me and my wife , Mrs Sharon , to win here last year .	-3.0837
It was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . '	-2.2874
Gary Orr , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50th birthday earlier this year , returns to the action on home floors .	-2.9010
This event will be his first Scottish performance since Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .	-2.0425
" It always means a bit more when you play at home , " said Orr , the man from Helensburgh .	-2.0229
" You want to do it well , but you also feel this additional pressure .	-2.0758
I really enjoyed it again and I played a solid golf .	-2.4764
I am glad about how it has gone so far . '	-2.3053
With the trio in the field are the former masters victor Ian Woosnam and the Senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst , Roger Chapman , Mark James and Mark McNulty .	-2.7723
Orr and the former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scots in the field , the others are Andrew Oldcorn , Stephen McAllister , Bill Longmuir , and Ross Drummond .	-2.6864

Less Lung Cancer Dead by Passive Smoking	-2.4483
Over the past two decades , less and fewer people have died from passive smoking on lung cancer .	-2.6166
Scientists of the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf ( UKE ) come to this result in a st       .	-3.9594

It is a rare insight into the daily life in the highlands of Papua , a former Dutch colony that was included in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,026 elders should vote by a public handling before the occupying forces .	-3.6713
An existing movement that started independence against Dutch rule quickly turned against the Government of Jakarta , which maintains control over the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers from it .	-3.5885

Papua is Indonesia ’ s poorest province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and some of the worst child mortality and literacy rates in Asia .	-2.5211
But it is also Indonesia ’ s Goldland .	-1.5028
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Grasberg , owned by the Freeport McMoran from Phoenix , is only 60 miles from Paniai , a highland province in the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants .	-2.9767
In 2015 alone , Freeport dismantled USD 3.1 billion and copper .	-2.4203
Moreover , Papua has wooden resources at the value of USD 78 billion estimated .	-2.3731
These wealth , however , are a source of misery for the Papua , which ensures that Indonesia ’ s powerful military preserves a stiff presence .	-2.8183
An investigation into New York Times in 2005 reported that Freeport paid local military members and units between 1998 and 2004 almost $ 20 million , including up to $ 150,000 to a single officer .	-3.0038

The former Zimmermann secured 27 of the total 29 districts of Papua - including Paniai - on the road to the presidential palace in Jakarta .	-2.5845

" Our hearts are broken because we voted for Yokowi in 2014 , with the expectation that he will fulfil our hopes that justice is restored , " says You .	-3.0248

When the mood was heated , the soldiers were sent a command about an internal radio : " If the masses are more than three times resistance , they shoot them dead , " it is said in an official document by TIME that was not released to local media .	-4.0320
Yeremias Kayame , 56 , the head of the Kego Koto district of Enarotali , saw the threat of danger and called for peace and called for the amount of returning home .	-3.3761
Nobody was listened in the mood .	-1.9353
" When I turned over , I was suddenly shot into my left hand joint , " he said TIME on the veranda of his colorfully painted wooden house .	-3.2387
Kayame still does not know who has fired , but says that the ball came from the series of soldiers assembled here .	-2.5524
" It was overfilled , many shots were fired , " he added .	-2.3116
The local man Alfius Youw was met three times , his cousin , who witnessed the shooting .	-2.6578

Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he established an extrajudicial mechanism for settling historical human rights violations .	-2.3686
But the excuses began almost immediately .	-1.4470
" Most injuries occurred long ago .	-1.7163
Some were in the 90s and early 2000s .	-1.9329
The point is that we have committed ourselves to tackling these infringements , but there are processes that need to be gone through , " he said .	-2.9179
Then Wiranto made a withdrawal when he spoke with TIME on 5 June in Jakarta and said that he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua .	-2.9821
Instead , ' everything is regulated by law ' , he sa   .             	-5.0019
Wiranto , who accused the UN of ' crimes against humanity ' , which called for more than 1 000 victims of death in East Timor 's bloody independence vote of 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights violations had already been resolved in Papua , including the Paniai incident .	-3.7502
Families of the Paniai victims accepted such claims with grim infidelity .	-3.1482
" I was interviewed four times in the last three years , but there was no progress , " says Yohanes .	-2.1781

He says that he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims .	-2.1074
" After I buried the bodies , the military sought me , " he said .	-2.1884
The shooting has not stopped .	-1.8053
On Tuesday , the Indonesian police shot on villagers in Paniai ’ s neighbourhood Deiyai .                            	-6.9688
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company that refused to bring a conscious man to the hospital , one person and 17 others were injured , including children .	-2.9973
The man , the 24-year-old Ravianus Douw , who was drunk when he fished in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .	-2.5479
Excited villagers protested before the company 's location office .	-2.4642
The police said that the villagers threw stones on officers that responded by firing warnings .	-3.1449
But locals say that the mobile brigade ( Indonesian paramilitary police ) began to shoot and killed one .	-2.1048

'I hidden myself two days in my house ' .	-1.8701
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the officers involved to be accountable and to withdraw the mobile brigade of the police from the area .	-2.7044
Paniai has always been an intersector for the Indonesian Government .	-2.4534
The lack of useful development strengthens the dissatisfaction of the tribal members of the sea , Moni , Dani and Damal , who live in the green highlands of Papua .	-3.0447
Many joined the " Free Papua Movement " ( OPM ) , the rebel army , which claims to defend the rights of the Papua by initiating sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers .	-3.2936
Some of the Top OPM leaders come from Paniai , including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya .	-1.8579
In response to this , thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and arbitrarily taken into custody in recent years , under the pretext of ' securing national sovereignty ' .	-3.4519
Some never resume .	-1.7429
Among the people of Papua , Paniai is known as " a tragic , forgotten place " .	-1.9958
Poverty strengthens discontent .	-1.2459
The bit of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals .	-1.7491
Bread is equally except reach .	-2.0175
People here are building everything they eat : especially nota and fruit and fruit vegetables .	-2.7507
Agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potatoes .	-2.6377
They retain most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .	-2.3728
Ten pieces Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees ( 75 cents ) .	-1.8826
Over time , economic inequalities have grown between the local Papua and the new migrants that have arrived larger since the opening of new air routes to Nabire Airpo  sin the  o .	-7.2492
The few jobs that exist in the region usually go to better trained and more prosperous migrants .	-10.7139
Papua rarely have capital or the necessary skills to compete with their own companies .	-2.4112
" The young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because here there are no jobs or money , " says John Gobai , the chairman of the tribal council of Paniai .	-2.8267
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua .	-1.6122
Moreover , restrictions on the reporting of international media remain tense .	-2.1271
At the beginning of the year , French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported for lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua , although they were given the rare permission t fil                                    	-7.2191
According to Phelim Kine , the Deputy Asian Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jokowi ’ s election campaign to lift the restrictions on reporting in order to promote transparency and development have not been rea                 	-5.6011
" There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report to Indonesia 's most troubled eastern provinces of Papua and Western Papua : visa refusal and a blacklist , " he said in a declaration .	-3.3549
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian Government remains largely limited to the immediate neighbours of Papua .	-2.6219
In March , six Pacific countries - Tonga , Nauru , Palau , Tuvalu , the Marshall Islands , and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to examine the ' different and widespread violations ' in Papua , including the Paniai shooting ed .	-5.4785
The same countries have supported the OPM historically .	-1.9458
The speaker of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry Arrmanatha Nasir rejected the accusations of the Group and said journalists in Jakarta : ' In Indonesia , a democratic system is still valid , and there are free media , so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights cases ' .	-3.8334
People on the ground want more foreign governments to take note of this .	-1.7196
As an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of the Human Rights Ambassador Kees Van Baar , Jayapura visited Jayapura on 4 May , locals broke their silence and pressed him " We wanted freedom " , according to a source that also wanted to remain anonymous at the      s   .	-4.8303
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua say that they will probably not vote again for Yokovi .	-2.4525
" Jokowi is a person who has good intentions , but it is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai shots , " says Gobai , the Chairman of the Tribal Council .	-4.8874
He wants Yokowi to know that , apart from the fact that it lives under the constant threat of a predatory military , it is in poor education and health services .	-2.9735
Gobai says that the Paniai people , like other Papua , vote for Jokowi as a " debt " that he must pay back .	-3.1277
" You do not need money , they just want justice , " he says .	-2.1914
Despite the threats and intimidations , Paniai ’ s victims ’ families carried out a last symbolic act of defiance : the body of a victim was buried on a site closely to the police and the military station .	-3.8732
You know that they may never have justice , but at least they do not forget their crimes .	-2.7858

Fire collect the ' Torch ' skyscraper of Dubai for the second time	-2.6778
A fire found its book on Friday in one of the highest residential towers in the world in Dubai and forced hundreds of inhabitants from 337 meters high to flee 79-storey buildings .	-3.5258
It is the second fire , which in just two years fagts through the high house , which is coincidentally called the Torch Tower ( torch tower ) .	-4.1349
The building was evacuated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .	-2.2517
" We have sleeped and we have stood up at the fire alarm and with the crying of people .	-3.6880
We ran down the staircase , and it took about 10 minutes to come from the 50th floor downwards , " told a resident who said his name as George , Reuters .	-8.1944

The incident can revive questions about the safety of materials used in outside areas of high-houses around the world .	-2.8822
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 showed that most of the damage came from the clothing , the external clothing to decoration or isolation .	-3.7495

No Davis Cup Reform : Further Best-of-five	-1.7671
The President of the International Tennis Association ( ITF ) has fallen through his large Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly .	-2.7158
At the meeting in Ho-Chi-Minh city , the revolutionary proposal for this sport to play Davis Cup individually only on two profits was not supported by the necessary two-thirds majority .	-7.5925
Although they are often very long , therefore very esteemed five-set classics remain the traditional application .	-4.1386
63.54 % of the Member States voted in favour of reform , and the objective of ITF President David Haggerty has therefore only been missed .	-3.2061
" We respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup .	-2.4397
We need a change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historical competitions , " said Haggerty .	-2.2425
We will continue to work on improving the applications .	-2.1269
After many objections , the proposal had already come to a neutral place after the vote .	-4.9204

More than 1 US traveller brings prohibited items to the aircraft , a survey wi       h . T ' s a s  .  , ae    o	-12.5608
A survey under passenger passengers showed that more than 20 percent consciously or unconsciously forbidden items passed to the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration past , including at least 6 % which entered the aircraft while accidentally banning knife or other items with blades .	-7.7905
Less than 1 % claimed that they were delayed that they were mistakenly travelling with firearms , ammunition or explosives .	-3.1982
The survey of more than 1,000 people - carried out by a jet charter service carried out by Stratos Jet Charters Inc . - also found that younger travellers disregard the rules more .	-3.7414
Of the surveyers who admitted that they knowingly tried to fly with something banned by the TSA , 19.7 % of the Millennials were compared to less than 15 % that were members of the generation X.	-4.1595
The most common objects deliberately passed to TSA agents were food and liquids .	-2.7976
More than 3 % admitted that items were knowledgeably borne by security control , while 2.2 % of female respondents and 3.7 % of male surveyers also confirmed that they would have brought deliberately banned drugs to the aircraft .	-4.4789
The company said that travellers throughout the country have questioned how many accidentally brought smuggling goods through airport safety and how many would have done it deliberately .	-3.8692
It is no surprise that the people who were the most smuggling products - knowingly or inconsciously - were bearing security by those who fly most commonly .	-4.1377
However , the company points out that the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing .	-2.0354
People are often uncertain what liquids they can take or how much of them .	-2.7512
So it is no surprise that the largest amount of liquids forbidden by the TSA are banned .	-2.9206
For a while , people thought that TSA could view books as smuggling products .	-2.6109
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .	-1.7905
Elon Musk is No Matter : Tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel Order	-2.3436
Elektro-Thousandsassa Elon Musk is happy to indicate with the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla " Model 3 " .	-3.2054
He has so far suggested that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation .	-3.1494
In addition to the always triumphal figures for sales increases and even more gigantic paragraphs , Tesla-Chef Elon Musk first betrayed another , less glossy number when announcing the recent quarterly balance sheet : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 .	-4.7377
In recent months , Musk had often promoted more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car , whose delivery is just beginning .	-3.7141
Now Musk clears : Of the total 518,000 pre-orders , 63,000 have already been withdrawn .	-3.2877
Critics had repeatedly pointed out that they are only non-binding reservations .	-2.6656
In case of cancellation , Tesla will completely return the 1000 Euro ( US $ 1000 in the US and 1000 pounds in the UK ) " Reservation Deposit " .	-4.4642
At the moment , 455,000 such non-binding reservations were presented , Musk admitted a telephone conference with analyst      .            .      	-7.8196
But the Tesla Chief does not believe that the cancellation of some 12 % of all orders could become a problem .	-3.2667
His argument : the challenge of ambitious growth objectives is not demand but on the production side .	-2.5341
Last year , Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles .	-1.7550
In 2018 , all models together - 500,000 , 2020 sho be one m                    	-7.3006
The demand for this is obviously t  h  he h          	-6.3509
According to Musk , 1800 reservations are currently being made p             	-4.9950
Anyone who is ordering a " Model 3 " may expect extradition in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive its brand new production roads , never tested in practice , without maximum interruptions .	-4.5792
Many experts doubt that this is possible .	-1.5037
But if it is to be larger delays , then the non-binding reservations could become a problem for Tesla .	-3.5031
Because the company cannot prevent dissatisfied customers from running into dishes .	-3.4068
EPA Chief Pruitt is withdrawing because of the delay in the rules of the Obama Era to reduce emissions .	-3.5215
One day after he was sued by 15 countries , Scott Pruitt , the head of the environmental protection authority , returned his previous decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules to reduce emissions of smog causing air pollutants .	-3.5024
Pruitt presented the change when his agency proved to be more reactive to the needs of the state environmental authorities than hitherto bec                  	-6.9568
He did not mention the complaint that was charged against his previous place in a Federal Appeal Court .	-3.0205
It is a deadline for states on 1 October to comply with the 2015 standards for ground-level ozo                         	-7.9571
Pruitt announced in June that he will delay compliance by one year to give his authority more time to study the plan and avoid " interfering in local decisions or hampering economic growth " .	-6.7942
Pruitt , who was President Donald Trump ’ s appointment to Oklahoma , has long been a reliable opponent of stricter environmental protection rules .	-2.7414
Since his arrival in Washington , Pruitt has repeatedly passed over to block or delay regulations that resist chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuel                         	-7.1322
The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the latest legal setback for the pruit ’ s regulatory rollback agenda .	-2.3842
Last month , a Federal Appeal Court in Washington decided that the EPA administrator had exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration , oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks .	-3.2132
In an opinion published on Wednesday evening , Pruitt proposed that its turning of ozone standards simply strengthen the willingness of the EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfilment of new standards .	-3.7104
" Under previous administrations , the EPA has often failed to respect the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be accused of by activist groups and others , and in an agreement to set the date for implementation , " said Pruitt , who sued the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job .	-4.0543
" We do not believe in regulation by court proceedings , and we take deadlines seriously .	-2.3660
We also take seriously the law and authority that we have . '	-5.8520
Nevertheless , the EPA 's opinion said that Pruitt will eventually use its ' power to delay and all other legally available powers ' to ensure that the rules are based on solid policies and the best available information ' .	-3.6872

Walter Martini emphasizes : " It is a unique village small od " .	-3.0187
In 1267 , the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in the Württembergischen Urkundenbuch : Count Hermann von Sulz sold " the mountain with the parish church to Tumlingen , along with the Vogtei " to Magister Eberhard von Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Sil                           e  d  '        	-7.9035
The wording of the documents after the Tumlinger Mountain was also a ruling courtyard , including the church or patronage law , and not vice versa .	-4.6680
So people lived there too .	-1.8891
As stated in the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt of 1858 , apart from the Unterdorf and Oberdorf , which are still to be recognized in the village of Tumlingen , was the " mountain " of the third , the ruling core of the village .	-5.0680

The Combination of Wind Wheels	-2.9916
" Boisheim resists itself " does not see a legal condition for construction and has therefore turned to the land council .	-3.1966
The Boisheim association has called on Landrat Andreas Coenen ( CDU ) to withdraw its authorisation for the establishment of planned wind power systems in the Boisheimer Nette .	-5.3246
It was illegal .	-1.6584
The association argues that at the time of authorisation on 30 December 2016 in the Boisheimer Nette could not have been approved wind power systems , because at the time in Fourse only a wind power zone existed at the town border with Schwalmtal .	-4.5410
Within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind energy systems are possible in principle , but at the same time the concentration zone will exclude wind energy usage for the rest of the city .	-3.7436
This area is designed to prevent a " savings " of the landscape .	-3.7299
The city of Viersen decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette by changing the land use plan a few days before - but the Düsseldorf district government did not approve because of a form error .	-4.4234
" The lack of planning requirements remains unlawful and therefore also withdrawn , " said Christoph Erkens , Chairman of Boisheim refuses to c                               	-8.5884
The current state of things : the City Council decided once again on the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette before the summer break ; an authorisation of the district government is still ou    e           e 	-6.0368
Detection : ' This means that the authorisation for the establishment of wind power plants is excluded ' .	-4.4095
The circle confirms the receipt of the call .	-2.1226
" The corresponding letters have been received at the circle of four last week " , a speaker explained .	-3.6911
The circle takes them opportunity to re-examine the matter .	-2.8153
However , they do not expect to stop the procedure .	-2.7873
With regard to ongoing proceedings in the administrative court , the circle on Thursday did not want to comment on the content of the argument of the Boisheim A      .     '     Boisheim ' d     '     	-8.8649
The NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , is planning to build four 200 meters high wind wheels on an area on the Boisheimer Nette .	-3.1236
Already last year , the company involving the city of Viersen had closed lunch contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of large areas .	-6.9684
With the establishment of the four wind energy systems , the need for electricity should be met by some 11 400 households - about one-fifth of the electricity needs of all four senior households .	-4.2579
The NEW Re wants to invest about EUR 20 million .	-4.3891
Last summer , Viersen ’ s City Council gave the green light for the purchase of three wind power plants in the wind park Linnich near Aachen , as well as a participation in a wind energy system in <unk>bach-Palenberg in the Heinsberg count                 	-5.8580

Also attractive offers for Saturday and waiving parking fees this day are part of the concept .	-2.8797
Customer potential should also be redeveloped or re-developed .	-2.8405
These include passengers and tourists .	-2.2468
But also many locals would have lost the city when shopping from the view .	-2.9970
In the end , everyone would help to revive the city centre - to letters , companies of the whole city and clubs .	-4.3594
We need to overcome the lethargy with a network that had partly broadened , King said in spring .	-3.8513
Birgit Streich , head of the IHK Center in Mühlhausen told us that there are five Thuringian cities involved in the nationwide third " home shopping " day .	-3.8417
Besides Bad Langensalza these are Weimar , Sömmerda , Saint Town and Bleicherode .	-2.2889
The day should " advertise the appreciation of local trade and point out its importance for the common good of our cities , " said strike .	-3.7139
The action under the leadership of the IHC and with many partners also make it clear that every citizen can influence its own direct environment with its purchasing behaviour .	-3.5856

Transcripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .	-2.2504
On 27 January , in a phone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto , Trump stopped saying publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall .	-2.7154
The US President denounced him because he publicly denounced the Wall , and according to him he said , ' you cannot say that to the press ' .	-4.0698
Trump launched his presidential campaign with the promise of building a wall at the southern border of the US , and sworn to pay Mexico for the project .	-2.8349
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and revealed a tense exchange .	-2.3689
Mr Trump said that a trade for the US refugees that migrated to Australia would be " ridiculous " , " mis " , and " stupid " , and that the existence of trading communicated by the Obama administration would leave him like a " depp " after proposing a ban on relocating refugees to the US                                                   	-9.5831

Moores Ford Massacre : Activists resume racist lynchact as a call for justice .	-2.5190
A Ford Mercury was founded in 1948 by a group of spectators in the rural Monroe , Georgia , and rumpled to the Ford bridge of Moore .	-5.4592
Before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men emerged with guns to block his way .	-2.8882
The leader of the mob - a man of middle ages in a needle suit - took a long train at his cigar and looked testingly through the windscreen .	-3.1550
Inside the occupants were floating into fear .	-2.6255
" We want this n ---r Roger ! " brulled the man .	-2.5660
'Get him out of the car ! '	-1.7863
The silence was crippled when a young black man was dragged by the front-passenger seat .	-3.7699
Fortunately , this terrible scene , played on 22 July , is just an emergency .	-3.0650
But when a snake is thrown around the neck of " Roger " , almost everyone in the audience experienced real sighs .	-3.6667
Since 2005 , civil rights have been returning to the Moore 's Ford Bridge to receive the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom , as well as George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946 .	-3.6695
Nobody has ever been accused of because of the killings .	-2.2659
" It is really inconceivable that not a single person was arrested in all these years - although we see them in our communities , although we know who they are , " said Tyrone Brooks , who helps to organize emergency .	-3.6198
'It is a dirt spot in a story , but it is a burden on our souls ' .	-2.7004
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Member of the State of Georgia and a lifelong civil rights .	-2.7655
It serves as a dramatic call for action and is an annual memory of the Monroe Community that an injustice has never been corrected .	-3.1729
" We want prosecution , we want the end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must get justice , " he said .	-2.8858
'We cannot get healing and reconciliation until we receive justice ' .	-2.0892
A court medical provides a bed about the body of one of the victims of the Moore-Ford-Lynchen on 27 July 1946 .	-3.2999
According to FBI files received by the NBC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the lynch process .	-2.5929
But none has ever been accused .	-1.7358
Although the suspects have been free for decades , civil rights rights say that the double motivation for lynch actions across the city was always known : politics and sex .	-3.4315
In April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court allowed the black citizens in Georgia to vote for the first time in the pre-election campaign in summer .	-3.2406
Approximately at the same time as the choice , according to the FBI of the black farmpaighter Roger Malcom , a white owner , Barnett Hester , declined during a fight - supposedly because of a woman .	-3.9927
Brooks said that the rumor in the city was that Hester slept with Malcom ’ s wife Dorothy and that the baby she wore did not come from her man .	-2.9852
On July 25 , 1946 , Loy Harrison , a prominent white landowner , paid $ 600 to liberate Malcom from prison , says the FBI .	-7.0581
He was accompanied by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey .	-1.7266
But when they removed from prison and approached the Moore 's Ford Bridge , a lynchmob surrounded the car .	-2.7121
" As it turns out , it was Harrison , who has prepared and ordered the murders , " closes a FBI report .	-3.1552
" It is also obvious that there was a complot between state and local prosecution , which was not only involved in the killings , eliminated evidence and covered the identity of witnesses " .	-3.0946
Brooks make it even more striking .	-2.5632
" It was a right-wing massacre , " he said .	-1.9353
" You were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : " If you are registered and if you vote , then that will happen here . "	-3.1049
For almost a decade , Cassandra Greene has led the annual event of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murder .	-2.8538
Their presentation is visible , taking action and is founded in a kind of deep racism that many want to believe that it does not exist in America any more .	-3.7152
It is difficult to watch , and even more difficult to look away , but Greene said that this is the pointer .	-4.5318
" We do not want to talk about the Lynch because we are then faced with its ugliness in all of us , " she said .	-3.0282
" But I cannot build a relationship with you if you do not want to listen to me or do not hear what I did through " .	-5.9965
The samples for this year 's production began in June , and on the first day , almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest of black - pushed themselves into a space and listened to a well-played overview of the piece when greens started a                  d       	-5.9790
Wade Marbaugh is here Greenes Co-Director .	-1.8165
He has played the role of the chief clan member for years , but he said that the role is never easier .	-2.2792
" I feel dirty because I am not so , " said Marbaugh .	-1.6076
" But I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return at these times . "	-2.6347
On the other hand , the actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona , who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester , tried their lines .	-2.5430
The piece begins with Malcom , who attacks and presses him , angry that he slept with his wife Dorothy .	-3.7027
'I said n --- he , disappearing of my ownership ! '	-2.1909
Rascona restores the fire .	-1.6986
There is a break .	-0.9129
And then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .	-2.2612
Greene is the loudest .	-1.5420
" What ? " , Rascona asked .	-1.3798
It is alarmed and confused .	-1.1004
Was I too hard ?	-0.9892
" No " , Greene said , still charing .	-2.2780
" I just do not believe that white people at the time said ' n---he ' .	-5.7290
" But " , one of the other black actors joked .	-2.2098
'You only have to meet the hard ' R. '	-5.8508
And there is exactly where the energy is delaying in the space , a feeling of cameraship replaces the unease .	-4.1502
Everyone is engaged in getting this right , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four people who are kill    .               	-6.2700
The scene begins again .	-1.4531
This time Rascona says the N-word , he says it sharp and emphatically .	-2.4518
No one laughs absolutely .	-4.0241
This repetition ends violently and quickly .	-5.6189
There are screams , shots and then silence .	-2.0391

The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white .	-1.7990
A couple is travelled from Ithaca , New York , to see the performance , many come down only the road .	-2.7422
You have experienced Georgia ’ s humidity for almost eight hours when brooks lead them on a pilgrimage to the tombs of Malcoms and Dorseys .	-3.6058
Until this point , the killings have remained an anecdote , but now when you are on the same country where the Lynch killings took place , the air feels spenst .	-3.8411
When the last notes of the song sound out , Greene invites the amount to come closer and inspect the body name .	-3.2091
Children are high on their heads , register the fake blood and the quiet body and wish to each other .                                	-9.1801
" They are not really dead , " murmurs a small boy as if he wants to remember it .	-2.6440
After a few minutes Greene thanks the quantity - and suddenly it is over .	-2.2948
The actors throw the lynch rope away and depart their tears .	-2.9481

Denise Duplinski fought to find words of what feeling the performance has left .	-2.2872
" It is difficult to hear these terrible words and actions ... of people who look like you yourself and who do that because they look as you ' , she said .	-3.1856
" What really does with me lets me believe that the Lynch still goes further , " she added , " today it is only called police shooting . "	-3.6680
In the same room , Tyrone Brooks Hof holds his table , he eats and reminds of civil rights .	-2.8731
He said that he had already started to plan the performance next year .	-2.2600
" The emergence is inspiring in some way , because it describes the horror of what we have been , but it is also a moment of learning , " he said .	-3.4514

The Wagnerians in Bayreuth	-1.9071
Also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner ’ s monumental work , director Frank Castorf puts on a colourful stage ahead of huge , six-storey scenery .	-3.9169

The performance of Frank Castorf and his team was expected to be tense .	-7.0668

Community area	-1.4979
In the end , the decision was clear : in two counter-votes , the Council of Fluorn Wincels decided to establish a Community area in the future senior housing system .	-4.0381
Before the discussion there is an important information : the purchase contract was signed for the lack of property , reports mayor Bernhard Tjaden .	-3.5726
Although it will take still for the surface of the church community to date , there is no longer any planning obstacle to the project to be assumed by a private investor .	-4.3905
There is a discussion on a Community area for this .	-1.9533
One of the two investors that are still in boat has offered to come across the community .	-2.7725
On the ground floor he would provide a living area - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with an area of 70 square meters for a special price .	-3.3352

The members want to set up panels along the planned route and inform them about stars and stars .	-3.5635
In a first phase until 2018 , the association plans " well reachable installations in five to six places " in the upper heart .	-3.4789
Inquiry would be St. Andreasberg , Braunlage , Hohegei<unk> and Sieber .	-2.2987
The information on the panels should be supplemented via the Internet .	-2.3502
Therefore , a good mobile network reception plays a role in selecting locations .	-3.0347
Freedom of accessibility is also a criteerion .	-4.6004
Later , the Star Path train should be extended by train .	-3.0507
" On the star path the viewers learn a lot of knowledge , for example about the physics of the individual stars , " explained the association .	-3.5501
Moreover , they learned why stars had different colors or why a star shined more than another , even though it is much further removed .	-3.6457
It also communicates in which asterisk there is a selected star and when they are best to see .	-10.9399

" I am a former springweight " , reminded Garcia .	-1.9486
" I got up for bronze [ to 140 pounds ] , but I am not so great .	-6.4770
I am small for 140 .	-1.2108
I would like to do something about lightweight .	-2.4225
And he must move on lightweighter [ 135 pounds ] and then we fight .	-2.6072
That is what fans demand .	-2.0438
Let us give them that . '	-1.6075
Lomachenko agreed .	-1.2435
'Boxing needs this struggle ' .	-2.0025
Climate asked whether it should be on pay-per-view , part of a strategy that Lomachenko must fight with a 135-pound debut this year to agree a date with Garcia next summer ( 37-0 , 30 knockouts ) which also has interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight title campaign in the forum on September 23 .	-6.1022

Garcia said that the focus is to show strength , then boxes .	-2.1864

Fortuna 's Hoffmann : " Triple Chain works better "	-1.9904
Andre Hoffmann hopes that the optimization of the defense formation will bring points to Aue after the 2 : 2 seasonal appearance against Braunschweig .	-4.0685
With the first season game , Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the result , there would not have been the two opposites at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .	-3.3462
" These were two opponents too much , and we must be better careful in Aue , " says the defender of Fortuna Düsseldorf .	-3.1650
The triple chain should also be optimized in the Erzgebirge mountains .	-3.3031
And a gate after an outdoor want the fortunes no longer to capture .	-4.3013
'For the future it will be so that none of themselves puts on the line alongside Michael ( rensing ) . '	-3.8192
Hoffmann is convinced that his team comes better after the experience in preparing for the triple chain than with the four chain .	-3.6466
" Nor do I know how we will act in Aue , " says his trainer Friedhelm Funkel , but Hoffmann is sure his thing " because we have players well in the triple chain on the semi-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gie<unk>elmann , said Hoffmann .	-3.9121
'Precondition is , but that we harmonise even better and we do not afford so many players in the construction . '	-3.4996
Of course , Hoffmann travels to Aue to win the game .	-2.2049
" But whether you can speak of a failed start after a decision , do not know .	-2.9180
The performance may well be okay , " Hoffmann meant .	-2.8454
" But if we are able to concentrate on Sunday with four points , we will certainly be able to talk about a proper seasonal break . "      e                   	-7.3764
His trainer did not want to know anything about this .	-2.2305
" I judge the start in the season only after six to eight play days " , said Friedhelm Funkel , who does not want to speak of an advantage over Aue , just because the game of the Saxony in Heidenheim had to be cancelled prematurely because of a weather .	-4.4578
" Now they can start the season quasi with a home game , " said Funkel and Hoffmann believes that players from Aue may be somewhat fresher , because they have no heavy and complete game like Fortuna against an ascendancy favorite in the bones .	-6.4076
" But they do not know so 100 % where they are currently , " says the interior defender of the Fortuna .	-2.6403
Although guests from the Rhineland go as a light favourite on Sunday to the encounter in the finally ( almost ) finished stadium of Aue .	-3.7077
" That we are abandoning them just because we have the right to come under the first six , " says Funkel , whose balance sheet is only positive in defeating eye from nine games .	-4.3743
" There is no team in the 2nd Federal League , which must be beaten from the outset , " explains Fortuna 's chief coach .	-3.3574
" To make such a statement would be arrogant and surprisi   .	-9.6299
And so Funkel does not want to experience his players on Sunday .	-2.9927
Publishing New Results of Swedish Asylum Assessment Tests	-2.0171
The recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden subjected to a new method for medical assessment of their age show that more than 80 % of the tested persons are older than 18 years , but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .	-3.5526
The Swedish Forensic Medicine Authority ( Council Medicinal Verket ) began implementing the tests last year .	-2.7717
They should make the assessment of age more closely during the asylum procedure , after the Swedish Migration Authority ( Migration Verket ) has been criticised for mistakes in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were underage .	-3.7681
So far , migration verket 6,880 has sent cases to be tested , and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31 July 2017 .	-3.6056
Eighty percent ( 2002 ) were assessed as 18 or older , while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the person was " possibly 18 years or older " .	-3.1066
In 432 cases , the conclusion was that the person is ' perhaps under 18 years old ' .	-6.0618
The tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is called into question .	-2.2698
According to Johan Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency , the results of recent months are constant .	-2.6162
" We do not see a great difference in the statistics of recent months , the figures are quite constant , " he said the journal The Local .	-3.0238
The high proportion of cases in which the person was judged over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker lied over his age .	-3.1900
In May , the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there are 442 cases which ' propose that the investigated person be 18 years older ' .	-2.9699
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet investigated the 581 results , she found that in 243 of these cases the person had frankly said that it was 18 years old this year .	-3.2334
The method of medical age assessment , in which radio recordings of wisdom teeth and MRT recordings are made by knee joints analyzed by dentists and radiologists , has also been criticised in some areas .	-4.3118
A skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute , whose work covers the assessment of the biological maturity of people to see whether they went sooner or later than usually through puberty .	-3.3623
" I had reason to think about it , and I do not believe that the type of measurement should be used .	-2.2981
Assessing biological age in this way is very uncertain .	-1.8866
If we cannot say it safely , we should not do as if we could do it , " he said the newspaper Metro .	-2.6635
Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of the tests : " In general you can say that the risk of judging a child as adults is low .	-3.1188
The greatest risk is if the person is just less than 18 , in this case they are about 10 % . '       . '  .  I    a s a      ' I  a	-10.9003

The other bridges lead through the Lauterbach .	-2.1063
They are built from red sandstone .	-2.1801
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve , or 10,60 meters long .	-2.2210
The bridge at the entrance of the village of Lauterbach has now received a 1.30 meter wide on the north side and seven tonnes of seven so-called bridge cap .	-4.1156
This is a marginal fortification , which is also used as an operating route .	-5.5047
The southern part of the bridge is to use a 2.20 meter wide bridge cap on Friday .	-3.1355
That is what the pedestrian way should be done .	-3.3166
The special thing is that this is manufactured parts , a patent of the Dizwo Schramberg company .	-3.3391
The other two bridges are already available with the patented      be       b     .  T ' i       	-11.8560

CDU and FDP before possible majority in Lower Saxony	-1.9269
Lower Saxony ’ s Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) is withdrawing after the loss of the red-green majority of government for a rapid re-election of the land day , but he does not want to resign .	-3.9786
Because on Friday , Parliament was in favour of dissolution .	-2.8734
Previously , the surprising exit of a Green MEP from its local group in Lower Saxony had plunged Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) ’ s government into a serious crisis .	-3.1828
Five months before the official date of the day-to-day election , the red green coalition in Hanover lost its scarce one-vote majority in Parliament to the opposition from CDU and F    DP .                	-5.2392

" I see my political future in the CDU " , she explained on Friday in Hanover .	-2.0105
CDU leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend his group to include them .	-2.9093
This would have CDU and FDP together 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Day , SPD , and Green 68 se      .	-5.6816
So far , the relationship has been reversed .	-1.8783
The new day will be elected regularly on 14 January next year .	-1.9536
Thumlers said that the red green government must now decide whether it can govern without a majority in this situation .	-2.5219
However , Stephan Weil considers it essential that the land day decides as soon as possible its self-resolution .	-2.9845
The CDU Group will probably decide on its further action on Tuesday .	-10.8694
The National Constitution also provides for the possibility of the Prime Minister to escape confidence and choose a successor .	-3.6576
" Our constitution offers several options .	-1.4998
These opportunities must be legally clean , " said Thumler .	-2.2065
'One will discuss all questions in calm when they are legally reasonable . '	-3.1883
Thumler called Twesten 's step " but something curious " .	-2.2182
The politician himself emphasised : ' I am not a traitor .	-2.1975
I feel very good ' .	-1.1901
She called herself a supporter of Black Green .	-2.4534
The Greens called on the reasonable Members to return their land mandate .	-3.4201
" Of course , we assume that she has returned her land day mandate through the green list of countries with immediate effect , " the country leaders Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner informed .	-4.1162
The Group Chairman of the Greens Anja Piel said : ' We regret the decision of Elke Twesten extremely ' .	-2.8307
She has consciously chosen not to hold a debate in th  gro  .	-6.5411
'Even in the context of the fact that there were no content differences , we cannot understand this step ' .                  	-5.3443
SPD Chancellor Candidate Martin Schulz condemns the transgression of the Lower-Saxon Green Member Elke Twesten to the CDU as a betrayal .	-3.2263
" The behaviour of former Green Members in Lower Saxony is not only betrayal of the electorate , but also betrayal of red green , " the Social Democrats ' federal leader wrote on Facebook on Friday .	-6.7569
He supports Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) 's decision to quickly re-elect the land day .	-2.6118
The exit of Twesten costs red green in Lower Saxony the majority .	-2.5770
The politician put her personal interests in her vulnerability and in her frustration to the welfare of the country , " criticized SPD Secretary-General Hubertus Heil .	-3.7560
" It is a scandal that the CDU participates in Lower Saxony in this dirty intriguing game and tries to beat political capital from it " .	-3.0836
Lower Saxony ’ s CDU leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend his Members to include Elke Twesten in the CDU .	-3.0788
The leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Oppermann , raised twests to distort the result of the 2013 day election with personal career thinking .	-4.0792

Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt ( CSU ) is in the interview with the editorial network of Germany ( RND ) speech and answer  .                          	-6.6100
Mr Schmidt , how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs ?	-1.8325
I can only encourage all consumers to look closely at the eggs in your refrigerator and to check the stamp pressure .	-2.8574
On the consumer protection portal www.food warning.de , the federal states provide the latest information about the egg charges concerned .	-3.2818
Eggs affected should be destroyed or returned .	-1.5682
Even if , after everything we know , health threats are practically excluded .	-2.8098
Does Aldi now take over the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the educator is not really perceived by the Federal Agricultural Minister ?	-3.5209
Food monitoring is the task of the Federal States .	-2.2262
Nevertheless , my House has been switching on immediately and has been in close exchange with the authorities of the countries since the affection of Germany .	-3.7944
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers .	-1.9396
Trade , like manufacturers , must ensure that the products sold are transportable and healthy .	-13.3167
If the maximum residue content of 0.005mg / kg is exceeded , they are not transportable .	-3.2633
However , unburdened eggs can be sold and e c ee .	-9.9319

Are production facilities and consumers in the same boat ?	-1.9266
According to the current level of knowledge , production facilities are not directly blame   .	-5.7955
Instead , they must expect economic damage on the basis of illegal practices for service companies .	-3.0891
As always , there are too little controllers in serious cases .	-2.4667
Is there only any personnel or coherent responsibility ? ?	-6.9561
It was precisely the official controls that discovered the process .	-2.7722
The truth , however , is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded from 100 % .	-2.3811
It is precisely therefore crucial to educate such events and to hand over to the public prosecutors in cases where criminal offences can be availab   .	-8.0135

How the financial rules of football have an impact on Neymar ’ s move to Paris	-2.9093
The rules aimed at preventing unhindered expenditure of European football clubs will not disturb Neymar ’ s world record transfer from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain .	-2.9817
Any consequences will come from UEFA for Paris Saint-Germain , because the leading organization that monitored the European game has made the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .	-3.4812
Financial fair play rules that were launched in 2011 by UEFA means that PSG must sometimes prove that the transfer of Neymar was financed without a loss    el .	-6.9360
Barcelona has paid EUR 222 million ( $ 262 million ) to buy the Brazilian from his contract , and Neymar will receive a salary that will be several $ 10 million per yea                        	-5.4642
Here are some of the financial aspects from Neymar 's move to France .	-4.3914
PSG can certainly make the money easier to sign Neymar and bring it into a galaxy of other stars , given the financing of the team through the rich ruler family of Qatar through the energy .                   an  o t               e 	-7.9556
Communities may spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players , but must counter legitimate sources of revenue that allow them to break even point in their business related to footba    .	-9.3195
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA President in 2007 .	-1.9576
The former French player believed that associations that had taken enormous debt effectively cheated and risked to ruin when banks or owners withdrew their support .	-3.4162
In 2011 , FFP shifted from concentration to club debt to monitoring its losses .	-2.5157
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then strongly invested to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a harder matter .	-3.2443
During the current three-year FFP period that runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million .	-2.8101
And , although Platini fallen into disgrace from the presidency in 2015 , his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to deter excessive expenditure .	-3.3708
" Certainly FFP is not dead and we will certainly strengthen the rules for the future , " said Andrea Traverso , who is responsible for FFP , to The Associated Press last week .	-3.1970
Although the PSG has paid the Neymar buy-out clause in a package , it can distribute the amount for the accounting settlement over the duration of its      contract .	-7.0019
Neymar has signed a five-year treaty so that the sum of replacement can be expelled for the next five years of EUR 44.4 million in the annual accounts .	-3.1865
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 , together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , met with the most serious sanctions .	-2.7829
The PSG received a fine of $ 60 million ( at that time $ 82 million ) that was lowered to EUR 20 million later - and it was ordered that the team members for the 2014 / 15 season Champions League were limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 playe                  1                               	-8.3782
UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to overlist their financial supervision by bloating their revenues by companies linked to the owners of a club .	-3.3560
While a Catarian company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsorship were to exceed the standard market rates , UEFA would not leave this as legitimate income .	-3.0972
This was exactly what happened in 2014 , when UEFA decided that the value of the PSA sponsorship was bloated by Qatar Tourism Authority .	-2.7882
It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come into Qatar through payments of the World Cup 2022 Organization Committee .	-3.1166
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have contested that Neymar World Cup Ambassadors will be and such a manoeuvre for the UEFA regulators could simply be found out .	-3.1930
The previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to observe every attempt to circumvent the rules .                                 	-7.9979
UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG on Neymar ’ s transfer , said on Thursday the people familiar with the situation .	-2.6034
You spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press because they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation .	-2.5528
The last reports published show that PSG 2015 / 16 , with a turnover of EUR 542.4 million , has gained more than EUR 10 million .	-2.7933
The accounts for the last fiscal year must be published .	-1.9186
PSG expects Neymar ’ s arrival to be a blessing for sponsoring deals , merchandising and tricot sales .	-2.1433
The association assumes that sales will increase by at least 30 % after the signature .	-2.6061
The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players , and it tried to prevent Neymar ’ s way by saying that PSG would violate the FFP .	-3.0507
" It is a clear case of " financial doping " with the club and the state , " said the President of La League , Javier Tebas , the Spanish newspaper AS in relation to Qatar 's ultimate ownership of PSG .	-2.9118
Arsenal-Manager Arsene Wenger , whose association is owned by an American sports tycoon , shares the reservations of La League against a state that finances an association .	-2.8234

About 17 million small red white packed shoggitables distribute the flight accompanies prior to landing to passengers per year .	-3.9245
The Swiss did not want to determine the costs .	-6.8223
Industry insiders appreciate the volume of orders according to " Northwest Switzerland " to 1.5 to 2 million Francs - the Migros daughter achieves annual turnover of around one billion francs .	-3.7414
But more important is the advertising effect : for a shogging manufacturer it is a prestigious order .	-2.9673
Like many applicants there is in the new tender , the Swiss does not want to betray .	-3.2420
But only Swiss manufacturers come into question .	-2.0893
According to the newspaper report , Chocolat Frey wants to endeavour to renew the Treaty beyond Spring 2018 .	-2.6160

Nostalgie goes in " Wet Hot American Summer " and " Comrade Detective " in the Niche	-6.4684
This repeat of history is nostalgic at the same time as the glorious days of the characters of the 80s , for the 90th anniversary of the Grunge era ( when the foregoing David Wain and Michael Showalter turned the sketch comedy " The State " for MTV ) , and for itself - that is , for 2001 before their stars , such as Elizabeth Banks , Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd , went to greater things .	-4.5249
As a cultural artifact , it is also a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook-capable era of permanent memories .	-2.3445
But as a franchise it feels as if the time were scarce .	-2.3162
" First Day of Camp " worked surprisingly well , not only because of its absurd humor ( it contained an original story for a speaking can vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .	-2.7940
By stepping up at the heart of the gag - actors of middle ages play horny children who will grow - they still created the impossibility of winning the last part of the joke .	-3.9526
" Ten Years Later " , with his adults who now play adults , is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more according to the canning principle , including a reference to the stalker films of the 90s such as " The Hand That Rocks the Cradle " ( " The hand that swings the cradle " ) .	-4.1252
At one point there is a character through an Apple powerbook , some inline skates and " a number of other things from 1991 " .	-3.2973
Many of the key stories are the same .	-5.1901
The lovely coop ( Mr. Showalter ) , now romanauthor , has still not forgotten Katie ( Marguerite Moreau ) .	-2.9346
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost his virginity .	-1.7669
And there is another malicious plot included in the Ronald Reagan ( also Mr. Showalter ) , which is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well successful impression of Michael Ian Black ) .	-3.1353
As always , the excursions are the best part of the franchise .	-7.0761
It is particularly fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rudd , the Matt Dillon 's underlip bard of " singles " , whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old cracker .	-3.8807
It is the moments of random madness that could fuel this franchise like a kind of repeating " seven up ! " series until he reaches what I accept as his logical conclusion : " Wet Hot American Summer : Twenty Years Later " , whose last scene will show the band how it will visit the film premiere of " Wet Hot American Summer " .	-3.9508
" Comrade Detective " on Amazon is now reminiscent of another kind of nostalgia : the revival of the Cold War of " The Americans " , the film " Atomic Blonde " and even " GLOW " with its East-gen-West ring iconography .	-3.8773
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as director indicates to be a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two policemen as friends , two officers from Bucharest fighting for truth , atheism and the way of Marxism-Leninism .	-3.6217
The main roles - a hard-sotted gregory and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici , whose dialogues are synchronized by Channing Tatum ( also an executive producer ) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English .	-5.7910
It is a brilliant idea .	-1.2326
But it is not much more than an idea .	-1.2278
There are some beautiful gags to see ( the police spend the time to look at chess on television , as Americans may do with football ) .	-3.0281
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate , Nick Offerman , Mahershala Ali and Chlo<unk> Sevigny - ensures a decent game ' Find the voice ' .	-4.8651
But " Comrade Detective " is so very committed to the truth of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer who bears a reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like a single one .	-3.3058
In six long episodes , the comedy is not fast or often enough .	-2.5995
" Comrade Detective " , which has been reduced to a lower length , could provide its agitprop satire better , because Gregor and Iosef could constantly visit the American embassy whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who devour a cluster of Hamburger .	-4.2135
The message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can make everything for a situation .	-2.5058
The fictious Romanian creators were not wrong : we even do it with our own younger history and with theirs .	-2.6856
Blowing Drug Mafia in the Country	-1.9968
The police have succeeded in striking the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg .	-4.8822
On Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest Baar circle , in Rottweil , Konstanz , Esslingen and Stuttgart , as the Public Prosecutor Constantly stated on Friday .	-3.8685
15 accused people were arrested aged between 25 and 77 and already arrested warrants against them .	-3.2122
Moreover , officials ensured larger quantities of Marijuana and Cocaine , shot weapons , and several hundreds of thousands of euros .	-3.0675
Two people were arrested in Italy with simultaneous racial areas                	-6.9571
There were German arrest warrants against the two suspects of Italy .	-1.9520
The two are probably delivered to Germany .	-2.0328
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action .	-1.8597
Overall , more than 300 policemen were used .	-2.0723
Members of the Mafia are accused of organised drug crime , serious acts of violence , attempted murder and blackmail .	-3.2202
Since summer 2016 , the Public Prosecutor has been determining constancy against organised drug trafficking in the southern German region .	-5.7607
Between the public prosecutors in constance and palermo , there was a stiff exchange and the investigators of the Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .	-3.6291
Therefore , the large use of Wednesday morning was accompanied by four Palermo officials .	-2.9021
In particular , Italian nationals have been closely referring to the Italian mafia to the visit of the investigations .	-6.8361
An incident on 27 May in Hüfingen , where several shots were fired into a restaurant in the morning , should also go to the band 's account .	-3.5525
Large Gaps in Foreigner Register	-2.5517
'Data of citizens who should not appear there ' : According to a report , the foreigners register in Germany has considerable shortcomings .	-3.4866
This leads to some serious misdemeanours in asylum procedures .	-2.6519
The representative for the Federal Government 's refugee management , Frank-Jürgen Weise , has drawn attention to large gaps in the foreign central register .	-3.1136
Defects in the data registered there could lead to some serious misdemeanours in the case of asylum procedures and deportations , warned in an analysis presented by the Southern German newspaper .	-4.1870
According to the register , ten million people are collected with foreign nationality , including about 5.7 million from non-EU countries .	-2.8214
The data will therefore be managed by approximately 600 foreigners authorities in German           	-4.6616
Because the data has not been sufficiently maintained , data quality has not been good in parts so far .	-2.9854
In individual cases , data were found in 1921 , ' by people who are no longer alive or by citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register ' .	-3.7546
" Error data entries can slow significantly , " says the report .	-3.0185
Furthermore , the statistics on extravagant people are covered by EU citizens , who would not have to travel at all .	-4.0649
Such false assignments , however , led to a distorted debate on the dealing with exit requirements , so it is in the analysis .	-3.8231
Meanwhile , the Federal Government has apparently begun to return refugee families with under 16 years old children to Italy when they have travelled from there .	-3.5542
This is emerging from an internal paper of the Federal Office of Migration and Refugees ( BAMF ) , the " New Osnabrücker Zeitung " reports .	-2.8292
The paper therefore states that the BAMF is running such procedures ' concerning families with children - except for infants and young children - to Italy since 1 June 2017 ' .	-3.9251
Since the end of 2014 , this has practically not been possible , as the newspaper refers to the difficult situation on the ground .	-3.1664
Under the Dublin Agreement , refugees from the EU State are responsible for them first .	-5.8721
If migrants travel to another EU country , this state can return it to the entry country .	-2.7031
The explanatory statement now writes : " The reception capacity for families with underage children in Italy has increased significantly " .	-5.6336
Italy has given guarantees to the reception and accommodation of families .	-2.1247
Even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECMR ) considers these commitments to be sufficient .	-2.4676
Other EU countries , too , would send refugees back there under the Dublin Agreement .	-2.3544
The domestic speaker of the Left Group in the Bundestag , Ulla Jelpke , criticised this decision : ' families with children threaten for the shortcomings in the Italian asylum system of human rights reception conditions and a threat to child good ' .	-3.9946
Achieving the Second Bes   Resue	-5.3943
A total of 220 litres of people living in Oberreichenbach already provided blood donation service for other people .	-2.7846
At least the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .	-2.0343
All of them , Jürgen Greule , who now shared 50 litres of blood with his 100 donations .	-5.9487
Traditionally , the community appreciates the multiple willingness to donate blood at the meeting of the Council of Local Council .	-3.1632
" It is genius how our body is created for this and we are paying respect to the donors who provide their blood for strangers , still unselfishly , " stressed mayor Karlheinz Kistner .	-4.7383
" A single blood donation helps several people " , explained the circle willingness manager of the German Red Cross ( DRK ) , Holger Maisenbacher , because the cannings are replaced in their components .	-3.7167
Thus , three people could benefit from a blood donation .	-2.6146
At the same time , Maisenbacher reported of the actions carried out in Oberreichenbach in the spring .	-8.3248
" This year we achieved the second best result with 114 donors , " said the DRK Willingness Manager .	-2.8761
Obviously , the change to the House of Theatres led to higher participants a few years ago .	-3.0354
Thomas Bockstadt , Susanne Reichle , Sandra Schöck , Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer already included multiple donors and have been awarded for 50 blood donations each .               e                    	-8.1619

The Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25 % .	-2.0957
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and the weakening of inflation have stemmed speculation about an increase .	-3.2832
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain " bearing " when it maintained interest rates on family income in the middle of reinforcing pressure .	-3.0419
The policymakers of the Monetary Committee ( MPC ) of the Bank voted in favour of keeping interest rates to 0.25 % this month , with less members seeking an increase , because weak economic growth has weakened support for increases .	-3.8553
In its quarterly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 to 1.6 % , warning that pressure on household income would continue , with inflation expected to rise to just 3 % in the autumn .	-3.5466
But it signaled that in the coming years , interest rates would be needed to bring inflation fueled by Brexit , and said that credit costs may have to rise more than expected on financial markets .	-6.7590
Members also voted in favour of withdrawing part of the Mammut Economic Recovery Package published a year ago after Brexit .	-2.8096
It will call for the financing plan to provide cheaper funding for banks from next February , although it has been said that it is now expected to provide 15 billion more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds of sterling .	-3.7637
Minutes after the decision on interest rates , the Bank said : ' In the central forecast of the MPC , GDP remains weak in the short term , because household real income continues to burden consumption ' .	-3.6938
As regards interest rates , it repeated that ' a certain streamlining of monetary policy ' would be needed to cool inflation and a ' slightly larger ' scale than markets expect .	-3.4477
Markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .	-2.3180
The Bank stressed , however , that increases would be ' gradually ' and ' limited ' .	-2.2767
The Bank ’ s downward-looking growth forecasts for this year and next are compared to the 1.9 % forecast in May and 1.7 % .	-2.8427
It retained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .	-1.8009
The pound fell after these news against the dollar and the euro .	-2.1620
The pound fell by 0.5 % to $ 1.31 and fell by 0.4 % to 1.11 euros .	-2.1951
The decision will not change after recent disappointing growth figures have steamed rising expectations for interest rates and GDP has risen from 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % in the second quarter .	-3.7559
Growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will easily recover after the bank at the end of the year .	-2.7275
The recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for budgets affected by increasing inflation and minor salaries , because tightening will first become worse before it will improve     .	-10.9943
She added that monetary policy cannot ' prevent income from breaking up ' in the coming years , but it added that the wages will ' clearly ' recover at the end of their three-year forecasts .	-3.9534
The economy is also strengthened by rising demand for British goods , due to the weak pound , which will compensate for some of the lower consumer spending .	-3.0915
The decision comes one year after reducing interest rates to 0.25 % last August after the shocking EU vote causing the decline of the pound .	-2.6002
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years before this will completely achieve prices and the economy .	-2.5033
Before the Bank ’ s last judgment on interest rates , the reputation for an increase in interest rates had increased , as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households , with three policymakers in July demanding an increase to 0.5 %  .                            	-7.5531
Inflation fallen from 2.9 % last month to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said that this was expected and will return it in the coming months .	-3.2378
The Bank said that the exceedance in relation to its target of 2 % is ' quite ' to the weak pound .	-3.1492
Andrew Montlake , Director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers , said : " Given the recent decline in the swap rates , the mortgage market will become more competitive , because lenders are looking vocally for shops and want to end the year in a positive way .	-4.0961
The market looks particularly good for those who expire the existing deals and complete the new mortgages , and many with free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . '	-3.4123
NHS ( The National Health Service ) is intended to prescribe 10,000 people with controversial HIV drugs	-2.7413
Patients will receive access to " transformative " HIV prevention treatment from September after a fight before the High Court against the financing of the medicine in the NHS .           w  w  a        a   	-7.6560
NHS England announced that a Pre-exposure Prophylaxis ( PrEP ) , which was taken place before gender traffic , can now be delivered by the health service over a first three-year study for 10,000 people , w        ri              p p   prophylaxi                                         	-13.2606
He declared willing to finance the process after the Appeal Court confirmed last year a judgment by the Supreme Court of Justice that the NHS had the power to pay for the PrEP , despite the allegation that the local authorities should finance it .	-3.7762
The movement announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England-Chief Simon Stevens as an " important new intervention " , while the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) called this " decisive moment " .	-3.3571
Sexual health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool , and Sheffield will be one of the first to allow people to register and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced across England in April 2018 .                      e                       	-7.9801
Pre-exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before the sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .	-2.3443
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in infectious endangered people .	-2.7928
Taking PrEP before gender means that there are enough medicines in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .	-3.0784
Such medicines can be taken every day or two hours before gender tra                     	-7.6795
Those who call into question for treatment include gay or bisexual men , transsexuals and people with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated .	-2.9491
Clinics identify appropriate participants who agree to the study , including men , women , transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known by antiretroviral treatment .	-3.1329
People who live in England and are registered with a doctor can also register for possible participation in their local sexual clinic .	-2.9934
The programme will sign <unk> 10 million and NHS England a contract this week following an international competitive procurement .	-2.6165
The study is intended to assess the whole potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence , as is specifically used , included and implemented on a large scale .	-3.8219
Stevens said : ' This great new intervention should supplement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .	-2.5768
It is another milestone in more than three decades of progress towards meeting one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . '	-3.0628
Deborah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National Aids Trust ) , said : " This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .	-2.2888
PrEP , when it is specifically aimed at needy and vulnerable people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic .	-3.2095
From September , people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-financed attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and is not subject to a negotiation with a partner , which leads to improvements in many , many lives .	-3.7652
We warmly welcome this announcement ' .	-1.5187
Ian Green , CEO of the Terrence Higgins Trust , said : " The priority must now be to leave the study quickly across the country and that nobody who has a risk to HIV is left .	-3.4271
Now that the PrEP test medicine has been obtained , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people . '	-2.5972
Sharon Hodgson , Shadow Health Minister , said : " The beginning of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and hesitant implementation by the government .	-2.8719
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and end the transfer of this life-changing infection .	-2.7426
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP .	-1.9884
It is now important that this study be carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV-infected and that it will help to end the spread of HIV in society ' .	-3.4079
The great life : Between floor and clever designer tricks have transformed this little Earls Court apartment into a generous home                       	-6.6847
Joanne Leigh , a former banker with a passion for real estate , reduced from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court Apartment in 2014 .	-2.5834
It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her pockets .	-2.8945
" Before that I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room , " said Joanne .	-2.3972
" I was looking for something that was comparable to my price .	-1.9851
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and she had the same high ceilings .	-2.2915
I fell in love with them and made an offer on this day ' .	-3.2346
Since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot has been completely outdated .	-2.6482
Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne Stauraum and an intermediate floor wanted to add the generous ceiling height optimally .	-3.9100
" I wanted high blankets , large windows , a lot of light .	-2.0513
That was my requirement , ' she says .	-1.7960
To this end , she appointed the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 feet high ceilings and to create a home which was not only a development but also a place for joanne life .	-3.6620
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms , so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor in which one could stand .	-3.0030
Erfan had to think creatively to resolve the definition             	-5.4759
" The steel mill is quite complicated " , he explains .	-2.1058
" We had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked without having to book ourselves .	-2.6462
It was not just a question of building a simple platform , but of creating steel in such a way that he had the right height for the function above or below . '  .      I  a s m  ...	-5.4847
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional drama .	-3.3300
For the intermediate floor , a classic copper light window from Retrouvius looks down across the glamorous living area .	-4.8952
Mirrored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage serge mouille lighting set the style for the program .	-2.3777
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatres , space and light .	-1.9937
At both ends , a short corridor is mirrored to leave it longer .	-2.3167
The kitchen feels like a window in another room .	-1.9663
At the entrance , mirrored units offer space for all Joanne cutlery and glasses .	-2.8204
By perceiving a more glamorous room , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .	-2.5564
Foldable kitchens are nothing new .	-2.2704
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door .	-2.1437
" A bit of engineering went in there " , Erfan explains from the steel reinforced , furnished MDF door .	-3.6305
" It is counterweight so that if you delay the door , it is very easy to slide . "	-3.6301
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Joanne won additional 16 m <unk> , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .	-2.9992
" At the end of the day you will sell the basic area - or how your property is estimated , " says Erfan .	-2.3930
'In a rudimentary form , a real estate agent will enter and carry out a calculation based on soil size ' .	-9.2080
They have managed to increase the soil area and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the space its luxurious advantage .	-3.2249
" The materials are the things you touch and which therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home , " says Erfan .	-2.6745
" You don 't love yourself in the electric sockets in the walls .	-2.8457
These are important , but they do not play with your heart . "	-1.8235
It shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square meters of something standard in something amazing .	-3.2624
Indeed , like Joanne , you could decide not to leave them .	-2.0487
Brothers fight for $ 500 million property empire	-2.5471
Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty , in a dispute because of one of Victoria ’ s largest real estate empires worth more than $ 500 million .	-3.4369
The former director of the Carlton-Football-Club and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul , who brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how to divide her property and business wealth .	-3.8513
Paul has been withdrawing from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp discussion on the separation is taking place in the Supreme Cou .                                     	-7.9648
Together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 real estate in the value of more than half a billion dollars , since the family bought a business in Smith Street , Collingwood                  	-5.0883
There , the Westco Jeans family founded and grew into a chain of 160 retail shops .	-2.5985
It was sold in 1999 for USD 85 million .	-1.5674
This money has been invested in real estate and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the city centre , the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller , as well as shopping centres in the board .	-3.4895
After an agreement with her late father , Colin has described - by Paul as " main operator and the dominant personality " in the De Lutis family - about two-thirds of the company 's wealth and Paul about on a t .	-6.8873
A judicial act says that this means that Colin property has $ 316 million and Paul worth $ 176 million .	-2.8283
The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .	-2.1001
" The divisions proposed by Colin left him with what I thought for the best objects , " he wrote in 2015 in a first affidavite .	-5.5225
Last Friday , after several failed conciliations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place .	-2.2820
The brothers are now also fighting for control over the existing business - from which Colin , as Paul claims , has excluded it .	-3.3569
Colin argues that this is not true , but Paul accuses of managing some possessions incompetently .	-2.5873
In an early Affidavit submitted by Colin , he says he hopes to resolve the dispute .	-2.2350
" My Italian heritage writes that the family is the most important priority , " he wrote .	-2.1806
The costs increase with hundreds of pages with Affidavits , e-mails and reports by companies , including Deloitte , Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan Myers , QC , and law firms held by both sides .	-3.2292
Mrs De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated dairy and delicate business from the late 1950s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early seventies .	-6.0578
They used the security to buy the Collingwood property in which Colin opened the first Jeansladen of the family .	-2.7073
Colin says that he began Westco there when he was " the high school in my last few years when Paul was still a small child ( approximately 10 years old ) " .	-3.2454
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass their property on to their sons validly .	-2.8498
" Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to land before court , " she wrote .	-2.3096
Two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lutis group , with Colin claiming that , when the company left , $ 10 million and Luke 26 million were paid .	-3.2722
Both Lukas and Mark , Paul says ' bitterly about the conditions of their financial separation ' .	-2.6020
Colin has been very restrained , although he was a former AFL member of the Board of Directors and after a biography dating back to 2015 by Eddie McGuire the best friend o  telev s                      e   	-6.6281
Fairfax Media contacted with Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers .	-2.1271
Only Colin answered via SMS to say " I really can not say much " because the case is before the courts .	-2.5531
" It is very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and draw our family name through the courts , " he wrote .	-5.0300
In mid-2016 , Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to meet the demands of his brother .	-2.4466
" Our father would not have wanted Paul and I would end in our current dispute , " he said and added that he " still hoped for a solution " .	-2.6057
On Friday , this hope seemed over .	-1.5377
" Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future , " wrote Colin .	-2.1526
Trump ’ s new Head of Staff plans to restrict the President ’ s media abstinence .	-2.1955
Others have tried and failed .	-1.3611
Perhaps John F. Kelly can do it .	-5.3960
If so , he will be the first .	-1.2290
Politico reports that the new Head of Staff of the White House is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Trump , including the reports by the news media , in the hope of keeping the head on a more evenly course .	-3.6298
Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey :	-1.3034
" When John F. Kelly , the new leader of the White House , met with senior employees on his first working day , he represented a major problem in President Donald Trump ’ s White House that he wanted to repair : bad information that entered the hands of the president .	-3.9827
Kelly said to the employees that information on him should flow - whether on paper or in Briefings - because the President would make better decisions if he were to receive good information . '	-5.2067
Kelly ’ s diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet .	-1.9302
President Trump ’ s relationship with television is going back decades – and now where he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong .	-4.0523
" If candidate Trump was annoyed because of unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of jobs that were to convince , " said former election campaign adviser Sam Nunberg in February to Politico .	-3.7245
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that ' the key to keeping Trump 's Twitter habit under control , according to six former election campaign officials , is to ensure that his personal media consumption contains a steady praise prize ' .	-7.4096
Okay .	-0.4756
But the idea that Trump ’ s Twitter habit ever was “ under control ” is ridiculous .	-1.9709
Perhaps these campaign officials know something we do not know - that Trump ’ s tweets had contained even more ingredients without their interventions .	-2.8199
We will probably never know anything about the tweets that Trump has not sent .	-2.3200
If his employees already managed to keep trouble from him some time , their efforts have been worthwhile .	-3.4454
But no one could consistently prevent Trump from causing controversy .	-2.4059
Part of the problem is that people in a White House composed of competing parties are constantly trying to move forward their own agenda by presenting Trump materials that may promote their views from the world .	-3.2338
Politico - wholeheartedly dealing with this story - reported in May on the preferences of advisers to provide dubious information to the President for strategic reasons .	-3.4328
This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher :	-1.4433
" Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can respond like a volcano to negative press releases , especially such with damaging leaks , and that he discovers where they come from .	-3.4700
This is exactly what happened at the end of February , when someone maliciously gave a printed copy of an article of GotNews.com , the website of Internet provocative Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy staff chief Katie Walsh of being " the source behind a cluster of leaks " in the White House .	-3.8996
Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter or that he has not offered specific evidence or that he has expressed and revoked false accusations in the past .	-3.7541
Trump read the article and began to question staff about Walsh . '	-2.4724
Goldmakers added that then Staff Chief Reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House , Rob Porter , " tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper cram Trump receives " .	-3.0903
How did this fold ?	-1.6240
Kelly tried to do the same three months later .	-1.4598
Perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager than priebus , but Trump is still his impulsive self , and his consultants still strive for influence .	-3.0234
These inchanging factors make Kelly ’ s mission very difficult .	-1.9026
Most-seeking criminals Get Europol	-2.7752
Since the address is unknown , the population will be asked and hoped to help them .	-3.3392
The police throughout Europe sends this summer ( virtual ) postcards to dangerous criminals on flight .	-2.6771
Since the addresses of the severity criminals sought are naturally unknown , people will hope and request information .	-4.0273
Europol reported on Friday about the action following the EU Most Wanted advent calendar from winter .	-4.8958
Experience would have shown that many refugees hide to holiday destinations , Europol said .	-2.9957
You have compiled 21 postcards for sought criminals from 21 EU countries .	-2.5396
Since 2016 there has been the website www.eumostwanted , more than 2.5 million times has been seen .	-2.8743
36 of the online searches have been arrested so far , at least eleven of them because of indications after the publication on the website .	-3.2597
Travellers negotiate on a divide and return to the ' millionaire ' series .	-2.5431
Some of the most prosperous homeowners of the West Midlands are again negotiated with some determined travellers on warfare , who have negotiated a divide drawn from the community to call for a field before their mansions .	-4.5721
The travellers have parked their 20 caravans on a field outside a prosperous street of Solihull , which is called the " Millionaire Trip " .	-3.4503
They have brought horses , babies and an army of transporters after they were only thrown out in May , but without having been deterred from a divide excavated by the Council to prevent their occurrences                   	-6.6479
The tactful group found a gap in defense facilities and pressed its vehicles by a section that remained unobstructed to find a way .	-3.2934
Angry inhabitants urged the Solihull Council , who said that it was ' useless to deal with the problem ' .	-3.0549
An anonymous inhabitant said : " They drew there on Monday evening after they were sent by Bentley Heath where they thrown stones on the passers .	-3.4957
The Council must be forced to implement shamefully because it was useless in dealing with the problem .	-2.6017
Travellers were there in May , were moved forward and are now back .	-5.2190
More arrived last night , probably even more tonight . '	-2.6067
She added : ' The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by keeping long instructions to protect their parks .	-2.6270
I live on the Streetsbrook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my community tax if the Council cannot even stop it . '	-2.5240
A resident who did not want to be called " It is ridiculous , we have just seen the last round of these travellers just to be plundered by another round .	-3.2276
The figures have increased this time and you have even seen a horse in the parking area ' .	-2.8169
A speaker from the Solihull Council said : ' We are aware of an unauthorised camp in the country beyond the Streetsbrook Road and work with the Solihull Police , and we are taking the necessary legal steps to proceed as soon as possible .	-3.8780
To support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible report an anti-social or criminal behaviour in the police by calling 101 .	-2.8476
This helps to create a picture of the situation in which the Court must examine when we present our case . '	-2.8333
Waldhotel Luise	-8.2511
The former Hotel Birkenhof becomes the Waldhotel Luise .	-8.6834
The house is currently being renovated in front of the gates of joy town and will be reopened on 1 March next year .	-3.4367
These are good news for the city .	-1.2860
Because with the closure of Hotel Birkenhof by then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014 , approximately 30 000 nights were lost every year and also revenues by the tax .	-8.6866
In the autumn of 2014 , given the dramatically increasing numbers of refugees who came into the district , the hotel building offered the council office as collection accommodation , which ensured controversial discussions .	-4.0906
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by creating a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .	-3.0816
The decision was not uncontroversial in the Council of Municipalities at that time .	-2.5755
But , above all , joy town of Oberbürgermeister Julian Osswald defended the hotel site and spoke of serious interested people at the time .	-3.2842
It should be right .	-1.3037
Luisenhotels Group with managing director Birgit Scherer , based in Bad Bergzabern , has purchased the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three-star plus category under the name of Waldhotel Luise .	-3.7523
The group has four houses with the Freudenstädter Object .	-2.1878
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb .	-1.6040
They are called Luise , Luisenpark , Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise .	-1.7745
The former Hotel Birkenhof has been in front of the entrance for a long time , and if you enter the house , it is clear what extensive renovation works are carried out .	-4.4071
The floors were removed , blankets sometimes dismantled , old bathtubs from the rooms .	-3.5296
The entire hotel building is a single building site .	-1.6646
There is still much to be done by March .	-1.5050
" It is a beautiful hotel " , says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper .	-2.3796
Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style .	-1.9021
The rooms are equipped with large showers , the entrance area is redesigned and new windows are built .	-3.1954
Everything should be " beautiful citizens " later , as Thomas Scherer expresses .	-2.9355
'We want to make a jewelry out of it ' .	-1.9604
Swimming pool , wellness area and meeting room are equipped .	-2.4697
You don 't want to position yourself at the high level of hotels in Lauterbad , but already at a high level of city centre , Scherer emphasizes .	-3.7630
The Waldhotel Luise , with its about 60 rooms , wants to sit broadly , explains Scherer .	-3.3228
Both individual holidays , groups or businessmen should feel comfortable in the hotel .	-2.7826
Talks with OB Julian Osswald and tourist director Michael Krause he has already held , says Schere         .	-7.1929
The ideas of the city are equal to those of the hotel group .	-2.7401
'We are on the same line ' .	-1.2231
Asked about the level of investment , Thomas Scherer does not want to set itself closely .	-3.0193
Just under one million euros , he expects .	-2.2509
External installations are also being put on the front , and that is already clearly visible .	-3.4093
There is a large terrace available from the restaurant , which is public .	-3.0700
Thomas Scherer is optimistic : " Freudenstadt ist ein guter Markt " .	-1.7370
Russia ’ s Affair : US Special Funder Sets Grand Jury	-2.4246
In the Russian affair around US President Donald Trump , special funder Robert Mueller should have used a so-called Grand Jury after a report    .	-6.4683
In recent weeks , the body has worked , wrote the " Wall Street Journal " with appeal to people familiar with the matter .	-3.8029
The newspaper valued the step as a sign that Mueller extended and intensified his investigations .	-2.4530
The CNN sender reported that there were already the first subscriptions of the body in connection with a meeting between Trump ’ s oldest son and a Russian lawyer  .                      e   e	-6.5965
US intelligence services have been accusing the Kremlin for a longer time to interfere specifically in the 2016 presidential campaign .	-2.7290
Mueller studied whether there were agreements between Trump ’ s campaign team and Moscow .	-2.2731
The focus of investigations should be on several men who operated in the election campaign as adviser of the Republican .	-3.4813
According to reports , Mueller also took more and more Trump ’ s private and business environment .	-2.4083
The ' Washington Post ' wrote a few weeks ago that the special facilitator Trump personally returned to the center and studied the accusation of whether the president may have hampered the judiciary as a result of the affair .	-4.1729
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine and decide whether to charge these evidences in possible crime cases .	-3.1518
Grand Jurys are therefore also called chambers of charge .	-2.6701
They are usually turned on if they are larger and controversial cases .	-2.7195
The procedure is always behind closed doors .	-1.8507
The body can also be turned on by the Public Prosecutor to invite people to take part under oath .	-3.6807
According to the CNN transmitter , requests have already been issued that revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer .	-3.5409
People involved in the meeting had been called for a statement in the report .	-2.9434
They should also provide documents .	-1.3795
In addition to Trump Jr. , Trump ’ s consultants and silencer Jared Kushner , as well as his then election chief , Paul Manafort , were in the process of talking .	-3.7629
Legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the establishment shows that Mueller does not let himself be intimidated in his work and that , if necessary , he wanted to act quick                 	-5.7107
But it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will end up in order to decide the collection of a charge .	-2.9260
Nevertheless , the establishment of the body of the start of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for President Trump ’ s concern .	-2.9165
In the middle of the new revelations , the President took advantage of a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to represent the Russian affair as a campaign of his po     oppo .	-5.6304
" Russia 's history is a total invention , " said Trump .	-1.7197
The subject gives the Democrats a way of feeling good because they have nothing else that they can talk about ' .	-3.1893
His special adviser Ty Cobb declared in an opinion that he knows nothing about the establishment of a Grand Jury .	-2.7706
He also usually worked in secret , however .	-2.9306
The White House supports any measures that accelerated the work of the Special Fund in a ' fair ' way .	-2.6237
Former FBI leader James Comey said three times that it was not determined against the President .	-2.6857
There was no reason to believe that something had changed in this respect .	-7.5939
However , Mueller was only used after Trump fireed Comey .	-7.3731
Because of this discard , accusations against Trump have become loud , he wanted to hamper the judiciary .	-3.7719
In June , Comey said before a Senate Committee that Trump asked him to stop the investigations against the then national security adviser Michael Flynn .	-3.1447
The President is under great pressure because of the investigation .	-2.0764
After representing US media , the White House collected material against the special investigator and his employees .	-2.8961
The solved speculation about whether Trump Mueller wants to redundancy .	-2.3908
Unlike an independent Congressional special finder , such as the Watergate affair for the later President Richard Nixon , Mueller has a position in which he could in theory be fired on pressure from the Ministry of Justice .	-6.6018
Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step .	-1.9929
Two groups of Republican and Democratic Senators presented legislative proposals on Thursday that the special funder could no longer be so simply redundant .	-3.6670
Antarctica : Gigantic Iceberg Drives in the Antarctic	-7.8486
In the West Antarctic , a gigantic iceberg has solved from the Schelfeis from the just seven times size of Berlin .	-3.2730
This informed the Bremerhaven Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .	-2.3779
The more than a trillion tonnes of severe and 5800 square kilometres of coloss now drive north and will probably need two , three years until it has been melted .	-3.9459
It is one of the largest ice giants in the past three decades , with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres .                                                	-10.8418
He does not expect a danger for people .	-7.2115
To what extent climate change has played a role in demolishing the iceberg , it is unclear according to research ind          .           	-6.9196
However , for around 30 years , there has been a series of unusual collapses of ice shelves in the region , writing the US Research Centre for Snow and Ice ( NSIDC ) in a fact                            	-6.8434
In the opinion of many researchers , this could be linked to global warming .             	-5.0214
The coloss , which has now been broken , has so far been part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis                   	-7.9662
Schelfeis swims on the sea and is fed by large glaciers .	-2.1930
It therefore grows further and further into the sea and is regularly                	-6.6600
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis lies south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula .	-2.4097
The north of this shellfish disrupted the balance of growth and cancellation a few years ago .	-3.6585
A complete shellfist was falling there , writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen .	-3.7176
There is some saying that the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is also in danger , because the front edge has never withdrawn as far as they are currently .	-3.8658
In addition , the ice plate is under tension and can fall if a piece is cancelled at a key point .	-4.1399
The melting of Schelfeis and Iceberg does not increase the sea level because it swims on the water and displaces ice as much water as it results after melting itself .	-3.6045
However , the loss of the Schelfeise means that the glaciers can lead directly to the sea and flow much faster than before .	-3.2567
This could possibly increase sea level , but only little , writes the British research project for monitoring the Antarctic ( Midas )       .	-3.9967
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is the fourth largest shelf in Antarctica according to AWI data with almost 50 000 square kilometres .	-3.5715
At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters .	-2.9544
It regularly breaks down there .	-2.9421
" Although it has been a natural event and is not aware of any direct connection with climate change , the ice sign now comes into a more vulnerable position , " said Martin O 'Leary from the British Swansea University .	-3.7157
" This is the broadest withdrawal since the beginning of the records " , he also confirmed .	-2.5962
Among scientists , whether the Larsen-C-Schelfeis will now grow again or decline in the long term and possibly coincide , his colleague Adrian Luckman said : ' Our models say that it will be less stable ' .	-3.8406
But this development will take decades .	-1.4868
Although these researchers do not result in the climate change of this gigantic iceberg , there have been a great many ice cream of the Antarctic Peninsula in recent decades .	-4.2861
This long Antarctic summit covers South America .	-2.4281
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey research programme , the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s .	-2.8943
The temperature increase has contributed to the decline .	-1.8510
Over the past 50 years , the Antarctic Peninsula has heated by about three degrees , counting among the areas where temperature is rising fastest .	-3.6053
CDU wants personnel domestic rates	-3.0730
Because it is becoming increasingly difficult to occupy freely growing bodies , the CDU is calling for the employers ' association to become more attractive .	-3.0903
Only just before the summer break , the circle day winked 41 new posts in the administration .	-3.6065
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the circle management in Mettmann .	-2.1864
Now 17 trainees have their first working day behind themselves .	-2.6363
The teaching programmes at the circle appear   ver desir   .      Th         e i	-10.3065
Around 620 applications were recorded for this year 's places .	-2.8319
Nevertheless , the circle lacks continued staff to meet the increased requirements and tasks .	-3.1490
Currently , there are still 50 non-occupied positions at the Mettmann circle .	-3.0781
Doctors and engineers are searched , among other things , as well as forces of general administration .	-2.9754
The CDU now wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG and confront the lack of experts in the administration .	-3.6905
The administration should draw up a concept of human resources and personnel development following the desire of the parties ' .	-3.4909
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs for professionals , but to counteract the shortage of applicants forward-looking , states .	-3.5972
The overall concept should be based on internal and external orientations , show concrete measures for cross-beginners and include a training offensive , call for CDU , FDP and UWG .	-4.0997
This sounds like a good approach .	-2.3539
Because the circle has to deal with staff problems that we did not know earlier .	-3.0981
Other cities promote good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .	-7.6640
The talk is about a reasonable ' competition by public employers '  . '           Th   e           	-10.6440
In addition , a high number of employees that disengage or age conditions from the service comes from .	-4.3660
Therefore , the highest time to act so that there are no longer more posts .	-8.4956
But Klaus-Dieter Peoples , Chief of Group of the CDU , still goes beyond the joint motion with his party .	-3.1119
He recently caused a fist-thick surprise in the day of circulation when he called publicly into question the cost of staff and amazed the other parties .	-4.6713
Peoples want all the possibilities to exit from the local employers ' association .	-3.1125
" If we do not come to a satisfactory solution here in the short term , the circle administration with the trade unions - perhaps in cooperation with the cities involved - should seek a domestic rate , " said peoples .	-4.4244
Thus , the CDU is trying to pay better for employees and officials than it actually provides for the public service .	-3.2760
The salaries are currently exactly required , increases or more money are only available if you change to a higher level oriented towards professional years .	-3.7962
But the tasks of the circle have grown increasingly in recent years .	-2.4020
Only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be established where employees concerned the provisions of the new Prostitute Protection Act .	-3.5597
Not least by the rising number of asylum seekers , Landrat Thomas Hendele and Director Martin Judge have a problem : you have too little staff .	-3.0551
Italy ’ s Tone of NGO Migrants Ba B B        B   Bo        Mi           	-10.4491
Italy has warned NGOs that use rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they must not continue if they do not comply with new rules for their operations .	-3.1594
" If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how to continue working , " said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin Daily Newspaper La Stampa .	-2.9498
Minniti 's warning came one day after the Italian authorities had confiscated a boat from the German aid organisation ' Youth Rescue ' , because their team had effectively worked with human traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigratio .                   has            e e      	-8.5378
The aid organization , which has only been in operation for one year , refused to express itself on detailed accusations by the Italian Prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio .	-3.4676
" For us , the salvation of human life remains our top priority , so we are very sorry that at the moment we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone , " said the organization in an opinion on the social media .	-3.6168
'We can judge all the allegations currently being collected only after we have collected all the information and assess the situation ' .	-3.1332
The Italian authorities had monitored the boat of ' Youth Rescue ' , Iuventa , since October .	-2.0263
It is suspected that his occupation takes rubber boat migrants directly supplied by human traffickers , and that smugglers can depart to enable vessels to be used again .	-3.7928
At least such a meeting was supposedly only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the act of the Public Prosecutor , whose content was published by Italian media .	-3.0093
The occupation is suspected of monitoring the authority of the Italian coastguard , the bailout operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons , not for any other motives .	-9.4416
Under the code of conduct , boats like Iuventa must have an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities .	-2.7190
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far explained to keep to the code : Save the Children , MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain .	-2.9519
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable , as they would not bring with themselves ' major changes or disabilities ' of their bailouts .	-3.3111
Among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel Prize winner organization is doctors without borders ( MSF ) .	-2.3712
Minniti has now said that the number of migrants that arrived after the rescue measures in Italy has fallen sharply in recent weeks , which indicates that the efforts to strengthen Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit .	-3.9565
" In the last few days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , " said the minist             	-4.5829
He announced plans for further discussions with Libyan Mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants that leave these countries in the hope of achieving Europe .                          	-6.1638
Rising and Trials	-1.4810
Nine Weilermer Biker , the " Berlin Outdoor Post " and two host drivers met in Wachenheim in the North Palace to enjoy trials and sights for four days .	-2.9529
Three friendly guides were available for this .	-1.8445
The accommodation in the Wachenheimer Valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .	-2.2848
The Wachenheim Castle and Wine Festival was a welcome extra .	-1.8986
The first tour led to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim along the Michaelskapelle vineya .      A a                          	-9.4711
It followed points of view , partly on towers , from which one could look far across the forest and the layers that have be store .	-8.4158
In between , there have been longer and longer increases that rewarded long trials .	-3.0652
The second day went to Bad Dürkheim to the saline and to the Volksfest sausage market .	-2.8420
Once again , there was a viewpoint , connected by " flowing " trials and moderate increases .	-3.6109
Over the last two days many height meters were again treated .	-3.0895
Caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and caves brought welcome breaks .	-2.3464
In Bad Dürkheim the bikers in the open-air inhalatorium breathed into healing sole .	-3.5654

Fact is that e-sport has long become a serious industry , becoming a lucrative business - large stars , millions of fans , and huge tournaments with high gages including .                                	-6.6798
This has also recognized the first Federal League Associations , which are increasingly involved in this area .	-2.8814

" We hope to enthuse very new young target groups for the VfB , " says Jochen Röttgermann .	-2.7027
He is sure that ' this turn a number of associations still rise ' .	-3.4360
Next weekend , the Football World Federation FIFA in London organizes the first " Interactive Club World Cup " , where the gamers of various clubs oppose each other .	-3.6982

And : the associations tried to conquer all possible markets , especially Asian .	-2.4259
With prominent e-sportsmen under contract , one could be far more often present in these markets than just sending the Federal League Team to Asia once a year .	-3.6135
What is it all about ?	-1.8536
When e-sporting , computer games like " League Of Legends " , " Dota 2 " , " Counterstrike " or the FIFA football simulation at competitive level .	-3.3353
For a long time , as in normal sport , leagues have established leagues where the professionals come against each other .	-3.6085
And in Asia 2022 , e-sport is already part of the official programme .	-2.3383
But is it anything that is a re sp   ?	-7.6864
For many , the idea is certainly needed .	-2.3006
Ingo Froböse has long dealt with the question .	-2.4831
For the professor at the German Sports High School in Cologne , e-sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in classical sport - for example , increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormonal changes .	-3.8173
It also needs cognitive skills , technical and tactical understanding and rapid response capabilities .                   	-5.3661

Michelle Carter condemned by the Texts that Conrad Roy pushed for suicide	-3.1687
A woman from Massachusetts was condemned to two and a half years because she has encouraged her friend through texts and calls for suicide .	-2.5210
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of condemnation behind grids and five years have been subjected to problems .	-2.9099
Carter was condemned in June for negligent killing of Conrad Roy , who lived on 13 July 2014 .	-2.5222
The father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : " My family is untouched .	-2.2229
My son was my best friend . '	-1.3388
Carter was allowed to stay free until the appeal .	-8.0670
She was faced with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both them and Mr Roy suffered from a mental disease .	-2.7054
Dressed in red trousers and a cream-coloured blouse , Carter stood with tears in the eyes , with folded hands and downward eyes when she was condemned .	-3.5724
" Your actions have murdered Conrad Roy , " said the Prosecutor to the Court .	-2.4371
" She ended his life to make her own better .	-1.8073
She has assumed no responsibility , " she said .	-2.1857
" She has not shown a repentance " .	-2.4473
But Carter ’ s lawyer said that it was a “ terrible circumstance that she completely regrets ” .	-4.7997
Judge Lawrence Moniz said , however , he did not find out that their " age or degree of maturity or even their mind have a significant influence on their actions " .	-5.1887
A public prosecutor read a declaration by Roys Mother Lynn Roy , who said that there is " no day when I do not mourn the loss of my beloved son .	-3.4295
I would like him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything ; I try to be there for his sisters , despite all the pain we will bear for eternity with us .	-3.6996
Roys Schwester , Camdyn Roy , said that she would never participate in the wedding of her brother or be an aunt for his children .	-3.0251
" No longer having this only person with whom I have been together every day since my birth is a pain that I will always keep for the rest of my life with me , " she said .	-3.3815
The case seems to set a legal precedent because there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another person to commit suicide .	-2.9424
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014 .	-2.2361
The case drew national attention after Carter ’ s text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life .	-2.7000
" Hang up , jumped off a building , suffer yourself , I do not know there are many ways " , she said in several news she sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on holiday with his family .	-3.7887
In the moments before his suicide she wrote : ' You must do it , Conrad ' and ' Everything you need to do is turn the generator and you will be free and happy ' .	-3.0586
Judge Moniz said that Carter was looking for attention through the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from the case through any press .           ee      e        	-7.3804

Joshua Kimmich : Learning from the new FC Bavaria	-1.9705
That Joshua Kimmich was allowed to run at the Audi Cup as a captain is no accident .	-2.7899
The FC Bavaria trusts the confed-cup winner a large season - Extra motivation does not damage there .	-3.2073
Something was different on his place in the cabin , which immediately saw Joshua Kimmich , even if the additional clothing was very , very small .	-5.3313
But there was no Philipp Lahm and no manuel newer on the second day of the Audi Cup , he made himself the binding allocated to the arm .	-4.2085
" The trainer did not announce it " , the confed cup winner told behind , after his first use as Bavarian captain .	-3.0055
Good that the book could have run better than at 0 : 2 against the SSC Naples .	-3.2905
But the character of the coach could also interpret Kimmich .	-2.7462
Not the eight years older Arturo Vidal had been chosen as guide guide in the C-Elf consisting of youth players , debut and holiday professionals , but he   was chosen  .	-7.3362
Sugar is the most preferable distribution of those who want to keep walking .	-4.0062
So anyone who has corrected the legacy of Lahm can only use a small extra motivation well .	-3.4351
Kimmich confirmed : " This is what you want as a player : take responsibility " .	-2.4400
On Wednesday , the 22-year-old flattened as a mini-lame over the field .	-3.1314
To the right , that is now his position , the white binding on the poor did their rest .	-3.1298
And at all , Kimmich worked in this start formation like those who can best take the rower in the hands .	-4.0968
He gave instructions , tried to direct the unplayed troop .	-2.1263
He had a look for the whole , while many others were dealing with himself .	-5.3253
Vidal with overplaying his lack of fitness ( hardly folded ) ; Renato Sanches with the devil comes out of the services of the Asia trip ( folded even only ) ; and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle with not negatively standing in their first performance in the Bavarian tricot .	-5.4462
After all , this was very good .	-2.7153
Besides Kimmich , Rudy appeared before the defense , both acted sovereignly .	-3.2210
The renowned Napoli storm has often been difficult , and sweet sulphur also succeeded in building games some time  even .	-7.1447
Although his colleague Rudy admitted that the outcome was not as we hoped ' .	-2.7700
But he also showed a proper achievement in the debut .	-2.6098
Game relocation , tempo change : " For this style I was also collected " .	-3.6633
The unusual Bavarian world is still for new access , it was followed by the party .	-4.1734
Rudy , for example , did not give one or two in the catacombs , but certainly determine six or seven interv                 	-5.6864
Kimmich adopted himself after a few cracky statements in the back of his new players .	-3.1894
There he heard an interesting sentence from Süle : ' What is going on here , I have already noticed .	-3.5329
At Bavaria you just have to win every game " .	-2.2777
After all , it does not have to teach the new ones anymore .	-3.2990

Companies satisfy with Rhineland-Pfälzischem Minister : Economy is praising Wissing ’ s Pace	-8.2284
It was often irreconcilable that the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when Eveline Lemke ( Green ) was still the economic minister of Rhineland-Palatinate .	-3.0580

None of the companies described companies as recall .	-1.8915
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions rules .	-2.6614
But the nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are valid as carcinogens and can cause asthma .	-2.4029
The cost of automotive manufacturers to install plants to neutralize the emissions emitted by diesel vehicles is also increasing , which makes it difficult to keep the price of cars com c competi          .                           e   	-9.4766

Murdillo ’ s Nose and Laughing Against Suffering	-2.6818

The Argentinean is still working on a film with 85 .	-3.6727
His message : Laugh , ' because there is too much suffering in the world ' .	-1.8880
Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .	-2.0362
In the first few years as an artist , he took himself as a drawer for congratulations - which frustrated him .	-3.5798
" The most happy day in my professional life was the day when lost in my job , " he once said .	-2.2534
After stations in Lima , New York and Paris , he succeeded in the end of the 1960s : with the publication of his cartoons in " Paris Match " and then also in " Star " and other leading magazines around the world .	-3.6851
Even in China , Mordillo found many fans .	-1.4787
The artist was always inspired by cities .	-2.6303
Large , roundly Mordillo figures stumble in drawings with the shale tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .	-3.0587
In the early morning , he is still on the character table , according to his own information , and works almos                      	-5.7397
Through calendars , puzzles , books for big and small , t-shirts , plush animals and watches , his throlly figures continue to find a lot of spread worldwide .	-3.9292
For six years he has also worked on a character film and a TV series with his figures .	-2.5464

Threatening Climate Change Lavender	-1.8620
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .	-2.2542
The lavender is declining because of the insects transferred to drought and because of the diseases , which prepares great headaches for scientists and farmers trying to find solutions .	-3.8657
Eric Chaisse , expert of the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in the Provence , said : " The lavender in the Provence is effectively endangered because in recent years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change , which has brought much less rain in spring and much more in the autumn .	-4.1381
This has an impact on the life of Lavendel .	-1.9098
There is also a small cicade , a microbacterium that transfers dwarf cicades , and in very dry weather there are many of them . "	-2.8224
And there is a lot at stake .	-1.5514
Lavendel oil not only attracts for holidays , it is also very important for perfumes and cosmetics .	-3.4089
Eric Chaisse said : " Instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers , we have had smaller , underdeveloped and either lacking or weakened .	-2.8752
So we have less parts of essential oil . '	-1.7028
Solutions that are considered include better distribution of water and slowing evaporation from the ground , but also spraying the plants with a protective mixture of sound and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dryness .	-3.9630

Murdering a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico	-2.1193
The weekly Riodoce staff usually meet Wednesday to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the State of Sinaloa by organised crime , corrupt officials , and unstoppable drug wars .	-3.8691
But on this day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .	-2.1943
They were told that it is important to change their routines .	-1.7208
Two high-level journalists are discussing what is safer : they should take their children into the office , who were the goal of an attack with grenades in 2009 , or let them home            .                  e    	-7.6011
Security experts have written three words to a panel on the front of the room : opponents , neutrals , allies .	-2.4851
You ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is needed , perceptions and feelings are enough .	-3.1770
There are drug traffickers , politicians , businessmen , journalists suspected of being on the government 's salary list or cartel , a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .	-3.1413
There is no peace break from violence and , while bodies are coming throughout the country , more and more journalists have been in place : at least 25 , since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012 , 589 have been under federal protection and , until now , there have been at least seven deaths in seven states                            	-7.1988
Among the latter is her publisher and her inspirator of Riodoce , the co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas                   	-5.6492
" The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be journalist " , wrote Valdez in one of his many books on violence in connection with drugs .	-5.0514
Two reporters in the thirties , Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez , wear T-shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut .	-3.6537
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and reporters discuss their shared topics , the trauma , their nightmares , sleeplessness , paranoia .	-2.7632
Although a special attorney was established in 2010 to edit the cases of journalists , according to the Committee on the Protection of journalists , it has launched only two criminal proceedings .	-3.7760
As with most thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organised crime every year , journalists ’ murderers are rarely being tried .	-3.4541
At Riodoce , they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa , even though they are undermining and although the terrain is now even more treasonable .	-3.5440
Without information about the killers , without justice , the meeting on security has little benefit , Ibarra says .	-2.6210
" It is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , " he says .	-1.7929
" Until we know why , we all mistrust . "	-2.3472
On the morning of May 15 , Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan .	-2.5710
He only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men , forced from his car and 12 times he was shot on him , probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with " twelve river " .	-4.0656
The shelter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .	-2.9848
Valdez was 50 years old .	-0.9238
He left behind a woman and two adult children .	-1.3909
Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan .	-1.7166
But there is virtually nothing to silence on the subject of Valdez .	-2.2450
Since Guzman ’ s arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January , Sinaloa had become one of the country ’ s most bloody battlegrounds , because rival groups have fighted here to fill the vacuum .	-3.2539
It is not assuming that someone or several people are shot in Sinaloa every day or that the graveyard is full of decorated , two-storey mausoleums for drug kings that are larger than many houses for the living .	-4.0674
Forget for one minute that there is a state of " peace " if only one cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States .	-3.1959
Nevertheless , and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work , Ismail Bojorquez ( 60 ) , a co-founder and director of Riodoce , is blaming for not protecting his friend .	-2.8736
He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the killing .	-1.9107
First , in February , there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez , a leader of one of the rival cartel factions in the war with Guzman ’ s sons .	-2.9978
This publication may have annoyed the sons , suspected course members bought every copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks .	-5.7762
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country to its own security after the confiscation of another newspaper that had published the same story .	-2.9072
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .	-2.0258
He had survived for so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there          .	-3.3392
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 , when he joined five colleagues for the foundation of Riodoce and sold USD 50 .    T ' s a d  'a s . H w                 	-9.8165
In Sinaloa , " it was impossible to operate journalism without encountering the drug problem , " said Bojorquez .	-2.7213
Over time , the newspaper deserved a reputation for bold and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .	-2.8017
Reporters loved to be able to publish hard research without fear of censorship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to treat .	-3.1889
Eight years after the foundation of Riodoce , she received the prestigious " Maria-Moors-Cabot Prize " for her reporting in Latin America .	-2.7128
In the same year , Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award committee to protect journalists for his courage in pursuing the Mexican drug history , wherever she always led .	-3.3479
He admitted voluntarily that he was afraid .	-1.7816
" I would like to go on " , he said at the time of the CPJ award .	-2.6399
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa is a way of life , " he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV .	-2.1302
" You must take over the task you have as a journalist - either that or you play the stupid .	-3.0679
I do not want to be asked : ' What did you do in the face of so many deaths ... why did you not say what went before it ? '	-3.1823
The Riodoce team misses Valdez , the fun bird that could flee like a port worker , the friend who was generous with embraces and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .	-2.8742
They trusted in his routine .	-1.8761
He would always bear his hat .	-1.7188
He would always go to El Guayabo , the bar opposite the office , and always sit at the same table there .	-2.6301
Now they ask : Was his love of routine spoiled ?	-2.6967
His death has also forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their jobs and stay at life .	-3.2586
" You do not like it when you deal with your women , your children , their clean shops , their secret runways and landing runs " to move drugs .                              	-7.6650
" These things were not allowed , " said Bojorquez .	-1.7128
The result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation .	-2.1583
His own instincts trust .	-1.6340
If it smells wrong , it will remain away from it .	-3.2317
The anger is , said the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal , that ' smell can be deceived ... and then the thing happened with Javier ' .	-3.2377
The old rules , as he and others say , are no longer applicable in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas , Veracruz , Guerrero and other countries , where a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes , weak institutions , and corrupt government officials is home  .                                         	-7.3396
The landscape is constantly changing .	-8.6718
In the space in which Riodoce ’ s employees met security training , no mobile phones were suddenly allowed , and d       b           w we   k w w    h w k  t  s            h ,  a s , a p , a s       , w a                h m  .   , 	-25.1450
Outside , two policemen seeked protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 <unk> C ) in the shadow of a tree .	-4.0970
They were charged by the national government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a middle-class area of Culiacan .	-2.9061
Half in joke , some of the reporters wondered whether these officers belong to the 50 % of the policemen who the governor himself called untrustworthy .	-3.2143
It has been months since the reporters have gone to the mountain landscape , where the drug gangs are de facto under control .	-3.1972
Riodoce looked to three main stories for this week 's issue .	-10.8369
There was the murder of the brother of the former famous Boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa .	-2.2228
They also had an exposé to governor spending that focused on the home to the   governor .                      	-7.9125
And there was a group that made an abduction in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan , a block from the office of the Public Prosecutor .	-2.9891
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or what happened , so it was cautious when it was time to write what everyone knows in the city : that the restaurant is a favourite place for drug traffickers and authorities .	-3.5382
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belongs to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party ( PRI ) , who dominated almost all the political levels throughout the century .	-3.2480
Several PRI governors have recently been accused of corruption for high-class cases .	-2.5833
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this place , including one in which a son of " El Chapo " Guzman escaped a military attack .	-3.0564
Just a few months before , the readers would have seen the column of Valdez as the best-informed source of kidnapping .	-2.8031
" Formerly we would have known what happened , " said Villarreal , 46 , with the nickname " El Flaco " because of its slender body stature .	-3.1396
'Now all channels of communication are breaking with our sources ' .	-2.1255
The Valdez Office was dedicated to the storage area for signs and stickers who protest against the murders of journalists , because the employees have become something they never expected : activists on behalf of the press .	-3.6049
Reporter Miriam Ramirez snapped a few signs and went to a demonstration next morning because of another journalist to the office of the Public Prosecutor .	-2.9926
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan .	-6.2731
A burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is .	-2.1717
Throughout the country , journalists have become more volume by rewriting them on walks and buildings in organized protests " SOS Press " .	-3.4184
On this day , the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to gather international support for the judiciary in the Valdez case .	-2.7738
At a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa , on the day after the murder of Valdez , Ramirez accused the authorities of spying journalists and letting them bring them because they said the truth .	-3.4566
Since then , it has asked that it be redivided by the government because it is concerned that its anger has violated its objectivity .	-2.8865
Valdez repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organized crime , government officials and an indifferent society .	-11.0672
In his last book " Narco-Journalism " he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs , but also on command of politicians and security forces that were under a ceiling with organised crime .	-3.6321
Last year , the Articulo 19 media guardian group has assigned more than half of the attacks on police and officials journalists .	-2.8381
" In Mexico you die because they want you to keep the mouth , " said Ramirez .	-2.1210
Obviously , the murders have a deterrent effect .	-1.9391
No one forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipa six years ago .	-2.0937
Their bodies were found together with a note signed by the Zetas cartel : ' Here I am because of my reports '      ' .	-10.3215
A computer keyboard and headphones were next to their separate head .	-2.0795
Some branches have chosen how to murder the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March .	-4.6801
Others continue , as El Manana did in Nuevo Laredo after the murder of her director in 2004 .	-2.6158
In 2010 , the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with a leading article on the front page with the heading ' What do you want of us ? '	-3.4598
Some journalists have fled from their own countries , or even from the country .	-1.9760
It is a painful decision .	-0.9765
It is difficult to find work in exile , and they still observe the roads and look for dangers .                               a  	-8.2847
And sometimes they are hunted , as it seems to be the photographer Ruben Espinosa , who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico town three months after the escape from Veracruz .	-3.5714

At midnight last Friday , when the last edition was already ended , the editors of Riodoce were on the citizen 's slope before the office and drank beer when all their phones began to sum up at once .	-4.3946
A number of shooters with gang rivals and security forces near Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed deaths .	-2.9622
The war further escalated , as promised by a number of cartel messages in the region .	-7.1870
From the Bordstone Edge they released the news on the Riodoce website via mobile phone .	-3.1814
The front page had to be changed the next day .	-1.7740
Sirens close to the area - another shooting in the area .	-3.1831
Bojorquez threw a look at the policemen who held guard to see whether they were willing .	-2.8821
If they were afraid , they did not show it .	-2.2459
Under the enormous portrait of the founder of the newspaper , whose medium finger was visible for the whole of Sinaloa , Riodoce staff followed his traces .	-6.0424
" How can you only remember this , " said Bojorquez , " if on the same day when Javier was murdered , the internship asked me to send them to the reporting street . "	-3.7644
Dinosaur Used Carnival to Deviate the Enemies	-7.5497
At first glance , it looks like a statue , albeit an appalling one .    e      ee              .	-10.2771
Researchers have now found that the first knowledge of the incredible Nashorn of a Canadian miner worker has been maintained so well that experts have described it as " Mona Lisa of Dinosaurs " .	-3.3948
It was so good that they could even see that his scary skin was of reddish brown - and they said that she had had something of a ' unsettled past ' .	-4.1167
The report in the magazine ' Current Biology ' called it ' the best-preserved dinosaur ever found and one of the best dinosaur copies in the world ' .	-3.0673
The fossil is a newly discovered type of Nodosaurian who lived in the middle of crowd time between 110 million and 112 million years ago .	-3.0325
His incredibly well-preserved state has amazed researchers who describe it as ' remarkably ' .	-3.2213
According to reports in National Geographic , the plant fresher is the best preserved fossil of his kind .	-2.9131
It was found by Shawn Funk when he grubbed near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta , Canada on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millennium Mine .	-3.0910
He met something that seemed missing from the surrounding rock , and decided to see more accurately .                             	-6.6408
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paläontology .	-2.1237
They spent the next six years of detecting the wild animal within the 2,500 pound ( 1,100 kg ) heavy globe clumps .	-2.8491
After all this hard work , the ready result is now ready to be revealed .	-9.3904
" If you just blinch with the eyes , you might almost believe that it has sleeped , " said the main author Caleb Brown , scientists at the Royal Tyrrell Museum , where the creature is to be seen .	-3.6631
" It will go into science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur copies - the Mona Lisa of Dinosaurs . "	-3.1685
Researchers found that this plant herb , although it is covered with an armor and similar to a changing tank , was probably threatened by meat-eating dinosaurs .	-3.5910
The heavily tanked dinosaur used a red and white carnival to hide from predators and used a shielding technology known as a counter-shadow used by many modern animals as wel                             	-7.7813
This would have allowed better mixing itself into its environment , saying experts , which indicates that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs .	-3.7836
The 110 million years old creature from the family of the Nodosaurians has made headlines in May for the first time and is now seen in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology .	-3.3261
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and it called Borealopelta markmitchelli after the Museumstechniker Mark Mitchell , one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours to discover it carefully .	-3.4904
The amazing preservation of the copy enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and armor about his body .	-3.0113
They discovered the countershadow , a widespread defense method in animal wealth , meaning that the tip of creature was darker than its bottom .	-3.2189
Although countershadow is common , the results are surprising , as the size of Borealopelta exceeds far the animals living today .	-3.3717
It suggests that the dinosaur has been hunted by enough pressure by meat-forgiving dinosaurs that evolution favored the confrontation as a means of survival .	-3.9626
But most contemporary animals using countershadow - think of row , zebras or belt animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey , which signals that this Nodosaurian was exposed to a real battle for survival .	-3.8842
" Strong predator behavior on a massive , highly tanked dinosaur shows how dangerously the dinosaur predators of creature time have been , " said Brown .	-4.0892
The chemical analysis of organic connections in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was red brown .	-2.2117
Scientists continue to investigate the animal for information about his life , including his conserved content to find out what it has eaten as his last meal .	-3.7127
They believe that the dinosaur , when he died , was flown into a river and driven beyond the sea , where he declined on the back to the sea .	-3.7387
At this time , Alberta was as warm as South Florida today , and rivers and oceans probably disseminated much further than they are today .	-2.9031
" This nodosaur is really remarkable because it is completely covered with conserved skin , but also in three dimensions and maintains the original form of animal , " said Brown .	-3.4937
" The result is that the animal today looks almost as much as in the early crying time .	-5.2308
You do not need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it , and if you just turn a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that it is at the sleeping . '	-4.2893
The crowd time was a time when huge theropods , meat-eating dinosaurs that were on two legs permeated through the earth .	-3.8964
Although the king of them , who lived Tyrannosaurus Rex , millions of years to Borealopelta , the tanked dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrible ancestors .	-2.9706
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus , a 38-feet ( 11.5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monster .	-2.6860
The scientists whose latest findings appear in the Current Biology journal believe that Borealopelta was sinked after death in the sea and mumified in mud .	-3.4849
The creature was found by Shawn Funk , when he grubbed near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta , Canada on March 21 , 2011 in the Suncor Millennium Mine .	-3.0506
According to the museum , it is the best-preserved dinosaur in the world , including skin and armor , and is completely from the snow to the hip .	-3.2434
The creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,300 kg ) .                    e   e 	-6.6730
It contained two 20-inch long tips that raised from his shoulders .	-3.0691
Researchers believe that the plant fresher was flooded by the Western Canada until an overflooded river flooded it into the open sea .	-3.0021
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur preserved his armor in exquisite detail .	-2.6712
The astonished remains of this special copy are so well received that the skin remains still cover holy tank boards along the dinosaur .	-3.7660
As Michael Greshko has written for National Geographic , such a level of conservation is as ' rare as a profit in the lottery .     ' . ' T  's     ' . ' T 's  	-7.7488
The more I look at it , the more confusing it will .	-1.6491
The remains of the skin still cover the bright tank boards that carry the skull of the animal .                       	-7.8856
His right-wing foot is on his side , his five fingers are spread upwards .                                  	-9.1150

In the Thunder : Mass carambolage on A8 : Many injured	-2.0454
Heavy A8 accident on Thursday evening : Almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carambolage .	-2.6846
There are numerous injured , kilometre-long congestion - and gaffer .             a  s  .   	-8.2416
On the motorway Stuttgart-Munich ( A8 ) , about 20 people were injured in the late Thursday afternoon at a mass carambolage .                       	-6.4426
According to the first information of the police , at 5 p.m. between Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen ( Aichach-Friedberg district ) during a thunder almost 30 vehicles , including probably lorries , were interconnected .	-4.4761
The exact number of injured people has not initially provided any information .	-3.5527
It is easy to medium-sized injuries , a police speaker said .	-2.4634
A wide range of rescue vehicles was at the accident .	-9.6089
The A8 was fully closed to Munich .	-2.1392
In the direction of Munich , a roughly ten kilometres long rear traffic was formed .	-3.5310
As an AZ reporter reports , there were also massive disabilities on the counter-track - through numerous gaffer    .   e                   	-8.6775
The fire brigade listed the marks of the vehicle manufacturers who now have to expect sensitive penalties .	-3.6567
Shortly after 18 : 45 , a second accident occurred on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and Dasing .	-2.6555
There was a collision between a car transporter and a car .	-2.4566
A bailout helicopter was on the way to the accident .	-8.2319
Deutsche Bahn : Group tests " Comfort Check-in "	-1.4997
It is a moment that almost everyone has already experienced : nothing about sitting in the train and sleeping .	-3.3600
Or it is deepening into his work and has just a brilliant thought .	-3.3728
And then : pufff .	-1.4991
Comes the creator and wakes up an unsoft or tears the passenger in the middle of the workflow .	-3.8904
Ticket control .	-1.0287
But the times of interruptions are over soon .	-1.7652
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing ticket control .	-2.0620
You simply confirm by mobile that you take your place and thus devalue the ticket .	-3.2603
A test operation is currently running on two routes .	-2.3649
" If the offer arrives , we extend it .	-2.7864
It will probably be available at the beginning of next year on many other distance transport routes in Germany , " said a railway speaker .	-3.2295
" Comfort check-in " calls the train ticket devaluation without a sheeper .	-7.6253
In order to be able to use , however , some conditions must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .	-3.1579
And you have to book an online ticket - what most passengers already do .	-2.6610
You must also bought it via the app of the railway DB Navigator , which is the most comfortable way of booking tickets .	-6.2852
Finally , you need a seat reservation .	-1.9865
Because the " comfort check-in " works in this way : you get into the train , call its ticket under " My Tickets " .	-3.7598
A button for electronic devaluation appears at the test customers .	-2.9948
The train accompanies receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and has taken the booked seat Y .	-3.2967
If the train accompanies come to Platz Y , he knows that there is a passenger with already devalued online ticket .	-3.7972
So you can continue to sleep , continue working , let alone .	-6.9730
The " check-in " has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the railway - which in turn should use passengers .	-3.3024
" Those who want to travel without ticket control with our train accompanying staff simply check in the DB Navigator itself .	-3.5537
This allows passengers to make their travel time more personal , " says Michael Peterson , Marketing Board of DB distance transport .	-2.9925
Second plus : " And our employees have more time than today to meet individual customer needs " .	-2.6149
Anyone who travels often knows that besides delays and missed trains , train controls are one of the greatest troubles .	-3.9308
Because you often have yourself , but in any case one of the passengers does not have all the documents you need to devalue online tickets .	-3.8085
Either the credit card or personnel identification or a document you have to show .	-3.4345
The result is endless discussions between train accompanies and passengers , which leads to bad mood in the department or large area and delays in controlling their own ticket , and the creator at the end takes the time to take care of other concerns .	-4.3504
Only a small number of test customers can use the new service .	-2.0252
And this also only at ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart connections and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen    .	-6.1385
Further track numbers on the same route are not yet unlocked .	-2.6785
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question : ' Whose Streets ? '	-1.9001
On 9 August 2014 , Brittany Ferrell was shaken un its core .	-2.6384
Only one day after she arrived in New York City , sat on the bed of an Airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled by Facebook on her phone .	-3.3067
She stumbled over a post of someone from high school .	-2.1563
" The police have just killed a 18-year-old child , and it is still on the street , " it said there   .     T                   e a 	-7.9759
Confused because nobody else posted the information on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .	-2.3901
A user with Handle <unk> TheePharoah has been constantly retweeted on her timeline .	-2.4895
The rapper from St. Louis was in the process of killing the death of Michael Brown , an unarmed black 18-year-old killed by a white policeman in Ferguson , Mo . , live tweeting .	-3.5608
He posted an image of Brown ’ s liveless body , which was extended on the road and would remain four hours there .	-3.2076
'That 's wild ' , Ferrell thought himself .	-2.8588
But death was nothing new to them and their community .	-1.8728
She deposited her mobile phone to return later in the evening to tweets about people on the Canfield Drive .	-2.5111
There were photos of the police band and people who cry , and of a man who claimed to be Brown 's father , who wearing a sign with the scripture : ' Ferguson 's police just killed my unarmed son ! '	-7.7518
She observed a live feed where a policeman was in front of a group of demonstrators with a bad dog .	-3.0520
In a different video , she said , a different policeman resisted his gun and screamed : ' I will kill you ... Animals all . '	-3.9788
" This is not usual " , Ferrell remembered her statement .	-2.1120
" This is not the kind of murder that we have used to and which we can call the typical "     .     " .   T i w  " T i i	-11.0389
At this moment I felt shake frost .	-2.0838
I was angry and wined ' .	-2.0679
She booked a return flight and went home next day .	-1.7997
After the landing at 23 a.m. she collected her 6-year-old daughter from her father 's house and decided that the two would drive to Ferguson next morning .	-5.0798
What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the theme of a new documentary film , " Whose Streets ? " , in the cinemas from the 11th century .	-3.0931
It is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , the strength and resistance that consists of the people who live in the Community and filled the roads to demand answers .                                          	-8.1673
When Ferrell got to Ferguson with her daughter , who weared a flower dress and a suitable crown , the two discussed a conversation that they had countless times before this morning » about black experience and black state <unk> .	-3.8532
" You remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? " she remembered what she said .	-2.7763
" We are now going to Ferguson because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and that was not right .	-2.7961
I could not take it with it , " said Ferrell later .	-2.2365
" What happened today is a culmination of what happened in the past ... What happened in the past .	-3.9784
It must be known and seen and raised in it .	-2.6796
It must be well developed , not only activism and organisation , but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution , and what we must do to become free to liberate ourselves .	-2.8748
Although I have the good fortune to give her an experience where she personally does not experience a blatant racism , she is no longer different from the next black women 's child .	-3.7676
I have the feeling that I would prove to her a bad service to keep them o              . '	-4.5061
The first station when they arrived in Ferguson was at South Florissant Road , a place towards the police authority , which became a camp area when activists waited for the possible non-charge of Officer Darren Wilson .	-7.6633
Ferrell and her daughter connected themselves with a local business holder who made lunch .	-3.1285
They prepared bags and helped to pass them on demonstrators .	-2.1915
Slowly a new type of activism began to accept Ferrell Form .	-2.5582
" My activism has changed totally after 9 August , " she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nourses Association and focused on eating justice and health inequalities in black communities .	-3.5153
" I had no experience in organizing .	-1.5043
Everything has happened . '	-1.6035
Weeks later , Ferrell met one of the co-directors of the film during an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan .	-2.4174
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to " document " what happened .	-2.0443
One question came Ferrell in mind : ' Do you want to document or try to find a story that you can exploit ? '	-2.7713
This scepticism was fed by countless cases of people , often by whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance .	-2.8977
As Folayan recently said in an interview : ' We had heard that people born and grown up in Ferguson did not center their voices and we wanted to do it differently ' .	-3.2031
Folayan had already worked with then co-director Damon Davis , an artist from the area known for his activism around death rock occupants .	-3.2131
His commitment brought Ferrell closer the project , along with six other locals followed the team of " Whose Streets ? " in the years of Brown 's shooting .	-3.2722
" This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us .	-2.4240
" That was the main thing for me , as these people are presented , because that is how I will be presented . "	-3.2730
The aim was not to focus on Ferrell 's experience - to show that the movement " is not a Messias leader , but a community that meets " , said Folayan - she proved to be the most open participant in the film .	-3.5393
As a result , documents from " Whose Streets ? " surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell 's life show how she is loving and her wife marries .	-5.6825
" I felt like naked , " said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time .	-2.1333
" But I understood that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanisation of black people . "	-2.6837
Furthermore , Ferrell ’ s history repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black-Lives matter movement .	-5.7866
Two of the three founders of the movement , which , after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 , identified the film " BlacklivesMatter " in social media .	-3.2155
" Black , gay women in management positions have borne the movement as a whole , " said Ferrell , " so we are constantly fighting on various fronts .	-2.8587
Black , gay women must bear the main burden of all ' .	-5.3250
Folayan agreed to note that " the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women " .	-2.2169
However , she insists that " this is not an affirmative type of action " , where Ferrell was selected as the heart of the film because of her identity .	-3.0552
" She was the person who upheld this energy , " she said .	-2.2003
" It is no coincidence , although she was on the front , because in a life of these crossings as a black , gay woman stands so much at stake in                    	-5.4849
You can feel their energy through the screen ' .	-1.9695
Meanwhile , the news cameras in Ferguson have long disappeared , but the racial connections between the community and the police remai                 	-5.3562
Ferrell is on proven for 2 <unk> years because of blocking a motorway at a demonstration .	-2.7463
She describes the social political atmosphere of the area that she calls her home : " A chaos " .	-2.7446
Nevertheless , she is clinging to singing and she feels committed to this memory since she went on the streets in Ferguson three years ago .	-3.9001
" It is our duty to fight for our freedom .	-1.2167
It is our duty to win .	-1.2873

From " Dream " to " Size Magnificence " : TV readers discuss bit gallery	-2.6062
The bit gallery moves people , although it is far from built .	-2.4472
But the idea of a shopping centre at the southern pedestrian zone has divided the population into advocates and opponents since the first presentation of 2009 .	-2.8414
Cold leaves the subject hardly a one .	-6.9666
The subject is also discussed on our Facebook page " Popular Friend Bitburg " .	-2.6153
While one says to the bit gallery : " This would be a dream " ( Anja Becker ) or " That would be really class " ( Nicole Shows ) , comes from the other side : " Do not human " ( Siggi Betzen ) or quite simply : " Size made ! " ( Lars Scholz ) .	-4.2719
While the supporters build on a gallery drawing more customers to the city , which also benefits the other shops , opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding .	-3.8585
Additionally , the gallery is planned exactly on the plot on which the farmer market hall stands , in which 13 direct marketers offer their products              	-5.5369
This will conclude with the beginning of the construction work                     	-6.9814
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to Beda-Platz with opportunity to sit outside .	-3.3819
Simone Rooms : " We have been buying almost weekly in the farm market hall for many years .	-2.7200
Mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of land women are always very happy again .	-3.4950
We have also discovered the butchery for u    .	-3.1304
We would like there to be an opportunity to maintain this offer during and above all after the construction of the gallery .  W    wo       w                  	-8.6158
In other cities there are also .	-6.4336
In particular , the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting .             	-4.7400
Gerd Densing : " Whether direct marketers are located in a market hall in the gallery , the height of the rent is at the height of the rent .	-4.4311
However , the new project should not be low . '	-2.8957
Eva Kilic : " Why shopping palaces in Bitburg ?	-1.7291
Whether clothing , shoes , drugs or supermarkets : I find that unnecessary .	-2.6649
There is enough of this in our city .	-2.1082
You see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .	-2.8002
But , as there is not even a proper weekly market here , it is all the more important that we remain the market hall at least .	-3.2017
After all , the goods offered there are fresh , largely directly offered by the producer and is also cheap .	-3.2249
As you can see , loading shops are rented in a shopping centre only by larger companies , because they are often unacceptable for a retailer .	-3.8250
Pity , special transactions are almost no longer available and what is still left of this will probably disappear . '	-4.0893
Wolf Fandel : " A shopping centre with a market hall does not match me .	-8.2212
And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg .	-1.5784
Most importantly , where is the farmers market hall to go during the construction time           	-5.3937
The old Edeka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery comes at some point .	-9.6385
Or does the Ghost Bit Gallery manage to distribute all shops from Bitburg in advance ? '                 	-5.6479
George Marquet : " This will simply not work .	-1.4451
And a shopping center that stands empty does not need anyone .	-2.5522
I believe it would have been better to promote a real farmers market instead of this gallery .	-2.5576
But there is no place for a farmers ' market hall thanks to the madness of many - I think - pointless construction projects in Bitburg .	-3.9020
If the farmers ' market hall is broken , a piece of culture will disappear again ' .	-2.6648
One suitable similarity : Artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA	-5.1610
In the middle of the Fridman Gallery in New York , many faces are to be seen - white , black and brown , which are almost imperceptible - which depend on cables on the ceiling .	-3.7007
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg made of cheekboards and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manni                                           	-9.7991
Manning sent the excerpts from the prison Fort Leavenworth , where the former intelligence service analyst sent a 35-year-old prison punishment after making public diplomatic news on the WikiLeaks website secretly classified .	-7.1265
The new exhibition opened on August 2nd is called A Becoming Resemblance ( A suitable similarity ) .	-2.6329
She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg , whose discipline united her professional competence in technology , computer sciences and art , and manning , a transfer and dissident whose condemnation was converted by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office .	-3.7393
Dewey-Hagborg has been sharpened by the algorithmic analysis of the DNA extracted by manning and created from 30 portraits , as someone could look at these genomic data , even if something intellectual comment not only to the formability of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also to identity .	-4.4879
Manning , born as Bradley Edward , but has already spoken openly since her puberty about identification as a woman , was condemned in 2013 because of 20 charges , including six infringements of the Spy Act , computer fraud and theft .	-3.5650
By prison , their picture was suppressed , so much that there was only one photo - a black and white self in which manning is visibly uncomfortably sitting on a driver seat and bearing a platinblond piece - with which she was associated .	-5.0353
In 2015 , Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of her 2012 project ' Stranger Visions ' .	-2.2945
The artist produced portraits of strangers from Forensic artifacts such as cigarette stumble and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from waste to produce an image of how these people could look like .	-3.6311
This was the time she received an email from a newspaper magazine .	-6.2555
" They led an interview with Chelsea Manning , while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , " explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition .	-3.0651
And she could not be visited at this time and she could not be photographed , so you contacted Chelsea and asked whether she wanted to make a DNA portrait .	-3.3094
The artist and her imprisoned museums became unequal letter friends who exchanged several letters over two years .	-3.0771
They even created a comic " Suppressed Images " illustrated by Shoili Kanungo , which predicted a future in which President Chelsea 's judgment would be able to see the exhibition personally .	-3.2218
That Obama really would only a few days after the book was published , manning ’ s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas , was a welcome kind of happy meeting .	-3.2762
There is now something deep and strong when the exhibition is opened , because Donald Trump is waging informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new , viable ways to flame the rigid divisions that he should actually fix .	-4.6435
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things , she said that " things happen for a particular reason " .	-4.4917
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , manning called for an end to the " automatic fragmentation whose foundation has been gender , race , sexuality and culture " in their family name . "	-4.1326
On the opposite wall , its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand feet of Cs and Gs and As , is written in pencil .	-8.1536
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by including the 200 letters ( or nucleotides after the advanced scientific lexicon of the artist ) , as amazingly similar , at least in biological terms , we are all .	-2.9908
" What people will hopefully take with it is that our genome does not take care of who we are and how open genetic data for interpretation and how subjective they are , " said Dewey-Hagborg , whose video work of 2007 , Spurious Memories , is also t                          	-5.7364
" DNA data can tell so many different stories , so these are 30 of these stories . "	-2.5271
The last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in its own room , is a site from the above mentioned comic novella .	-3.3894
It shows manning how it appears in the hands with an open-air phone from the United States disciplinary barracks such as King-Kong .	-3.9251
" When they cold your speech , they have won , " says .	-3.0932
'So never keep the mouth ' .	-1.9863
" It came directly from a letter she wrote to me , " said the artist who greets from Philadelphia .	-2.3789
'I still get goose skin when I talk about it ' .	-2.5978
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition personally - as it was predictably anticipated in the comic book - but if it should do it , it will be welcomed by the masks in the middle of the space , by their own genomic simulacres , which are combined with hordes of protesters .	-4.6297
This was also targeted , like everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 " 2 , mannings stature ) where their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil .	-3.3159
" In the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted to feel like a human amount , " said Dewey-Hagborg of the portraits .	-2.7331
" I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed itself with Chelsea , like the movement that was behind its liberation . "	-3.1060
Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of the University of Oxford so                	-5.6154
A country-wide hunting is under way for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of the University of Oxford , who are seeking as suspects after a man had been suspended in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries .	-8.7430
On Monday , Wyndham Lathem ( 42 ) and Andrew Warren ( 56 ) arrest warrants were issued for murder because of their alleged participation in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau , as the acts of the Court of Office show .	-3.4854
The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau , 26 , died after several stitches .	-2.0506
A Community warning system published by the Chicago Police Authority states that the body was discovered on 27 July .	-2.1493
Officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza apartments and found the victim with several injuries on his body .	-2.5381
Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead at the place of events , and detectives examine the stiffs as murder , while the police actively seek for the two suspects , said officials .	-3.6875
Lathem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007 .	-2.1903
Alan K. Cubbage , the Vice-President of University Relations , said in an email statement that Lathem had now been approved and excluded from the entering of the Northwestern University campus .	-3.1511
" This is now a criminal issue being examined by the competent authorities , and Northwestern University cooperates in this investigation , " said Cubbage .	-3.0248
Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford .	-1.3984
A speaker from the University and the Somerville College said in an email explanation that ' we are in contact with the police in Britain and are prepared to help the US investigation authorities in every way ' .	-3.4561
The statement added that Warren 's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to face up .	-2.7465
Chief Communications Officer of the Police Authority of Chicago , Anthony Guglielmi , said he strongly urged the suspects to face up to the authorities .	-2.8230
" The police have an idea of their stay , and our efforts to localize them are increasing , " said Guglielmi .	-2.9208
Guglielmi said that local , regional and national authorities help find suspects .	-5.5509
Guglielmi said that the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building , which had just received a puzzling tip , which said that something happened in the apartment of 1008 .	-3.4050
The police described the scene as very cruel .	-1.2759
Guglielmi said it is unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July .	-2.0857
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building .	-2.1534
" We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship , " said Guglielmi .	-1.7535
The Grand Plaza management team published an explanation to the inhabitants : ' The police are currently working on the time axis and the background of the victim and exploring a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident ' .	-3.4406
" We will conclude the WADA roadmap in the near future " - Russian Vice-Premier Mutko	-2.4339
The Russian Vice Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that it will not take long for the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) to restore the Russian Anti-Doping Agency ( RUSADA ) .	-2.8967
" At a particular stage in the fulfilment of the criteria of the roadmap , RUSADA has received the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD ( UK Anti-Doping ) .	-6.7480
The WADA timetable was updated in this respect , " explained Mutko on Thursday .	-2.3649
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA roadmap to comply with the code describing the criteria for the reinstatement of RUSADA and recently published on the Organization website .	-3.2384
According to Mutko , he does not contain anything that could give rise to concern to Russi .              	-5.6581
" Everything has been announced , everything is implemented .	-1.7863
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and WADA in the near future , " he added .	-2.0939
However , one of the criteria mentioned in the list notes that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on alleged government-sponsored dopings in Russian sport .	-3.5374
With regard to the matter , Mutko said : " We carry out the investigation because our anti-doping system has acknowledged a mistake .	-2.9913
All measures have been implemented .	-1.3776
But there were no state programmes and we will not admit something that does not exist . '	-2.4478
Mutko 's words agreed with those of Vitaly Smirnov , the head of the Independent Russian Anti-Doping Commission .	-4.5508
In conversation with Russian sales office RSport at the beginning of the day , Smirnov added problems to the past in Russian anti-doping organisations , but then added : ' We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .	-3.4187
Nobody intends to accept this report unconditionally , ' added Smirnov .	-2.0677
In November 2015 , RUSADA was excluded from the implementation of doping controls in Russia in   t   of      W A  s    sc  .	-10.1183
However , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping ( UKAD ) .	-2.3889
After a visit to the main quarter of the organization in Moscow in July , WADA Director-General Olivier Niggli declared that RUSADA is moving in the right direction " to be                                          	-8.5741

Amy Srett wanted to measure the luck with your e-commerce startup , but the surveys did not work .	-2.8307
Answers were often vague , little helpful or even worse - fraudulent .	-2.1714
And even if you promised anonymity , some workers did not drive the process .	-2.3810
" There has just never been consistency and objectivity , " said Errett , who operates the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care company Madison Reed .	-2.9752
She has called people from outside for help .	-1.9006
A new breed of Human Resources Start-ups is in growth to help companies find out how their employees feel .	-2.8282
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee commitment , it allows companies to carry out surveys , address special groups and demographic groups , offer employees anonymity and complaint hotlines , and in some cases Whistleblowern allows to circumvent the C Suite leaders and turn directly to the Board of Directors .	-4.2933
" You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for pursuing their health , but where is the fitbit for your company ? " said Jim Barnett , co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employees commitment .	-3.3059
Saved said that they won a better insight into what your employees think and feel with Glint in the three years .	-2.9356
In addition to the snap surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which executives have low consent results - so you can drill why .	-4.0427
Companies come to recognize that at the top of job culture must remain , so that you do not become the next uber involved in scandals since a former employee released a blog post describing an environment of harassment in which those who have spoken have been punished .	-4.4907
For start-ups like Glint , this desire is a lucrative business opportunity .	-8.9979
Global governance , regulation , and compliance industry could have more than $ 118.7 billion value in 2020 , according to Let 's Talk Payments financial technical website              .             	-6.4493
Denver , Colorado , Start-up Convercent , which helps companies prevent and recognize bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of the ubercase in discredit .	-3.2301
Convercent has almost 600 clients , including Airbnb , Microsoft and Tesla .	-1.5379
Uber hat sich rezem als Klient angem .	-7.8206
Like Glint , Convercent companies send tailor-made " pulse " surveys , collect confidential responses in real time and view the heat cards of your problem areas .	-8.3901
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that employs bad behavior .	-2.6029
And if the main manager is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .	-2.3087
" The court of public opinion covered the regulators , " said Patrick Quinlan , the founder and managing director of Convercent .	-2.6136
If a company is found that treats its employees poorly or is unethically behaving , it can experience costly consequences by consumer boycott , worker fluctuation , and complaints , said Quinlan .                                            	-8.5095
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations , has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have a simple opportunity to achieve their corporate headquarters .	-3.3281
Previously , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the corporate centre , submit a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously .	-3.2700
It was often an intimidation and inconvenient experience , said James Vitrano , Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel , who said that there was no good way to follow the complaints of employees .	-4.5628
Now that the company uses Convercent can hide problems previously identified and addressed by leaders in cities or countries , such as discrimination , harassment or unfair practice .	-3.6490
" I can get closer to this holistic 360-degree view in experience with employment , " said Vitrano , who leads the Risk Management Group of Ruby Tuesday .	-3.0923
'And we protect our shareholders from employment disputes ' .	-1.7787
Companies began to take ethics , values , and employee commitment in 2002 more seriously after the accounting company Arthur Andersen collapsed for ethical infringements by the Enron scandal , Quinlan said .	-3.2797
But it took until the " social media came to their right " that companies recognized that you could not prevent their dirty laundering online .	-2.9624
" Before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , " he said .	-1.9890
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service , and burden companies with recurring charges for the use of their produc .                                          	-10.0228
It is a business model and an opportunity to find the approval of Venture Capital Investors that have supported both start- u                	-5.7109
Convercent received $ 10 million in financing in February of companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital , which increased the entire capital to $ 47 million .	-3.0477
Glitzern secured $ 10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners and brought all the financing to $ 60 million           .                	-6.2179
These investments are hardly surprising , given the networked nature of companies , culture and venture capital .	-2.4229
There is an increasing complex of research that shows that today ’ s employees expect more from their jobs than they have been .                      e a      	-8.6186
In competitive markets like Silicon Valley , high salaries and interesting projects are only operations .	-2.5955
The employees want the feeling that you are accepted and esteemed and that you give your time a company with a positive mission .	-2.9432
" If people are glad to be in a company that belongs to their voices , and that the work you are doing is worthwhile , they feel more committed to making this company successful , " said Nina McQueen , Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn , which uses both Convercent and Glint .	-3.5806

Important data on employee engagement according to experts in job culture .	-2.9515

Indeed , when a company asks employees about your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the w                  	-5.5727

" If you are asking about 4,000 suggestions , you must be prepared to have 4,000 discussions " , said Russell Raath , President of Consulting at the business management company Kotter International , who has seen companies that have relied too much on collectin da    .                                   	-7.3082
" Because if you will not follow employees ask , " Have ye really heard me ?	-5.8752
Do you take care of this ?	-1.7155
And if you do not take care of why should I ? '	-2.5285
Madison Reed , who is now carrying out monthly staff polls , has been able to take measures on the same day when a problem is being reported about Glint , so S  S                 	-5.8377
And , following the collection of feedback by frustrated employees , it was able to reorganize several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems by th speed of decision-making and quality of communication .	-3.9281
At Ruby Tuesday , the company has always received new insights about the employees , and in the long term it hopes that this will lead to a better binding of workers in an industry known for high revenues .	-4.3638
" If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , " said Vitrano .	-1.9495
" And if you lose people , you also lose customers .	-1.7963

NCAA Eliminates Two-Day Practices and Makes a Long Day for Bruins	-2.6521
It is accepted at 23 p.m. when a lot of UCLA football players on one side of the new training fields of the team entertain on the    c .	-8.4123
Some have extracted their tricoto parts and show the back full of weld from the first day of the training camp .	-2.9071
For a good part of the team , these inactive minutes are a lunch break .	-2.2500
Players who are incorporated into the summer courses will return to their final checks after the three-hour exercise before returning to the Waterman Football Center next morning at 6 : 30 a                      	-6.0172
" This is a real mill for the boys the next three days , " said Bruins-Trainer Jim Mora just before Monday became Tuesday .	-2.9045
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to facilitate the burden of players , and it has actually extended its days - at least until the final o  F          . A             ee  e	-7.8154
Therefore , the first three UCLA trainings should start at 19 : 15 to meet the already packed timetables of players .	-3.5403
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the bruins moved the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and for the first time during the summer school , during Moras , six playing times in Westwood .	-3.9174

Mora said that he supported the NCAA regulation even if they add another point to the multi-employed routes of players .	-3.1983
" We put this huge burden on them three or four days , and it is very challenging , " said Mora .	-4.7821
" And they simply pressed it , they plack on , they are great people .	-2.6915
I think it will be great as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time . '	-2.7041
UCLA will end its practices as soon as the camp ends , which will not be an easy task in view of the clear views of its fields by an adjacent car park and the adjacent Luskin Center , a hotel of the upper class that has already been accused of footballs that cleared a protective network behind a gate post .	-10.8809
Bruins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mora admitted that there could be a problem once these rooms are free during the season .	-3.0601
" We will use our security , " said Mora .	-1.9426
" This is a real problem , and it is not far recovered to think that people rent a room there and then stop recording an exercise there .	-3.5185
If you have the video band of an exercise , it is quite good business .	-2.5989
But we have security forces there and we have security forces in parking 8 .	-2.1873
We will do the best with what we have .	-1.4805
I am therefore not very concerned about it .	-2.2316
We have a plan . '	-1.1919
Facebook wants to intensify fact review in the fight against fake messages	-2.2596
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false reports to third parties ' facts checkers and their results under the original contribution then , said the world 's largest online social network on Thursday .	-10.1028
The company said in an opinion on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to recognize possible false reports and send them to fact verifiers who may show results of the fact test from the original article .	-3.9485
Facebook was criticised as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news , many of which believe that they also affected US presidential elections in 2016 .	-2.7597
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with French voters being flooded with false stories in the run-up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan to punish social media networks if they do not succeed in removing hate-fulfilled postings such as the September elections .	-4.0119
On Thursday , Facebook said in a separate explanation in German that in the USA , France , the Netherlands , and Germany a test of the new fact review will be launched .	-5.4673
" In addition to the knowledge of the stories of facts reviewers of third parties , people want more context to take sound decisions about what they read and share , " said Sara Su , product manager for Facebook news in a blog .	-3.5232
She added that Facebook will continue to test his feature to the " connecting article " and work on other changes to his message feed to reduce wrong news .	-2.9523
Creating a Comic Novel : A Castle in the History of England	-1.8468
In his recent past , the small Scotney Castle was in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s .	-2.7979
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cosy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become an inspiration for a graphical novel of Jamie Rhodes , a mophaired Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents .	-3.4213
" I find it so beautiful to look at the manuscript of someone who has been dead for 300 years , " he says humble .	-2.8053
'What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand ' .	-1.9122
'A Castle in England ' reveals the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scotney .	-3.2874
It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive : he wrote ' Dead Men 's Teeth and Other Stories ' in 2014 , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly emotional                     	-4.9136
" I responded only to the thumb printing on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700s who worked for the Jacobines , " he says .	-3.1504
" That is his thumb print !	-1.9869
And letters always smoke , because at that time they ignited a fire because of the light .	-2.9421
For someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he were himself .	-2.4286
Oh , I love archives ! '	-1.5053
For someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and Arts Council England and lived in a castle nearly four months ( " To be honest : I have my welcome salute a little overvalued " ) seems to be all too beautiful to be true .	-3.9306
Rhodos spent his days with exploring the Victorian " new " castle , seeing the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle , such as the assembled hyene heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the digging .	-4.0057
He migrated through the area and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape carers , gardeners and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his bo .          e                e    	-7.9234
Then , at night he drank " Whiskey and began to write " .	-1.9228
The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown , because the National Trust received full access only in 2006 when the last erbin , Elizabeth Hussey , died .	-4.4158
When Rhodes arrived a decade later , the employees just began to take care of the archive he described as " hundreds of years in which aristocrats said " Oh , threw it on the roof floor " .	-3.7587
Diaries , letters from the time of English Empire , cards that present who owned what : " You might think that country conflicts would be boring , " says Rhodes , " but there was a birch to fight two families .	-3.7203
Guys , let everything go ! '	-5.8963
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive into English history on a broader basis , including ' The Labourer ' , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the farmers ' uprising of 1381        .	-4.2705
" There is a record of an uprising that occurred in 1380 in the castle , in this book with the title ' Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex ' , says Rhodes .	-2.8468
" The farmers uprising began in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start .	-2.5552
Perhaps the two are connected ? '	-7.4311
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like ' The Priest ' , which tells the history of the Jesuit Pater , which the Darrell family hid for seven years during English reformation .	-3.1010
Or ' The Smuggler ' , where Schmuggler Arthur Darrell was presented from the 18th century , who staged his own death by filling a concern with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later than his concern was excavated ) .	-4.0036
The darrells are Rhodes ' favorite family of Scotney : ' The gentlemen seemed to be quite gaunters , constantly make debt and spend money on things they could not afford .	-3.7567
Other generations of Darrell men resolved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I present them as a cluster of well-looking boys , with a talent to advertise ' .	-3.1534
After the end of his use in the castle , Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences	-2.5458
He brought a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämänmäki , the site of a sanatorium from the early 20th century , which has since been recalled back from nature .	-3.8379
But Scotney has a special place for him .	-1.3884
" I was sad to go again , " he said .	-1.6580
It was like : ' Oh , now I have to cope with the condemned life ' .	-2.6284
Launched campaign : Over 300 years old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf covere               	-6.0272
With the coverage of the 301 years old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf , the city of Bad Honnef launched its campaign to introduce a new umbrella ( Thursday Roof ) .	-3.6022
Until Thursday , mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and the slogan secret .	-2.6123
At the end of August there should be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth as the highlight of the campaign .	-2.9431
'Too beautiful for us .	-1.4746
Or ? " , ask the makers of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rhöndorf Chapel .	-4.8280
" We do not really think that ( of course ! ) , write them on their website yesterday .	-6.9091
" But we use this measure to gain your attention .                  	-6.4842
And to make it clear that something is better than it seems .	-1.6642
Basically , we firmly believe that we , as a Bad Honnefer , know citizens about the beauty and attractiveness of our city .                  	-5.7155
The action is more than " just " a logo and a slogan , it continues .	-3.0775
" We must formulate a single promise , one that gives the city a distinctive characteristic of single attitude " .	-3.7091
Finally , they are in competition with other municipalities .	-2.0501
The city of Bad Honnef can cost its new rooftop brand and campaign .	-3.0001
Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan ’ s Fear of the Army	-1.4886
Every year in early August , Ankara advises the Supreme Military Council ( YAS ) on pensioning and transportation in the Officer Scorps                       	-6.1357
So this week too .	-1.9286
At first glance a normal process .	-1.5793
But nothing is routine among the Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt .	-4.9226
The meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff , as before , but at the headquarters of the Prime Minister .	-2.9052
Under the chairmanship of the Head of Government , the five Vice-Prime Ministers and the Ministers of Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs now participated in th  debate .             e  a	-6.2099
That was the civilians in the YAS .	-10.7381
The government attracts the military reins .	-9.0237
Head of Staff General Hulusi Akar remains in office , but the commanders of the army , the air forces , and the navy were deposited .	-3.5335
Since the failed coup , leader Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals .	-2.4325
More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the series of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the exile preacher Fethullah Gülen , which Erdogan sees as a wire drawer of the coup attempt .	-4.1947
Negotiations have been negotiated against 486 people who have been directly involved in the coup attempt .	-3.3245
Even on the day after the coup , Erdogan called the conversion attempt as " God 's present " , because he gave him the opportunity to clean the forces " completely " .	-4.4622
But does Erdogan really handle the army ?	-1.6243
At the end of February , the newspaper " Hürriyet " published an article with the heading " Uneagen in the military headquarters " .	-2.6428
In the general staff there are concerns about an increasing " Islamisation " of the army , which , among other things , manifest itself in the lifting of the headscarf ban for soldiers , wrote the newspaper .	-3.9569
In any case , the large purification of the army and the security forces continues .  A              e       	-8.9781
In mid-July , Erdogan fired another 7395 servants , including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers .	-2.9311
It seemed that Erdogan tamed the military .	-1.7429
The generals were considered earlier than the real masters of the country .	-2.7208
Three times , they called for their role as guardians of secular state order .	-3.0989
After his election victory in 2002 , Erdogan urged the military ’ s power back step by step , not least invoking the European Union ’ s reform provisions .	-3.3946
Former officers say that Erdogan is specifically pushing forward an Islamicization of the forces .	-5.1415
In the magazine " Vocal Europe " , a roll-called non-mentioned officer , who seeked asylum for fear of persecution abroad , warned that the Turkish army will be " full of extremists and salafists " in a fe                                            	-8.9781
True , such a development could not leave NATO cold .	-2.6276
In any case , there is doubt about the willingness of the Turkish army in the alliance to clean up .	-5.6114
The leadership structures and operational skills are " weakened " , say NATO diplomats .	-1.9582
Washington Changes the Green Card	-1.4240
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , President Donald Trump , quoted by the media .	-2.0131
It provides for legal immigrants to reduce to 50,000 per year , stricter rules for the obtainment of visas for temporary work permits and restrictions on family-oriented visas .	-3.2766
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President .	-1.7031
The draft bill is to be discussed in the two Chambers of Congress .	-2.4660
" This law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers , and will do so by changing the way in which citizens from other countries will spend Green Cards . "	-3.1807
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .	-1.5544
This new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English , who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , " said Trump , quoted by the American media .	-2.8828
Ministry wants to renovate routes for racing shuttle	-3.0397
Over time and again in recent months , the future of the racing shuttle has been disputed - now it should be quick .	-4.0865
Before the end of the year , the marode route on which the tourist train leaves should be built .	-4.1298
In order to safeguard the future of the racing shuttle in the long term , construction work should begin this year , according to the Ministry of Transport .	-3.7527
" With the decision to continue ordering and renovating the route of Ilmenau-Rennsteig , the country commits itself to this important connection , especially for tourism , " declared transport secretary Klaus Sühl on Friday i E                 	-5.7605
The cost of repairing the route was about EUR 2.5 million .     1  m      2  m .           	-6.4510
Of this amount , the country takes over 75 %  .	-2.4325
The contract on which the shuttle should also be ordered by the country in the future is currently being finally agreed , declared sou    .	-4.0418
The Ministry and South Thuringia as an operator are already agreed on technical details .	-2.5382
" This is the roadmap , the vehicles used and the quality standards negotiated , " said Sühl .	-3.1961
The planned contract between the Ministry and the Railway Company is concluded for a duration of 11 years .	-2.5757
This will regularly order the racing shuttle on December 2017 .	-2.9570
The Rennsteig-Shuttle is an especially popular rail connection between Ilmenau and Rennsteig trains       .           T ' i t  '       	-9.6410
In recent months , a pilot operation has been tested whether the route is used by sufficiently many people to order it regularly in the future .	-3.3871
The route is also heavily running in parts .	-2.6902
The Rise of Sex Robots is Real , and We Should Be Concerned	-6.0200
Just when you thought that it cannot become more crazy in 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots comes .	-2.7987
Yes , indeed .	-1.2673
Sex robots are currently a big thing .	-1.6903
Recently , the Foundation for Responsible Robotics ( Foundation for Responsible Robotics ) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years .	-2.3173
According to Noel Sharkey , emeritated professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR , we must start taking their rise seriously .	-2.6780
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its form of the breastwart and type of fingernail nail            	-4.5965
" People are funny about them , but companies are providing a lot of this and we will get them much more often , " said Mr Sharkey in publishing his new report .	-4.0933
Modern sex dolls have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warmly - with consciously human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence .	-5.9845
The user can adjust his robot according to his beliefs " and select everything from the eye color of the robot to the form of breast warts to the type or color of his fingernails .	-4.1028
But it will become even more worrying , as many robots have the " personalities " that would leave a Stepford woman progressively .	-5.3578
Modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with a silicone skin                	-5.7719
The RealBotix robot , for example , allows its users to adapt their robots to the characteristics they find appealingly such as shy     .	-6.7049
And then there are the Roxxxy Gold Sex robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as " Frigid Farrah " , which gives the impression of shythesis and " Wild Wendy " with a " adventurous " personality      .	-8.3198
" Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is as good as possible adapted to your personality , " warms the True Companion website .	-2.9223
So she likes what you like , and she does not like what you do , etc .	-2.3700
She also has her moods during the day - like real people !	-2.7561
It can be tired of being fixed on conversation or it can be ' in mood '          '	-5.4605
There are many disturbing aspects of this rise in sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subject female characteristics , the allusions to rape when you take a step towards Frigid ( meaning : reluctant ) Farrah , worry one most .	-4.5066
On his website compared True Companion Roxxy with a vibrator , but for men .	-2.0731
" If women ( sic ) can have a vibrator , why can men then have no Roxxxy ? " is there on the site .                      ee           e	-9.8172
However , these sex robots are not just a fetish or just hold another sex toy .	-2.6617
Their emergence and their increasing refinements point to something darker and deeper in our culture , a withdrawal from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition .	-3.5224
Most men will , of course , not keep sex robots , and while the FRR notes its rising popularity , they will nonetheless remain at the edge of consumer culture .	-3.6958
But what is transferred from the marginal zones can be very teaching in terms of the spirit of the time we live .	-5.6094
And many people are not strange or insulting until they give the free market the permission to do so .	-2.6692
There is a certain overlap that these advanced sex robots are appearing at a time when women 's rights are threatened worldwide , in which there is a President in the White House who has praised to have sexually attacked women .	-4.1118
The most deterrent aspect of the TV series ' The Handmaid 's Tale ' ( ' The Report of the Magd ' ) is not the graphical images , the devastated bodies and the eyes that have been brought out , but how realistically this vision works                . ' T 's     	-7.0785
The Republic of Gilead is a jump , but at the moment it does not feel like a great jump .       I                           	-8.7112
The aim behind these sex robots is to produce a physical similarity to actual women as realistically as technically possible ( albeit with pornostar proportions ) .	-2.6156
Their builders want themselves to feel human that they are imitating the movement of a real body .	-3.3220
But , when it comes to ' personalities ' , the robots are not real women .	-2.4163
They cannot separate from their companion or simply go away .  T              e             	-9.6000
They have no mediation or background history , nothing that indicates independence or anything that could disrupt the imagination of total subjugation .	-3.2328
In other words , they are complete slaves .	-1.4109
Or to express it in the 2017 speech : Service Girls	-2.2339
Trump ’ s Great Performance ?	-1.3867
He Makes Mitt Romney t the Inclusion of Common Sense	-2.6251
It has become a wisdom of the Trump era that the political divisions polarized by the US electorate have also divided families in small format .	-3.0067
Around Christmas and Harvesting Festival , there were newspapers in the US with advice about how to deal with the horror of Trump elected relatives .	-7.7480
We are all supposedly strict to place our filter bubbles .	-2.8369
Less noted has been Trump ’ s power to bring families together .	-2.1243
I mention this because my cousine , a left-wing poet living in Chicago , has long been dealing with the Republicans in our family this week in New York .	-3.0054
She reminded me that unity can have a powerful effect against a common enemy .	-2.0495
With Trump in the White House , everyone it knows , including the Republican relationship with which it had fought for decades for politics , is suddenly and strangely on the same side .	-3.4016
This is certainly a good thing around the dining table , but it strikes me in another context that this also has significant risks .	-3.7582
The Left has been strengthened by Trump , but the disappearing effect of his presidency has the strength to push us all to the right .	-3.1037
When we talk about ' normalization ' and Trump , we are referring to the grussing possibility that his girls will no longer be cast off .	-4.5177
However , there is an even more appalling long-term scenario in which Trump normalizes Republicans of the right wing , who suddenly appear to be reasonable compared to his standards .	-3.4373
Today , I find myself affected by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney ’ s urcomic version of the crazy – the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax declaration looked like ) – which , in fact , happened to a very mild crime compared to Trump .	-6.8169
When Trump goes , the next candidate of the Republicans must only be mentally healthy to qualify themselves as an improvement .	-3.0675
When my cousin was in the city , we brought our children to the Carousell in the Central Park , the largest of the New York park department , and the best three dollars that can be spent in the city if you do not need a caffeine .	-3.5692
The horses are enormous , the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are cruel and the animals twist to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climpering music conveys this in a strange way .	-4.1124
So many clichés of a city disappoint : the views of high buildings are old , the skylines are familiar to offer a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city is not just the dream .	-3.5112
Thirty-five years later , and I am still not entirely over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a large roundabout in northern London .	-3.4243
However , the Central Park Karussell is still a strange magical experience , because here two years , a 11-year-old and two women can go to this in the 40 's and all have a great time .	-5.8034
If I had been able to evaluate the carousel , I would have given him the full number of points , but fortunately nobody asked him about that               	-5.4374
On the other hand , I was forced this week in a department store to evaluate my " experience " with transactions on one scale of one to five stars before I could pass my credit card .	-5.3114
In the coffee house on the corner of my road it is the same , plus the option to compensate the evaluation with a 15 % drink money - this to buy something about the loading table .	-3.6821
This not only leads to a slowdown in what should actually be a neutral exchange , but also puts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is needed .	-3.4910
The poor woman in the department stood apologizing , while I tired the experience of reaching my credit card with five stars .	-3.3753
Oscar Pistorius moved from Prison to Hospital	-2.7290
Pistorius has left the prison for a hospital for the second time .	-2.1512
Last year , he was brought to the hospital because of the treatment of cuts on his hand joints , which he suffered the prison authorities after a       en in his cele .	-6.4929
Pistorius was condemned against a first sentence because of murder of an appeal by the prosecutors .	-3.6412
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine ’ s Day 2013 by shoting them several times through a door of the toiletries in his house in Pretoria .	-3.1417
Pistorius claimed that he considered his girlfriend to be a night intrusion hidden in the cabin .	-3.0336
The public prosecutors have announced their intention this time to object to the six-year prison of Pistorius Appeal , which they say that it is too lenient .	-4.0406
The National Prosecution Authority said that it will oppose the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the opposition can be heard this year .	-2.8415
Pistorius runs danger of increasing its punishment to 15 years when the public prosecutors are successful .	-4.8205
There is no death penalty in South Africa .	-1.0903
As a Farmer Arnold Finds a Strange Egg	-2.4197
As the last of the Blumberg schools , the fourth classles were released from fertilizers and ports in the holiday and in the further schools   .	-7.7247
Three of the dismissal students will go to the gymnasium , four on the Real School in the future .            .	-6.5214
On Tuesday evening , Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Biesental Citizenship in Epfenhofen .	-2.7839
As a symbol of school redundancy , the 29 students of the four classes under the leadership of Sophia Schumacher and regine Meder chose a young eagle who grew up in the chicken courtyard , but then it is dismissed into freedom .	-4.1443
To do this , the munter Shar led a musical with the title " Der Adler im Hühnerhof auf " .	-3.4890
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg and breaked it from his chickens .	-2.6985
Instead of a chicken , a small eagle emerged .	-2.3561
But the hope of making him a chicken destroyed , the eagle spread on a high mountain his wings and declined .	-3.2684
After that , the classes showed three and four chicken dancing in the study of Yvonne Frank .	-2.9992
The hens danced with the young skirts that weared cylinders to the bet .	-3.0402
The eagle stands for integration , said school director Angelika Sitte .	-2.2200
The young animal is different from the other young animals ( chickens ) , but it is one of them .	-3.4840
But he will never be like a chicken .	-1.5229
Its provision is to be free .	-1.6911
She wished every fourth classles that he feels accepted in his new school .	-2.8297
Thank you to Mrs Michael Müller , the former school director , who is constantly jumping in teaching shortages and parental representatives .	-4.0587
The chick time is over , explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher .	-3.1131
She only dismissed her students after two years of lessons , because it was a really great time .	-3.5391
Finally , they could rely on the fourth classles .	-2.7174
Finally , all students sounded a song of summer time and holiday time .	-2.7197
Children were very pleased with this .	-3.0247
Eight classles are already registered for the new school year .	-2.4815
Arrested two Bulgarians for illegal camping in Greece	-1.9978
Two Bulgarians were imprisoned for illegal campings in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted by television .	-2.5979
On August 1 , the police arrested a group of illegally tented people in Sithonia , including the two Bulgarians .	-2.7086
They were released on the same day , while an investigation is currently under way .	-2.3706
The Foreign Ministry reported bTV that the Bulgarians were released later .	-2.0898
The Greek authorities have exacerbated control over the free camping and put considerable fines to anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose .	-3.5055
The controls will continue throughout the season .	-2.0305
The Ministry said that the Court can impose a fine .	-1.7809

This depends on the commitment of manufacturers and on political pressure .	-2.0684
" For we have seen , voluntarily , car manufacturers are not acting on the environment so far . "	-3.1656
How long should the update take ?	-1.3571
The conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .	-2.1617

We Make the City Living	-2.3177
Roland Wacker , Haslach ’ s city master , goes into pension next year .	-2.4473
The body is already written out - suitable applicants are , however , rare .	-3.5700
For 31 years Wacker Stadtbaumeister has been .	-2.2680
And the work still makes him great fun as he communicates in the press conversati                 	-6.5081
He reports of varied , but also demanding tasks that are waiting for his successor .	-3.0015
At the same time , it surprises him that no application has so far met the requirements profile .	-2.7517
The city is looking for an architect or construction engineer at the nearest possible time .	-2.3091
In this way , with regard to the regular termination periods , there is still enough time to work .	-3.8630
Since Haslach acts as a lower construction law authority for the administrative community , the applicant must provide appropriate conclusions .	-3.5571
Because this function wants to keep the city in a w   c .	-9.7907
If they cannot fill them any more , the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for consultation .	-3.4766
But proximity to the city and itself is important , says Wacker , who reports of a good operating climate and good mood between the authority and citizens .	-5.0015
In more than 30 years in office , some important projects have been accumulated that look back to wackers with pride .                           	-8.0665
" We make the city liveworthy " , it is safe about the construction office and its employees .	-3.2005
But there are also varied projects on the agenda in the future : the transformation of the former Hukla area and the Lower Hoven parking space has been initiated .	-4.2762
The Kinzig Bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed , and stadium renovation is still a topic .	-3.1658
The latter alone will beat some EUR 1.5 million , " if we make it right " , appreciates wackers .	-3.9102
" All in all waiting fantastic tasks for my successor .	-2.3758
The work here is fun . '	-1.3974
Design is available for a city master of great room .	-3.2344
With Haslach ’ s own construction farm and gardenery , much can be responded quite flexibly to many things .e.	-6.3306
" You can move a lot " , so wackers , and the design of the green plants is often mentioned by citizens and visitors .	-3.0790
Since the old town is under monument protection , whether it is important to " have an eye for what fits " when new buildings are approved , the outgoing city tree master emphasises                	-5.8433
In any case , the city master has a high responsibility .	-2.7484
He is Bauherr , " at the end everything runs about my table " .	-2.2564
In the case of care and coordination , he can count on many years of employees : Markus Neumaier ( high construction ) has been present for ten years , Manfred Schöner ( deep-building ) has been already for 15 years .	-4.5047
Also that his successor remains long , Wacker wants : " We are looking for someone who really wants to be identified and stay with the plac "           ee   th              	-8.7560
Continuity is not only important for a good operating climate , but also for the further design of the city                  	-4.9694
If you want to inherit Roland Wacker , you should be able to present a completed study as a diploma engineer or a bachelor with a direction of architecture and have good expertise in the areas of construction and construction planning .	-4.7540
The town office has high- and low-construction , construction planning , basic professional matters , management of urban properties , urban operating house with Bauhof and city gardens , as well as the lower construction authority , including monument protection .	-5.0584
Bicycle Thrown on Lines : Closed southern railway line	-7.9545
According to the police , the previously unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway transfer in the area of Leoben Street ( B116 ) to the lines .	-3.8032
These have been so damaged that the useful train of goods had to be stopped .	-3.3986
The investigators go out of two male perpetrators and are looking for them since the night hours .	-2.7321
Near the Tatort were witnessed by a rosarotte scooter and a bicycle driver                 	-7.3021
" This goes far beyond a lusbub disk , " said <unk>BB speaker Christoph Posch to the APA .	-3.3985
The or the perpetrators would have brought themselves into great danger and also jeopardised train .                    ee	-7.8641
In addition to the damage to the local and the equipment , as well as the delay minutes and the cost of rail replacement , there could also be ponals from rail customers to the perpetrators .	-5.0885
Overall , the speaker said that there was a ' considerable ' amount of money .	-3.2879
The damage was fixed again on Friday afternoon , rail transport on the southern route could be carried out without disabilitie     e            	-6.2891
Almost ten people trains were out of Friday morning , two of them concerned distance transport .	-3.6052
Goods trains did not fall , but they were late .	-2.3950
According to <unk>BB speaker Christoph Posch , about 200 meters of transfers had to be exchanged .	-2.8980
Isolators and masts have also been damaged .	-1.4135
Red meat , milk products , and chocolate could help alleviate IBD ( inflammatory illness )	-6.0099
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system .	-1.7844
But a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory illnesses .	-2.8581
The incurable state of around 1.3 million in the United States and 300,000 in the United Kingdom causes stomach fighting and blades , recurring or bloody diarrhea , weight loss , and extreme fatigue .	-3.8601
While those affected are normally encountered in avoiding meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophane helps develop immunicipals that promote a tolerant darm .	-4.4019
The senior researcher , Dr. Marco Colonna , explained that immune cells patrol in the darm to ensure that harmful microbes hidden in the meal do not enter the body .	-3.5809
Cells able to trigger inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without harming sensitive tissues .	-2.7047
If the balance tends too far towards inflammation , it can result inflammatory illness .	-5.5495
Experiments have noted that there are some kind of tolerance promoting immune cells in mice which bear a particular bacterium in their intake .	-9.7752
And the bacterium needs Tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .	-2.4791
Professor Colonna said : " We have connected between a type of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the darm microbiom , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .	-3.1088
The more tryptophane had the mice in their food , the more they had of these immune cells " .	-2.5553
He proposed that the combination of L. reuteri and a rich diet of tolerant , less inflammatory infectious when the same system works for humans .	-3.9931
The post-doctorate Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe that was separated but did not have this .	-4.0387
She suspected that the difference was to do with the darm microbioms of the mice - the community of bacteria , viruses and mushrooms that usually live in the stomach darm tract .	-3.6843
The darms of the mice have been sequenced by DNA and six bacteria were found , which were available in the mice with the immune cells , but without them lacking in the mice . even though                        	-7.5953
Mice were raised in a sterile environment , so they lacked a darm microbiom and they did not develop this kind of immune cells , and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells .	-3.6696
To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system , researchers L. reuteri grew in a liquid and then transferred small quantities of liquid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated by the mice .	-3.5395
The immune cells evolved into tolerance-promoting cells .	-2.7691
When the active component was cleaned out of liquid , it proved to be a by-product of tryptophane metabolism known as indol-3 milk acid .	-2.9205
If researchers doubled the amount of tryptophane in the feed of mice , the number of such cells rose by about 50 % , but when tryptophan values have been halved , the number of cells fell by half .	-3.4576
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice , and that most of us L. reuteri protect our stomach darm tracts .	-2.9005
It is not known whether tryptophane by-products from L. reuteri develop cells in people as in mice , but defects in genes relating to tryptophane have been found in people with inflammatory illness .	-6.1941
She said : ' The development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote , because these cells control inflammation on the internal surface of the  darm     .                   	-6.6603
Potentially , high tryptophane values can lead to an extension of this population in the present of L. reuteri . "	-2.7013
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has committed a " genius " with Nemanja Matic .	-2.1161
At Manchester United , Nemanja Matic signed a " genius " , Jose Mourinho believes after the midfielder had his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening .	-3.0120
The 40 million pound signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last preseason game before the UEFA super cup began against Real Madrid on Tuesday , and impressed in the Halter role , when people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marched after work                              	-6.6297
However , Matic was excluded from the preparation Asia tour of the blues and only created 45 minutes , which Mourinho admitted that he had to improve before the Premier League season began .	-3.4283
" He needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , " said Mourinho .	-2.1107
" We will help him to be prepared sooner than later . "	-2.0900
Besides Matic , Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started at the Aviva stadium when Mourinho shaped his start-XI for the start of the season .	-2.8771
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three more recommitments , but he insisted that the club had already done a " fantastic job " to meet three of its four priority recommitments .	-3.2213
" Three of four , I thank the association , " he added .	-2.3230
" I will be more happy when they get four of me from four , but they have given great efforts . "	-5.3433
Boeing " Paints " Dreamliners in the Sky	-1.7375
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing painted the silhouette of a dreamliner in the sky .	-2.3172
The pilots fled from Seattle in the US State of Washington , but the drawing began in Marquette in US State Michigan and moved in the form of a dreamliner about the US , these are several thousand kilometres .	-3.6514
The action took 18 hours and one minute .	-1.5877
On the radar screens was the form of a dreamliner .	-2.1872
The whole was an endurance test for new engines .	-1.9952
Boeing had made such advertising earlier  .	-2.1091
Thus the number " 787 " and the Boeing logo was painted in the sky .	-2.5246
New Deep Strike for Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a Problem	-2.3288
As the wind shoots , when Sigmar Gabriel was still SPD chief , Social Democratic Prime Ministers always looked at elections with some concern to Berlin .	-4.0971
The most important desire of the election campaigners was not just a headwind from the Federal Government .	-4.2481
Since Martin Schulz , the party has changed fundamentally .	-2.2179
Since then , employees from the Willy-Brandt-Haus have been watching the events in the SPD-ruled capitals with growing horrors                      	-6.5821
What Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not be described in approach with headwinds .	-2.9657
There were deep strikes .	-2.0458
One after another .	-1.8250
After the surprising end of the red green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CDU sends a general signal against coalitions of SPD and Greens .	-2.6773
" This shows once again : Red Green cannot simply govern reliably , " said CDU Secretary-General Peter Tauber to the editorial network of Germany ( RND ) .	-3.0647
The surprising group exit of a Green MEP has plunged Prime Minister Stephan Weil ’ s government into a serious crisis .	-9.3148
Five months before the land election , his red-green coalition lost its one-vote majority to the opposition from CDU and FDP .	-2.7032
The Green Managing Director , Michael Kellner , has asked the breakaway Nethersaxian Green Member Elke Twesten to return her mandate .	-3.6134
The transfer to the CDU means a clear distortion of the electoral will .	-2.3573
Elke Twesten must immediately return her mandate , " said the Green Editor Germany ( RND ) , the German Federal Manager and the Green Campaign Leader .	-3.8348
" After all , this must not be true , " a SPD election campaigner sighes up , when the new Hiobshop reaches the party headquarters on Friday morning .	-4.2713
Stephan Weil , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , is there without their own majority of government after the transfer of the Green MEP Elke Twesten to th    CDe .	-6.1285
It is the preliminary highlight of a whole rank of large and small crises in SPD country organizations .	-2.7627
And nobody knows what comes next .	-1.5663
The misery began with the unexpected clear defeat in the Saarland election in March .	-2.3782
A blue eye , more not , reassured the cooperatives at the time .	-2.7646
After the land elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia , everything will be different .	-2.1076
It was then - and it was all worse .	-7.5673
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the dawn , the Düsseldorf bank smoothly reversed the party .	-3.4133
In the weeks afterwards , the companions rappled again .	-3.8021
Then , when they had just created new courage , the G-20 summit of Hamburg came .	-2.5785
And with him came the next deep shot .	-4.5327
Mayor Olaf Scholz , the last strong SPD leader , lost his nimbus that weekend because he sat in Elbphilharmony while his city burned .	-3.0681
And because in crisis communication he then did so quite wrong everything that can be done wrong .	-3.7233
Since then , Scholz has fought for his political survival .	-3.7330
So now Stephan Weil .	-2.0333
Because of the VW emissions affair and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Netherlands Prime Minister has been in criticism for longer .	-3.3237
Most of these poll values were added .	-2.6083
Nevertheless , or perhaps precisely that , because over the past few weeks , there has been increasing attempts to put accents in the federal government .	-4.5693
The ambition of the former Mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin was not hidden by consultations in the surroundings of Martin Schulz .	-3.8190
They were granted him because they were promising to stabilize the party .	-3.3163
Now the exact opposite could happen .	-2.3772
Because the party internal sense of the Lower Saxony Greens is basically not blamed .	-3.9573
School is not at all .	-5.2400
For the time being , the cooperatives try to keep their own ranks closed .	-3.5979
Her anger is directed towards the Greens , and particularly the renewed parliamentarian Twesten .	-3.6819
" It is intolerable and democratic , as Mrs Twesten poses her own career interests on the interests of all the others , " says Matthias Miersch , head of the party links in the SPD Group , the editorial network of Germany ( RND ) .	-3.5676
Mrs Twesten has been elected to Parliament not because of her person as a direct candidate , but also through the list of countries of the Netherlands Greens .	-9.4491
The logical consequence would be that it returns its mandate .	-7.5167
Thomas Oppermann , the head of the SPD Group , complains a ' undemocratic manoeuvre '                    .	-5.6029
" The will of voters four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Weil a prime minister , " says Oppermann , who leads the Lower-Saxon SPD as the top candidate into the federal election , the RND .	-3.8990
" Now the personal career thinking of a future CDU MEP is distorting the result of the elections , " said Opperman           .	-4.2649
He called for the background to be informed .	-2.0946
I want to know whether there have been more or there have been further commitments from the CDU Lower Saxony .	-3.1098
Promotion money for local core III	-3.1768
If you want to renovate your house , you can soon get support from the country .	-3.3707
Informed Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives STEG Urban Development in Reception on Wednesday .	-2.6407
At the beginning of the information event , Schindler once again gave a review of the previous events .	-2.9981
Since 1991 there have been reception areas .	-2.0262
At that time , in the renovation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the country of Baden-Württemberg took over two-thirds of the support sum .	-3.3747
In the restructuring area II from 2005 to 2016 , the grant was still 60 % .	-3.0013
For skillers , the previous renovations are a " success project " - it is important to promote interior development and not just to develop new construction areas .	-4.0965
On 4 April , the Bureau of Government Karlsruhe received information that there would be a renovation area III .	-2.6609
The funding sum is EUR 833 333 , of which EUR 500 000 would come from the country , the rest of the community receptions .	-4.4587
How does a restoration area come from                	-5.3575
You will continue to examine skillers where the " really old " houses are .	-3.1699
But there is also a role to renovate whether there is any interest in the planned area .	-2.9517
If necessary , the limits could then be postponed again .	-3.1921
The STEG represented Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel .	-1.9613
Keller presented the contents of the Federal Country Programme " Social City " where the renovations would then be carried out .	-3.5358
The core of the programme is the revitalization of cities , the improvement in residential and working conditions and the preservation and development of infrastructure .	-3.4943
The measures would be implemented object-related , that is to say per lot .	-2.7859
The recovery area would eventually be defined as a statute .  T               e       e 	-9.1629
The approval period for funding has run until 30 April 2026 since 1 January 2017 .	-2.6070
Until September this year , however , the inventory would only be carried out once again , within the framework of which the parties involved in the recovery area would receive a questionnaire .	-4.5744
In November or December , the decision of the statutory decision is to be taken as possible so that the coming year can begin with the remova                	-7.1328
Pietzschmann then declared that each local municipality must carry out the pre-advanced investigations .	-3.3525
It is a question of evaluating and deciding when renovated and to what extent .	-2.9247
It will then also be registered for the respective plot in the Groundbook .	-3.6239
Pietzschmann will come once again to receive a picture of the situation , she promised .	-3.4617
Gotzel stressed that an essential factor of success for the project was the participation of the parties involved .	-2.9200
That is why there will be questionnaires that will be sent to the citizens postally in the coming weeks and can be filled out until the end of the summer holidays .	-3.5293
The yellow questionnaire is the " building and land arch " , which includes the construction state and reconstruction intentions .	-3.6921
In the grey questionnaire , the ' budgetary and housing arch ' , information can be made about the size , division and residents of a living room   .                       	-7.0567
The blue " Operating Arc " can only be filled if the building operates business areas .	-3.1462
However , note that Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not a request for funding at the same time .	-3.3179
In addition , new building measures are not eligible .	-5.1705
Shindlers still emphasised that the distribution of funds according to the " greyhound principle " works - who comes first , first makes the mistake .            	-6.3904
You cannot reserve any support funds for later       e   .    T e   	-7.1788
Finally , photos of the project " Place II " were shown to make the present a " tasty " renovation .	-3.7954
British inventors themselves have a microchip to come with a handmade movement in house and cars  .	-3.7740
A British inventor is the first in the country equipped with a microchip to open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .	-3.0796
Steven Northam , 33 , had implanted the tiny chip between thumbs and point fingers and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology by his company BioTeq .	-3.0468
He has merged with Dr. Geoff Watson , a consultative anaesthesist in the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester , Hants , to ensure that the implantation procedure is conducted in accordance with medical standards                                       	-7.4743
The technology resembles a cat and dog implanted microchip and lasts only 30 seconds .	-2.2542
The company of Mr Northam also wants to change the castles of houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip , all for an additional charge of <unk> 300 per castle .	-3.1431
The married father of one has now built at home as well as in his BMW Z4 technology , which begins when his hand is on the tax .	-3.1783
The White House ’ s Advertising Costs Cost Thousands of taxpayers	-2.5674
The White House ’ s decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlights American production last month costs taxpayers up to USD 24,000 according to the indications of the military left to the TIME magazine .	-6.7062
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on 17 July in the White House with American construction programs .	-2.7496
President Donald Trump , Vice-President Mike Pence , and White House leaders made a tour of products from all 50 countries .	-2.4170
The helicopter manufactured in Connecticut was issued next to a yacht of maine , a fire fighter car made of wisconsin and a forklift truck from Mississippi .	-3.6263
The military office of the White House required the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO , hardly 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn , according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One ( HMX-1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .	-3.5590
" I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , " the commander of the HMX-1 wrote on the eve of the event of his president , the deputy naval commander for aviation .	-7.2017
The message showed that the helicopter arrived at the South Lawn on 17 July against 7 a.m. for the event , and so long until the grass was cleaned from 18 : 00 to 21 : 00 this evening .	-4.1564
The touch adds that if the departure from the White House were to be delayed , a second team would be needed for the return flight because of the restriction of service hours  .                                 	-7.2957
The original flight crew was during the event at the helicopter , while the security staff of the unit remained on the ground during the time of the aircraft .	-3.6703
The records made available to the TIME did not make it clear whether a second flight crew was needed .	-9.8521
The Hatch Act bans federal employees to use government property for political purposes .	-2.4215
Rows show that HMX-1 has asked whether the event could violate the provision .	-2.2986
" A question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case , " wrote the commander .	-2.5560
" Sounds as if you are closed , " the deputy commander responded .	-2.0115
The event " Made in America " was described as an official event by the White House and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act .	-2.3490
But official events also have political upper tones .	-2.0369
At the event , the President gave an impetus to the reform of health reform that was under way in the Senate , and he promoted efforts to contain government rules .	-3.8429
The use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One is hardly a new phenomenon from politically beneficial purposes .	-2.4495
Presidents are obliged to use them for the journey .	-1.7430

HMX-1 crews often carry out training flights in the area around Washington and South Lawn to settle US Presidents in the White House with precise centimetric rates .	-3.3427
When Trump was at the beginning of July at the G20 summit in Germany , HMX-1 carried out 58 training landings in the White House .	-2.5785

Helicopter units flew 11 hours a day for " non-presidential support missions " .	-2.3910
The White House said that taxpayers did not take the burden on any of the other requisites presented at the event .	-2.4599
A speaker from Sikorsky said that the company was not involved in issuing the helicopter on the South Lawn .	-2.3841
HMX-1 does not maintain budget records for presidential flights , and it is difficult to identify the exact costs of the event .	-2.7941

" Defining the cost of taxpayers on the basis of estimates for refund rates is highly misleading , " said Walters .	-3.1403
'These estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs contained in the annual means ' .	-2.3238
According to a RAND study in 2015 , the refund rates for DoD do not contain the costs of staff , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and conclusion .	-3.3161

" And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not thousands of people depend on it .	-2.6884
And I think , like most Americans , we are all proud of helicopters and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly .	-5.6631
It is , of course , appropriate to highlight this . '	-2.1276
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event , but he placed himself in the driving seat of a fire car .	-3.4227

GMB Senior Organizer Drew Duffy said : " The fact that we cannot gain clarity from the General Site Manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross is deeply affected by our members .	-3.2748
Generations of families have worked here and the workforce focuses heavily on the local community and Glasgow , an important pillar of decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantages .	-3.3951
Therefore , under the perspective of jobs , pay and prosperity , and against the background of Brexit , the rising cost of living and the chronic decline in production , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a prosperous production presence at McVitie .	-3.7892
A speaker from Pladis said : " The branch manager at Tollcross only received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday , and the company will respond directly to it because we appreciate continuous commitment to employees and trade union representatives .	-3.6985

Interview : " Domspatzen Report relieves Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger "	-1.8772
The Regensburg Domspatzen report on abuse cases relieves Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger .	-2.5113
This means author and historian Michael Hesemann .	-1.5864
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Domspatzen continues to ensure discussions .	-2.7926
Christian Weisnder , spokesman of the reform movement " We are church " , explained an apology following the publication of the Deutsche Presse Agency , he expected from the former Regensburg Bishop and today 's Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller and from the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger , the 93-year-old brother of the emerited pope Benedict XVI .	-4.2659
It would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church if Muller and Ratzinger were to express their deep regret at their own omissions or their wrong assessment of the transactions at that time .	-3.7307
The vatican address " Osservatore Romano " , on the other hand , criticised that " double standards " are measured in the reporting of violence in the cathedrals .	-4.2441
With regard to the attacks in Regensburg , nobody doubted that these are ' shameful and shameful acts ' that would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; but strikingly , it is the ' degree of media manipulation ' , so the author Lucetta Scaraffia , historian and member of the national Italia Bio                        	-6.6461
" The habit of describing the Catholic Church as a source of all evils is already part of the everyday experience and prepares the public opinion for keeping it normal , " writes Scaraffia . "                  	-5.1075
Fürstin Gloria von Thurn and Taxis also meant in the interview with the Bavarian broadcasting : " You will be happy to go to the church and this is a found for " .	-5.6690
In addition , she pointed out that in her youth ' beats a very normal educational means ' had been ' to cope with free children , as I was one thing ' .	-3.9153
It would be unfair to apply today ’ s standards to previous decades , because the world has changed .	-2.5824
In connection with the reports on abuse cases , Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared .	-2.7573
Wrongly , author and historian Michael Hesemann , who wrote with Ratzinger the memory band " My brother of the Pope " ( translated into 12 languages ) .	-3.3933
" I must take Georg Ratzinger in protection , " says Hesemann , " because all this had nothing to do with him , " he worth the results of the final report .	-4.5778
What exactly is the 440-page report , which has been presented by the lawyer Ulrich Weber , who has been presented by the Bistum Regensburg , with the Enlightenment ?	-4.5570
Between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s , 547 Regensburg cathedrals were sexually abused with high plausibility " victims of attacks , 67 cathedrals .	-3.6408
The final report states Georg Ratzinger , who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : " Summary can be said that Domkapellmeister R. , in many cases , used forms of physical and mental violence .	-3.6816
The punishment for students could also be more vigorous in the case of high emotionality .	-4.0975
Nevertheless , unlike many other accused people , it states that many victims estimated the general humanity of R. and , in many cases , despite violence , even positive memories combined with him ' .	-4.1549
In the interview , Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Cathedral Park Georg Ratzinger believes that it is relieved .	-3.8777
Mr Hesemann , the 440-page report on the ' incidents of violence exercise on protected commanders at the Regensburg Domspatzen ' gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger .	-3.4656
On the one hand , many students highlight his " humanity " .	-2.4691
On the other he appears as a cholerist and perfectionist , who was handmade by the often if a cathedral patch did not musically bring a top performance .	-4.5756
How do you value this final report as his biographer ?	-2.0987
Michael Hesemann : If you take the trouble and read the whole 440-page report from the front to the back , you must ask yourself more why the name Georg Ratzinger is in there .	-4.1900
He is just eight pages dedicated to him and it is clearly unleashed by any suspicion of the company or system of sexual abuse in terrible cases .	-4.7756
The excesses of violence at preschool also occurred outside its effectiveness .	-2.5085
In any case , he can be accused of having taken seriously enough of this too late or not taken first suggestions .	-6.0259
The cathedral gymnasium on which he worked has been felt by virtually all respondents as - so literally - " redemption " , " heaven " and " better world " .	-6.9068
Thus , the broad majority of his students Georg Ratzinger expresses a very excellent testimony , describes him as " warm " , " popular " , " sincere " , " competent " and " understanding " , as a very good teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes , cokes and bonbons and " always shifted by children grapes " .	-4.7534
Only a minority complains about its perfectionism and its high emotionality , which has already led to anger eruptions .	-2.8400
He has already admitted , deeply regretted and apologized for himself , not only with chairs , and threw the key covenant on the ground , but also distributed ear cleanse      t t t t s w w         r .   Ha a            h h    a       h h   	-26.0238
However , it is important to say that such educational methods were widespread in the periods in question , the 1960s and 1970s , in parents as in teachers .	-3.8744
Do you know such breeding methods ?	-1.9987
Of course , I think each of us born before 1968 .	-1.8546
I too have seen this in a secular school , a government gymnasium .	-2.4766
Compared with what is actually at stake in this report , namely the appalling sexual abuse and the excesses of violence at preschool , these are , of course , baga parts .	-3.8383
It is wondering whether it is not more with its familiarity and role than a brother of Benedict XVI that many media have just fallen on him .	-4.6113
After all , many who have never understood him are still working on the Bavari   pope .         I have             	-6.7558
The truth , however , is that the report discharges Georg Ratzinger in every way !	-2.5919
Much has been reported in the media in connection with the report on the issue of abuse of the Regensburg Domspatzen .	-3.0346
Is Georg Ratzinger also being put at the expense of any involvement or system of sexual abuse in the final report ?	-6.9614
Michael Hesemann : Clearly no .	-1.6598
Not one of the 67 victims of sexual attacks claims to have entrusted the Domkapellmeister .	-2.3594
Not even parents were inaugurated .	-4.8828
" I never trusted to speak with my father or my mother about this , " said a person deputy for the others , " It was all very embarrassing " .	-3.6957
The real problem with the education of sexual abuse was , after all , that most victims are silent .	-3.0967
If they did not even entrust parents and siblings , then there is no doubt a choir leader who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators to some extent .	-4.3904
How do the Domspatzen students assess Ratzinger 's role in abuse case   ?	-10.6692
Michael Hesemann : A questioned student formulated it as : " In relation to sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he had had had timely insights and could have stopped the respective perpetr el .	-7.7361
I think it ... also is really absurd to assume that he has calculated himself more intrusive or clearer or rather opened than to their parents , International managers , confidence teachers                       	-6.9656
The fact that we are talking to him about sex .            	-4.9493
The report thus comes to the very clear result : ' that students and / or their environment affected in the run-up to him could not be confirmed within the framework of the investigation ' .	-4.0585
As far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg Ratzinger is therefore to be unleashed by any system of substance .	-3.4372
Nor can him be accused of not preventing him or brought him to the display                  	-6.9711
Therefore , there is no reason to connect its good name with these opposite crimes , as unfortunately it happened in some cases .	-3.6861
In the media there was much to read of " excesses of violence " at the Regensburg Cathedral Patz            .       	-6.7389
The former chapel master Georg Ratzinger is accused of the report ' Wegschauen ' .	-5.1456
Should he live with this accusation ?	-1.9268
Michael Hesemann : this is the great problem that everything has been mixed and shifted in reporting to a huge length of sexual abuse and excesses of violence and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg Ratzinger .	-4.1117
That is precisely what the report is abusing .	-2.4716
Indeed , it is clean : between the preschool and the gymnasium of the cathedrals , between sexual abuse and excesses of violence , and , once , we say other accusations .	-3.8828
The report also deals with incidents from the period since 1945 , in other words four decades where Georg Ratzinger was not choral leader of the Cathedral Squares .	-3.8309
The whole terrible pedagogy , the cases where the bones of sadistic teachers have been harassed and maltreated and suffered horrific , all occurred at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen , where truly scandalous conditions must have ruled .	-5.2335
But with those Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with , because he got the young face only when they were already on the Domspatzengymnasium .	-3.5263
On that , as the most witnesses stressed , the topic " Preschool " taboo               	-6.9887
One was happy to escape her and enjoyed so much better treatment and for many even " paradisian " cond                           	-7.4479
What was different on the Domspatzengymnasium ?	-2.1731
Michael Hesemann : Although there was discipline here , there was no sadistic violence        .	-3.9748
This also applies to Georg Ratzinger , where the report concludes that ' many victims estimated the general humanity of R. and , in many cases , in spite of violence , even positive memories combined with him ' .  '                    	-6.5130
At most , the accusation of looking away .	-2.6532
Despite all the efforts , the report could define only two periods when it was reported by the conditions at preschool .	-3.3969
The first time in 1970 / 71 , when he started to establish himself just now and did not want to hear anything from the processes at a school where he was unworking and responsible ( so witnesses ) , and then again around 1993 .	-4.7228
Does Georg Ratzinger close the ears consistently before the conditions ?	-2.4944
Michael Hesemann : No , because he already wrote a letter to the Director of the Domspatzengymnasium , which the report even reproduces .	-2.7698
He points out that ' the preschool continues to practise the penalty '  .	-7.5784
Even with the risk of negative press releases , he recommended urgent intervention .	-2.5327
This was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed when caning penalties were long prohibited in Bavaria .	-3.2029
Before that , they took place in a legal grey area , as we all know .	-2.8981
For him , too , has been difficult to assess where the people concerned may have been excessively or dramatised and where the permissible limit had really been exceeded .	-4.3024
You cannot say , however , that he has always looked awa  .                          	-8.1419
That is simply not true .	-1.4998
It was only in 1980 that the caning penalty at schools was officially abolished in Bavaria .	-3.1513
Prince Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today ’ s educational standards to the time at that time .	-3.1167
How do you see that ?	-1.3158
Michael Hesemann : We historians talk about the ' case of anachronism ' , that is , the danger of evaluating past moral standards today .	-3.3382
The Fürstin is right .	-5.4102
But this does not apply , of course , to sexual abuse , which was disgusting at all times and not to what was broken in the preschool of representatives and violence at innocent souls of children , which goes far beyond that time .	-4.7204
That is all very terrible and I am glad that it is finally being worked out .	-2.5967
But at the same time I have to protect Georg Ratzinger , because all this had nothing to do with him .	-2.4202
His funds for disciplination and punishment , in other words ear cows and hairs and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .	-3.2781
When physical punishment was then prohibited , he also believed strictly to this .    T                	-7.0417
What picture of his Regensburg time has Georg Ratzinger reproduced in the discussions with you for the book " My Brother of the Pop "                                 	-8.1458
Did the issue of caning punishment also raise the subject ?	-3.6538
Michael Hesemann : Well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , that is , Pope Benedict ’ s XVI , tells from his perspective , because the cathedral parts played only a side role .	-3.9707
Nevertheless , I am not concealing the fact that he had a strict regiment there .	-3.2231
But this , too , must be said : without this perfectionism , without the demands of unconditional discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world rank from the real cultural ambassadors of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour equally two times in the US ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .	-7.3373
With boilers and bonbons alone , one makes no major singers and every success in whatever area , but always discipline , passion and self-overcoming .	-4.4350
As what for a person you have experienced Georg Ratzinger in talks on their book ?	-8.0057
Michael Hesemann : Through the work on the book and beyond , I have really getting to know Georg Ratzinger well and repeatedly experienced Georg Ratzinger as wonderful , humorous , basic , deep and heart-good people , who cannot imagine that he could only do something to suffer flying .	-5.4469
I get regular with how many former cathedrals still today , 23 years after his emeritation , regularly keep contact with him , visit him , read him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family .	-3.7680
So those who have not yet forgiven him that he was strict to them are clearly in the minority .	-3.0017
Most cathedrals are grateful to him today for enriching their lives and brought the world of music to them .	-2.9571
And that he always became a good , fatherly teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a loving respect for which they are still looking today and which they are worshiping .	-4.2543
Please , once again , illustrate that everything that is accused of him is educational methods which were on the agenda at the time .	-3.9850
We can be glad that we have long overcome this time .	-1.9140
But it is highly unfair to make a man just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to media scapegoat .	-2.5408
The evil intention behind this is too obvious only  .	-8.9671
Because the report that has just been published discharges it .	-2.4815
Now it would be the decency that a 93-year-old man who has acquired great merits and who would not know the Regensburg Cathedral Squares without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany 's perhaps nobody w would finally be able to leave peace .	-6.3228
