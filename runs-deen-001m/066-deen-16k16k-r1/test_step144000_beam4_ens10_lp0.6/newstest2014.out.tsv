Good : More pedestrian safety	-1.4645
They are not 100 meters apart : on Tuesday the new B 33 pedestrian ramps at the village parking square were put into operation in Gubach .	-7.6124
Two plants so close to each other : intent or shield couch ?	-3.4307
This question was answered clearly yesterday by Gutch ’ s mayor .	-2.9987
" The Rathausampel was installed at the time because it secured the school path , " Eckert explained yesterday .	-12.5719
Kluser traffic lights secure secure both cyclists and bus passengers and mountain residents .	-4.7334
The officially launched plant yesterday is important for the Sulzbachweg / Kirchstra<unk>e intersection .	-4.0741
We have the museum , two churches , spa park , bus stop , doctor and bank as well as the flow of traffic from the residential area <unk> Grub <unk> .	-9.4801
" At the high traffic and pedestrian traffic levels there was another traffic light , " Eckert says .	-5.6619
This is confirmed by Peter Arnold of the Landratdier Offenburg .	-4.0458
" According to current measurements on the B 33 daily about 12 000 vehicles pass through the town of Gutland , of which about ten percent are heavy traffic , " says Arnold .	-5.7242
That is why it is more than necessary to build another set of traffic lights : ' Safety just happens here ' , says Arnold .	-5.9181
In total , four traffic views were carried out , and a roundabout traffic was also thought out , but was rejected again because of the closeness of the Sulzbachweg / Kirchstra<unk>e intersection .	-7.5097
According to Arnold , everything was tested at the traffic light masts ' choice : " By means of an extra long wooden trunk that we have used for us , we have turned out whether these vehicles can go from the Sulzbachweg to the B 33 without clogging the traffic light masts " .	-11.0432
The EUR 15 000 traffic light plant itself is " the most modern thing on the market " , explained Arnold .	-5.4050
The system is equipped with colorful LEDs , which are so strong that the lights are well visible by the drivers , for example , even when the sun is deep .	-8.4103
It is also economical : older lighting uses about 100 watts , the new , just eight watts .	-5.1958
There are three lighting units per direction .	-3.2542
Arnold explained the technology of the new plant : It is equipped with two radar sensors .	-2.3895
Once the pedestrians push the traffic light button , the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation .	-4.0237
If the road is free , direct green for the pedestrian , if not , it takes about 15 seconds .	-3.2836
Another radar sensor checks whether the pedestrian green phase can end .	-2.8861
" If a group or disabled people go over the road , the green phase is extended , so everyone comes safely over the track , " said Arnold .	-5.6945
Of course , drivers must think together as partners here and watch the track .	-4.8183
This was not the case yesterday : scarcely showed the traffic lights for pedestrians green , smoked a upper class vehicle - with bright red .	-4.5043
For more than 30 years , Josef Winkler has been writing his childhood and youth of the soul .	-2.7996
The calamities of his Catholic village childhood - the lack of language , the slope to raw violence and stubborn sexuality , the closeness and joyoulessness - have often been described by the poet of Carinthia .	-6.8386
The director of the stage is known primarily as a prose author , theatre texts are rare in his work .	-6.5950
Collage from Prosatexten Gerhard Fresacher composes a collage of prosated texts for his performance " Weather lights on the tongue " , which can now be seen in Garage X on Petersplatz .	-8.2124
The theatre director combines elements from the autobiographically shaped novel " The Oath Bees " ( 1987 ) with prominence scores from " Leichniam , his family besieging " ( 2003 ) .	-6.7124
The eight-person ensemble is supported by the text material on the largely empty stage - an important prop : a rugged sofa , which is allegedly copied and masturbated .	-7.8326
Director Fresacher seems little to trust the text .	-3.1686
The 70-minute performance transforms the template with a wealth of regime influences , known from the repertoire of postdramatic forms .	-5.0864
The actresses in particular find themselves in the sometimes somewhat dubious scenic conversions .	-7.5633
They are attacked hard , with their heads sucked underwater , flattened with their dawns to the wall .	-7.4113
Impressed in cellophane or bog , they stitch into dangerously high sticks by staging , either monologize them loudly or lie utterly muted on the floor .	-6.9959
However , this strenuous text scarcely convey itself .	-3.9082
The best moments have the evening when sung - the bandwidth ranges from Deep Purple to popular songs .	-3.8485
It is only in the end that the overturned performance comes a little calmness , and Winkler ’ s absurdity flashes up .	-6.4364
A Blackbox in your car ?	-1.5516
US road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the declining HWay system , and believe that the solution has been found in a small black box that can fit in every car 's armature board .	-6.4046
The devices that record every kilometre taken and report the information to the authorities are at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and the federal planning offices to revise the outdated system of financing American roads .	-4.2936
The typically boring area of road planning has suddenly sparked an intense debate with colourful alliances .	-3.6938
Libertarians have joined environmental groups , arguing that the government can use the small boxes to record the kilometres driven – and possibly where they were driven – and then use the information to calculate tax certificates .	-5.9929
The Tea Party is horrified .	-1.9332
The ACLU also expresses a number of concerns about data protection .	-2.7348
But , while Congress cannot agree on action , several states no longer wait .	-3.2064
They are currently looking into how they can change over the next ten years to a system where drivers pay per driven mile .	-4.3522
Thousands of drivers have already tested the tachographs , some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring .	-2.2730
That really is a must for our country .	-1.4871
“ It ’ s nothing we will only use , ” says Hasan Ikhrata , Managing Director of Southern California Assn. of Government , who plans to record miles in all California drivers in the state from 2025 .	-5.5504
The way in which we pay those taxes will change .	-1.6094
The technology for that is there .	-1.7206
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund , funded from the taxes paid to Americans at the fence pillar , is flawed .	-4.3276
But in America , no longer as much is anchored as before .	-4.6995
Cars use less fuel .	-1.4073
The state mineral oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon ( less than 4 euros per litre ) has not increased for 20 years .	-3.1687
Politicians at high injection prices do not dare to raise the tax by just one cent .	-2.5660
“ The gasoline tax is simply not future-proof , ” says Lee Munnich , an expert on transport legislation at the University of Minnesota .	-3.6956
Its federal state has recently equipped 500 cars with tachographs to test a meel-based payment system .	-6.1790
“ This is the most sensible alternative in the long term , ” he said .	-2.4323
Bureaucrats call it a mea-based user fee .	-2.3989
It is no surprise that the idea is echoed by urban liberals , for example , because the tax could be used to influence driving behaviour in such a way as to reduce congestion and climate-damaging emissions .	-4.3700
The Californian planners are relying on the system to develop strategies to achieve the federal state ’ s ambitious , legally established climate change goals .	-5.1379
But the Republicans Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania , Chairman of the House Transportation Committee , also declared that he saw the most viable long-term alternative .	-8.2039
The Reason Foundation ’ s freelancers are also inspired by the idea of getting drivers paid by the route they have traveled back .	-6.9222
“ This is not a tax that disappears in a black hole , ” says Adrian Moore , Vice-President for Reason Guidelines .	-2.7283
People pay directly for what they get .	-0.9286
The movement is also supported by two former US transport ministers , who in a report in 2011 called on Congress to move toward meel-based billing .	-3.6160
Last year , the US Senate approved a $ 90 million expensive pilot project that included 10,000 cars .	-2.4114
But the majority in the House did not allow this step forward , responding to the concerns expressed by rural MEPs who represent people who often have to take many miles on their way to work or to the city in everyday life .	-6.6578
Several states and major cities , however , are moving in this direction on .	-3.6313
Oregon , the most committed driver of all time , is currently recruiting 5,000 drivers to the country ’ s largest experiment .	-5.1511
These drivers will soon pay Mileage instead of the oil tax to the federal state .	-3.4923
Nevada has already completed a pilot project .	-0.9269
New York City is also considering such a thing .	-0.9683
Illinois is testing it on lorries to a limited extent .	-3.5014
And the I-95 coalition , which includes the Transport Ministries of 17 states on the east coast ( including Maryland , Pennsylvania , Virginia , and Florida ) , is currently examining how to introduce the change .	-3.2880
The concept is not a universal hit .	-0.8452
In Nevada , where more than 50 volunteers were equipped recently , drivers were sceptical about the fact that the government could follow each of their movements .	-4.9241
“ Concerns against Big Brother and such things were a major problem , ” Alaudtin Khan explains , the head of strategic and earnings management in the Nevada Transport Ministry .	-5.5512
People did not want it .	-0.8055
When the test started , the Nevada ACLU warned on its website : “ It would be relatively easy to turn tachographs into full-blown surveillance devices . ”	-4.3763
There is no need to build a gigantic , bulky technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to capture data about individuals ’ daily movements .	-2.8860
Nevada is part of a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology to allow the state to grasp the crossed kilometres , but not exactly when and where .	-5.2178
That , Khan says , would also reassure the public .	-2.1129
The hunt for this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California .	-2.0929
The company was not originally designed to assist states in car taxation .	-4.3684
Instead , its aim was to find a way of going on in an emerging market for car insurance , where drivers should pay on the basis of the miles they have taken .	-7.3757
But the devices it tested are also interesting for road planners , because they do not work with GPS and provide limited information regularly uploaded by modem .	-4.2918
“ People are more willing to participate if their speed and locations are not recorded , ” Ryan Morrison , Managing Director of True Mileage , said .	-3.9440
Large errors have been made in some of these public pilot programmes .	-2.6661
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways of doing this .	-2.1404
In Oregon , planners experiment to give drivers a range of choices .	-2.7375
You can choose a device with or without a GPS .	-1.2068
Or they do not choose a device at all and instead pay a flat-rate fee based on the average mileage taken by all residents of the state .	-5.1327
Other bodies hope to sell the concept of a distrustful public by providing the devices with more functions than with a lesser one .	-3.9541
In New York City , transport officials want to develop a tax-paying device , have to pay for parking fees , have to pay for insurance only for driven kilometres and collect speed data from other vehicles in real time , which will enable drivers to avoid congestion .	-8.0796
“ Drivers would be motivated to participate by the added value of the benefits offered by the system , ” said the city ’ s planning document .	-4.2206
However , some road planners wonder whether all the talk about pay per mile is not just a huge maneuver .	-4.8862
Under the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay area , officials said that Congress could solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund simply by increasing fuel taxes .	-4.1531
An additional one-time charge or an annual levy could be imposed on motorists with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume little petrol , so that they also pay a fair share .	-4.8960
“ There is no reason for an operation if an aspirin is sufficient , ” says Randy Rentschlehr , the head of legislation and public affairs of the Commission .	-5.2483
If we do that , hundreds of millions of drivers will take care of their privacy and many other things .	-3.3130
Königsfeld : Small Team Cracks Wackers	-7.8372
The volunteer fire brigade handled its Autumn Triple despite the shortage of staff .	-5.9509
Only eleven men took part in the exercise .	-1.2861
Deputy commander Hans Kammerer had chosen the property federation in his training in the Burgberger Stra<unk>e .	-5.2369
A short circuit was created during the saw .	-3.5285
The resulting fire and smoking performance injured two people , but one of them could still send an emergency call .	-5.1376
After the first examination of the situation by Hans Kammerer , two respiratory defenders of the Wehr were prepared to enter the building .	-5.1232
After a short period of time , it was possible to find the first person and pass it freely .	-4.6549
The second person had to be born .	-1.3189
This was not easy , because a close staircase was also to be overcome .	-3.3435
The building , a workshop with integrated stable for two horses , was not easy to secure .	-2.3857
It lay a lot of wood and also floodballs inside .	-8.4176
There were also electrical woodworking machines .	-2.2698
The first extinguishing handle was carried out via the tank in the vehicle .	-2.7565
Another line was taken over an abundance of hydrates at about 100 meters distance .	-6.2283
Now three deletion handles could be arranged .	-4.5532
A hollow pipe was used also in the building .	-3.1503
Hans Kammerer also sought to demonstrate what to do with a few staff .	-5.0235
In the event of an emergency , support will be provided via the Königsfeld daily sales group .	-3.4974
The commander was satisfied with the exercise .	-1.7689
Interconnection between universities and firms important	-3.7206
During his visit to the county of Breisgau High Black Forest , Guido Wolf , President of the Land , was also given an explanation of where the workers of tomorrow came from .	-6.7082
At the Schwarzwald Förderzentrum , he addressed this important issue together with the business leaders of the vocational schools and Kreisgymnasium and members of the Parent Advisory Council .	-7.9961
" Education is an important location factor " , underscored Claudia Stehle , director of Hans-Thoma School , who presented the interconnected school project Training Center Hochschwarzwald .	-4.5910
Wolf was impressed by the model projects for training .	-3.3394
Since 2011 , the city has had a successful collaboration between the Förderzentrum , Kreugymnasium and vocational school centre .	-6.1096
He also praised the friendliness of the rural community .	-3.5063
" It is important not only to have the family phase in mind , but also because of demographic change the phase to care for relatives , " said Wolf .	-4.9397
He also noted that more and more employees took care of and care for their loved ones .	-4.4350
" Without the support of employers , the resulting burden on employees can lead to an end to the employment relationship , " said Wolf .	-3.5467
But no one can afford to lose a qualified workforce , he continued .	-2.5743
Another particularly important factor is the networking of universities and businesses .	-2.9477
" Because whoever has experienced the benefits of the region during his studies , with his acquired knowledge and skills , often remains in the regional economy , helping to strengthen the region , " the president of the country was convinced .	-7.3582
Only if sufficient training places are offered can the need for skilled workers be met .	-4.2841
In his opinion , the advantage of the district is its advantageous location in the south-west of Germany , close to France and Switzerland .	-4.2560
In addition , on his journey from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg , he experienced the efforts already made to expand public passenger transport .	-5.5480
" If you remain stubbornly and make sure that local public transport becomes better , " he told the local politicians present .	-4.8231
Experience Music with an entertaining afternoon	-7.1263
For 15 years the Kaul family has been inviting the Dietinger seniors to coffee , cakes and then to a Vesper .	-5.7881
In the past , the elderly were treated in the resting place .	-4.3955
Meanwhile this afternoon it is taking place in the nursing home of St. Josef .	-5.0359
The homeowners rejoiced at the tasty cakes and cakes .	-3.2530
Later , there were sausages .	-2.8021
Silvia Kimminch-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich entertained her with popular melodies .	-4.3738
The more than 100-year-old natural stone wall , as the outline of the old priory to the church road , is to be resubmitted by the city of Brünlingen .	-8.9430
In the days before the Kilbig a small angle wall was built in the first works of restoration of the front school , to stabilise and to reduce static discharge of the more than one hundred years old natural stone wall with balustrade .	-7.3190
The further action is to include Alexander Misok of the Municipality Office , the Municipal Office , in the planning plans and create a redevelopment concept for the old wall .	-7.6973
Then there will be a calculation of costs by experts , who will then be put on the table to the Council of Municipalities for deciding and deciding what to do .	-7.5101
A decision on this will probably be taken next year .	-2.2387
In the foreseeable future , after the renovation , cobblestone and planting of the old school courtyard within the two side wing of the 1912 school , the limitation wall in need of restoration must be renovated from scratch and put on new underbuilding .	-9.6480
The historic , one-hundred year old wall of the old school building to the Kirchstra<unk>e , is mainly due to water and frost damage , as no drainage is present , in need of repair and has a bowing nesting ahead .	-8.5358
Deep cracks in individual stones testify to climatic damage , but the wall is not at risk of collapse at the moment .	-5.1271
A stationary wall is a precondition for a school yard used by students , which is what has happened through the current fixation work .	-7.4631
Originally , the school remediation was already planned in 2008 / 2009 , but high irregular expenditure caused a shift .	-5.7630
An important word in the historical reconstruction of the school wall , which has even been used for film shots , will be given to the National Memorial Office .	-6.7373
If you have any questions , don 't hesitate to contact us .	-5.5800
Students of the Brünling Primary School , who are now taught again in a well-renovated old school building with a new Aula , can soon use the old schoolhouse .	-6.7382
<unk>zdemir wishes to receive jazz training in Stuttgart	-2.2122
Cem <unk>zdemir , Federal Chairman of the Greens , has now joined the ongoing discussions on the future of music schools in Baden-Württemberg .	-3.7394
" I think it is wrong to give up the holistic training at the Musikhochschule Stuttgart , " said <unk>zdemir the " Stuttgart Message " .	-3.8195
Jazz and classical belong together at the Jazzstand Stuttgart .	-2.7414
Thus , <unk>zdemir , the Grün Roten LandesGovernment , is opposed to the choice of a direct mandate in Stuttgart on 22 September .	-7.1927
On the basis of an expert study , this is forcing a reorganization of the five music colleges in Baden-Württemberg .	-4.9466
The purpose of this course is to transfer Jazz and Pop from the Musikhochschule Stuttgart to the Musikhochschule Mannheim . the . the the . the the . the the .	-9.7959
US Border : ' Super-Tunnel ' to drug smuggling	-3.7618
On the border between Mexico and the United States , investigators have discovered and closed a ' super tunnel ' to smuggle drugs .	-3.7115
As the US customs authorities have said , the more than 500 metres long tubes between Tijuana and San Diego were equipped with electricity , rail tracks and a ventilation system .	-4.2265
Three suspects were therefore arrested , eight tonnes of marijuana and almost 150 kilograms of cocaine confi.	-2.5679
The tunnel was not yet used as it was indicated .	-3.2263
" These cartels are stupid if they think they could dig under the radar , " said the US Federal Public Prosecutor 's attorney General of the Southern California district , Laura Duffy , at a press conference in front of a San Diego warehouse , where that was discovered at the end of the tunnel .	-5.7209
To drug gangs , Duffy assured : " If you continue to build such a tunnel and try to use it , we are determined to make the huge waste of your dirty money " .	-5.4439
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in constant struggle against the drug cartels .	-2.3598
Since 2006 , more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug-related crime .	-2.3671
Built by experts	-1.4976
Because of the expensive equipment of the tunnel , investigators assume that it was constructed by architects and engineers and that the construction took about a year .	-5.4310
The track was equipped in such a way that electric cars could be used there .	-4.0689
On the Mexican side , access is in a building 80 meters from the border .	-3.3063
According to the authorities , a ladder takes depth 20 metres to the actual tunnel entrance .	-3.0311
The tunnel has a cross section of 1.20 meters height and 90 centimeter width .	-3.0040
It would also have been appropriate to encourage illegal immigration to the United States .	-3.9326
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine fund .	-1.3593
The third , a Mexican , was taken because of the confiscated marijuana .	-3.0117
All three face the threat of life imprisonment , as officials have said .	-2.9760
Eight such tunnels have been discovered since 2006 , and the San Diego press conference continued .	-2.1308
It is , however , the first time that cocaine has been found in such a tunnel construction . , , , the , , , , , and , , , , , , , ,	-8.2650
Normally cocaine is smuggled in small quantities , not by tunnels .	-2.9994
This demonstrates the ' despair ' of drug gangs , whose traditional routes have now been cut off , said Bill Sherman of the DEA in San Diego .	-4.7841
They would do everything to get to the US .	-2.1137
No details were given to those arrested , at least one being Mexicans , it was said .	-3.6528

2014 Will Geisinger Faire	-2.8734
The anniversary of the town of Geisingen in 1250 .	-3.1221
We are getting closer to the first proverbial reference .	-4.9597
When the year ends in a good eight weeks , the anniversary year is on .	-5.0778
Geisingen and Kirchen-Hausen were first mentioned together in 794 .	-3.1467
A certificate was produced in churches in which both places are mentioned .	-3.2239
On 15 March there will be an official start to the anniversary year , and since Geisingen has no hall at the moment , this opening event will take place in the place where the first mention was made in 1250 years ago , in the house of Kirchen-Hausen .	-7.6986
A number of events are planned during the anniversary , both in violiniand in church houses .	-4.9593
Kirchen-Hausen will host the 1250 in July on a weekend weekend of 18 to 20 July .	-5.5962
Recovery .	-2.9470
Friday with a party , on Saturday and Sunday with a festival around the church hall .	-3.5514
On that weekend is the church house festivity .	-3.7952
City music director Rudolf Barth wrote a contract composition for the city on the occasion of the anniversary , which is performed on three dates .	-5.4162
On 21 June together with the Sonnwendfest of the Schwarzwaldverein , on 12 July in the arena with fireworks and on 13 December the first concert of the town music in the new Festhalle .	-4.5295
This will be completed and inaugurated in the year of jubilee , the official deadline is last September , 27th and 28th .	-5.6965
On the occasion of the Geisinger Stadtjubiläume a new chronicle is also published .	-3.4687
" But a chronicle should not only be made by violins themselves , but a printed work on the violins of today , consisting of violins , church houses , Leipzig , Aulfingen and Gutmadingen , " says Mayor Walter Hengstler .	-6.6017
Today ’ s civilization has been celebrated in 2014 as well as in 1974 .	-6.6368
The new chronicle will be presented on 21 or 22 November in the new Festhalle in Geisingen .	-3.4463
2014 , however , is also a year with many anniversaries .	-2.5499
The Strohglonki narrative begins on 8 February with a traditional evening during its 60-year existence , the Harmonie Gutmadingen is 90 years old and has the banquet on 29 March and then celebrates the district music festival from 1 to 4 May .	-7.4140
The Altenwerk Leipzig is 40 years old , the Geisinger School has been in the new location for 50 years and celebrates this on 10 May , the Musikverein Polyhymnia Leipzig is 150 years old and celebrates this as part of the Brunnenfest from 4 to 7 July .	-5.9034
The town of Geisingen was first mentioned in 764 in a gift certificate owned by the St. Gallen monastery .	-3.3543
The certificate was made in churches ( houses ) , which was then a court place .	-3.9494
Both communities are thus mentioned in the same document .	-2.0428
To celebrate this 1250 year ’ s cause in 2014 , the parish body also dates back 40 years .	-6.2180
The Council is targeting rail systems	-3.9952
Should the railway crossing " Am Hirschen " be extensively rebuilt in order to increase road safety ?	-4.9123
Yes , the local councils have decided .	-1.2537
He has to pay EUR 220 000 for this .	-3.1755
Deutsche Bahn wants to improve the Kinzigtal track next year .	-4.0689
Especially the aim is to increase safety at rail crossings - there are regular collisions of trains with other vehicles throughout Germany .	-5.4470
If municipalities vote in favour of the reconstruction , they will have to contribute by one third to the cost , and the rest will share train and covenant .	-7.8003
Schiltach ’ s mayor Roland Grie<unk>holder explained to the municipal council the peculiarities of the Bapretty ’ s fame “ Am Hirschen ” .	-6.9555
There , the city plans to build an outlet at the height of the local tunnel to the west of the railway track .	-6.0618
There , for example , larger vehicles , such as those that carry long-timber , could also stand in the opposite direction without having to block the tracks .	-6.8818
Grietors therefore proposed to construct a base wall that would allow the city to spread the road following in due course in order to ensure a smooth flow of traffic .	-7.7959
This was controversial in the municipal council , because some councils doubled the need for a street spread : Thomas Kipp , with his statement , put the critics ' mood at the point : ' Do we have to take so much money in the hands of so few vehicles ? '	-7.9030
The mayor Thomas Haas disagreed : the " Hirschen " railway crossing is regularly used for long-timber transports .	-5.6288
Even timber from the " Kuhbach " area is partially transported over this route , because the up to 20 metres long vehicles could not use the route at the Häberlesbrücke because they could not turn there into the main road .	-15.8445
In addition , the route was used as a cover for those vehicles that cannot use the tunnel when the main road is closed , Haas argued .	-5.4910
The railway station " Am " Hirschen " can be used for a long time .	-16.9723
The Councils agreed to have the costs to be borne by the proposed extension of the road .	-4.6313
Despite this , a majority of people agreed to rebuild the railway crossing with the requirement to build the necessary support wall in such a way that the city could extend the following road towards " Bahnhofstra<unk>e " to approximately 5.5 metres , if necessary for encounters .	-9.4255
On the other hand , the restructuring of the railway crossing of the Gerkö Trautwein could lead to a very different problem affecting access to the strongly rising " Geroltzhäuser Way " .	-7.6474
The administration had asked the train 's reconstruction plans to be examined by the engineering office of Breinlinger , as it had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhäuser Way was easily possible .	-7.3831
The study found that it was not to be ruled out that road mooring could lead to longer vehicles being mounted .	-5.5037
The responsibility for this lies with the city as a road paver .	-4.5114
The rebuilding could therefore entail liability claims .	-4.0799
Haas argued , because both wood abrasion and bending worked in the current state of development , he was not in favour of the reb.	-8.5008
Even at this point , the risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle on the transition is significantly lower than on the other crossings , because it is right next to the center stop where a good visibility link exists .	-8.7725
Even trains from the main train station should have been braking so far that no collision could be expected .	-6.2921
The majority of people refused to agree to the reconstruction of this railway crossing , as the city of Schiltach had to " settle " the problem with stopping vehicles , the Councils said that the railway could withdraw from responsibility after the construction was completed .	-9.4707
The panel considers the changes at the " Before Heubach " and " Before Kuhbach " stations , for which agreements with the railways have already been made .	-6.5450
Esa decides on Grand Space sessions : Missions for Billions	-3.8727
Far planets , gravitational waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects that they want to launch in the next few years .	-3.9059
30 proposals were available , five are still in the race .	-2.1525
Far Worlds .	-0.9734
More than 1000 planets in other stars have already been found by astronomers .	-2.2159
Whether there is life on at least some of them is no doubt .	-3.4783
The selection is difficult : Are you looking for gravitational waves ?	-3.7486
Or rather investigate the origin of the cosmos ?	-1.8434
Or after strange planets , you 'll be able to enjoy some extraterrestrial life ?	-8.7888
These questions are specifically addressed by those responsible for the Esa European Space Agency .	-3.7933
They are looking for ideas for two major space projects to make the most of research .	-4.9376
The budget for these ' L missions ' is approximately EUR 1 billion each .	-3.2122
The launch will probably be 2028 and 2034 .	-1.8191
At the beginning of September , the elite of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions .	-2.2711
30 ideas were on the agenda , five of them have now come to the closer election .	-4.3625
Many committees are evaluating the proposals to catch researchers .	-5.4910
A final decision will be taken in the next few days by the scientific committee .	-2.5354
The Esa has selected four major questions to which the missions of the Cosmic Vision program , launched in 2007 , will find answers .	-4.4583
What are the conditions for the emergence of planets and life ?	-1.4748
The exact events in the formation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus the creation of planets surrounding these stars - still lie in the proverbial dark .	-5.3860
A large infrared button in the All could penetrate this darkness .	-3.7006
And if a star planet has , under what circumstances can life be created ?	-2.8727
To investigate this issue , the 2017 space telescope is to launch the " Cheops " telescope , which will examine more closely the 500 already known planetary systems in our vicinity .	-7.2545
The possibilities are limited , however , Cheops is a small mission with a budget of EUR 150 million .	-3.4026
With larger instruments , astronomers could map earthly planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres and thus search for " biomarkers " : gases that are considered an indication of biological activity .	-5.5103
How does the solar system work ?	-1.2880
In the final analysis , this question , too , is intended to establish the conditions for the emergence of life .	-6.3364
The magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field as well as the particle radiation it emits with the planetary system plays an important role .	-3.9410
In our solar system , these processes can be studied in a exemplary manner .	-5.0127
With the " Solar Orbiter " , the Esa has already approved a M-class mission ( where the budget is about half a billion euros ) for this issue .	-4.2628
The probe will launch in 2017 and observe the surface and activity of the sun .	-3.2348
Jupiter and his Moon are also of great interest to researchers .	-8.8451
They want to find out what role the Giant Planet played in developing the solar system .	-3.7779
For this , the Esa envisages the first of the three L-missions of the Cosmic Vision programme .	-3.4678
The song " juice " ( Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer ) is expected to begin in 2022 .	-3.0803
Eight years later , she reached Jupiter and was to investigate the atmosphere of the planet as well as the icy moon of Europe , Kallisto and Ganymed .	-3.6938
What are the basic physical laws of the universe ?	-1.0799
The universe offers many opportunities to study matter under extreme conditions and to examine whether the known laws of nature still apply there .	-5.8710
There may also be deviations that could show the physicists the way to a new theory under which all known laws of nature can be combined .	-5.5260
How was the universe created and what is it made of ?	-3.3769
13.7 billion years ago , our cosmos arose through the big bang .	-3.8308
In addition to the familiar matter , the stars , planets , and living beings as we exist , Dark Matter , whose gravity holds galaxies and clusters together , and Dark Energy , through which the expansion of the universe accelerates .	-6.2189
Until now , researchers do not know what physical laws were valid in the first second fractions of the big bang , nor do Dark Matter and Dark Energy .	-6.0830
With " Euclid " , the Esa has already approved a M mission which is scheduled to be launched in 2020 .	-4.7605
With a special telescope , the probe should investigate the distribution of the matter in the universe for the first time in the whole sky , thus enabling conclusions to be drawn on the composition of Dark Matter and Darker Energie .	-7.6450
Who could Race	-1.2835
Of the 30 proposals , only two will remain at the end of the selection process .	-1.8303
In the opinion of many experts " E-Lisa " , the best chances of obtaining an L mission is a challenging concept for detecting gravity waves .	-12.1550
Physicists understand the structure of space time that Albert Einstein predicted almost 100 years ago .	-3.3442
To date , they have not been proved .	-4.3160
Elisa could do that , hoping scientists behind the project .	-3.1190
The mission envisages one of two or three probes existing detector stationed in space .	-2.2906
In contrast to Earth plants , it could also prove gravitational waves that emerged at the big bang and thus provide new insights into the formation of the cosmos .	-6.7478
Four more proposals are still competing for the second L-mission : a major ' Athena ' X-ray telescope to explore black holes , among other things , ' Icy Planets ' , another mission to the outer planets of the solar system , ' Prism ' , a mission to measure the cosmic background radiation , and the ' Exoplanet Finder ' , which is to detect and investigate ersonic planets .	-6.6229
Proposals for the return of samples from Mars , the study of moon , Venus and asteroids and solar physics are already withdrawn .	-5.5989
Snowden willing to “ cooperate with Germany on US surveillance . ”	-2.3017
Edward Snowden , the whistleblower of the US intelligence service , has said that he is ready to travel to Berlin and to say ahead of the German Bundestag , if the National Security Agency and its director , Keith Alexander , do not provide answers to their activities .	-5.7648
The German MEP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden in Russia on Thursday in order to discuss what he said in Germany .	-3.4218
In a letter from Snowden presented to the media in Berlin on Friday by Ströbele , he writes : “ Even though the result of my efforts was demonstrably positive , my government continues to treat a divergent opinion as a breach of loyalty and to criminalise political expression with a threat of impunity , in which no defence is possible . ”	-6.7322
But telling the truth is not a crime .	-1.7117
In the letter , Snowden writes that he is convinced that support from the international community can convince the American government to drop the charge .	-4.1603
The indictment issued by the US Department of Justice includes spying and theft of state property .	-2.4602
Germany ’ s Home Affairs Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich said online , “ If Mr Snowden is ready to talk to German representatives , we will find ways to make that possible . ”	-4.5974
Relations between the US and Germany are tainted by the allegations that Chancellor Angela Merkel ’ s cellular phone has heard .	-4.6124
Thomas Oppermann , the MEP who is chairing the parliamentary committee responsible for the secret service , said that one should take the opportunity to listen to Snowden as a witness , if possible , “ without jeopardizing him and completely destroying relations with the US . ”	-5.3941
Ströbele , a Green MEP , published a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed .	-2.6671
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia .	-1.7758
Ströbele explained that , according to former NSA employee , Snowden cannot return to Russia if he leaves the country .	-4.4441
When Snowden says in Germany , he needs an assurance that he is “ safe ” there , according to the honourable Member .	-4.2200
In his letter , Snowden declared that he was facing a “ serious and ongoing ” campaign of persecution that expelled him from his home country .	-3.9979
It is , however , affected by the global response to “ my act of political expression . ”	-2.7929
Citizens around the world , as well as high-ranking politicians – including in the United States – have called revelations about an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance a merit for the general public .	-4.3258
In his letter , Snowden makes an offer of cooperation to the German authorities “ when the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation have been resolved . ”	-3.4047
Frontier Airlines charging for hand baggage	-2.5612
Frontier Airlines is planning to request up to $ 100 of passengers who wish to avoid cabin baggage on their flight .	-5.5160
Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to $ 100 for one piece of hand baggage and $ 2 for coffee or lemonade , even if the announcement on Wednesday read that passengers should keep all can .	-4.2046
The new fee is for hand baggage in the baggage compartment above the seat , small bags under the seat are still free of charge .	-3.9519
Frontier explained that US $ 25 will be charged if the fee is paid in advance , and US $ 100 for travelers who paid only at the platform .	-5.8242
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O 'Malley said that the fee of USD 100 is intended to encourage travellers to take care of their payment in advance .	-4.6130
“ We don ’ t want to calculate this amount , ” she explained .	-2.4359
Airlines started to charge for the first and second piece of baggage in 2008 .	-2.7480
Passengers who have tried to avoid this have taken as much as possible into their hand baggage , which means that luggage compartments are often overcrowded above the seat .	-7.0079
Charges are a way of getting passengers on board less .	-2.9843
O 'Malley said that the new fee is not really about making money .	-1.6326
We are talking about the most loyal customers of Frontier , who would have clearly said that it would be more and more difficult to find a place in the trade above the seat .	-6.4994
Passengers who purchase tickets on the airline 's website do not have to pay .	-2.2111
This means that , under certain circumstances , a passenger may have to carry a piece of baggage free of charge on the platform of Frontier , but the next person must pay $ 100 for a similar piece of baggage .	-5.4485
O 'Malley explained that Frontier 's website and check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers are informed of the charge before coming to the airport .	-4.2984
Frontier 's new hand baggage fee will only enter into force in the summer , and there is no exact date yet .	-4.7919
Passengers often contract baggage surcharges and other charges , but airlines are happy to support them .	-3.8069
They argue that baggage transportation should cost money and passengers should pay that service if they wish .	-3.4899
Many on Wall Street see new baggage charges as a sign that airlines take enough money to cover air travel costs after years of losses .	-3.7924
Most of them , however , have left the finger of fees for hand baggage .	-5.0929
Spirit Airlines Inc. demanded three years ago first hand baggage charges , and later Allegiant Air , also followed by a low-cost airline .	-4.5732
The only other airline with such a charge is the Hungarian Wizz Air , the airline consultant Jay Sorensen , who closely follows the additional charges .	-3.8340
In a December 2011 report , he estimated that the carry-on baggage cost would raise $ 50 million a year .	-5.1132
Sorensen , who previously held a leading position on Midwest Airlines , recently flown with Spirit , and was curious what he would expect from the platform if passengers were faced with the unusual hand baggage charge of the company .	-6.0937
“ The boarding process was one of the most smooth I have seen in my career in aviation , ” he said .	-3.6277
I expected to see knuckles and hands-on discussions at the platform .	-3.3792
“ The plane was full , ” he declared , “ and boarding ran as much as it was . ”	-2.9383
Frontier also follows Spirit at the 2 dollars required for coffee , tea , lemonade or juice .	-2.8644
The company explained that passengers who bought lemonade or juice should keep all can and coffee will be refilled free of charge .	-4.2831
Water is still free .	-1.1433
US Airways had briefly attempted to demand money for soft drinks in 2008 , but it reversed seven months later after passengers complained and no other large company had been retreated .	-5.7438
Frontier ’ s move to charge for hand baggage if passengers do not purchase them directly from the airline is the latest initiative to direct customers to their own website .	-5.6264
Carriers pay online travel agencies such as Orbitz 10-25 US dollars per ticket sold .	-2.5731
This gives all companies an incentive to move passengers to direct sales rather than through an online travel agency .	-4.4244
Frontier , however , has gone furthest in this area .	-1.7813
In September , the company began booking through an online travel agency with just half the number of frequent flyer miles .	-4.9619
On Wednesday , miles were once again reduced to 25 % of the route .	-2.6310
A flight with Frontier over 1000 miles is reserved for a third party provider , so customers only take 250 miles .	-6.0069
Passengers can also book seats only on Frontier 's website when they buy them directly .	-4.6182
Frontier has a loyal customer base at its headquarters in Denver , but the business is shrinking and the company is losing money .	-7.7725
The revenue fell by 9 % and the flight capacity shrunk just under 13 % in the first quarter , as read in the financial report published on Wednesday by parent company Republic Airways Holdings Inc .	-10.2416
Republic has attempted to control the finances of Frontier as part of the sales of society .	-3.6082
Speaking Words Out of the Bible	-2.9700
A good 40 women visited this year 's last breakfast in the Protestant parish of Biingen .	-3.8777
The theme of the day in common was " proverbs from the Bible " and " speeches from the Middle Ages " .	-4.5122
After breakfast , Zita Köhler , the chairman of the parish council , entered into a lecture on the biblical proverbs .	-3.9769
" Spacious words contain vitality , regulations , or warnings , " she explained .	-3.3303
She compared several proverbs with the corresponding posts and explained the meaning .	-4.3841
They called sayings like : Holzauge is vigilant as scales fall from the eyes , throw an eye on someone who gives his own to sleep , wash his hands of innocence .	-6.3436
Several times , the speaker asked their listeners what proverb it was .	-4.1779
Speaking from the Middle Ages , the parish of church Christel Dehner accepted : all good things are three , make a little blue , breathe a .	-5.9834
She explained the importance and origin of the speeches she called ' bridges to the past ' .	-2.3674
Finally a raffle was lost .	-2.4278
The prizes were concealed on a table and were choosed humorously before they were handed over to the winners .	-5.2772
Among the visitors of the breakfast round , the mayor 's candidate Roman Waizenegger also met .	-4.6991
Learning instead of unemployed : pilot project for disabled people in tourism	-2.2931
A pilot project for the tourism industry started at Mecklenburgische Seenplatte .	-2.0900
Under the leadership of the Federal Labour Agency , 49 men and women who already work as unskilled in the industry are to be qualified for hotels and restaurants over three winter months .	-5.1333
" The new thing is that the six months of graduation courses end , " said Carmen Wiechert of the work agency Neubrandenburg .	-4.2639
The benefits are varied : participants would not be unemployed , firms would have trained professionals who were increasingly missing in hotels and restaurants , and the agency would not have to finance unemployment .	-5.5016
The project also includes the Chamber of Commerce in Neubrandenburg and the German Hotel and Restaurant Association ( Dehoga ) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern .	-3.2064
NSA declares that an “ internal error ” and not hackers are to blame for the crash of the site .	-3.5180
The flawed National Security Agency declared on late Friday that a mistake had paralyzed its public website for a few hours , not hackers , as was claimed online .	-4.7122
“ NSA.gov was unreachable for several hours this night as an internal error occurred during a planned update , ” the spy agency explained in a message sent by e-mail .	-5.0868
The problem will be fixed this evening .	-1.6758
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed denial of service attack ( DDoS ) was not true .	-2.2901
During the early evening , online server trackers noticed that the NSA website was not available for at least six hours and is still not available for some users .	-4.2532
Previously , a NSA spokesman told ABC News that the Authority ’ s sensitive internal network was “ in no way ” compromised .	-3.7700
Secret information is not in danger , according to the speaker .	-2.4410
At least a group of hacktivists claimed to have paralyzed the NSA website with a DDoS attack .	-1.9106
In such an attack , the target site is flooded with page views until the servers are overloaded and the website collapses .	-4.4190
Cybertactics are relatively simple and the attacks are not designed to penetrate the internal network of the target system .	-2.8625
The former supersecret NSA , whose nickname once was No Search Agency ( none of which was such an authority ) , now finds itself in a bright light , and has been stolen and published by disillusioned former NSA employee Edward Snowden , after the revelations of its extensive surveillance program at home and abroad .	-9.2426
The growing controversy surrounding the secret service fueled initial speculation that the incident today was the result of targeted cyperoperation .	-3.9422
The number of people without jobs fell slightly in October by 22 to 1.307 .	-2.8007
Although the rate of 3.1 % is better than last year and even better than in September , " we would have hoped for more " , says Monika Felter-Bauer , Deputy Director of the Employment Agency in Sonthofen .	-5.0753
The fact is that many farms have so far responded with attitudes .	-4.8837
According to Field Bauer , one reason for this is : " We have hardly any skilled workers in the craft , healthcare and care of the elderly " .	-5.8908
Since September , job openings for staff in the hotel and catering industries are also being made due to the seasonal situation .	-7.3440
The winter season starts mid December .	-2.5297
The entire background report can be found in the Allgäuer Ad leaf of 31.10.2013 ( page 33 ) .	-4.8487
The Loss of Bombardier After Shipping and Returns	-4.7711
On Thursday , the Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15-percent decline in net profits after being pressurized by declining orders and deliveries of third quarter aircraft , as well as contract problems in the railway sector .	-6.0523
Bombardier , based in Montreal , did not publish any flight test data for his brand new plane of the CSeries , and did not receive any new information about whether the aircraft could enter commercial use under the ambitious schedule next September .	-6.4739
The maiden flight of the test aircraft one and a half months ago was followed by only three further starts , which makes it doubtful whether the test phase is scheduled .	-5.5164
The results remained behind the forecasts and led to a rate of more than eight percent on the Toronto stock exchange .	-4.8399
On Thursday , Cameron Doersen , Analyst at National Bank Financial , downgraded his rating from “ outperform ” to “ sector performance ” with a view to a limited price potential in the next one to two quarters .	-5.4799
“ While weaker deliveries on aircraft were widely expected , we are clearly disappointed by the march in the transport sector , ” said Doersen in a customer .	-7.1665
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries when the test program for the aircraft is progressing .	-9.6664
However , if no new orders are announced in the coming months , we expect the market to become more sceptical about the programme .	-3.0666
Bombardier hopes that the CSseries of aircraft will be able to catapult the company into the lower market segment currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus .	-4.4900
The first test aircraft was presented to the public in March and first flew in September after months of delays .	-3.0719
But , so far , binding orders for the CSries are moderate at 177 , as potential buyers want to wait for the results of the flight tests and see whether the company ’ s claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost savings potential are appropriate for the new jet transport aircraft .	-6.8389
There are currently 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies .	-2.1501
Chairman Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will reach its target of 300 binding orders at the beginning of commercial use .	-3.6184
On Thursday , the company ’ s management assured the analysts and the media that the programme would be part of the schedule .	-5.1683
“ The test aircraft no longer remained on the ground than expected , ” Beaudoin said at a telephone conference and added that while the aircraft was still standing , ground tests and software updates were scheduled .	-5.7007
Each manufacturer plans differently .	-1.2286
We have decided to take a first flight and then apply a review period , as we have done .	-3.7802
This is happening throughout the programme .	-3.2920
The second , out of five test aircraft , is expected to start in the next few weeks , the remaining ones shortly afterwards , said the company 's side .	-5.6538
However , analysts remain sceptical as to whether , twelve months after the maiden flight , the first customer can operate a CSries aircraft .	-5.9746
Bombardier explained it will review the start-up plan ( EIS ) and will update it in the coming months .	-3.7096
“ The slow progress of the flight test – though it appears to be in line with internal planning bombings – reinforces our view that commissioning will shift to the first quarter of 2015 , ” said Doersen .	-5.7382
In the third quarter at the end of September , Bombardier ’ s net income fell to $ 147 million , and $ 8 cents per share of $ 172 million , or $ 9 cents per share , a year earlier .	-4.7671
The adjusted earnings per share is the same as 9 cents .	-2.5142
Sales declined slightly from 4.2 to 4.1 billion dollars .	-7.4228
Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and a turnover of 4.56 billion dollars , according to Thomson Reuters I / B / E / S.	-3.2864
The world ’ s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer says it has delivered 45 aircraft in this quarter , a decline of 57 last year .	-4.0120
Net orders declined from 83 aircraft to 26 .	-2.0377
The order book in the Space Division was $ 32.9 billion on 30 September and was therefore unchanged on 31 December .	-4.0985
“ In the field of aerospace , the results were within the framework of our targets , but the low intake of orders and overall market conditions were disappointing , ” said Beaudoin .	-4.2753
Aerospace revenues fell by 13 % to $ 2 billion .	-3.1541
Bombardier , the world ’ s largest railway manufacturer , announced that sales in this sector increased by almost 11 % to $ 2.1 billion .	-3.8983
The order book in the transport sector was $ 32.6 billion on 30 September and was thus slightly increased against 31 December .	-3.8142
The profit margin for transport was affected by settlement problems with some large contracts .	-3.5148
According to the management , new benchmarks will be set for the fourth quarter .	-3.4393
In the afternoon trading on Thursday , Bombardier stock dropped by 8.5 % and stood at 4.83 Canadian dollars , after it was announced that Google ’ s Board of Finance will move Patrick Pichette to the Board of Directors .	-6.4049
On Thursday , Brazilian Embraer SA , the world ’ s third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and bombinder ’ s closest rival , reported a ten-percent decline in quarterly earnings .	-3.6737
The US : Protests at Los Angeles Airport	-2.0503

Cocaine-based lawyer who warned drug boss about police investigation must be imprisoned .	-3.5493
Basharat Ditta , 42 , gave information to Neil Scarborough Underworld Size .	-3.3314
The Prosecutor was Fear that his secret drug addiction could come to light .	-3.2706
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpooler Crown Court .	-1.6471
A well-known criminal defender who warned a drug baron against a major police investigation because he was afraid that his secret drug addiction could be discovered was sentenced to three years in prison .	-4.2477
Basharat Ditta , 42 , subworld size Neil Scarborough provided sensitive information on investigating its activities in drug trafficking after compromised by its own cocaine addiction .	-4.8583
The “ first class ” lawyer , who was praised by criminalists with the nickname “ Bash ” , was arrested in his house in 2011 , after police overseeing Scarborough , which he had advocated in a previous drug trial .	-6.1467
Officials observed how Scarborough ( 32 ) delivered three bags of cocaine to the house of lawyer in Blackburn , Lancashire , while he was with colleagues at a bar meal .	-4.2816
The investigation revealed that Ditta regularly consumed Class A drugs after tests found traces of cocaine in his hair , wallets , and credit cards .	-3.4446
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011 , he attempted to obtain unauthorized information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners .	-3.2487
All four suspects were then supervised by the police in the context of a major investigation into the heroin and cocaine trade in Lancashire , Cumbria , Merseyside , Berkshire and West Yorkshire .	-3.5672
Together with 32 other people , they were arrested later , after the police secured Heroin and Cocaine worth <unk> 1.5 million and <unk> 200,000 of cash in a number of house searches .	-5.3759
Ditta , 42 , gave information to the criminals because he feared that his drug addiction could become public .	-3.1725
Today , Ditta , who works for Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn , was found guilty and convicted on the Liverpooler Crown Court after a three-week trial on two charges of obstructing justice .	-4.7831
He admitted the cocaine property during a previous survey .	-3.6316
The lawyer was transferred after the police found out in their investigations against Scarborough that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011 .	-3.5606
Two investigators followed the suspect and saw how he went to Ditta ’ s house , putting the drugs under the bar ’ s garbage cans with a purity of 60 % .	-5.0657
Shortly after he had delivered the drugs , Scarborough regularly telephone Ditta , who was in the football stadium of Blackburn Rovers in Ewood Park .	-3.7073
The lawyer returned home , obtained the drugs , and then nine messages were exchanged between the two .	-2.9772
The court noted that Ditta was a “ regular consumption ” of cocaine after class-A tests discovered in his hair , wallet , and credit cards .	-4.1057
Ditta was later arrested , but dissented to take cocaine and said he spoke to the presumptive Dealer because he was his client , claiming that her discussion was “ attorney secrecy . ”	-5.7085
During his arrest , Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards , but they were assured and he was taken from a hair sample .	-5.3022
In the case of police questioning he said that he is conducting an office at his private address as well as at the workplace and he would call him at home for legal matters .	-12.8984
It became known to the courts that he had called for important drug trafficking players , some of whom had been represented before , and informed them of what investigators knew about them .	-6.7324
Public prosecutor Anne Whyte said : “ A criminal prosecutor should know better than anyone else that the law is not broken . ”	-3.3720
Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal defender because he has been too busy with certain clients .	-5.1754
The relationship in question is not simply one of a drug trafficker , but one of drug traffickers who supply drugs to their lawyers .	-4.7002
Some of his communications were undoubtedly legitimate , because he was the advocate of these people .	-3.6530
But that went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between lawyer and client .	-2.7472
He provided assistance to police investigations as far as possible , so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities . .	-7.5528
This brought Mr Ditta 's profession into disrepute .	-3.7433
He was too close to certain clients , especially Scarborough , and allowed his independence to be compromised .	-2.2129
Ditta objected to any misconduct : “ If I were a corrupt lawyer , which I am not , and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough , I would not wait 15 hours , but do it immediately . ”	-5.3578
But , after the hearing , Superintendent Lee Halstead of the Lancashire police said : “ Mr Ditta took the step from a criminal defender to a criminal at the moment when he started to buy drugs from organised criminals . ”	-4.7252
His cocaine dependence led to a hopeless compromise and made him susceptible to the motives of leading members of organised crime who instructed him to obtain valuable information on police investigations .	-3.5840
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure public confidence and confidence .	-2.3271
Ditta has lost that trust and tried to hide behind the façade of his profession .	-3.3479
The Lancashire Serious and Organised Crime Unit led the investigations against Ditta , which also led to condemnation in three cases on account of the cocaine ownership and impediment to justice , which underlines our determination to bring criminals to justice .	-5.2962
This case should be a warning to criminals and show that none of us can escape the arm of the law .	-3.6356
We find you and bring you to court .	-2.1049
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after he found guilty of conspiracy to heroin , cocaine , and cannabis trading .	-3.0090
Thirty-five other people involved in drug trafficking have been sentenced to total penalties of 153 for drug offences .	-3.5640
On his website , Ditta published a range of questions and answers about himself suggesting that his dream job is to represent clients on death row in America as a lawyer , his ultimate guest at dinner is Mohammed Ali and inequality of opportunity is the motivation for his work .	-4.5636
Revolutionary Music Works	-1.8833
At the end of the celebrations on the occasion of its 160-year existence , the Liederkranz Dunningen will frame two services with Franz Schubert 's " Deutsche Messe " .	-3.8708
After the great success of the music " Rock my Life " , which was attended by the spectators in the spring of this year , the song crank will enrich two services with the performance of Franz Schubert 's German fair at the end of the anniversary year .	-6.5128
On Saturday , October 26th , this extraordinary fair will be heard from 19 during the evening fair in the St. Martino Church of Dunningen and on Sunday 27th October at the St. Johannes Baptistkirche in Lackendorf from 10.15 a.m.	-6.0714
The " Deutsche Messe " with the original title " singing to celebrate the Holy Sacrifice of the Messe " , D 872 , is a spiritual musician of the composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was almost revolutionary at the time of its birth .	-6.7049
The fair is presented in the context of the services , as the client Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind .	-4.5951
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider , the choir is accompanied by the group of the music association Frohstur Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi at the organ .	-4.8855
Haslach : Skepticism Softs Prosperity	-3.8701
In 2015 , for example , in the Haslach ( SE ) Peaceful Community Unit , basic legends will change .	-10.0965
There is then only one common parish unit for all six parish parish parish posts .	-3.8719
On Saturday , the committees from Haslach , Hofstetten , Mühlenbach , Fischerbach , Steinach and Welchensteinach prepared themselves for the changes .	-3.5330
The fundamental decisions of diocese no longer need to be amended and it is up to the parish communities to implement them as satisfactorily as possible .	-4.3437
During the course of the day , it became particularly clear : skepticism about the new gives way hesitant but growing confidence .	-6.2895
From the ideas and expectations of the innovations in 2015 to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the parish council , the highly constructive discussions of the six bodies with the main official of the Lions Council were held .	-7.2008
According to a presentation , regional dean Georg Schmitt explained the newly adopted guidelines for naval correction units in the Archdiocese Freiburg .	-4.5718
After that , the SE Haslach , as a church community , will form a public law body , which will enter into the rights and duties of the six church communities so far .	-6.3827
There will only be a common parish council and a board of foundations representing the parish power .	-3.8619
At least two elected members shall be represented from each parish , in the six parish teams are formed .	-4.3395
Their future task will be to promote church life in the village .	-3.7593
When it came to the finances of the individual parish communities , there was considerable need for discussion .	-4.5389
The innovations provide that accumulated funds will be kept in the parish heights earmarked .	-5.5653
The liabilities , by contrast , cover the whole community .	-3.8726
It was precisely in view of the large planned investments , the commitment of which all the parishes made , that there was great concern .	-6.4541
" Even in the past , only investments have been made in projects that were managed by individual parish owners alone , " Haslach 's parish chairman , Bruno Prinzbach .	-5.5633
Practical experience with a common body for five parishes depicted Barbar Knights , the chairman of the body in the Schutterwald Neuried , in the Seelsorgein .	-7.9121
In 2006 , they set themselves the task of " becoming one , staying five " , and found that this is not so easy .	-6.3497
The authorities of the Haslach Lakespeare Council then decided to answer the questions on the future composition and size of the common parish council and the practical work of the community teams .	-7.5968
The preparations will be finalised at further meetings and will be adopted at another joint meeting of all six bodies next spring .	-5.3688
In the end , the parish council Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the Seelsorgein , which was approved by a clear majority .	-4.6941
In Püllendorf , the Electricity of Time	-4.3575
The citizens of Pflüllendorf must prepare for higher electricity costs .	-3.8442
As the city ’ s managing director , Jörg-Arne Bias , has confirmed to the S<unk>DKURIER , a four-person Pflüllendorfer family has increased costs between 70 and 90 Euros per year .	-6.2890
Essential reason for the upcoming price increase is the increase in the so-called EEG conversion from 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt-hour .	-4.5568
This conversion is reinstated every year in October by the four operators of the big electricity lines .	-5.5135
These are the additional costs that they will incur from the energy transition , which they will be able to charge by leveraging the electricity price .	-7.0226
The town walls of Pflullendorf form the last link in this chain .	-3.9507
The supervisory board of the energy company , in its forecasts , even assumed a higher levy , as Jörg-Arne Bias reports .	-3.4815
Now the concrete figures would have to be calculated before the town works could inform their customers about the exact price increase next week .	-4.8251
" We are moving from an increase of 1 cent plus x , " said Bias , where the figure would be closer to the 2 cent .	-3.7510
Ensuring Temperature Ampel	-4.2330
Sometimes a traffic light will not get green .	-2.9988
The contact loop in the street does not react , or the sign of light is faulty .	-3.8303
What should we do - drive with red ?	-4.4791
If a person has waited long enough at a red light and the intersection is free , he can continue , explains Ralf Becker in the magazine " Motorrad " .	-3.7474
The waiting time must be " reasonable " , which can be interpreted differently on a case-by-case basis .	-3.7976
Becker advises you to stay at least five minutes before any disturbance to the traffic light can occur .	-5.7247
If you continue the journey despite the red light , however , you must be aware that it is entirely to blame for an accident caused by this .	-6.0144
If you tolerate less than five minutes , you may not wait long enough , warn Becker and refer to a decision of the Supreme Court of Hamm .	-4.9583
In the negotiated case , a driver ignored the traffic lights after about three minutes and was responsible for a negligent red light violation .	-4.7850
The traffic lights were not broken , but jumped green a little later .	-4.2390
He was spared a travel ban because of the special situation - the fine not .	-4.0083
The Joint Council looks forward to a solid budget	-2.4194
Whenever it comes to the budget in municipal meetings , mayors Ralph Gerster laughed .	-4.0108
The municipal backlash in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and the administration has not known since 2005 .	-3.8044
In this sense , the 2012 financial year is also a success .	-3.3437
This became clear when the annual accounts were presented for 2012 .	-2.3994
As Andrea Rothmund pointed out , the administrative budget amounted to around EUR 7.6 million over a million more than was planned .	-3.6552
The surplus of the administrative budget , too , is around EUR 1.8 million above the approach .	-3.6284
The surplus is due mainly to higher commercial tax revenue and the share of the community in the income tax .	-4.7480
The asset budget , too , was well above the planned values .	-3.9567
Instead of the EUR 1.5 million envisaged , it was EUR 2.5 million last year .	-2.3544
" This is essentially due to the increase in administrative expenditure , " says Rothmund .	-3.9770
Since less investment has been made than planned in the 2012 financial year , the return of waste has also increased .	-5.8394
Overall , the overall reserve has been increased by around EUR 2.1 million to a total of EUR 4.9 million .	-2.5447
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for their good work .	-2.1187
" Such a work is not simply shaken out of the sleeve , " Gerster praised with a view to the annual accounts .	-3.4773
He and the local councils clearly enjoyed the good figures .	-2.5406
It may sound paradoxical , but these very good figures could soon be expensive for the citizens .	-4.0450
In the past , due to the good financial situation , the community has had to renounce high levies .	-6.8352
In turn , Gerster said that subsidies had often been cut off from the country .	-4.9284
There are conditions for these grants from various sources of compensation .	-3.1696
Among other things , the cities and municipalities that apply for grants must provide certain levies .	-5.3407
" We have to look at the issue of heaps , because in the years to come there are investments that we would like to have subsidies , " said Gerster .	-6.3799
Nagold : Hugo Wermter in the Choir for 60 years	-2.1529
With 60 years as a singer , Hubert Wermter ’ s story is almost twice as long as that of the autumn festival in which he was honoured solemnly .	-4.7991
As usual , Hubert Wermter stood on stage in the colours of his male association .	-4.2803
After 60 years of singing with the choir , he still enjoys singing .	-6.1577
Wermter was also active as a member of the committee for 28 years .	-3.0452
He received several awards for his commitment and association : Jörg Kohr , Pastoralreferent on behalf of the Association of Caecilia Rottenburg-Stuttgart , presented him - since the choir is also a church choir - a certificate of the association and an honorary letter signed by Bishop Gebhard Fürst .	-6.1621
His singers presented him with the certificate of the German choir association and a engraved tin plate .	-10.4742
Besides the recognition , the 31st Autumn Festival took place in popular courses : With the MGV Vie , the Liederkranz Salzstetten , the Baisingen and the local music association , the vollmaringer had loaded a colourful mix of choirs and vocal styles , which kept about 400 visitors .	-8.7577
MGV All-Marringen opened its doors with attractive songs such as " Im Weinparadise " and " Lustig , her brothers " .	-4.4400
They prepared a little stand for their honorary Hubert Wermter - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart 's " Bundeslied " .	-3.9312
The Männergesangverein Vie also sang classic choral songs such as " Jägerwerben " by Julius Wengerben , " Weit , far away " by Hubert Goisern and the folk song " When you go through the valley " .	-4.9413
The Liederkranz Salzstetten , with his mixed choir and female group - " Impulschor " - provided the women 's quota of the festival .	-5.6960
Antos Gus ' mixed choir abducted from the Neapolitan people ' Santa Lucia ' and ' Eviva Espana ' in foreign countries , while the ' impulsor ' also resorted to foreign languages : ' Liberatio ' and ' Hey Jude ' were part of their programme .	-4.9730
The singer department of the Baisinger Sportverein came back to home with " What is the Schwab ? " of Hans Süssmuth and Robert Papperts " Bierlied " , where the Vollmaringer Musikverein was the crowning musical conclusion .	-6.3684
For the children there was a small side programme - " Oma Hanne " alias Hannelore Stollsteimer performed a Casterltheater and read a few stories which the children spent the lunchtime well .	-7.2915

It will be delivered to the nursery on the agreed day and will then be processed directly by the helpers .	-3.5583
Helpers can be parents , grandparents , friends , associations and , of course , educators and children themselves .	-2.5004
Kenya ’ s press outraged about controversial media law	-2.6571
“ We are in a frightening situation , and one might wonder : what does Parliament think of simply abolishing judicial independence tomorrow ? ” was read in the newspaper , which considers the draft law unconstitutional .	-6.8752
“ The law is draconian and very criminal , and we reject it , ” said Cyrus Kamau , Managing Director of the Capital Group , which also includes Capital FM , one of Kenya ’ s most respected independent radio stations and news sites .	-4.1566
He said that the new media tribunal “ will always be biased , because it is an extended arm of government , ” and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya ’ s position in the global economy .	-2.9254
“ I hope the President will listen to us and we appeal to him to reject this draft legislation and send it back to Parliament , ” he said .	-2.8965
According to The Star newspaper , the government effectively embraces a stranglehold through the new law “ the media . ” On the other hand , the standard , democracy , and freedom of speech in Kenya would have suffered “ a severe blow , ” and called it “ draconian . ”	-6.1174
The adoption of the law is part of a series of measures to strengthen national security in the aftermath of the attacks by armed Islamists on the Westgate shopping centre in September .	-3.6605
The Kenyan media caught the authorities ’ wrath by releasing pictures of security cameras on which to see how the units dispatched at the scene supposedly bolted the luxurious shopping centre .	-6.5842
Police chief David Kimaiyo reacted to interfere with the appointment of two journalists and a leading media representative , even if the subpoena was withdrawn after a media outcry .	-4.4909
According to the new law , media houses can be subject to a penalty of up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists with up to one million and the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation .	-4.7596
The Tribunal also has the right to confiscate the possession of those affected if a penalty is not paid .	-3.3498
According to Daily Nation , “ a single penalty can push most radio stations into bankruptcy . ”	-3.0244
Moreover , the newspaper believes that these measures could have a devastating effect on Kenya ’ s description of “ lively blogosphere . ”	-3.2210
If they silence the media , politicians could do things with impunity wherever they want .	-3.7771
“ No one will ever hear it , ” wrote Mutuma Mathiu , a national journalist , who calls the Kenyan media a crucial factor in public life .	-4.6549
“ Leave politicians themselves , run the country into bankruptcy , and return to the time of hunters and collectors , ” he commented .	-3.7518
Kenyan legislators have had public trouble in the past .	-3.1793
In May , they voted to reverse the cuts ordered by the national compensation commission and reintroduce their defective salaries of around 532,000 shilling tax-free per month – one of the world ’ s highest .	-5.2015
Bad-Dürrheim : A Dream Comes for the FC	-2.6868
In spite of the cold weather and rain , the official artistic rafting celebration of the city and the football club had nothing to do with the importance for the city .	-7.0432
Everyone hoped for a more pleasant holiday last Saturday , but Peter did not want to play .	-3.5961
So all those who came without a umbrella or could not keep one for some reason .	-4.4734
This was the same as many speakers for the musicians who framed the ceremony .	-4.5862
Nass was also named after FC leader Albrecht Schnenker , who spoke of fulfilling a dream .	-5.2754

This remarkable volunteer commitment also earned the compatriot Karl Rombach .	-3.8424
Other greeting words were for the urban sports committee Hubert Baier , the district chairman of the South Baden Football Association , Kuno Kayan , and Friedrich Knorr of the Planning Office , who announced a donation to the Club Youth Department .	-4.9998
Mayor Klumpp reminded us that recurring weather-related influences took place in spring and autumn in such a way that he could not be played .	-4.4369
Fifteen years ago , there was the first thought of solving the problem when it was thought of building a third place in the area of the football club or at the Realschule on Saline Lake .	-6.8245
Both were rejected again .	-2.0725
Six years ago , ideas were born to create an artificial grass pitch , which was generally considered the ultimate solution .	-5.3071
Concrete planning was started two years ago , when the FC took over the Schabelstube in Erbflecht , pledged a cost share of EUR 100 000 to build the place , and approved funding of EUR 104 000 .	-5.7131
In October 2012 , the municipal council decided to take over the remaining EUR 356 000 in the total cost of EUR 560 000 , and made Klumpp together .	-5.1643

Trains on highways were threatened , which are already accident focal points .	-5.7783
The introduction of a toll on all cars would also be a first step from Pronold 's point of view .	-3.4832

As Airport-Presenter Peter Kleemann announced to Radio Vienna , Vienna Airport is following the cessation of surveys affecting individuals , an international trend .	-4.7219
For example , airports in Copenhagen , Frankfurt or Dubai are already renouncing loud calls .	-3.9436
The absence of these surveys - on average , around 200 personal calls by the speakers a day - is intended to make it more peaceful at the airport in future .	-7.2575
" It has also been shown in experience that these individual surveys have been seen relatively little , but at the same time all other information on changes to flights or departures here is somewhat lost " , says Kleemann in talks with the radio station .	-8.0062

The new oplage shines with a new cafe .	-2.9520
One that invites you to linger and return .	-4.7530
One that wants to make the name of the program .	-2.2645
According to Lexicon , Déjà Vu refers to a psychological phenomenon that is expressed in the sense that a new situation has already been experienced or seen .	-4.4790
In the case of a visit to the homonymous café at the Opschlag in the district town of Kleve within sight of the Rhine-Waal University , it does not have to remain with the pure sense of déjà Vu .	-6.9560
After all , the café with its beautiful name has exactly the aim of making a real stay not only thoughtful but also handproof .	-8.0186
Because it 's fun and simple is beautiful .	-2.9374
A glance into the inner life of the Opschlag 8 immediately gives the viewer a good feeling .	-4.5926
The modern , but not cool , café ambience looks like a place to feel good .	-3.9311
Here the team treats the guests with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the top of the hotel with a variety of coffees and cocktails .	-5.7708
There are delicious cakes and individually lit fresh baguettes .	-3.3211
The owners , both 33 years old , have already made a name in Kranenburg before the opening of the pretty café at the Opschlag as a restaurant .	-7.4777
The sympathetic café fans hope for more audiences from the move to Kleve to the Opera .	-6.9394
Not least by the university .	-3.0859
" Where we do not have a specific target group , " Daniel Büttner stresses .	-3.3065
Instead , the two here would like to address young students as well as seniors and all ages in between .	-9.6590

Two events were held in the bright café .	-3.0450
Better to say one .	-1.2010
After all , the port festival took place outside - Café Déjà Vu did not have the benefit of it .	-4.6906
But there was also a pinch evening .	-4.2343
" Good , successful and funny , " the two 33-year-olds found .	-3.2371
But it is not everyone 's business .	-2.2561
Perhaps even for that reason , Daniel Büttner is not an outspoken fan of Events evenings : " You can 't make everyone right now . "	-10.0100
And with an event , I only speak to those who are interested in the special event .	-4.1409
Therefore , events will be the exception with us .	-2.6428
" We want to disrupt the normal business as little as possible " .	-2.6919
Let us say that Déjà Vu also stands for reliability .	-3.0848
With regard to the quality of the products offered here , as well as to the team and the beautiful surroundings at the Opschen in Kleve .	-4.4593
The road that is gradually becoming a gastronomic part .	-4.1900

UN proclaims New Poverty Reduction Goals	-1.8889
The United Nations is starting from now on to draw up a series of new objectives to replace the Millennium Development Goals announced twelve years ago to combat poverty .	-4.9946
In the run-up to the UN Sustainable Development Summit , which started in Rio de Janeiro in the evening , Australian diplomats played a key role in promoting “ sustainable development goals ” to replace the 2015 Millennium Goals .	-3.5230
They have been included in the final draft of the document that will be adopted at the summit by world leaders , including Mrs Gillard .	-2.9833
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon declared in the evening at the summit that the time had come to “ think beyond national interests . ”	-3.8514
“ I am pleased that Member States have agreed to embark on a process to agree on universal , sustainable development goals , ” he said .	-3.7501
“ These objectives will build on our progress from the MDGs and will form an integral part of the post-2015 framework .	-3.2347
I will spare no effort to implement this mandate given to me by member states to realize our vision of the sustainable development goals that build on the success of the Millennium Goals . ”	-4.1699
Even if the SG Achim / Baden has not been a victory for four days , the handball league continues to maintain a good mood .	-6.0660
Trainer Tomasz Malmon leaves no doubt about this .	-2.8494
Everyone remains fully motivated to deal with the matter .	-3.2779
Nevertheless , I hope that we will finally win again .	-8.8195
" After all , I don 't know how such a victory tastes , " Malmon expects a success from his team at VfL Fredensbeck II .	-4.8596
Even though Fredenbeck ’ s Third Liga Reserve has not pulled out trees , Malmon is warning the pointer .	-6.0400
I have trained many players myself in the A-youth .	-4.0526
Therefore , they will certainly be very motivated against their ex-coach .	-3.6308
" In addition , it is important to wait if there is still some reinforcement from the first one , " explains the SG-Coach .	-6.0901
To finally return to the track of success , the Malmon team must definitely increase compared to the previous performances .	-4.5356
Above all in the cover work and in the switching gear it hapered enormously .	-6.8557
Opportunities must also definitely be improved .	-2.6935
So I hope my players have finally got their heads free during the short break .	-3.6114
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing in the face of clashes between influential personalities .	-1.8734
Thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo under the watchful eye of the statue of Samora Machel , the founder of the State and the first president of Mozambique to agree to peace in a rare public demonstration .	-4.6820
“ We want peace again , we want stability , ” said Vanessa de Sousa , Managing Director of an investment company .	-2.0141
For fear of the country ’ s future , she has exchanged her business dress against a T-shirt with the inscription “ We ask for security ” in Portuguese and joined the crowd on the capital ’ s independence square on Thursday .	-7.3083
For two weeks now there have been reports of clashes between government forces and renamo , which are among the worst fighting since the peace agreement over 20 years ago .	-4.2712
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement , initially supported by White Rhodesia and later by South Africa ’ s apartheid government in an effort to destabilise the country ’ s independent government .	-4.3955
After the 1992 peace treaty , she became an opposition party .	-1.6253
Analysts believe it is unlikely that the country will return to a full-fledged conflict , but recent events have worried foreign investors and locals .	-3.7527
The stakes for the fast-growing economy are high , because the discovery of huge gas reserves off the coast and north-west coal deposits could attract investment of more than $ 50 billion from firms such as Rio Tinto , Vale from Brazil , Eni from Italy , and Anadarko from the US in the next few years .	-13.6468
The ruling Frelimo Party , the dominant force since 1975 , and Renamo are blaming each other for tensions .	-3.0155
Renamo claims that the government provoked recent clashes by attacked its members in Sofala , a traditional stronghold of Renaamos , on 17 October .	-4.0254
The attacks on the former rebels escalated when government forces attacked Renamo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlama , the leader of the group , declared Renaamos spokesman to the Financial Times .	-4.8420
The government is blaming Renaamo for the clashes , accusing the organization of attacking soldiers .	-8.1713
President Armando Guebuza has sought to diminish concerns about instability .	-2.6174
On Wednesday , against AFP , the French news agency , he said that Dhlama considered himself a “ loser , ” who “ wants to use all his remaining forces to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government . ”	-5.1249
Frelimo and Renamo both stress that they want to avoid war .	-2.4859
But the concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted as saying that Renamo is abandoning the 1992 peace agreement .	-4.3547
He declared against the FT that he meant that Frelimo would no longer respect the agreement .	-2.9772
“ Our vision is to start negotiations again , and seriously , ” Mazanga said .	-3.1840
Previous talks between the parties have done little to resolve the tensions fueled by a series of clashes this year .	-2.7880
“ We have two adult men ( Guebuza and Dhlakama ) who get together the heads , ” says Joseph Hanlon , lecturer at Open University and Mozambique expert .	-4.4416
None of them are good negotiating and no one is prepared to make the necessary concessions .	-2.6260
Renamo , who is pushing for electoral reform , has already said that she will boycott the local elections in November .	-3.0176
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year .	-5.5798
Some commentators have interpreted the use of force as an attempt at an ailing movement to gain government concessions and financial benefits .	-3.0593
Renamo ’ s electoral success has shrunk since 1992 , while a newer party , founded by a former renamo member , Movimento Democrático de Mo<unk>ambique ( MDM ) , will probably improve in the elections .	-4.7445
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – whose resignation is due when his second term ends next year – wants to destroy the country ’ s democracy .	-2.4340
“ He does not want multi-party democracy , he does not want transparent elections , he does not want peace because he does not want to give up the presidency , ” says Mazanga .	-2.9513
It is unclear what Renaamo has capacity , but it has undertaken unrest attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important North-South interconnections .	-5.3819
Most of the battles took place in Sofala province , which is located several hundred kilometres north of Maputo , but is located in Beira , the port , mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale for the export of coal .	-13.8251
In June , Rio suspended the use of the railways for a month after renamo announced an attack on the track .	-3.7150
Mazanga responded reluctantly to the question of whether Renamo would repeat this threat .	-5.8417
Renamo “ wanted to warn the international community that things are not good in Mozambique , ” said Mazanga .	-2.4995
Instability has increased the frustration over the government , says Fernando Lima , head of Mediacoop , an independent media company , because many people have already been concerned about corruption , slow progress in development and a recent wave of kidnapping .	-4.5010
“ People think that the government and the president are responsible for the country ’ s future , and that he should be the one who finds solutions to the problems , ” he explains .	-3.2195
Omar Sultane , a demonstrator , said that people simply wanted stability .	-1.7888
“ No one is interested in Renamo and Frelimo , they just want peace and usable streets again , ” he explained .	-4.6466
Children should be taught myths and legends as “ examples of life , ” an author says .	-3.0787
Thor ’ s stories showed that “ brutal power has no chance against clever tricks , ” and the Artus legend demonstrates how important it is to have a dream .	-3.0486
But many of the myths are “ far too wild , too offensive , and in some cases too dirty to be taught to schools , ” which is why Crossley-Holland argued for a “ careful selection ” of ancient works .	-4.6869
“ I find it wonderful that myths and folklore are already part of education in America , ” he said .	-1.9084
I have proposed this as a plan for twenty years .	-1.9573
He added that with authors and teachers who are “ over-didactic , ” children would be “ completely shut down , ” because , in entertaining stories , the messages would be “ submerged . ”	-5.4786
Crossley-Holland , who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon , and author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myth and British Folk Tales , said : “ You can follow certain intentions , but you should keep them in mind as much as possible . ”	-5.2050
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an author writing for children lies in the need to convey hope .	-2.9912
Not everything needs to be simplified or lead to happy ending , but there is an immense sense of good and evil .	-2.5172
This must be shown below , revealed by history and not explained .	-3.9647
This is the old story from show rather than telling .	-2.7533
Hansyakob Getting Again at Freihof	-3.1868

He was received not only by the audience with much applause , but his sister Philippine also welcomed him .	-3.2013
Billy Sum-Hermann understood it incredibly good to fit into the role of the sister and gave her an enormous life in mimic and gestures .	-5.2645
The Mühlenbacher Farmskapelle played selected music between the individual games scenes and rounded off the performance .	-5.6844
In order to awaken the Honorary Citizen 's dignity , Haslach 's mayor Heinz Winkler had the honour of making his appointment together with a part of the Town Council , representing the then holder of the .	-18.1949
Her awakening subsequently made the three king singers , who spurred Hansjakob to speak : " Oh , how beautiful , there will be youth memories of my own three-royal era alive . "	-9.0697
With their song " O Jesulia " they enjoyed the public at the patio as well as the stork day children with their loud " Edi , Edi " .	-7.3268
His criticism of the Official Church expressed Hansjakob as much at the time as his concerns about the agricultural expansions , the consequences of industrialization , or the consequences of war .	-6.5513
He found his resting place in the home , behind his tomb chapel on the fire at Hofstetten .	-4.7752
" An unquiet mind had finally found his peace and had gone forever , " it was said at the end of the scene game .	-5.6702
Many applause and many laudable words were given by the audience for the performance .	-3.2717

However , it was not possible to hear the first breath from Ludwigsburg .	-4.9177

Rhenus Midgard has also invested heavily on land .	-2.3840
They put the coal coming from the ships on hold .	-3.2764
The company has several iron in fire at its location .	-4.0173

" The signals are intended for safety and are prescribed by law " , says Matthias Schrell , Managing Director of Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven .	-3.5564
In the case of unfavourable wind this is , unfortunately , widely heard - and there were already some complaints from people from the North .	-6.9226
He takes the complaint very seriously and has therefore made contact with those affected , says the 40-year-old .	-3.9305

In addition to the local Eon power station , imported coal goes to power plants in the inland country .	-5.1493
If the GDF-Suez power station were to go to the grid , 5 million tonnes of coal per year would be realistic .	-4.1005
The three ship loaders on the bridge and the second transport belt could create up to 10 million .	-3.8622
Bayern ’ s basketball team is optimistic despite its first defeat .	-2.2728

Court blocked decision on the NYPD ’ s Stop and Risk Directive	-2.4973
On Thursday , a Federal Employment Court in the United States blocked a judge calling for changes to the New York Police Department ’ s stop-and-risk program ( “ Stand and Search ” ) , and dismissed the judge from the case .	-6.3003
The 2nd U.S. Court of Appeals declared that the decisions of judge Shira Scheindlin would be suspended until a city appeal was decided .	-5.0199
The judge ruled in August that the city was in breach of the Constitution with the way in which the program was implemented for holding and questioning persons .	-10.6337
The city appealed against its assessment and the remedies imposed , including the decision to set up a monitoring body to assist the police in amending their directive and the relevant training programme .	-5.5529
The Court of Appeal listened on Tuesday to the arguments for the request for suspension .	-3.1691
The appeal report stated that the judge had to be disbanded from the case because she had breached the code of conduct for US judges by deciding that a judge should avoid the appearance of party ; this was partly justified by a series of media interviews and public statements in which she had publicly responded to the court ’ s criticism .	-6.0027
The judge had judged that police officers were violating the civil rights of tens of thousands of people because they were inappropriately targeting black and Latin American men with the stop-and-risk programme .	-4.1050
They appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of major changes , including reforms of directives , training and service supervision , and ordered a pilot program with body powered cameras in quarterly areas where most controls were carried out .	-7.1527
In August , the city of New York agreed to end the practice of storing names and addresses of people who were dismissed after police control .	-3.5157
An oral hearing for the appeal of the city is planned after March 14 , 2014 .	-3.4131
The stop-and-risk tactic has been criticised by a number of civil rights defenders .	-2.5668
There have been controls of this kind for decades in various forms , but the number of recorded controls increased during the term of office of party mayor Michael Bloomberg to an all-time high of 684.330 in 2011 , most of them black and Latin American men .	-5.0318
In 2004 , four men belonging to all minorities filed complaints that resulted in collective redress .	-3.7989
Proponents of changes to the NYPD ’ s stop-and-risk program will say that the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trustworthy and effective police force , as well as influence how other police presidencies use the system .	-4.6388
Opponents argue that the changes would dampen police morals , but not crime ; money would also be wasted , and the broader problem of a police force that has been under pressure since thousands of jobs have disappeared in the last decade .	-5.5818
The judge pointed out that she did not end the stop-and-risk practice that was constitutional , but only reform the way NYPD implemented controls .	-4.6599

Rainer Prewo , the former Nagold OB , had proposed to equip this vehicle with a photovoltaic facility and now , according to Henne , plans to consult the association .	-4.5791
In 2008 , Schleeh from Baiersbronn , in the record time of just under one week , created the Socogim hospital , an elementary district on the outskirts of the capital city - voluntarily .	-7.2775
Henne also mentioned a new maternity hospital in Nouakchott .	-2.6866
Especially interesting in times when the birth line is to be liberalized in Nagold .	-5.1056
They learn a lot in Africa as a medical doctor , Henne said , for example , deceleration against burn-out .	-4.7672
As a result of political unrest in the country , it was not possible to make as many journeys as planned , but many medical doctors came to Germany for this purpose in order to hospitalise in various areas .	-7.8207

Coulson type-hacking used to check a hint .	-4.1731
Former news of the Word editor Andy Coulson allegedly used “ telephone hacking , surveillance , and confrontation ” to try to confirm a false tip about an affair of then-Interior Minister Charles Clarke .	-5.3822
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC declared to the court in the Old Bailey that News of the World heard the wrong rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with his “ attractive special advisor ” Hannah Pawlby .	-3.4077
The newspaper charged Glenn Mulcaire with hacking Pawlby ’ s voicemails , and persecuted her , but Coulson also appealed to and left the court ’ s news .	-9.1818
“ According to the Public Prosecutor ’ s Office , Coulson , now an editor of the NotW , is no one who stands in front of people ’ s homes and hopes to breathe them freshly , but one who likes to face a story to see their reaction , ” Edis said .	-6.2847
He said that NotW use three methods to research stories : telephone hacking , surveillance , and confrontation .	-3.4308
The editor is personally involved in the third method .	-1.1200
Obviously he knows of the second , the monitoring , otherwise it can not be .	-2.3980
What about the first ?	-0.7063
Does he know about phone hacking ?	-1.6632
He disputes that , but we say , “ And whether he knew . ”	-3.1875
rumors of an affair of Clarkes were first picked up by the feature editor of NotW when a source that was sexually interested in Pawlby was said : “ Don ’ t waste your time , she ’ ll do with Charles . ”	-5.3913
A band with voicemails from their phone of at least three events was secured in August 2006 in Mulcaires apartment .	-3.2559
The investigators also found entries on the detective computer where Pawlby and her sister were stored as “ projects . ”	-3.6378
In the time the searches were running , Pawlby ’ s grandparents received anonymous calls asking them for information about them , Edis explained .	-4.2482
Meanwhile , former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw the surveillance of Pawlby ’ s movements . , , the the , , the the .	-10.6992
On 18 June 2005 , Coulson left her a voicemail with the following content : “ I have a story that we want to produce tomorrow , which I would like to talk about with Charles . ”	-4.0728
Edis explained that Coulson ’ s activities in this story followed the same pattern as other key personalities , such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett .	-3.5825
On Thursday , the stories heard that Coulson Blunkett faced a married woman because of a affair when he had himself lied with the co-accused Rebekah Brooks , who had been married at that time .	-6.0547
Coulson and Brooks are arguing to have agreed with others to hack telephones between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006 .	-4.8780
Mulcaire , Thurlbeck and Weatherup have entered the telephone hacking .	-2.6042

Warning : No absolute protection possible	-2.9259
" We want to include the inhabitants in the early stages " , the Mayor of Jen Fäu<unk>ler opened the civic information event on the flood protection concept in Gechingen .	-6.8311
Around 80 participants had come to the community to explain the planned measures , ask questions , express concerns and bring forward ideas .	-4.8394
The House made it clear : ' The final decisions take the members of the council ' .	-5.4041
The floods , which traced on 15 May 2009 , were unprepared , were a serious event that raised the question of protection measures for the future , Schäuerler said .	-5.2270
A river area examination was commissioned with the neighbouring municipality of Aidlingen , which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen .	-4.9746
" The protection of as many land as possible is the aim " , says Schäuerler .	-9.0512
The protection against flooding , according to Deutsche Wetterdienst , can be traced statistically every 100 years .	-7.0512
A 15 % surcharge will take account of climate change .	-2.9181
In specialist circles this is referred to as " HQ 100a Klima " .	-3.5478
The water masses , which caused considerable damage in Gechingen in 2009 , corresponded to a 1000-year flood .	-5.5353
" There is no absolute protection , but we can achieve a relative improvement , " he states .	-4.0564
In order to protect the HQ 100a climate , about four million euros will have to be invested in germany , with the municipality able to count on government subsidies of around 70 % .	-8.0463
However , as usual , it was pointed out that support only exists if an overall concept is implemented .	-4.9894
The community needs the participation of its citizens .	-3.9891
An expensive planning and approval procedure must be completed .	-2.1200
At best , implementation could begin in 2016 .	-1.9426
Amongst other things , the concept of protection , which was already presented in the municipal council last week ( we reported ) , provides for local measures in the inflow of the Irm river from the local valley .	-6.4193
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept , the participants took the opportunity to raise their concerns .	-3.5594
Amongst other things , it was questioned why more dams and restraints are not planned to protect the place .	-5.0299
Gregor Kühn , chief engineer of the engineering office Forest and Corbe of Hügelsheim , who presented the concept , stressed that it needed the interaction of all the measures presented to achieve the desired goal in the sum .	-6.1127
In addition , the most economical solution to be found is Joachim Forest of Forest and Corbe .	-4.0527
There was a discontent among local residents , who , even in normal thunderstorms , have suffered from congestion on the channel network .	-7.0883
The problem is well known to the administration and initial actions have already been taken .	-3.4200
On the other hand , it has been pointed out that the directives on channel systems are different from those for flood protection and should not be confused .	-6.3205
The municipality is obliged to interpret the Channel network in such a way that two to three years of rainfall may be affected .	-6.1495
Making sewage channels bigger would cover millions .	-2.6144

In the early Friday afternoon , on Landstra<unk>e 44 near Revensdorf , two drivers were seriously injured in a frontal collision .	-4.6637
The police closed the road completely immediately , but there was little to say about the result of the accident .	-5.2500
However , there are several testimony statements that should first be evaluated .	-3.5183
It is clear that the 19-year-old Lenkerin of a VW Golf took the direction of Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf came to her with his Hyundai .	-5.7899
Both vehicles jumped together , and the woman was so hard pressed that the fire brigade needed about half an hour to get her out of the wreck .	-5.9349
The actual cause of the accident was not clarified at first .	-2.9674
Both incidents went to nearby hospitals .	-3.0898

Perhaps he was crazy , had buried drugs on his brain .	-3.2697
He has recognized early that the machines are Divinities .	-4.2761

Speaking About Merkel in Russia	-2.2075
Former US intelligence expert Edward Snowden could make statements in his Russian asylum in the US paraphragm around German Chancellor Angela Merkel .	-4.8133
Representatives of the German Federal Attorney could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old personally in Russia , the agency Interfax reported .	-4.3228

On the instruction of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection and Counter-Terrorism ( BVT ) , the German Interior Intelligence Service , he should photograph the roof of the U.S. Foreign Post , which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank .	-5.7958
According to the German media , the BVT wanted to prove the existence of surveillance devices and the action led to a change of wording between the US and the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin .	-4.6404
James Clapper , US Director of National Intelligence , insisted in September that the US did not use foreign espionage to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of US firms to expand international competitiveness or profits . ”	-4.7152
But , since Edward Snowden , a former member of Whistleblower , began publishing his fullhorn on US surveillance secrets , European governments and business leaders have become unsure whether they can take the director at his word .	-5.0632
Reports that the US National Security Agency has spawned the Brazilian oil company Petroban and acquired data from American Cloud suppliers , including Google and Yahoo , have brought the company paranoia to a new level due to state surveillance .	-5.6437
The rush to overflow has led the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel ’ s phone was obscured , possibly for ten years .	-4.3511
If the most powerful person in Europe can target them , business leaders are certainly potential targets .	-4.4458
Snowden has made intensive cooperation between US intelligence and business transparent .	-2.2074
I believe it is conceivable that these data will be used for mutual benefit .	-2.4657
“ Germany must wake up ” , says Oliver Grün , President of the BITMi , who represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany .	-2.7603
German companies believe that the US is now almost as risky as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft , a survey published by the EY Advisory Company in July .	-4.6743
However , the documents sent by Snowden have not yet shown that the US has passed on foreign companies ’ trade secrets to its own companies .	-5.3721
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU should lack certain IT and Internet opportunities and reduce its dependence on the US .	-2.6630

Everything in Germany is subsidized , from coal to cars to agriculture .	-1.6286
Everything , except the IT industry .	-4.7506
Yet the reach and technical refinement of US spy agencies exposed by the Snowden revelations has shocked firms that had previously seen the biggest espionage risk in China .	-4.9443
Cloud computing is undergoing major change , because European business leaders are now more aware that data held in the US is subject to case-law and are potentially at risk .	-4.7363
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance , a trading institution , after the revelations about US data mining activities with Prism , about ten percent of non-US members ’ plans to use an American supplier .	-4.8696
Jim Snare , SAP Deputy Managing Director , says : “ We see a new question from customers who didn ’ t have it a year ago – she says : Where are my data stored and can you guarantee that it will stay physically in this legal area ? ”	-6.0967
Many German business leaders believe that the latest reports simply confirm what they already knew anyway , namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and therefore need to be guarded at all costs .	-4.6534

Parents of a teenager from Georgia who died in tragic accidents believe in murder .	-2.0160
The parents of the teenager , whose body was found in a colloquial ringer mat in the gymnasium of his high school , are convinced that their son was murdered , declared the family lawyer on Thursday .	-5.4559
Kendrick Johnson of Valdosta in the state of Georgia , USA , was found on 11 January in an upright mat behind the grandstand in the school hall .	-5.4096
The investigators of the Sheriff of Lowndes County concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident , leaving the family of the 17-year-old unlucky .	-5.1539
“ They are convinced that their son was murdered , ” explained Benjamin Crump , Kenneth ’ s lawyer and Jacquelyn Johnson , to FoxNews.com.	-3.0837
They never thought he died as the Sheriff had done .	-6.4131
“ They believe that it lacks any logic that violates the laws of physics as well as common sense , ” says Crump .	-4.3989
Rather , they are convinced that the truth is hidden to protect the person or person responsible for the death of their son .	-3.2508
“ Your son went to school to learn and came back in corpses , ” he commented .	-4.2253
On Thursday , US prosecutor Michael Moore said that there will be a formal investigation into Johnson ’ s death , as a number of important issues have yet to be clarified .	-7.7043
What was the cause of death ?	-0.7437
Is his death attributable to a crime ?	-1.4659
That was said at a press conference on Thursday afternoon .	-2.6621
I follow the facts in which direction they lead .	-2.1456
My aim is to find out the truth .	-1.3176
“ I believe there is a sufficient basis for formal investigation , ” he said .	-2.4967
Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy indicates that Johnson died from the consequences of “ position-related suffocation . ”	-3.6503
But another cause of death , Moore said .	-2.6814
“ There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed , ” he said .	-2.2307
Moore added that if there is sufficient evidence of a criminal or civil investigation into the Johnson death penalty , he will instruct the FBI to carry out the investigation .	-4.4067

CDC Publish Allergy Policy for Schools	-1.8980
On Wednesday , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) published a set of guidelines for dealing with food allergies from children in schools .	-2.3799
These are the first such directives that the US government has issued , as the number of schooling children with food allergies increases .	-4.1336
One in 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy .	-1.7151
According to the CDC , the spread of food allergies among children increased by 18 % between 1997 and 2007 .	-1.8222
The guidelines contain information for schools intended to raise awareness of food allergies among teachers and employees and how to deal with children who show allergic reactions .	-9.6420
It is also recommended that schools have epinephrin in stock – the auto-injection of the EpiPen brand is most commonly used – to deal with a potentially deadly hypersensitivity response .	-4.6091
Legislatures in the states have recently changed the rules so that schools can easily keep epinephrin in stock .	-5.1793
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms identified by children with an allergic reaction .	-3.1619
Children may say : “ It feels like pushing something on my tongue ” , “ My tongue feels like a hair on it ” or “ My tongue cribbles ” .	-5.6099
Parents of Intersexual Children Can Vot ‘ Gender Inaccurate ’	-4.0553
Germany is the first European nation to recognise a third gender for children born with non-clear genitals .	-2.7658
Babies are no longer assigned rigid male or female .	-2.8245
Under the new law , parents no longer need to declare sex for such children , but can indicate “ untrue ” or “ not fixed ” on birth certificate .	-4.3209
The aim of the law is to take the pressure of parents so that they do not have to make hasty decisions regarding the operation of sexual assignment in newborn babies and to combat discrimination against sexuals .	-7.8865
One intersexual person later said , according to BBC , “ I am neither a man nor a woman . ”	-2.5946
I remain the patchwork created by doctors and full of scars .	-2.3543
It is estimated that one in 2,000 children each year will not be born either as boys or as girls .	-3.3030
They are intersexuals , a group that comes under the diagnosis of sex differentiation ( DSD ) , a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes , germ glands ( ovaries or hods ) or unusually developed genitals .	-5.8564
Wallis Simpson was perhaps intersexual .	-1.8944
Understanding gender identification is still not very well developed , but most experts in the US recommend that you use the best available information on gender allocation if a provision is not possible , rather than wait for child ’ s psychological and physical development before deciding for an operation , if any .	-6.6956
The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher , who specializes in the issue of gender identification , said that the new German law “ sounds like a good thing . ”	-4.2255
Intersexual children are an ethical dilemma .	-1.2587
“ Some people have life-threatening conditions that require surgical intervention , but most children do not , ” he said .	-3.2183
You can do gender assignment without an operation and then wait and see how identity develops .	-4.7775
The scientific data on how a child develops its gender identity are not very accurate .	-3.0148
No one knows why it is happening .	-1.5999
It is like the secret why people are homosexual .	-1.9136
A report to the European Commission in 2011 states that intersexual people are different from transsexuals or transgenders , because their status is not gender in nature , but because of their biological constitution , which is neither exclusively male nor female , but typically defines both simultaneously or not clearly as one of them .	-6.5197
These characteristics were shown in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle mass , heating , breasts and stature , priority sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals , or chromosome structures and hormones .	-4.3308
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination suffered by intersex and transgender people in working life , as well as the extent of harassment , violence and prejudice .	-4.5660
Young who disagree with gender have a special camp now .	-2.8460
It is now possible for adults in Australia and Nepal to indicate male , female , or “ third gender ” on official documents .	-3.5056
In June , Australian Norrie May-Welby ( 52 ) was recognized as the world ’ s first “ genderless ” person after a court had granted lifelong retention of “ non-determined ” gender status .	-4.3092
In the future , German expulsions will have a third assignment , alongside M and W , for intersexually , according to the Ministry of the Interior .	-5.0446
In neighboring France , gender issues are still controversial , such as a news report on France 24 .	-3.7213
In 2011 , dozens of French members of the strictly Catholic country signed a petition that “ gender theory ” should be removed from school books .	-3.0129
The US website , Catholic Online , also opposed German law , on the grounds that “ if the world is dragged into a new state where gender is a decision but not sexual activity , then we will turn two more pillars of civilisation . ”	-5.9249
The mother of a newborn child from Maryland declared to Baby Zone that she would be better off giving babies a sex at birth .	-3.9104
“ The parent is already stressful enough even without further restrictions , especially if one does not know the sex of one ’ s own child , ” she said to the parent website .	-5.0121
Children need stability and security .	-0.6198
Historically , children born with male and female genders were called Hermaphrodites , after the attractive Greek God who had both sexes .	-3.4056
Ten years ago , medicine regarded gender as something that could be wiped out and then rebuild .	-2.9449
But the ethical foundations of an operation are now being questioned , now that it is known how complex gender identity is , and that doctors can also be wrong because they do not know how the child feels to grow up with the sex they assign .	-5.9959
“ In the middle of the 20th century it was called a psychiatric emergency , ” Dresden said .	-3.9710
When such a child was born , one did not call the psychiatrist , but the surgeon .	-2.7173
The prevailing theory of the treatment of children with non-clear genitals stems from Dr John Money from Johns Hopkins University , who believed that gender is formable .	-4.6896
He coined the concept of “ gender identity , ” arguing that social and environmental incentives – as parents educate a child – interacted with children ’ s genes and hormones , thus shaping whether a person considered male or female .	-5.2366
But in a case known as “ John / Joan ” in 1966 , his theories became controversial .	-2.6168
He smiled to the parents of a boy whose penis had been cut off in a plethora of circumcision , to disguise the child completely and also to remove his hods and then grab it as girls .	-8.5358
“ Money presented this case as a successful example of conversion , which he was not , ” said Drescher .	-3.5135
When the boy was about 15 , he changed back to male sex and married a woman .	-5.8625
With 38 But he began suicide .	-5.5384
According to Drescher , there are still doctors who would practice this model .	-7.5940
But in the 1990 ’ s , with the onset of the Internet , survivors of these genital operations came to the public , who are “ unhappy with the outcome . ”	-4.3085
For example , Jim Bruce , a 36 year old Montana author , born with XY male chromosomes , but ambiguous genitals .	-2.6237
Doctors were not clear about whether he had a great clitoris or a small penis , and were convinced that he could never lead a “ satisfactory life ” as a man .	-8.1154
So his external organ and the troubles were surgically removed shortly after the birth in 1976 and pulled out as a girl .	-5.0914
At the age of 12 he received female hormones .	-1.3842
“ I knew I ’ m not a girl , ” he told ABCNews.com	-1.9089
I was unhappy , but it was really hard to ask questions .	-1.8030
At the age of 18 he should receive a vaginal plaster .	-3.2203
But , knowing that something was wrong , he demanded his medical acts .	-2.6249
What he found out was shocking .	-0.9899
I was sterilised at my birth – and no one ever told me that .	-2.2710
Bruce was born with a DSD , through which his body could not produce enough testosterone to develop the genitals .	-2.8736
Having learned the truth , he switched back to male identity , received testosterone injections and let his breasts be removed .	-4.7541
The operation has made it infertile .	-2.3711
Today he is campaigning for others in an organization called Interface Project to regard intersexual people as normal .	-3.9743
But Anne Tamar-Mattis , Managing Director of the California legal group Advocates for Informed Choice , is concerned that German law can “ encourage stamping and stigmatizing . ”	-3.3688
“ Many activists are concerned that Germany ’ s decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and invite the child not to “ allocate ” , she explained .	-5.3535
We fear that this will benefit intervention .	-3.2246
We think it would be better to attribute male or female sex and then wait .	-2.4132
But we do not yet know how the law will affect , so we can only speculate .	-2.2730
Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports Australian law , because “ it allows adults to recognize as third sex . ”	-3.9694
“ Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal sex , ” she explained .	-2.8495
The German law concerns the assignment at birth .	-2.3664
This is not a fight to which small children should be forced at this stage .	-2.6478
When they grow up , they can decide on their own body .	-2.5766
But Dr Arlene Baratz , a Brustradiologist from Pittsburg , who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group , says German law “ empowered ” both parents and children .	-3.7413
Katie , the daughter of Baratz , was born with male chromosomes , but has a DSD called complete antigen resistance .	-2.8178
Due to the recipe defect of the target cells for testosterone , catia developed female characteristics .	-4.5346
She has a vagina , but no uterus and no eggs .	-3.0901
Today , Katie 29 is married ; she is working at the University of Pennsylvania as a child psychiatrist .	-3.4188
Although she is infertile , she hopes to have a child through adoption or surrogacy .	-3.7029
“ The law gives parents room to decide quickly , ” said Baratz .	-3.5198
It gives them time to do different tests and to clarify things and so gives them time to write “ male ” or “ female ” .	-4.1964
That way everything is fine - you pull the child large and love it .	-4.4943
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy parental happiness .	-1.1780
And you do not need to make a hasty operation that can no longer be undone .	-3.7846
“ That includes children in the decision , and it explained the fear that parents are surrendering because they believe they are not doing the right thing . ”	-5.7080
Ultimately , the child decides on the sex that fits better – and that is wonderful .	-3.5467
This will enable children to make the decision themselves .	-2.4384
Unknown Involves Girls Through Shot from Auto	-8.9187
Unknown have injured a 12-year-old in Sachsen-Anhalt in shooting from a car .	-3.6697
On Thursday evening , the perpetrators probably had fired a group of children with an airforce in Ghent .	-4.6957
That informed the police in Burg .	-3.7448
The girl was easily injured on the left wade .	-2.0716
Rescuers brought the girl to the hospital .	-2.1579
The shot came from a small car that had passed on to a group of six children and suddenly stopped .	-7.5645
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car .	-1.3242
The perpetrators also shot at a bus stop .	-1.9540
A disk broke down .	-1.7813
Then they went .	-1.9913
The criminal police identified it on Friday .	-2.5376
The police inspection can look back at a quiet Halloween night .	-3.6388
The officials were only asked twice for irrigation children who threw them against facades .	-6.3456
Since homeowners recognized this in good time and removed the eggs , no material damage will have arisen .	-6.9118
Also some New Year 's Eve Bonds have been burned in the city , but no damage has been done .	-7.1103
A native of the Bishop Friendship Route reported that his car was wrapped up with clockpaper and his wheel blends were turned away .	-7.2853
However , until the police arrived , the man found his bicycles in the immediate vicinity all of them again , so the police had to stop working .	-6.2077
Living with a Future Perspective	-1.7107
In fact , Waltraud Ries has a fantastic apartment .	-4.1627
Your house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with lots of green , an old tree stock , nice neighbours and also not too much traffic .	-4.0288
It is only a few minutes by public transport to the city .	-2.8643
" I hope you don 't have any fear of spiders ? " , Waltraud Ries asks for a fat spider at the door frame .	-5.6730
I have been searching for a new home for my husband and me for some time .	-2.5460
But you know how difficult this is in Stuttgart .	-1.7374
The reason , however , is not a spinning phobia , but a concern that at age the many steps to the house and the apartment cannot be overcome .	-7.5068
In addition , since a Menismus operation , the centrioner has had to know for himself what it means to get stuck with handicap .	-6.1409
She has recently published a book entitled ' Happy living in Age - What form of living is the best for me ? ' .	-4.9290
'Our apartment is the best example of what is not possible at age , ' she begins to tell .	-4.4280
When she moved with her husband to the Maisonette apartment more than 20 years ago , it was simply a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green countryside .	-4.5816
Today , with the middle of fifty , Waltraud Ries thinks differently about this . the the . the , the , , , , , , , and . the , , , , , ,	-10.7980
It also knows , however , that it is one of the few people dealing with the issue of ' living in old age ' .	-4.5453
Most people displace it as long as it goes .	-3.5795
Only the others who are old are old , ' she says dirty .	-5.3958
Only when the pressure on suffering is really great can we think about it .	-3.9066
'Then it can also be too late ' , Ries says .	-3.4704
In their book , interior designers present 17 models of living for a self-determined old age .	-5.0699
'But what form of residence you choose is always an individual instruction , ' she explains .	-4.1826
D i e solution does not exist for age .	-1.3501
Even those who can afford age residency in Tuscany or Brittany should always consider becoming ill as well . .	-12.3604
And : ' Without a good knowledge of the national language , one can also join in the Dolce Vita , ' the specialists ' instructors will have to bear in mind those who want to leave the country .	-14.8481
Among their models are classic support models , alternative forms of housing or the often quoted pensioner WG .	-4.0253
At Age everyone has such ticks and Macken	-3.5792
'For me such a community would be nothing ' , she means with an eyelid .	-4.2268
Not at all like in a Studenten-WG with a common bathroom and a kitchen .	-3.6996
" At age you just need your retreat rooms " , says Giant .	-5.3365
The book author does not want to rule out the fact that a senior citizens ’ community can still function .	-5.1592
But that should be different from the classic Studenten-WG .	-3.8760
And sometimes you just want to rest , ' she believes .	-3.3937
She is not alone in that opinion , at least in the capital of the country .	-3.8689
" Most of the old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own home as long as it goes , " is also the experience of Theresa Rütten , the head of civil services life at the age of the provincial capital .	-4.4155
Your department advises people around the subject of ' becoming older ' .	-3.5320
That is why it is the older people who would often accept discomfort and restrictions only in order to be able to stay in their habitual environment that is also the experience of the Foundation of Goods Test .	-7.2651
There are many ways of making the house or apartment accessible .	-4.1786
Giant recommends that everyone who is involved in the alteration of their house or apartment should first inform themselves thoroughly and not hire the first craftsman .	-7.0650
Today there is also the alteration specialist based on the age .	-5.3445
Even in the rental apartment it is possible to realize one thing or the other , and if it is only the toiletries meeting increases , the interior designers clarify .	-7.5266
However , it is not always possible to change the existing apartment without alteration , even if it is still so beautiful .	-6.0500
This experience was what Waltraud Ries had to do .	-3.2758
Although the apartment could be installed a staircase , which would also be paved with stairs to the door of residence would be a far greater obstacle .	-7.3398
She will continue looking until she finds the ideal object for her and her husband .	-3.3181
Before moving , it is more grey than in front of the spider at its living room .	-6.3182
The US Want to continue prosecuting Snowden	-2.7706
The US has not changed its stance on former US intelligence officer Edward Snowden .	-2.5784
He will continue to be accused of having passed on secret information .	-4.3817
So he must face a criminal proceedings in the US , said the US State Department spokesman Jennifer Psaki in Washington .	-4.3906
Even recent statements by Snowden would not change this .	-3.5851
Previously , after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow , German Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele had appealed to the US not to continue to threaten him with punishment .	-3.7741
Psaki stressed that Ströbeli ’ s statements were that of a member of parliament , not that of a German member of the government .	-5.6719
Edward Snowden , a secretary service secretary , is always ready to talk to the German authorities .	-4.1194
First of all , however , he wants to know what the situation is .	-4.4089
This was made clear by the former NSA employees , who were looking for the United States , in an unaddressed letter published by Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and passed on to the Federal Government , the Bundestag and the General Federal Prosecutor .	-6.7262
According to a translation by Ströbele , the letter has the following words :	-3.8082
Responsibility	-3.7951
I have been asked to write to you about mass surveillance in relation to your inquiry .	-2.6162
My name is Edward Joseph Snowden . I was previously contractually employed or employed as a technical expert at the National Security Agency ( NSA ) , the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) and the United States Defense Intelligence Agency ( DIA ) .	-12.9367
During my work in these institutions , I witnessed my government ’ s systematic violations of the law , which led me to act on a moral duty .	-5.6482
As a result of the publication of these concerns , I was exposed to a serious and sustained surge that forced me to leave my family and home .	-4.1927
I currently live in exile and enjoy temporary asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation under international law .	-6.4001
I am encouraged by the resonance of my political actions , both in the US and elsewhere .	-1.7319
Citizens around the world , and also senior officials - including the United States - have judged revelations about a system of all-round surveillance that nobody is accountable to as a public service .	-4.6959
These espionage revelations resulted in many proposals for new laws and directives aimed at the previously hidden abuse of public confidence .	-3.8695
The benefits to society from these findings are becoming increasingly clear , while at the same time , the risks taken have been deliberately reduced .	-12.1021
Although the result of my efforts has been demonstrably positive , my government continues to treat dissent as a breach of loyalty and seeks to criminalise and prosecute political expression .	-4.5409
Nevertheless , telling the truth is not a crime .	-1.8103
I am confident that the United States Government , with the support of the international community , will take this damaging position .	-3.3314
I hope that , when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved , I will be able to participate appropriately and legally in the responsible clarification of the facts concerning the statements made in the media , particularly with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports .	-5.4693
I look forward to a discussion with you in your country as soon as the situation is resolved and thank you for your efforts to uphold international law , which protects us all .	-3.9211

Kindergarten found a private buyer	-2.1135
" The building is in good hands " , says Winterlings Mayor Michael Maier .	-1.5580
The former nursery in the Gartenstra<unk>e sold the commune to a private person .	-3.1478
The council agreed to sell at its most recent meeting in the non-public section .	-3.9689
The building changed its owner for a " reasonable " price .	-2.2332
" The community is satisfied , " Maier points out .	-6.6864
The budget was EUR 100 000 .	-1.4620
It is not yet clear how the new owner will use the former kindergarten .	-2.7498
The mayor is right that Winterlingen has handed over responsibility for the building to someone else before the winter and therefore no longer has to pay for the maintenance of the house , how to heat up , look after the garden and clear the walk .	-7.0014
" This effort is now gone , " is glad Maier .	-3.6460

President Barack Obama ’ s closest advisers secretly thought of replacing Vice-President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton in the 2012 election campaign , said the New York Times .	-2.7888
The revelation is the most remarkable surprise of Mark Halperin ’ s long-awaited work on the 2012 election campaign , “ Double Down : Game Change 2012 . ”	-3.2727
The Times is a copy of the forthcoming book , and it reported on Thursday evening that the president ’ s top advisers had conducted “ extensive group meetings and polls at the end of 2011 ” to find out whether Obama ’ s dwindling hope of re-election is better off if he drops bids .	-5.6159
According to Jonathan Martin , the Times ’ National Policy Correspondent , the book painstakingly draws on the history of the efforts of leading campaign and White House officials , notably the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley , to measure the effect of the poll numbers of former Secretary of State Clinton on the Vice-President .	-7.5779
Potential change was a strictly guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office .	-2.6288
Only half a dozen of the president ’ s closest advisers – including Daley , Obama ’ s former campaign leader , Jim Messina , and the White House ’ s former chief adviser , David Axelrod , and David Plouffe – knew about the planned change .	-3.2923
In the Double Down , it is claimed that Daley has led the effort to exchange bids despite their “ tight , personal relationship , ” before deciding against such a move , after the data show that Clinton ’ s candidacy would “ not significantly improve Obama ’ s . , ”	-13.4947
In an interview with Martin Daley , the government did indeed consider replacing bids with Clinton .	-2.4712
“ I said a whole series of things to be considered , and that was one of them , ” Daley told the magazine .	-3.6915
It must be remembered that the President had terrible poll values at that time , so we thought , “ In God ’ s will , what do we do ? ”	-4.4050
While Daley called the investigation “ due diligence , ” Martin told CNN ’ s Anderson Cooper that considerable effort was made during the re-election campaign to find out whether such a move is paying out in respect of the ballot boxes .	-5.5323
“ In campaigns , not so much money is spent on surveys and focus groups if you don ’ t really think about something , ” Martin said on AC360 .	-4.2822
But it is not clear whether Obama knew his team was thinking about an exchange .	-2.2995
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his former boss knew about the potential change .	-2.5696
Although Daley explained that he did not believe that the president was “ aware of the possible change , ” the former chief of staff admitted that it was “ possible ” that Obama knew it .	-3.3102
Martin added that “ Double Down ” did not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether Obama ’ s political exploits had reached the desk .	-3.7273
Cooper asked Martin if he thought seriously that Obama did not know anything about studying whether to drop bids in the elections .	-4.5656
Martin replied ‘ Possibly ’ .	-2.5623
What happens on the way with my email ?	-2.1250
E-mail actually means electronic letters .	-1.9073
Was the design of the Internet service e-mail similar to the conventional mail technical the letter secrecy ?	-5.4980
The concept of early Internet services focused on making communication possible .	-3.0506
Therefore , the basic technical protocols have not been designed to provide a stable basis for listening exchange .	-5.3275
Therefore , a conventional e-mail is more like an open postcard than a sealed letter .	-2.6622
If user " Anna " sends to " Benni " a mail , are the computers of the two connected then ?	-3.9216
In the first step , the Anna e-mail program or browser will send the mail to the mail server of their service provider .	-3.5094
For example , if she has a GM account , it would be Google .	-2.5821
This mail server sends the content to the provider who uses Benni .	-2.2600
It is possible to use a number of other servers on the internet .	-4.7866
Bennie can then call the content at his provider .	-2.3151
Is conventional e-mails included on their way through the network ?	-3.5932
Most mails are read several times by software robots .	-4.4777
At the sender 's provider , it is usually checked whether the mail has a malicious program as an attachment .	-4.5257
A virus check is also carried out on the receiver systems .	-1.8222
Furthermore , ISPs check whether this is an annoying and unwanted spam mail that is deleted immediately or at least sorted out into a spam folder .	-5.2881
Do the robots have another task ?	-1.7564
For systems like GM , the robot also determines the information Google needs to place context advertising .	-3.0486
If Anna and Benni communicate via GMail on their upcoming holiday trips , Google can provide links to holiday offers .	-5.4999
See also unknown people with the e-mails ?	-3.3040
The probability of unauthorized people reading mail is very low .	-4.0686
In theory , this is possible .	-1.5600
In companies administrators often have the possibility to read electronic mail .	-2.5065
The law enforcement authorities and the intelligence services also have legal means of intercepting or taking note of e-mails .	-3.1637
In addition , possible illegal overnight stays may take place .	-5.1941
Is it possible to protect e-mails from reading ?	-3.8127
An encryption according to the OpenPGP standard enables an e-mail to be effectively encrypted against reading .	-5.3617
With a high technical effort , it is also possible to hide the metadata of an e-mail communication , so that it is not even possible to recognize who has communicated with whom .	-6.3033
How important are Yahoo and Google on the email market in Germany ?	-1.1779
According to a study by Convios Consulting from August 2013 , Yahoo and Google play a minor role in the mainly privately used mailboxes .	-4.3776
While Yahoo-Mail ’ s shares had recently fallen , GMail ’ s ability to clearly indicate .	-6.4072
Mother in the Woods and Rent Cases	-8.0722
When his mother died , a man from Wolfsburg forged a plan .	-3.0725
He buried the dead in a forest - and continued to collect their pension and care money .	-4.4763
A 67-year-old Wolfsburg buried his dead mother after police investigations in the forest to collect further pension and care money .	-5.0247
At first , he concealed the death of the 89-year-old , then he has been cutting the money for more than a year and a half .	-5.3592
Now , as a spokesman said on Friday , the 67-year-old is responsible for fraud . .	-10.8715
So the man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt .	-2.0217
The man was already suspected in May : it was discovered that no medication was needed for the needy mother .	-4.8660
The investigators told pensioners that his mother had traveled to Spain .	-3.2645
Because the officials found this odd , they went on to investigate .	-4.2025
It was discovered that the two had lived in a common apartment for more than 15 years , and that he had last cared for it .	-6.1732
The 67-year-old finally admitted the death of his mother .	-1.9041
Obduction according to the police showed no evidence of a capital crime .	-4.1596
Feel like ice cream shining in the dark ?	-2.9290
A British entrepreneur has developed the first bright ice in the dark – with agony .	-3.8540
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of marine animals and made them look good .	-4.5433
The idea came to him after he had read a research on torment and convinced Chinese scientists to artificially produce the bright protein .	-5.3325
The ice cream reacts when eating with the tongue , increasing the pH value in the protein and causing the light .	-3.9024
Chris explains that the ice reacts to the warmth of the mouth and shines – the more you leak , the brighter it becomes .	-4.6883
Charlie , founder of the ice cream company “ Lick Me I ’ m Delicious ” , says : “ The product is incredible , but still at a very early stage of production , getting two grams of it for 200 pounds . ”	-4.5583
The protein used in ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH value .	-2.5356
When the mouth warms the protein , the pH value and the ice rises .	-1.9223
We have tested it over the last few months and it seemed to us ideal to put it on the market in Halloween because it has this wonderful luminous effect .	-4.8582
It is probably the most expensive ice cream I have ever produced , because the quality luminaire is four times more expensive than gold .	-3.1333
Each ball costs me about 140 pounds .	-1.8478
But it tastes good for that .	-2.5941
Charlies experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual flavours , including beer , cheese , beef and gold .	-3.4023
But his latest creation is to become even more ambitious .	-2.1085
He says , “ I would like to develop an invisible ice cream . ”	-2.0484
It is impossible in itself because of the precipitation caused by the ice crystals that make ice cream ; but I suspect we find a way to create it .	-6.6663
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a torment artificially produced by Chinese scientists .	-9.6445
After six days the TSV Morsum is still without any point in the Handball League .	-3.8144
It ’ s now time for Ingo Ehler ’ s team to join the Derby against TSV Daverden , who celebrated his first victory last weekend .	-5.7086
With this game the season begins new for us .	-2.0904
" I hope that we finally have our head free , " Ehler is behaving optimistically .	-4.6097
At last , with the exception of the permanent injured Hendrik Blohme , he has his entire cadre available .	-5.1987
Like us on Tempospiel as well .	-4.3321
Therefore , we must keep our error rate low .	-1.9676
Above all , however , there is a need to increase in the cover , which has recently left everything but a certain impression .	-6.2133
After the first season victory against North horn , Daverden 's coach Thomas Panitz will be much more relaxed .	-5.8464
The game was of course a house number .	-1.7402
But for that reason we are far from favourite , because everything can always happen in Derby .	-4.1227
But now Panitz wants to shoot in Morsum to start a series .	-3.6257
Abandoned Jan-Malte Jodat .	-2.6101
The A-Jugend Joost Wind<unk>u<unk> celebrates its season debut with dual rights in the A-Jugen-Bundesligist HC Bremen .	-6.9986
Those who are not hot in such a game should stay at home .	-2.6942
Halloween 2013 : In numbers	-2.3548
When I was small , Halloween had some magic .	-1.0675
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy , to stop late and to sue us for the neighbourhood .	-3.9670
Today I have become a Halloween muffle .	-2.7141
In the last two years I have not declared myself prepared to distribute from my dwelling out of candy , and I think I will not do it this year either .	-5.1108
However , according to statistics , I am a black sheep when it comes to Halloween .	-2.5536
The majority of Americans – 158 million to be precise – celebrate Halloween this year , spending $ 6.9 billion in candy , costumes , and decorations , according to the United States Trade Organization ( NRF ) .	-3.9807
One thing I always look forward to in all Halloween is the trend .	-5.1434
The costumes will represent about 1.2 billion of the $ 6.9 billion spent , according to the NRF .	-2.4332
This year , exciting unlived objects are the last cry .	-3.7007
Women no longer have to wrap themselves in sexy clothing ; they can now also embody seductive food such as pizza , hamburgers , or carrots .	-4.0730
As for men , I expect a lot of Zombies thanks to The Walking Dead , and I bet that the Daft-Punk Spare will create it this year in the instant feeds .	-4.6569
According to Google , the most sought-after costumes are zombies , batman , pirates and witches .	-2.4495
I guess it is nothing wrong with tradition .	-2.8950
We dressed our dogs last year and so I 'm astonished we were not alone .	-3.8721
Indeed , Americans spend $ 330 million this year on costumes of their pets , the NRF said .	-2.7038
That ’ s a lot of hot dogs .	-2.7893
As far as sweets are concerned , we are not stupid . . .	-5.8591
Americans will spend $ 1.9 billion this year , according to The Nielsen Company .	-1.7559
This is about 270 million kilograms of chicory organs , lutches , bonbons and rubber bears .	-5.4283
So good news for the 41 million people , according to the US Department of Trade , who drag through the quarter with the slogan “ sweet or saures . ”	-4.9193
In fact , we will buy over 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and , let us not delude ourselves , eat .	-3.3951
The only thing we do not want to consume is the sugar-sweet Candy Corn ; nevertheless , 15 million kilograms are sold around Halloween , according to the National Association of Sweets Manufacturers .	-4.6628
That is about nine billion cans of maize .	-3.2346
It is a mystery that I have not yet been able to solve .	-1.9001
Nothing belongs more to Halloween than houses in which it evokes .	-2.8505
They have great names such as “ Terror Behind the Walls ” , “ Howl-O-Scream ” and “ The House of Shock ” .	-3.7445
There are , in fact , 1,200 official spuk houses in the United States that earn $ 500 million , America Haunts , and that includes the wonderful photos on which you spin into the pants and then put friends on Facebook , where they are not getting rid of them , and then the type on which you stand leaves a comment like “ nice face pressure ” .	-10.1294
But we finally get to the pumpkins .	-2.6501
Charlie Brown made us familiar with the Great Curbis when we were children , and the biting of a pumpkin is like the Mystery of Christmas tree – something we made from small .	-5.9407
Fortunately , the “ baby in the pumpkin ” trend started last year thanks to Pinterest , so most of us have grown up with caring the pumpkin rather than sitting in it .	-4.7181
This year , Americans will spend about $ 106 million on pumpkins , according to the US Census Bureau .	-2.1755
The pumpkin laterns that slowly rotted in the front garden are probably from Illinois , where 245 million kilograms of pumpkin have been harvested this year .	-5.4154
If you want to score right , call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa , California and cut something of its 921 kilo heavy chicken .	-4.4895
Housing Bring in HelmbRight : Rescue forces Cattle Leiche	-5.6503
The fire brigade had to break out in Helmbrecht on Thursday night .	-2.9679
A three-family house in the district of Hof catches fire on Friday night .	-3.1474
The rescue forces have a stolen body from the house .	-2.4277
Rescue forces found a corpses in a fire in Helmbrecht in a three-family house .	-4.1840
Whether it is a resident , it is still unclear , as a police spokesman in Bayreuth said .	-4.5355
On the late Thursday evening , it had burned on the ground floor of the house .	-2.6184
When the fire brigade arrived , the flames already smashed from a window .	-3.1661
The staff went into the apartment and found the corpses in a room .	-2.9734
This and another room were completely destroyed .	-3.4362
The entire ground floor has been damaged .	-1.4285
All other residents were not home during the fire , the spokesman explained .	-3.4206
The building cannot be used for the time being .	-4.0821
The exact cause of the fire was initially not clear .	-1.8998
Germany 's largest regional church has an offensive artifact to promote the profession of pastor .	-3.4287
The background is a possible lack of a parish : the Gospel Lutheran National Church of Hanover calculates that the number of its present approximately 1,800 pastors will be halved by 2030 , according to its . the is . the . the , , the , , , , , the , , , and the	-17.4408
For young people from today the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects for the future , Pastor Mathis Burfien ( 43 ) said in conversation with the Evangelical Press Service .	-3.7680
It is attractive to be able to determine the workflow and the workflow itself .	-4.5548
For the first time , the regional church commissioned a pastor in a full place to inspire young people to study theology .	-4.8127
Currently , fewer and fewer young people decide to study theology after the tut.	-4.0560
Burfien returns this to the process of deception : " God 's voice is quiet , the world is loud " .	-3.2696
It is a profession of great freedom and diversity .	-2.5822
I am the master of my calendar and I can focus on where it is important to me .	-4.2176
Pastores could be a salesman very close to the people .	-4.3338
They earned as much as teachers and could live well .	-2.2923
Certainly , more is paid in the free economy , but theologians would have a safe employer .	-3.3269
This is to the young people of today , who are not just about careers , but about decent work .	-4.3766
According to the National Church , which covers three quarters of Lower Saxony , around 60 pastors are retired each year .	-3.4370
At the same time , about 40 graduates from a theological school start their vikariat .	-4.4083
In sparsely populated peripheral areas such as Harz , Emsland and Wendland it will be difficult to fill jobs in the future .	-3.4570
Burfien wants to organise studies for young people and to invite celebrities who have studied theology .	-5.4008
Theological studies offer a broad education .	-3.9050
You can even become German President .	-2.9569
Land Rover Rally Series announced	-0.9393
The interior features race seats and six-point belt seats and an outdoor facility .	-5.8021
The options range from strengthened brakes , a service package with support for Bowler Works mechanics and logistical support to vehicle storage between events .	-3.6330
Drew Bowler , Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport , explains : “ The Rally customers who come to Bowler have changed . ”	-2.5338
They are not all experienced riders , but people who are looking for excitement and adventures , as well as an accessible way to world class events .	-5.0571
We are pleased to open this path in partnership with Land Rover and MSA , and believe that the format opens up new possibilities to experience the different rally disciplines in Britain and abroad and to prepare newcomers for the straits and reality of Rally Raid .	-5.3048
We really had fun developing the Defender Challenge car – that will be an entertaining championship .	-3.3234
In addition , the Defender Challenge has a training and test day in February and the option to participate in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East .	-4.3560
Fire brigade called for the rescue of a mountain that was erected 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rock leap in a quarry .	-7.7287
Cockerspacial-Hündin Ruby had run off after a minor accident .	-3.6630
Three days later , she was discovered by a walker in the quarry in her predicament .	-2.9463
Firemen roared up on the cliff and rescued the dog from safe death .	-4.7022
The fire brigade was able to secure a little bit that stood on a 15-meter high ascent in a cliff wall .	-6.5596
The nine months old CockerSpaniel-Hündin Ruby had gone out after a road accident on Sunday afternoon and survived for three days before being saved from a quarry on Wednesday .	-5.3527
Scott Alderson , 25 , and his friend Becky Hall , 20 , who belongs to the dog , came to the quarry Flappit in Denholm , West Yorkshire to welcome Ruby again and thank the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service firemen .	-4.1296
They had desperately sought their missing bitch and published requests for help on social networks when they had escaped to the quarry after the small traffic accident .	-6.5257
At about 2 : 15 a.m. on Wednesday , a walker who took up his dog saw the stranded Ruby on the 15 meters high paragraph in the quarry .	-6.5236
The technical rescue team of the Cleckheaton Fire Station ran out and took off to rescue Rubys , which was then transported up in a dog box .	-6.2246
Andy Clayton , a technical rescue team specialist , said : “ She was in a dangerous situation .	-2.6888
It was located in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and the bottom .	-2.9634
She did not motion a muscle while she was rescued – she was like frozen .	-4.0571
Now it is going well .	-1.6584
She then eaten a few dog cakes .	-1.7584
That was a rather unusual effort .	-3.5100
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible .	-1.3628
Peter Lau , a technical rescue team specialist , said : “ Ruby had a huge piece of work . ” . the , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-8.2400
It was possible that it was very badly injured or worse .	-3.0266
Ruby was brought to the veterinarian , but he did not find anything other than exhaustion and dehydration .	-4.0646
Becky Hall from Halifax , West Yorkshire , said : “ It was frightening to see the rescue . ”	-3.3616
I couldn 't believe she was there .	-3.0587
It was wonderful to keep them in the poor again .	-2.0272
The veterinarian explained that if exhaustion had become too large and it had collapsed , it would probably have crashed .	-3.7098
The firemen have done great things .	-2.2223
What they did was really courageous .	-2.4859
We are just so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible .	-2.0318
Scott Alderson from Keighley added , “ We were afraid that she would fall , but she stayed up . ”	-3.1302
The firemen were great .	-1.7686
I can hardly believe where it was .	-1.4464
Mick Jagger explains that he never remembered Katy Perry when she was 18 .	-3.2078
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week , the pop star said she had been working as a background singer on Jaggers song " Old Habits Die Hard " from 2004 .	-4.8330
Perry explained that she had eaten with the altrocker to evening , and that “ he got me up when I was 18 . ”	-8.6741
She added : “ This has been a long time ago and he was very nice to me . ”	-2.9790
In a statement , a representative Jaggers , 70 , said on Thursday that he “ categorically denied that he had ever attempted to approach Katy Perry . ”	-5.2175
The representative added : “ Perhaps she confused him with someone else . ”	-2.5600
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest appearance this year during the Rolling Stones tour .	-4.0941
Her new album “ Prism ” landed at first place this week .	-3.2050
George Kerevan : European unbundling gives the Scots the vote	-6.5127
A new day , a new history of terror about independence .	-2.1935
This time , we are warned that an independent Scotland is needed to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership .	-2.5660
This provides the keyword for stories about pass controls in Berwick and a border with barbed wire along the Hadrian wall .	-4.1754
In fact , the Strathclyde proposal drew attention to the potential economic benefits that would bring more freedom of travel in the rest of Europe , but this did not , I expect , play a role in the headlines .	-6.4830
Nor has anyone mentioned that EU member states often bend their strict rules when it is cheaper for them .	-3.5316
As Scotland currently does not belong to the Schengen area , continuing disregard for Brussels would be a small concession in exchange for what is really wanted by the Scots .	-5.0941
So it is not a story .	-2.2891
The first time I heard the “ Independence means Passport Control ” duct at least 40 years ago .	-4.8191
An interesting point is lost in constantly repeating this ancient history .	-3.4578
Why expect an independent Scotland to dance to the European pillar ?	-2.8952
Why exchange the London yoke for Brussels , especially now ?	-1.5078
These are the real European news : the great post-war plan for uniting Europe has stalled .	-2.9828
With the euro crisis , the European project has officially died .	-2.0025
Across the EU , parties that are hostile to the EU or wish to discard the euro as a common currency are gaining ground .	-2.7969
Even in Germany , the Euroskeptic Alternative for Germany – founded only this year – was able to win almost five million votes in the September election , effectively driving the Free Democrats ( the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrat ) out of the Bundestag .	-5.2396
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe .	-1.7446
The current economic crisis , however , turns out to be a turning point .	-1.5394
Because of the rigorous austerity policies imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank in connection with the straitjacket in which the national economy is forced by sticking to the single currency , many people believe that the European project has gone too far .	-5.0005
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments creating excessive fiscal deficits – only in Greece .	-2.6055
Instead , the eurozone system has fixed its members on exchange rates that are advantageous to German exporters – and German politicians like that .	-4.2446
Without the possibility of devaluing the local currency , southern Europe will find itself with a built-in productivity disadvantage vis-à-vis Germany .	-3.9236
The only way is to cut wages and public spending – spurred by Berlin .	-1.4448
There is a deeper European productivity problem behind the current fiscal and monetary problems .	-2.1982
As a result of the “ green ” energy directives imposed by Brussels – a code for subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – European industry pays twice the price for electricity and four times the price of gas compared with the United States .	-4.2855
This is a crippling cost disadvantage , as we saw in Grangemouth .	-3.1885
All world wage fixing does not protect the European petrochemical industry from being pushed into the corner by cheap American shale gas .	-2.6658
As a result , there is a revolt , especially in France , the EU ’ s former chief executive .	-3.0536
After the war , France ’ s political elite saw the EU as a vehicle for keeping Germany in check and elevating Paris on an equal footing with Washington .	-2.6230
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy , and has pushed Europe into its own economic policies , with the result of which the struggling French economy is struggling .	-4.9453
The result : Marine Le Pen ’ s right-wing anti-EU National Front has just won a decisive re-election , leaving the ruling socialists at the top of three .	-4.2058
The National Front is now France ’ s most popular party with 24 % of the vote – a timely warning to the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that right-wing divisions would automatically benefit the left .	-4.5219
What makes Le Pen with its newly won popularity among the white working-class French ?	-2.3942
It wants to use next year 's EU elections to forge an anti-EU and anti-Community currency bloc in the European Parliament .	-2.9046
If the anti-EU parties do well in these elections – and this is very well possible – then for the first time such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament .	-3.2690
This is the point I want to make : in the not too distant future , the growing opposition to the EU and the common currency will come together to abolish the euro .	-3.4871
The EU will not disappear , but it will become more like the “ Europe of ( sovereign ) nations , ” which General de Gaulle favored .	-2.5094
Germany and some of its satellite economies may be holding down the euro , but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies .	-2.5895
I expect Britain to distance itself from this project in the hope of joining the US .	-2.6292
But Washington ’ s growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be in Atlantic rain alone .	-2.0941
Where is Scotland in all this ?	-1.5733
We can decide to be a region of ( at the end ) Small England .	-2.5422
Or we can defend our own economic interests – including telling Berlin and Brussels what they can do .	-3.4630
I suspect that Scotland could go very well in a more relaxed European Union if we retain our own currency .	-4.9095
Cooperation with other similar countries is easier in a non-federal Europe of nations .	-1.8636
Otherwise , we should consider doing the same with Norway and maintaining our economic independence .	-3.5841
The SNP government in Scotland , remarkably , is the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe and won a spectacular majority in 2011 , owing to the rejection of the proposed ( and implemented ) cuts that Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem coalition had to answer .	-4.6111
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to opt for independence now , only to get austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels .	-3.3761
Early Puberty : Will Grow Up faster	-2.2053
Afro-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white ages , as studies show .	-2.8251
Physical Changes Not Immediately Puberty	-2.9563
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible .	-1.4497
Experts believe that the epidemic obesity is a trigger for early puberty .	-1.9757
The trend toward early puberty is less pronounced for young people .	-2.6878
Pat Etheridge , a former CNN correspondent , is a journalist specializing in child health and family issues .	-2.8190
Should a mother be concerned when her daughter grows breasts and shamhairs at the age of seven or eight ?	-3.2909
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando , Florida , the pediatrical endocrinologist Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and were a new standard .	-11.1112
“ I spend a lot of time reassuring parents – usually this is no sign that puberty is coming soon , ” Kaplowitz explained .	-5.4979
Obvious indicators of development , such as growing breasts , sham and axle hairs , and body smell , are showing in girls earlier .	-4.9240
However , there was only a slight shift in the age of the menarches ( occurrence of the first round blood ) over the last 40 years .	-4.6754
In the United States , the average age is 12.5 years , slightly less than 12.75 in 1970 .	-1.6215
“ When the breast ’ s development begins , it takes at least two to three years to menarche , ” said Kaplowitz , author of the book “ Early Puberty in Girls : The essential guide to dealing with this frequently occurring problem ” .	-5.8895
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty progresses .	-1.4254
It is controversial , which is indeed the beginning of puberty , but it is ‘ early on ’ when the breast increase is accompanied by a growth boost of eight years ago .	-5.7597
In most cases , the process slows or stagnates – something that a paediatrician can monitor closely .	-3.1029
As soon as progress is made , tests may be displayed by an endicron so that serious problems such as tumors or cysts can be excluded .	-6.3179
There are methods of treatment to delay early menstruation and the defense of another consequence : premature ageing of bones , which can ultimately lead to growth inhibitions and therefore small body growth in adults .	-6.5995
The recommendations for medical or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child , the speed of development , the rate of growth and the emotional maturity .	-3.5598
Psychosocial aspects are also important .	-1.4585
Kaplowitz is cautious about drugs , but he admits : “ The oppression of puberty can alleviate behavioral problems and girls ’ feelings , rather than their old minds . ”	-6.0674
The other major problem is understandable : parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have the period .	-1.6269
“ They worry about pregnancy risks or about how to manage the hygiene side , ” said Kaplowitz .	-4.4026
“ It was a shock , ” recalls a woman whose daughter received her days with ten .	-3.2025
Although there were initial signs and we were talking about menstruation , it was emotionally unprepared .	-3.2015
She came frightened and excited from the school home because she was the first in her Friends circle .	-6.2586
There are many widely published theories about the causes of early puberty .	-1.5251
But there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other foods , chemicals in the environment , or sexual messages in the media .	-3.4234
Young are like girls earlier in puberty .	-3.4253
Kaplowitz believes that the most convincing premise is the obesity epidemic .	-1.7065
He supported the implementation of a study in 2001 on girls aged six to nine , which establishes a link between body fat and admission to puberty .	-4.5364
Other studies support this conclusion , but there are many other factors that played a role .	-9.4146
In this country , African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white age sensations .	-3.3418
There are different explanations for this .	-1.2811
Globally , early puberty seems to be influenced by all kinds of things , from economic conditions to the climate to genes .	-2.7220
Another puzzle : Although boys are growing earlier , the trend toward a full-time puberty is not as strong as girls .	-5.3260
Other doctors at the AAP conference emphasized the complexity of the topic .	-2.3552
The appearance of acne and shamhair is common even in babies and infants .	-3.0079
“ We need to be careful about how we identify the real beginning of puberty , ” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman , a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children 's Hospital in Morristown , New Jersey .	-3.4542
Parents should not hesitate to consult their pediatrician on how to talk to their children .	-3.6567
“ This can mean having to talk earlier than expected , ” Kaplowitz said .	-3.6598
If you remain calm , the child usually reacts well .	-1.9520
Girls who flourish early need the insurance that the process is a normal part of life , even if they arrive earlier than intended .	-3.4620
Jumbo manufacturers compete over a seat width in the face of large orders .	-3.4235
Between leading aircraft manufacturers there has been a dispute over the wide range of tourism-class seats on long-haul flights , suggesting the tone for a bitter collision at Dubai Airshow this month .	-5.3962
The dispute revolves around the seating width offered to passengers on long flights in the tourist class – not always those who are most concerned by airlines , but this designated space is the key to the efficiency assertions of the latest Airbus SAS and Boeing Co aircraft .	-5.8772
This week , Airbus called for a industry standard requiring a maximum of 46 cm ( 18 inches ) in the tourist class , but the US archrival Boeing says that the airlines should decide .	-5.8028
The debate comes at a time when aircraft manufacturers are competing to sell even larger versions of their twin-engine long-range flyers , and expect record orders from 17 to 21 November at the event .	-5.5708
As the rear part of the aircraft is designed – especially if there are rows of nine or ten seats – it is crucial for the given economic results that will deliver the new “ mini jumbo ” design .	-5.2078
Boeing claims that its modernized “ 77X ” was 406 people in tourist class seats over 17 inches wide and thus allow ten per row .	-5.8069
Airbus declares that the competing version of the A350 will carry 350 people in 18 inches wide in the tourist class , with nine per row .	-4.9435
Aircraft giants often divide Hiebe through technical details through advertising in the specialist press .	-4.8700
Now Airbus is appealing directly to the public at the Dubai Airshow , where the 777X is expected to be the race with over 100 orders .	-4.5998
Recently , the company presented an ad that could be the beginning of a new advertising war , showing donors a picture of three people sitting together in a restaurant , entitled “ Would you accept that ? ”	-5.5765
“ Boeing proposes long-haul flights in seats that are tighter than regional turbo props , ” says Airbus ’ sales manager John Leahy .	-3.8652
People are getting thicker as they change , but aircraft seats have not changed radically .	-4.0090
Between the early 1970 ’ s , when the Boeing 747 defined modern long range travel , and the end of the century increased the weight of the average American male between 40 and 49 years , according to the Department of Health .	-5.2823
The size of the male average American in the 21st century is 100.8 cm , according to American health statistics .	-3.8862
Airbus says that its rivalry adheres to a seat concept from the 1950s , when the average body range of the freshly squeezed jet set was narrower .	-6.1381
Airbus reported that an additional tariff ( 2.54 cm ) per seat increased the sleeping quality by 53 % .	-4.0870
Boeing disputes Airbus 's figures as it stands and says that it is not at the discretion of the manufacturers to decide how airlines balance air fares and equipment .	-6.3143
The company also explains that , according to studies , the aircraft experience depends on more than its seat width .	-4.1958
“ It really is about giving airlines flexibility to do what they think they need to be successful , ” says the cabin expert Kent Craver of Boeing .	-4.8656
They do not want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable .	-1.0820
They know their business better than anyone .	-1.1112
Passengers are concerned with greater freedom of envelope , but for manufacturers it is becoming increasingly an issue that can affect sales .	-5.5288
Behind the controversy is a race for aircraft orders estimated at least $ 700 billion at list prices over the coming decades , which could have a lasting impact on the US or Europe ’ s export balance .	-4.8826
As Reuters first reported in July , the seating layout is the driving force behind the fight for the new jets .	-2.9787
Both Airbus and Boeing maintain 20 % more efficiency per seat in their latest twin-engine long-range designs than the market leader in this segment , Boeing 77-300ER .	-3.0594
The results of Boeing are partly dependent on the fact that the 777X is compared to its ten seats per row with the original design of nine seats in the 777 .	-3.8217
The increased cost per unit is still lower than that of currently used machines with ten seats per row .	-3.9213
“ Boeing therefore squeezes more seats in its aircraft to make it more competitive with our products , ” says Kevin Keniston , Head of Passenger Comfort at European Airbus .	-4.1531
On the other hand , analysts say that full cabins with ten seats per row for existing 777s indicate that many passengers choose the closer arrangement , which could be accompanied by cheaper fares .	-4.6307
“ Eighteen inch seating width would be great for passengers , but the reality is : from an economic point of view , Airbus ’ offer is controlled by the 777 threat , ” says Mary Kirby , expert in cabin design , founder and editor of Runway Girl Network .	-5.5879
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats , but a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can select .	-3.0397
The world ’ s traveller jet-sellers even wear gangs to measure the setup with the competition .	-8.8391
Even if they price comfort , all manufacturers also offer jets with highly compacted design for low-cost airlines and regional flights .	-5.0304
Airbus offers a ten-seat A350 , but it has not yet been sold .	-3.8956
Until recently , Airbus has emphasised the importance of greater adaptability for the cabins and wide cabin seats for some jets .	-5.5285
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets , experts say that the call for a new industry standard is likely to fade , but could distract from the wave of 777X sales .	-4.8727
New anti-nicotine vaccine could make smoking fun .	-3.1755
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could spoil the fun of smoking .	-1.8473
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice for a lifetime from nicotine addiction .	-2.6365
Prior to human testing , more tests are needed , which may take some years to go , but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said that the first results are good .	-4.5646
“ We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to stop , trying to try all the methods available on the market , but have experienced that nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches , ” Cornell said .	-5.8491
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been changed to include genetic information on the manufacture of nicotine antibodies .	-2.9162
The virus selectively infected liver cells , which then produce a permanent stream of antibodies .	-3.0364
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before reaching the brain , leaving a smoker without the high nicotine .	-3.8886
In experiments , vaccinated mice , which Nikotin was administered , kept their normal level of activity .	-4.4487
Unvaccinated mice , on the other hand , would have taken a “ out-of-time , ” the researchers said , a sign that Nikotin had reached its brain .	-6.1008
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine .	-2.1201
Previous tobacco vaccines were failing because they contained antibodies .	-1.7521
The vaccinations had to be so common that they were expensive and impractical to maintain the antibody pedal .	-4.6122
But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be significantly lower , as it transforms liver cells into antibody factories .	-3.3253
As Professor Crystal said , a future vaccine for people , if it is certain , could be administered to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette , thereby preventing nicotine addiction .	-3.9454
More likely , though , smokers would use him to stop .	-1.8364
“ They then know : when they start to smoke again , they no longer feel a pleasure because of nicotine vaccine , and that helps them to break their habit , ” he explains .	-6.3769
British scientists said that the results were interesting , but at the same time warned that more research was needed .	-3.2352
Tripodi ’ s claim to have been influenced by Obeid	-3.7787
The former Labor Party minister Joe Tripodi of New South Wales is being investigated by the government ’ s oversight of corruption .	-5.2976
The former NSW minister denies that he has changed the rules on maritime leasing at the request of his political mentor , Eddie Obeid , who had hidden holdings in three properties on state-controlled land .	-5.7060
On Friday , the Independent Commission Against Corruption ( ICAC <unk> Independent Commission against Corruption ) extended its investigations into the question of whether Obeid has influenced various ministers of state in terms of leasing contracts at the Circular Quay , where the Obeids operate two restaurants and a café without extending their invitation to tender after their expiry in August 2005 .	-7.6536
Now , because of the accusation , Tripodi knew that Obeids had hidden interest in the property , after Tripodis told former deputy chief of staff Lynne Ashpole on Thursday accordingly .	-6.3398
In many years of discussions that began in 2005 , the government had pushed for public procurement contracts .	-3.7717
They were opposed to it and wanted to run longer .	-4.5474
In 2009 , the lease contracts for companies on the Circular Quay , which gave Obeids $ 2.5 million a year , were extended without public tender .	-4.8294
Tripodi , the port minister from February 2006 to November 2009 , originally supported public procurement .	-3.0897
But he disagreed to have made the changes on the request of Obeid , who , as Tripodi confirmed , had pressed for a change in government leasing rules .	-6.0005
One of the ICAC ’ s telephone records showed talks from August and September 2007 between Obeid , Tripodi and Steve Dunn , a senior official who had moved to the port ministry after working under care in the fishing authority .	-5.6969
“ Was the issue raised in these phone talks about drawing up commercial payoffs ? ” , Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi asked .	-5.2273
“ No , ” Tripodi replied .	-2.1225
I cannot remember what was discussed , but it was definitely not .	-1.9071
Definitely not between me and Mr Obeid .	-2.0623
Israeli warplanes are targeting Syria , so official sources	-6.4165
Israeli hunting aircraft would have attacked a target in the Syrian port of Latakia , confirmed a senior government representative to Fox News .	-5.1908
The official did not explain what the objective was , but said it was at least one .	-2.5874
According to Associated Press , the target was Russian SA-125 missiles .	-1.5338
At least twice this year , Israel has already carried out rocket deliveries in Syria .	-2.8401
Foreign workers with 457-visas could be subject to ‘ authenticity tests ’ .	-2.6888
The government is considering a “ authenticity test ” for foreign workers with a 457-visa within the framework of expanded measures .	-4.4918
If the test were to be introduced , he would use a criterion to prevent the 457 being used to fill unqualified jobs or as a back door to attract family and friends to Australia .	-4.6445
Today , a government proposal for discussion was published after the former Labour Party MPs , Maxime McKew , condemned the government ’ s comments on foreign workers , because they could be interpreted as insulting by Australia ’ s neighbors .	-5.4086
“ Strong explanations like foreigners are to backfire — and Australians are an unpleasant fall in times when trade unions demand a protected labor market , ” she told Australia India Institute today .	-6.4977
Historically , that meant that white labor should be protected – and , if some in the region rally an echo of this historical artifact , I would not be surprised .	-4.9703
The proposal for a debate covers twelve measures that were once envisaged by former immigration minister Chris Bowen .	-8.7012
Immigration Minister Brendan O 'Connor , who was in talk yesterday about human trafficking in Sri Lanka , has implemented five of the recommended changes and others are still being considered .	-4.0545
If the ‘ authenticity criterion ’ is adopted , someone who applies for a visa could be checked to see whether ‘ the application is valid in cases where the applicant is related to or personally linked to the owner or a relevant person of the supporting company ’ .	-7.1160
Companies could also be required to account for the number of 457 visa holders after , in the past , companies that initially wanted to support only a small number of workers have finally stopped employing hundreds .	-5.1387
Meanwhile , a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum officer probably died from a heart attack after he arrived this week with a refugee boat on Christmas island .	-4.6568
The injured nine-year-old husband ’ s son , who had come to Australia with him , has been served by an adult cousin since his father ’ s death on Wednesday , who was also on the boat .	-5.1301
Australian authorities brought the man to the Christmas Island Hospital where he died .	-1.7687
The British Government has announced a study to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland .	-2.7469
The work of HS2 Ltd proposes to implement high-speed links between Scotland and the North of England as early as phase 1 in 2026 .	-3.6784
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said that the project “ will bring Britain closer together ” .	-2.1844
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was very pleased to work with the British Government on this plan .	-2.8819
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail link between London and the West Midlands .	-2.0832
After completion of phase 2 there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds .	-2.3369
In June , the government corrected the estimated cost of building the high-speed railway between London and the north of England from <unk> 32.7 billion to <unk> 42.6 billion .	-3.5316
The British Government , which is involved in discussions with Transport Scotland , has commissioned HS2 Ltd to seek further route capacity and travel time improvements for North England and Scotland .	-4.9665
This includes the possibility of a journey to London from Glasgow and Edinburgh , ultimately for three hours or less .	-5.4716
Baroness Kramer said : “ Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network of routes that brings Britain and its cities closer together . ”	-2.5852
We are progressing with HS2 because it brings enormous benefits .	-3.1578
Without it , we are faced with a crisis of capacity in our rail network .	-2.3377
But there is also the link between 18 British cities , including Glasgow and Edinburgh , which is improved thanks to HS2 .	-2.8171
The Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael commented : “ Today ’ s announcement is good news for Scotland . ”	-2.6503
On behalf of the Scottish Government , Keith Brown Carmichael called for the Scottish integration into the HS2 network .	-3.3484
Brown said : “ The high-speed rail link has the potential of huge economic benefits for Scotland , but at the same time Scotland ’ s economic power is an argument for fast rail connections across the UK . ”	-4.8314
We are therefore pleased to work as a partner of the British Government and to examine the options for a high-speed rail link in Scotland , which will bring benefits to everyone and complement the link between Glasgow Edinburgh , which the Scottish Government is already planning .	-5.5999
I look forward to examining this report with the British ministers next year and to taking the next steps together .	-3.7105
Rules on electronic equipment in aircraft are being provisionally in force in Australia .	-3.8491
Australian air passengers must continue to shut down tablets and smartphones at launch and landing , despite efforts in the US to relax the regulations on such devices .	-5.0048
The US Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) enables US airlines to change their requirements so that passengers can read , watch or play e-books during critical flight phases , provided they are in “ flight mode . ”	-5.0930
Passengers are already allowed during most of the flight , but many people find it annoying that they cannot read their e-books when they start and landing .	-4.4980
Australian companies do not have immediate plans to change their regulations to implement them .	-4.9758
CASA also declared that the announcement would be viewed , but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic equipment in critical flight phases in Australia still apply .	-5.0172
“ CASA currently has no specific regulations on the use of electronic equipment on the aeroplane , ” has been announced . , , , and , , , , , , , , and , , , and ,	-8.2297
It is subject to provisions which require airlines to maintain safety at all times and passengers to comply with safety instructions provided by cabin crew .	-4.8166
Virgin has already held talks with CASA about extending the use of his Wi-Fi entertainment system to flights and has declared that you are open to change , but they should be initiated by the legislator .	-5.7074
“ We would welcome a review of the approval of electronic devices by CASA , because we are convinced that this would improve customer experience , now that we ( wireless entertainment ) offer during the flight , ” said a speaker .	-4.9518
Qantas explained that the current rules will continue .	-3.2017
“ Our current directives stipulate that electronic equipment must not be used at start-up and landing and we currently have no plans to change that , ” the company stated .	-5.0485
The FAA rules apply to US airlines .	-1.6050
However , we are always interested in developments in legislation that passengers can benefit from and will certainly take a close look at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it .	-4.1513
The decision varies depending on the age of the fleet .	-2.7058
They have to prove that their aircraft can tolerate radio disruptions by mobile devices , and change manuals , training materials , hand baggage programs , and customer documentation .	-4.8824
“ Once an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet , it can allow passengers to use portable , lightweight electronic devices such as tablets , e-book reading devices and smartphones at any rate , ” the FAA announced .	-5.7596
In rare cases , the crew will instruct passengers while landing the equipment .	-3.9036
The group also recommended that heavier devices be stolen at start-up and landing safely under the seat or in the subjects above the seats .	-4.8105
In front of the Piano Piano against Schalke , BVB trailers with light rockets had provided ugly scenes in the Veltins Arena .	-6.7034
Borussia Dortmund subsequently announced severe consequences .	-1.6279
Prior to the Friday match of the football league against the VfB Stuttgart , the Ultras responded with a silence - first .	-4.6756
It was an unfamiliar , almost spoken acoustics that was offered to the viewer until just before the start of the Bundesliga game between the German vice champion Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart in the signal Iduna Park .	-6.0524
The fans of the guest were mostly listening with their singing .	-4.7710
On the other hand , where BVB fans are the most loyal - and loudest - BVB fans presented themselves at first a very quiet time : no sounds , no slaughter calls .	-8.0622
The podium of Capo , which otherwise coordinates the joint firing , remained untouched .	-4.3292
And in the front of the gallery , a big flag flashed with a inscription " Stadion Banning section " .	-7.5956
Only as Torhüter Roman Weidenfeller , as always , took the place as the first BVB player , burned up a brief celebration .	-6.3686
When his team members followed , there were loud vocals and weeding scars - but not everywhere .	-4.8232
There was nothing happening in the central blocs 12 and 13 in the southern gallery .	-8.3925
Norbert Dickel 's stadium lecturer once again listed the positive experiences of the last few days - Derbysieg , victory over Arsenal , contract extension of trainer Jürgen Klopp - did not cause celebration .	-6.1080
Only five minutes before the launch of the Capo reached its podium - and until then , the straight with palpable tension unleashed in a loud cry when Dickel as usual asked the mood on the ridges in the stadium .	-9.6767
The last one , as always , was the South Tribune in the row - and finally the loudest place in the stadium was again . . the were . , and , , , , , , , , , ,	-12.4854
And at the latest when the loud call from the southern tribe arrived at the loudest call " Derbysieur stands up " , everything was again as usual .	-9.1215
Silence before it was probably a reaction to what has happened in recent days .	-3.0837
Immediately before Referderby at the FC Schalke 04 , some of the followers of BVB had hit the spectators and pushed to the square - and almost Torhüter Roman Weidenfeller met .	-8.5751
The game was delayed because of the chaotic scenes .	-1.2172
BVB-Boss Hans-Joachim Watzke received the top of the Dortmunder Ultras in his office - and one believes Watzke 's words , this was a rather untiring appointment for the fanatics .	-5.2391
" There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra movement , " the BVB-Boss announced on Thursday evening at a panel discussion in Frankfurt .	-3.7186
As an immediate measure , Watzke prohibited Ultras from choreography for the home game against VfB Stuttgart .	-7.0620
" I banned this , " he said .	-2.8549
We cannot abandon the zero tolerance policy on pyrotechnics .	-1.6882
In addition , the Ultras have been shown various ways of punishing them - until Tuesday they now have time to choose one .	-5.8260
Otherwise , Watzke said , the BVB will impose a sanction by the end of next week .	-3.3621
" This will be drastic , " says Watzke .	-2.5254
It is interesting to see how the reactions in the southern gallery are then .	-3.7698
Pfandhäuser boomed in Singapore , as the middle-class crisis has arrived .	-3.4956
In a deposit house in the Bendemeer Shopping Center in Singapore , Janani Amirthalinga is exchanging a golden rifle , a ring and a pair of earrings to pay the school fees of her daughters .	-5.9958
“ My husband and I have just bought a house because my whole money is in , ” says Amirthalinga .	-3.1470
Although every month they earn 3,000 Singapore dollars ( about 1.730 euros ) as an administrative co-worker and work their husband , the monthly family income is not sufficient , she explains .	-5.9721
Indeed , in parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt is increasing – demand is so great that ValueMax , where it has made its exchange , has become the third deposit listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week .	-4.9706
The pledge of jewellery is not only a quick way to get money – $ 1,300 of Singapore in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan .	-4.0593
Typically , deposit houses in Singapore require an effective annual interest rate of 17 % , just over the 15.4 % that the United Overseas Bank requires , a local creditor with a branch in the same shopping center .	-3.9655
But Pfandhäuser has the advantage that there is no need to review credit rating or income proof , which means that loans can be made faster than banks can .	-5.9601
That is why millions of people in the region are turning to Pfandhäuser , as families feel the pressure from rising living costs and rising household and consumer debt .	-4.5814
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap credit , owing to easy fiscal policies in the developed economies , families with lower and middle-income income seek deposit houses , thereby compensating for the difference in a contentious economy .	-6.1612
This week , the credit rating agency Standard & Poor ’ s growing fiscal debt , mainly due to rising mortgages , was a risk to Asian banks ’ creditworthiness .	-3.1966
According to the agency ’ s estimates , Malaysia , Thailand , and Singapore have the highest household debt in Asia relative to gross domestic product .	-3.1338
Malaysia ranks 80 % of GDP at the top of the list , a 60 % increase in 2008 .	-3.0945
Popular economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand , which this week was just due to a technical recession .	-4.8559
On Thursday , the data showed a continuing weakness in exports and a drop in consumer demand .	-2.9838
“ In the end , this means that , with rising costs , middle- to lower segments ( the income scale ) will try to supplement their incomes wherever possible , ” says Song Seng Won , economist at CMB , a Malaysian bank .	-4.7710
Historical highs of gold prices over the past two years have reinforced the trend to pledge personal items , as people take the opportunity to turn family jewellery into cash .	-5.2459
In Singapore , about 70 % of the pledged items are in the 200 deposit houses of the city-state of gold .	-3.2443
People say , “ The price of gold looks good , let us pledge grandmothers of gold and return next month . ”	-4.1433
The largest Thai Pfandhouse operator , EasyMoney , has seen a 20 % increase in customers in its branches in recent months .	-4.0983
The growth in the Pfandbusiness is so strong that ValueMax , the operator of the branches in Bendemeer and 15 others in Singapore , wants to expand not only into neighbouring Malaysia – where the company operates four houses – but also outside Asia , Yeah Lee Ching , Managing Director of ValueMax .	-4.9695
The company is funding 60 percent of the 66 million Singapore dollars it received this week with the Singapore Stock Exchange .	-4.6051
While some lenders have come into the crunch for high interest rates , Yeah explains that deposit houses are not only cheaper interest rates than other lenders , but also did not directly raise the debt .	-5.6859
“ Customers refer to articles they already own , and the fluid of personal values does not increase household debt , ” she explains .	-5.2806
Pfandleife business is increasingly accepted as short-term , secured financing .	-3.9498
Nor are all people using the loan in financial difficulties .	-2.8881
Rich Singapore people also enter ValueMax 's stores to eat gold bars and Rolex watches , for which they receive up to 60 % of the purchase price in cash .	-5.4777
We have clients from every social class .	-2.1306
“ These include wealthy , who borrow something for a shop or investment in the short term , or small businesses that have to bridge bottlenecks in the cash flow , ” says Yeah .	-5.8656

Australia ’ s $ 325 million rescue package for Tasman Health	-3.0326
The Australian government insists on the harsh conditions associated with the $ 325 million bailout package for the Tasman health service to ensure that the state government cannot waste the money .	-4.4429
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take “ immediate action ” to avert a crisis caused by an aging population of the island state , a higher rate of chronic disease and system restrictions .	-4.3085
Financing for a four-year period was decided after government consultations with independent Tasman member Andrew Wilkie .	-4.2123
“ The government has drawn up an emergency rescue package that we believe addresses the unique challenges facing the federal state , ” said Plibersek today .	-4.8799
The 325-million-dollar package includes $ 31 million instant electoral support .	-3.4300
Another 2600 operations , including orthopaedic interventions and treatments for gray star , are intended to eliminate residues .	-3.9411
There is also money for day clinics in Hobart and Launceston , better after-in-residence care , professional exchange , mental health services , and the introduction of an electronic system for recording health data in local hospitals .	-4.9155
“ These investments are in line with the ideas that I have heard in the hospital staff who have said they are the best way to improve the Tasman health system , ” said Tanya Plibersek .	-6.3890
The Minister insisted on strict reporting and accountability by the Tasman Government .	-2.7754
The federal state must maintain the current level of funding to obtain money from the Commonwealth and report monthly on where the additional money was spent .	-3.6831
A three-headed Commission will be set up to ensure that the federal state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible .	-3.5780
As Wilkie said today , the $ 325 million would be of little use if “ they were not accompanied by real reforms that would put the public Tasman health system on a more sustainable path . ”	-4.1236
Nevertheless , he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent help , which he first expressed to the Prime Minister in early May .	-3.3136
“ I am confident that state aid will make a major contribution to removing the state ’ s public health system from the list of care , ” said Wilkie .	-4.2929
According to the state government , these election benefits will largely make up for the recent cuts .	-2.7599
But Peter Dutton ’ s health policy spokesman at the federal level , Peter Dutton , believes that today ’ s announcement is only a “ plaster solution . ”	-4.0529
“ We are in today ’ s position because the Labor government has deducted $ 430 million from the health system , ” he said to ABC TV .	-3.8931
It is not acceptable for a government to be running almost half a billion dollars out of the system and for the Commonwealth to add 300 million and then pretend that the good news is .	-6.0646
Dutton asked Plibsek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the bailout will be spent on additional bureaucracy .	-3.4294

Syria has destroyed its ability to manufacture chemical weapons , a surveillance group	-2.9151
Syria has destroyed important chemical weapons and poison gas munitions facilities , the global chemical weapons monitoring group declared Thursday , while in the north of the country there have been severe clashes near one of the sites where suspected toxic substances are stored .	-6.6463
Also on Thursday , a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people were killed soon after the civil war began .	-3.1723
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons ( OPCW ) came one day before the deadline .	-2.8870
1 November , the Damascus organisation established in The Hague in order to destroy or " unoperable " all equipment for the manufacture of chemical weapons , including all machinery for mixing chemicals into poison gas and filling ammunition .	-5.9074
The conclusion of this process , which is essentially the first stage of destruction , is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable aimed at the destruction of all Syria ’ s chemical weapons by mid-2014 .	-3.6651
The destruction of facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons .	-1.7079
Damascus , however , must begin to destroy existing weapons and stocks .	-3.4364
According to assumptions , there are about 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons in the country , including Senfgas and Sarin nerve gas .	-3.0638
The announcement came at a time when fighting took place in the city of Safira on Thursday , when experts said that there was a chemical weapons production facility and storage facilities here , as the Syric Human Rights Observatory , based in the United Kingdom , said .	-5.8159
The activist group , which follows the number of deaths across a network of activists in Syria , said on Thursday that 120.296 people died .	-4.1589
Of these , 61.067 civilians , including 6,365 children .	-2.4124
On the side of the government , 29,954 of them were the army of President Bashar Assad , 18,678 were pro-government fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militias .	-3.3152
Also among the dead are 2,202 army soldiers and 5,375 opposition fighters , many of them foreigners .	-8.8557
On 25 July , the UN has estimated the number of deaths in this conflict since March 2011 to 100,000 .	-2.1629
This number has not been updated so far .	-1.5949
The conflict has forced about two million people to flee the country .	-1.4553
Assad ’ s troops have been fighting the rebels in Safira for weeks , many of which have connections with al-Qaeda groups .	-3.2496
The observatory said that there were losses on both sides on Thursday , but not details .	-3.0985
The fighting underlines the danger that chemical weapons inspectors face , because their mission to liberate Syria from its poisonous arsenal is a race against time in the midst of a great civil war .	-5.0372
According to OPCW , which works closely with the United Nations , the team is “ convinced that it has seen and seen all the major production and mixing / filling facilities mentioned by Syria , and its destruction . ”	-5.1865
“ No further inspection activities are planned . ”	-9.4539
Earlier this week , the inspectors had declared that they had completed the first round of checks and visited 21 of 23 of the sites mentioned by Damascus .	-3.4572
Due to safety concerns , the inspectors said that the visit was not possible .	-7.7902
On Thursday , the OPWC declared that the two sites had “ been abandoned ... and that the chemical weapons program ’ s properties there had been moved to other above-mentioned facilities . ”	-5.3427
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two facilities that OPCW inspectors could not visit .	-2.3890
Syria has put forward a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons , which must be approved by the Executive Committee of OPWC next month . the of .	-11.5633
“ I salute the bravery and courage that you have all shown in completing the most challenging mission ever carried out by this organisation , ” said Ahmed Uzumcu , the Director-General of the Supervisory Organisation , in a comment published by OPCW .	-4.7206
For three years now , the main Sunni Muslim rebels in the civil war have been fighting Assad ’ s government and its security forces , which include many members of the Alawites , to divide Shia Islam .	-4.3410
With regard to further developments , the head of the observation group , Rami Abdurrahman , said that there was a strong explosion on Wednesday in an air defence facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia .	-4.7219
The cause of the explosion is unknown , he explained .	-2.1897
Fury on Bali Bomber Trial	-3.9703
The 202 survivors and relatives of the 202 people who died in the bombing in Bali in 2002 responded to the verdict on the last of the instigators who were tried , because Umar Patek believed to be shot under the law .	-7.9972
Patek , who was on flight for just under ten years as one of the most wanted people in Southeast Asia , was condemned yesterday for his role in building explosives for the bombing to a prison sentence of 20 years .	-5.1728
It could be dismissed after 15 years with a penalty .	-10.6174
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder because of the attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta , where 202 people died , including 88 Australians , and many others were injured .	-3.4038
A condemnation also took place in a series of terrorist charges , including a wave of explosive attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000 .	-4.1446
The Public Prosecutor had called for life imprisonment , even if the death penalty could have been applied for the man who is also called “ Demolition Man ” because of his reputation as the most powerful bomber .	-7.0594
The decision aroused painful memories at June Corteen , a Perth mother who lost her 39 years old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the devastation caused by Patek and his conspirators nearly ten years ago .	-4.4735
With tears she said that Patek should have been condemned to death .	-2.2737
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the other bar .	-2.5017
“ It should be set before a shooting command , ” Corteen said to AAP .	-4.6162
I have to live with it every day that I will not get any more grandchildren and I will never see my daughters again .	-4.0697
The Sari Club was razed to the ground when , on 12 October 2002 , a huge bomb exploded in a small load parked in front of the club .	-5.5040
Peter Hughes was in Paddy 's Bar , where only 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber had an explosive backpack .	-3.3548
He fell into coma for a month after the attack , and died three times when he depended on a life-support system .	-5.0045
Hughes said that Patek deserves the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cell Jemaah Islamiah – Amrozi , Mukhlas , and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the bloodbath and executed four years ago .	-2.6148
In fact , this type should receive the death penalty above all others .	-3.5972
To keep him alive – no , there is no reason to keep him alive .	-2.9620
Getting 20 years after he killed 202 people and injured many hundreds is not much .	-2.1793
Patek is the last of the Bali bomber to be tried .	-2.3025
He expired almost a decade of arrest , but was eventually picked up in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottatbad , where US forces killed Osama bin Laden , just under four months later .	-5.0953
During the negotiation , an FBI agent said that intelligence reports had indicated that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of reconstructing the link between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda .	-4.6308
“ He did not stand , ” Corteen said .	-2.6361
Until recently , he has shown no repetition of how much he has inflicted on other people .	-3.5078
The verdict came before the tenth anniversary of the attack this year , celebrated with commemorative ceremonies in Bali and Australia .	-3.9086
“ There will be many tears this year , ” Corteen said .	-1.7742
Patek may appeal against his verdict .	-1.7146
FAA : Passengers can now use electronic devices in aircraft ( but do not have mobile phone calls )	-3.6973
Aviation passengers can now use their electronic devices for reading , work , games , music and the image of films , but not by phone , from the departure to landing , but the new guidelines issued on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) in the USA .	-7.6939
But passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately .	-1.3069
FAA ’ s staff , Michael Huerta , explained at a press conference how quickly they would be implemented .	-4.6019
The airlines must demonstrate to the FAA that aircraft conform to the new directives and that they have updated the personnel training manuals and equipment recovery rules in accordance with the new regulations .	-5.4113
The FAA stated that it has already received plans from some airlines to increase the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft .	-4.3168
Among these airlines were Delta and JetBlue .	-2.2474
“ Depending on the state of the plan , we could approve the increased use of electronic equipment very soon , ” the FAA announced in a statement .	-4.1106
Currently , passengers need to switch off smart phones , tablets , and other devices when aircraft doors are closed .	-3.4451
You may not reboot until the plane reaches a height of three kilometres and the captain gives the green light .	-3.7107
Passengers must switch them off and not restart them before the plane has landed .	-5.7464
According to the new directives , airlines whose aircraft are protected against electronic interference could allow their passengers to use the equipment at start-up , landing and on the field , the FAA stated .	-6.9552
Most of the new commercial aircraft and other aircraft that have been retrofitted for the use of Wi-Fi at major heights should meet the criteria .	-9.7170
Laura Glading , President of the Professional Flight Association , welcomed the changes .	-2.3386
“ If the new regime is implemented safely – and we work closely with the airline in this respect – both sides will benefit , ” commented Glading .	-4.4000
In all honesty , we are tired of having to feel pampered on this issue .	-5.0432
However , Internet connections for surfing , exchanging e-mails , text messages , or downloading data under three kilometres were still prohibited , the agency explained .	-4.7659
Passengers are asked to move smartphones , tablets and other devices in flight mode .	-3.3440
So still no “ Words With Friends ” , the Scrabble like online game played by actor Alec Baldwin in 2011 on his smartphone , when he had to leave a public jet of American Airlines because he refused to switch off the device while the plane was parked on the plane .	-5.0506
And heavier devices such as laptops must continue to be stolen as there is a danger of injury if they fly through the cabin .	-3.6815
Mobile calls during the flight are also prohibited .	-2.5264
The regulatory competence for telephone conversations lies with the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) , not with the FAA .	-1.9092
FAA may ban certain electronic equipment at launch and landing .	-2.8566
Last month , Mark Rosenker from the National Transportation Safety Board said that security experts on national transport issues at CBS News , mobile phones are still considered to be a risk .	-4.9326
“ Mobile phones are really a problem , not only because they could potentially cause disturbances in navigation equipment , but because we know from the FCC that transmission from the air can also disrupt transmitters , ” Rosenker said .	-5.5552
A consultative committee of the industry set up by the FAA to investigate this issue recommended last month that the government allow for wider use of personal electronic devices .	-5.1523
In recent years the pressure on the FAA has increased to relax restrictions on use .	-3.0311
Critics such as Missouri Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill argue that there are no valid safety reasons for the ban .	-2.9312
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of equipment has become ubiquitous .	-3.1254
Some studies refer to the fact that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore the decommissioning of the device . the is . , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-8.7389
In 1966 , the FAA began to restrict the use of electronic devices by air passengers after reports of disruptions to navigation and communication devices by passengers , which were then the latest technology trends .	-6.7211
New aircraft are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft , but they are also designed and approved by the FAA that electronic interferences do not make up for them .	-3.8566
Airlines have been offering passengers Wi-Fi for a number of years now when the flight is high .	-5.8440
The flyers fitted to Wi-Fi systems are also more unsensitive to interferences .	-3.8015
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for greater use of electronic equipment according to the new guidelines , Huerta said .	-3.7014
Today ’ s electronic equipment generally spends much less radio radiation than previous generations .	-3.2782
E-readers , for example , emit only minimal radiation when leaked .	-3.5959
However , when downloading or sending data , the data transmission values are stronger .	-3.3800
Among the champions of a relaxation of flight restrictions for passenger equipment is Amazon.com.	-5.1646
In 2011 , company employees invited a child E reader passenger aircraft and made a test flight to investigate problems , but were unable to find them .	-5.5444
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using devices .	-1.6956
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he thought the disruption of the equipment was real , even if the risk is minimal .	-3.6889
Other committee members have said that there are only isolated reports from pilots who talk of disrupting aircraft systems by equipment , and most of them are very old .	-4.4090
However , the Committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to arrange for passengers to turn off the equipment when landing instruments under poor visibility .	-6.5611
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and called them a sensible adaptation for travellers , which would be extensively equipped with technology today .	-5.2238
“ We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not in conflict with security , ” said Roger Dow , CEO of the U.S. Travel Association .	-3.0879
Related Bird saved by North Sea Brinsel ’ s Air Repartment Service	-5.6440
A bird flown by air rescue service to the coast , who was found exhausted on a North Sea oil island , has been laid off again in nature .	-5.0432
Last month , the water rally was flown to Aberdeen by a helicopter , caught up by the SPCA Scottish Animal Protection Agency in their rescue center in Alloa .	-5.5070
Colin Seddon , head of the center , said , “ This water rally was probably a wintry train from northern Europe , stopping through the strong winds over the North Sea . ”	-4.3103
Apparently , the exhausted bird looked for shelter on the drill island .	-3.1899
He added : “ He could not fly any further , so we were contacted with the request for help . ”	-3.6967
At her release the rally was again fit and healthy .	-3.4956
Is Europe ’ s elite ready to do business with Britain ?	-1.2210
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy to a table and defining what those who create wealth and work in Britain want to change our relations with the EU .	-4.6661
To this end , we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey among British economic leaders , asking them what they think about Britain , the economy , and the EU .	-2.7073
YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 business executives , representing around the UK ’ s size , sectors , and regions .	-5.3215
The results of the survey will be surprising .	-1.8006
We have found out that the vast majority of companies are now exported outside Europe , concentrating on countries that modernise and grow , while EU states are stagnant .	-4.5790
They want the government to favour new trade links with countries like China , India , and Brazil , rather than to stop the long and exhausting process of reforming the obscure EU institutions .	-4.9629
In their view , the majority of economic leaders believe that control of these key competencies should be brought back to Westminster .	-5.1908
There was general dissatisfaction about the internal market , because , according to companies , the costs of the Brussels regulations would now outweigh the benefits of being part of Europe ’ s trade zone – even 40 % of large companies agreed that they were traditionally the most pro-European .	-5.9820
Finally , and probably most of all , our survey of economic leaders showed that a large majority of the UK wanted to see a course of change for the agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade was not political .	-6.0310
This realization , found by companies of all sizes and leading corporations , shows that the economy is pushing for a “ meaningful change ” that brings the tide of action back to Britain .	-5.5871
There is a lot at stake – changing the agreement and better conditions for Britain would lead to a 16 % change of opinion in favor of remaining in the EU in a referendum .	-5.2681
The Prime Minister should have no doubt : this survey shows that the British economy is behind his plan to renegotiate Britain ’ s conditions for EU membership .	-2.7285
It also shows that companies expect a significant shift in power relations back to Britain from renegotiation .	-2.3473
A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary as the eurozone moves toward closer economic and fiscal union .	-2.7294
Jobs and growth in the UK must be a priority , as the result of our survey shows , what increased focus for businesses on trade and a fundamental change in the regulatory approach in Brussels is .	-4.9856
Gazprom ’ s Alexei Miller calls the beginning of a new gas era in Bulgaria .	-2.5886
The beginning of the construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria represents the start of one of the largest European energy projects , declared the Gazprom Board .	-3.6963
“ Today ’ s event is a milestone : building work on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline , the largest and most important project in Europe , has begun , ” said Gazprom ’ s CEO , Alexei Miller , in a statement on Thursday .	-4.1500
The project is a key element in the energy security of the entire European continent .	-1.9214
South Stream is meant to provide more diversity in Russia ’ s export routes through Europe .	-3.0188
A dispute between Gazprom and its counterpart in Ukraine , in which most of Russia ’ s gas is stored for Europe , is responsible for increasing the risk of conventional routes , as is stated by the official authorities .	-5.7451
Miller said that the direct link to Bulgaria , a member of the European Union , means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are “ forever ” out of date .	-3.3199
Bulgarian consumers receive gas from South Stream at discounted rates when the entire project comes into operation in 2015 .	-2.8918
According to Gazprom , construction work in other subordinate countries should begin on the planned route at the end of the year .	-3.4107
The pipeline is designed to supply natural gas with an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic metres .	-9.3081

German real estate markets benefit from the economic strength and the favourable European comparison of good economic conditions in the country .	-3.6203
This is what Christian Ulbrich , CEO of Europe , Middle East and Africa of Jones Lang LaSalle pointed out at the 9th real estate day of the stock exchange newspaper .	-3.6856
According to Ulbrich , how to look at German commercial real estate is to look at the transaction volume .	-4.9880
In the first three quarters of this year , the figure was 31 % compared to last year 's figure .	-2.8699
In the UK , the plus was only 6 % , in France at 19 % .	-7.3812
" Real estate investments offer an attractive interest , " said Ulbrich .	-1.7969

hearing before the Royal Commission : Two YMCA employees are charged with accusations against Jonathan Lord for sexual offences .	-4.3186
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales ( NSW ) were charged with child sex offences before 2011 allegations were made against the child welfare Jonathan Lord from Caringbah , as the Royal Commission experienced for child sexual abuse .	-4.6289
But in the Commission ’ s opening statement , YMCA had declared that “ there was never an incident of sexual abuse in the organization . ”	-4.9027
Phillip Hare , Managing Director , was asked about a case in which a YMCA employee had been charged with offences with child pornography , and another where a sports teacher of YMCA Caringbah Hall in 1991 had been convicted of abuse of entrusted children .	-6.1076
Hare said Gail Furness , one of the assisting lawyers to the Commission , that he knew of the first case but had not known the second .	-3.2547
He admitted that the YMCA ’ s opening statement to the Commission was also inaccurate in the assertion that “ there have been external YMCA reviews , in which YMCA has been recognized as being at the forefront of child safety . ”	-4.8994
Evidence before the Commission shows , however , that the YMCA was informed that it received the second lowest rating of four possible in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities ( Ministry of Education ) in August .	-12.1213
Hare , who started with 21 at the YMCA , admitted that the management failed “ from me to the downside ” in hiring Lord and did not ensure that employees were aware of their obligations to report violations of the child safety guidelines .	-6.0789
Lord was sentenced to 12 boys during his two years of work for the YMCA earlier this year because of sexual abuse .	-5.3192
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison .	-1.4872
But Hare discovers that the YMCA had a cultural problem that prevented the employee from reporting Lord ’ s breaches of child safety .	-5.1710
The staff said they had observed violations , including that Lord was alone with children , they were privately guarded as a babysitter , they were sitting on his lap , to say that he loved it , and children were playing with his mobile phone .	-7.6041
Danielle Ockwell , whose superior Lord was and who asked for a training on child protection because she was concerned about his behaviour , said that the childcare director , Jacqui Barnat , who was the superior Lords at YMCA Caringbah , was “ very intimidating and most of the time very unthink. ”	-7.7117
The CEO said he would not accept statements by employees that they would not have dared to report back to their superior .	-4.8440
Instead , he said , it was her friendship with Lord that affected her judgement , which is why she would not have asked him .	-4.7967
Hare explained that he told YMCA NSW ’ s board that the lesson that the organization had to draw from the “ Jonathan Lord incident ” was “ not about the reporting ” by employees , and the Board of Directors agreed to it .	-6.1980
Hare said that the decision to urge employees to sign secrecy commitments just after the accusations were made was taken by the YMCA ’ s Managing Director , Liam Whitley .	-5.0322
He said that the contamination of the evidence should be prevented , but that was ‘ overzealous ’ and poorly implemented .	-4.2123
The YMCA NSW was not a safe organisation for children when Jonathan Lord was there between 2009 and 2011 , declared Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University , expert on sexual child abuse , the Commission .	-4.0827
He explained that there were “ serious problems ” in employees ’ recruitment , checking , editing , training , and supervision .	-6.1020
The hearing was postponed until 20 December .	-1.2161
Tony Blair said he would seize the opportunity to return as British prime minister – but admitted that a comeback is unlikely .	-3.2198
In an interview this evening to mark the fifth anniversary of his departure , the 59-year-old announced his views on various domestic issues .	-3.2909
Since his resignation in June 2007 after a decade as Head of State , Blair has largely avoided speaking on British politics , and has mostly limited his comments to foreign policy and his role as envoy of the Quartet of Middle East Peacekeepers .	-4.7724
When asked whether he would like to return to the position of Prime Minister , Blair was quoted in the words of Evening Standard London : “ Yes , safe , but it is unlikely that this will happen , so ... ”	-4.8937

Fenton was praised by the Jurors for his natural skills in dealing with the pony , which lay far above his age .	-7.5476
Toffee was given best marks for his appearance and personality .	-5.7933
Fenton had been given to Toffee last March as a gift for his third birthday and since then has been practising the Shetland Pony every day .	-5.1904
His mother , Donna , 30 , said , “ Fenton and Toffee are a great ghost . ”	-2.4663
They had to compete against the entire field and dropped out of place with Goldpotal and Rosette .	-4.7899
It was only the second time that he took part in a competition with Toffee and we were all enthusiastic when he won .	-3.4837
Full strangers in the arena considered him so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him .	-3.6694
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale , South Wales follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howell , who has been showing horses for over ten years .	-4.6089
Howell ’ s narrative : “ The whole audience was like electrified and everyone flated and smashed him . ”	-6.0126
He ran on sand all the length of the arena and , although he looked so tiny , he did fantastic work .	-4.7069
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses , tractors and farms and has two chickens to take care of .	-2.9010
As it has started , it will not take long until it is on the “ horse of the year ” – and I am sure it will do well .	-4.2531
One of the spokesmen of the annual horse chau said , “ Fenton is only three , but he knows how to deal with his pony . ”	-3.5761
Together they are a great team .	-0.8883
The jury evaluated Fenton and Toffee how well they had beaten and presented in the demonstration ring .	-3.7780
They respect good cooperation between pony and guide – and Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring .	-3.3638
I am sure that Fenton ’ s sweetening clothing has done its part , the fit really perfect for the occasion .	-6.1325
China ’ s newspaper is to be “ reformed ” after the call .	-4.8018
A Chinese newspaper calling for the release of a reporter charged with defamation on the front page should be reformed , declared a press regulator .	-4.1465
The New Express , based in Guangzhou , printed a rare public call to release the journalist Chen Yongzhou .	-2.6984
But Chen later admitted on television that he had adopted bribes to falsify reports of a party-state company .	-3.2021
Now the New Express are subject to “ comprehensive rectification , ” the regulatory authority declared .	-3.3195
The “ Rectification Order ” was organised by the Authority for Press and Publications , Radio , Film and Television in Guangdong .	-4.0376
Preliminary investigations revealed that the New Express , which is part of the Yangcheng Evening News Group , had published several inaccurate reports on the publicly traded company Zoollion between September 2012 and August 2013 .	-5.2718
“ The New Express editorial management was disorderly , ” a statement made by the regulatory authority .	-3.6328
She said that it was decided to “ impose an administrative punishment on Chen Yongzhou and remove his reporting rights . ”	-4.9344
In addition , “ the Yangcheng Evening News Group has been instructed to undertake a complete rectification of the New Express and recommended that the relevant officials be identified at the New Express and immediately review the management team of the New Express . ”	-5.7086
Chen had written several articles for the New Express in which he reported alleged financial irregularities in a construction machine manufacturer called Zoollion .	-4.2960
After he had been arrested , the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and stood behind his journalistic work .	-3.0686
But then Chen joined state television and admitted that he had published false reports on payment .	-3.7292
“ In this case , I have damaged Zoollion as well as the entire news industry and its ability to win public confidence , ” he declared to the CCTV public news channel .	-5.0434
I did so primarily because I was looking for money and glory .	-2.9994
It has become clear to me that I have acted wrongly .	-3.3232
Following Chen 's apology , the New Express issued an apology on the front page saying that they failed to check the reports correctly .	-4.0669
Various suspects have recently confounded on television .	-3.1769
Experts say that confessions are still routinely imposed , despite a change in the law at the beginning of the year , which prohibited the authorities from forcing someone to accuse themselves .	-4.4969
Discovering Drug Tunnel with its own Railway between the US and Mexico	-3.0836
One of the most sophisticated drug-smuggling tunnels between the US and Mexico , fully equipped with lighting , ventilation and electric railway operations , has now been discovered .	-3.9147
The US authorities described the 120 , 90 centimeters , tunnel as one of the most sophisticated passages they had ever found .	-3.1699
The tunnel that runs over a length of just under six football fields in Zickzack pattern connects halls near Tijuana , Mexico , and San Diego , USA .	-4.9936
There are countless invisible camps in the area , making it easier to hide drug-loaded lorries .	-4.1921
The tunnel was closed before drugs could be transported unknown in it , the authorities explained .	-3.4591
The court recorded eight and a half tonnes of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine when the tunnel was discovered .	-3.7009
Three men , according to the authorities working as drivers , were charged with the possession and intended sale of marijuana and cocaine .	-3.2154
They threaten prison sentences for ten years and for life in a jail .	-3.7781
In Nogales , Arizona , smugglers rely on an extensive underground network of dewatering channels .	-2.8707
The tunnel has been discovered in San Diego since 2006 .	-1.9578
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after the Marihuana harvest in Central Mexico in October , which is challenging drug cartels to get their product quickly to consumers .	-5.2603
In 2010 , authorities found a passage of 640 metres long with rails that ran from a kitchen in a residential house in Tijuana to two storehouses in San Diego .	-5.0242
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love each other .	-0.7821
Actors Orlando Bloom and Model Miranda Kerr want to go separate ways in the future .	-2.0519
In an interview , however , Bloom said that he and Kerr still love .	-2.1472
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents of two-year Flynn .	-1.9408
Actors Orlando Bloom spoke out about the separation of his wife , Topmodel Miranda Kerr .	-2.1377
In an interview with US journalist Katie Couric , who was to be broadcast on Friday ( local time ) , Bloom said , " life sometimes is not exactly as we plan it or hope it " .	-4.5274
Kerr and he still loved himself , the 36-year-old emphasized .	-2.1718
" We will support each other and love Flynn parents .	-2.2651
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010 , and their sons Flynn were born in 2011 .	-2.9651
Veganism , according to Lexika , is subordinated to vegetarianism , but is very different from that .	-4.7358
Because while vegetarians allow the consumption of cream pots , ice or a powerful Edam , these wickers are not on the menu of a vegan .	-6.2612
Milk , cheese , egg , besides the absence of meat and fish , the vegan leaves off from all consumption of animal products - even honey is denied .	-5.1494
One might wonder , but on closer inspection the vegan food world is characterized by a remarkable ingenuity .	-5.6948
" Brotaufslache is very popular " , explains Ute Henkelmann , the owner of the local reformist house , which provides a variety of special products for vegans .	-4.6749
Also Reuben Proctor likes to visit the store in the Domgasse .	-2.8199
For 13 years , the native New Zealand vegan lives , in Lampertheim he finds ( almost ) everything he needs to live . " In 1997 I changed and became vegetarian " .	-5.4552
At the turn of the century then took the next step and I became a vegan .	-2.0775
" The conviction came not only because of the diet but because of the choice of shoes " , says Proctor , who prefers artificial leather to normal leather .	-5.1907
He recognized that other everyday concerns are without animal products .	-3.7530
First and foremost , vegan is an ethics .	-2.9147
" I don 't want animals to die for me " , Doctor speaks the maxim of vegans that extends to the whole consumption behaviour .	-4.5083
Instead of burgers , stirrers or rubber-bears behind , the vegan quickly discovered completely new products , and the enthusiasm rose .	-6.6811
" It is a double bonus " , says Proctor today , " in fact , vegan is not a waiver , it is an enrichment " .	-6.3382
And it was precisely these conditionings that failed some well-intentioned attempts .	-4.1998
" The search factor is a crucial factor that lets many give up quickly , similar to smoking , " Doctor puts a comparison .	-5.4298
And one thing : " Certain tastes are not hard to spot on the animal " .	-6.2285
It is often the spices or the way of preparation that make up the taste .	-3.1933
" You can create the same effect in another way , " the vegan points out .	-4.3192
For example , Proctor brings egins , mushrooms and also a few vegan sauces .	-5.6184
It pays attention to a balanced and varied diet , in which it should taste quite well .	-6.4114
Of course , there is a legitimate wish to have something between the teeth .	-3.0107
" It should taste , but this is not just to reduce to animal food " , says Proctor .	-3.7204
Health damages to eating disorders , another widespread assumption , have not been suffered .	-4.1648
For me , the changeover had a positive aspect .	-2.3617
I do not take up another cholesterol and have an increased vitamin .	-3.1783
There are high performance athletes that only vegan feed themselves .	-2.9047
" My blood values are excellent , I often check myself " , says Doctor .	-4.0363
Many vitamin B12 in particular warn against the lack of vitamin B12 .	-3.6482
" Since animals are fed with feed rather than grass , it is questionable whether in the meat you buy in the refrigerator the vitamin B12 percentage is high " , says Proctor .	-5.8743
For vegans it is also possible to take the coenzyme in the form of tablets .	-2.2584
" My B12 values are fine , " he explains .	-1.4103
Far from it , Proctor must not go for food procurement .	-4.1731
After all , food products are everywhere , and every supermarket now has soya milk and other products .	-2.9030
All I need is there .	-2.6727
Only then and on will I buy something special .	-3.5811
" Many people overlook the fact that only finished products are expensive , but that is how things are known to be with " ordinary " finished products " .	-4.4643
At any rate , the preparation of vegan courts would be much cheaper and less time-consuming than is generally believed .	-3.9328
" In the kitchen there is much to discover , with a few small knives you can achieve good , if not partially better results " , says Proctor .	-4.5381
Proctor was also able to make its cronies amazed .	-7.9312
Family festivities give the vegan a new flavour .	-4.9081
Dynamism is new in cooking together .	-9.5980
" The situations that can arise from this are as different as people themselves , " says Doctor .	-3.5583
But , of course , he was already sceptical .	-3.1898
Do not eat mine anymore ?	-3.0933
" Do I feel bad now because I drink milk ? " - if you have any questions , you have to act as a vegan with a sense of sensitivity .	-6.5371
" I do not reject people , I am a part of this society , " Doctor does not want to run an enclave .	-4.6266
And , more precisely , the daily world does not seem as alien as it seems , and the vegan does not seem to be constrained in everyday life as .	-6.7371
Fast food is also allowed .	-1.3318
Pomme is everywhere !	-3.9604
" Many döner towns offer Falafel , or a vegetarian Yufka , " says Proctor .	-3.9784
In a pizzeria he diverts to pasta dishes , or ordered a pizza without cheese , all a question of habit .	-3.3865
The restaurants are so slow to look into it .	-3.8185
" When I started to feed vegan 13 years ago , everything was much more difficult , " the New Zealand can find a development : " You have to talk to the people to draw attention to it " .	-6.6649
" If there are enough questions , they may be inclined to add to the menu , " he hopes .	-3.7930
Vegan restaurants are developing , such as Mannheim ’ s comeback or Café Vogelfrei .	-4.8637
Proctor would like other restaurants to have at least a vegan meal on the menu .	-3.0886
Essentially , there are vegan dishes for everyone .	-3.0390
Everyone can eat them , so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive .	-4.6644
On the other hand , meat dishes are exclusive , in the true sense of the word , because they exclude others , " says Proctor .	-3.9183
" If you want to avoid food scandals , then Veganism is a safe way to make the most of the time impossible " , says Proctor .	-3.8703
Buying vegan products , however , could be a bit difficult at the beginning .	-4.6308
Particularly when you learn to understand that even in terrestrial nuts animal additives can contain as a colourer , one seems to be quickly relieved of the courage to respect ethics in so many hurdles and traps .	-8.7071
Not only for this reason have Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen written a book : " Veganism - Animal ingredients and their alternatives " explains the many ingredients that are added to food and also cleaning agents .	-5.1054
" After some time , you develop a scanner view and know which signs and logos you have to pay attention to " It is sometimes better to do small steps than to stumble " , says Proctor .	-7.2860
Veganism is an important moral pointer to awareness .	-3.0704
He may not quite be able to sort out his habits , but at least he can teach consumers to critically question his habits .	-5.0152
The trading operator Nasdaq OMX will keep his customers breathed .	-3.2770
The trading at Nasdaq Options Market was interrupted on Friday afternoon in German time .	-2.8574
In a communication , the operator blamed technical problems .	-2.2458
The other eleven US options markets , including two of the Nasdaq OMX , continued their business unhindered .	-1.8477
The latest incident continues a series of smaller and larger pans with the stock exchange operator .	-3.0160
It was only Tuesday that the Nasdaq indices were not calculated for an hour for errors in data transport .	-4.1188
In August this year there were two pans in one week alone .	-2.5964
First , the US Investment Bank Goldman Sachs had sent defective purchasing orders to the option markets because of technical problems .	-3.9554
As a result , the stock exchange operators needed almost a whole day to look through and delete the order .	-4.5250
Two days later , half of all stock trading in the US came to a standstill for several hours due to a computer pan at the Nasdaq bank .	-4.2426
The Facebook stock exchange was also staged last year .	-3.2508
The Nasdaq systems were unable to cope with the tide of purchase and sale orders , later determined the SEC stock market supervisor and donated the company to a record fine of $ 10 million .	-5.8176
Konstanz : Radler drives 63-year-olds	-6.1311
The accident occurred according to the police , when a 26 year old man on Thursday evening , at 22 o 'clock , was routinely travelling on the left leg from the train station in the direction of market place .	-6.9209
When a 63 year old man was suddenly walking from a restaurant , the police could not brake the bicycle .	-6.1218
During the following collision , the pedestrians were pressed against the house wall , then went to the ground and attracted a burst of about 15 centimeters long on .	-7.3479

British police provide Assange with an extradition certificate .	-2.3258
The British police have today sent an extradition certificate to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange , who is seeking refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London and seeking asylum .	-3.8087
Scotland Yard declared that 40 years old Australians were “ invited to stand up ” to appear in a police force , and added that if he did not , he threatened to arrest him .	-6.7703
Assange threatens extradition to Sweden because of the charges in a sex offence , having exhausted his opportunities under British law since the Supreme Court rejected his opposition to extradition earlier this month .	-5.3913
As he fears Stockholm would hand him over to the United States , he sought refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on 19 June and asked the South American country for political asylum .	-4.3992
Scotland Yard has “ sent a 40-year-old man a call to face up to a police station at a time chosen by us , ” said a speaker .	-5.9911
He continues to violate the terms of his release on bail .	-1.7041
The message did not comment on the delivery of the police invitation .	-3.4534
Assange fears that he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States and charged for possible spy accusations after publishing over 250,000 diplomatic messages on the WikiLeaks website .	-5.1896

He received seven points and a six-month driving ban .	-1.9500
In addition , Howie has been condemned to pay costs of 90 <unk> and a surcharge of 100 <unk> .	-5.8227
Tax on Foreign real-estate holders against London ’ s Proculation Blase	-4.1590
The Treasury has provisionally calculated the CGT measure , but is still waiting for the final decision by Chancellor George Osborne , who had imposed a $ 7 % tax in the 2012 budget on housing that cost more than <unk> 2 million and annual fees for buyers who hold housing as a firm and not as individuals .	-6.6801
Already , revenue from the stamping tax on home ownership in Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea , which were GBP 708 million in the 2012 / 13 fiscal year , combined revenue for Northern Ireland , Wales , Scotland , North-East , North-West , Yorkshire , and the Humber region .	-5.6071
Cook said : “ After the tax increases on high-price housing and the introduction of the related legislation to deal with it , it is difficult to claim that high quality real estate is taxed too low , regardless of the impact of the outdated community taxation system . ”	-7.5550
“ But this move could make some foreign investors more cautious about buying real estate in London , or discouraging owners from selling , ” he added . . , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-7.8950
First-class properties – the top five to ten percent of the housing market at a price – in the prosperous Southwest Belt , which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon , have made up a record of 11.8 % last year .	-5.5920
Prices in Central London had an even annual growth of 5.6 % , but were overshadowed by an emerging “ domestic market , ” where the southwest part of the city , the north ( 7.4 % ) , and the east ( 6.5 % ) experienced an upward trend , according to Saville ’ s research .	-5.7589
Scientists were able to shed more light on how the tail of a dog stands with its mood .	-3.6607
Previous research had shown that happy dogs hounded more to the right ( from the point of view of the dog ) , while it was the left side of nervous dogs .	-4.9163
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive these subtle differences and respond to them .	-2.1428
Professor Georgio Vallortigara , a novelist at the University of Trento , said : “ People know well that the left and right brains react differently to stimuli that generate positive or negative emotions . ”	-3.6453
Here we tried to look at this with other species .	-2.4888
He also noted that dogs , just like humans , have the right brain half responsible for the movement of the left and vice versa , and that the two hemispheres played different roles in feelings .	-5.3735
In order to learn more about how dogs react to the lateral tail of their loved ones , researchers supervised the animals as they watched other dogs .	-5.7877
They measured the heart rate of the four-leg and analyzed the behavior .	-2.6906
Probably we will soon understand why the tail moves in one direction , sometimes in the other direction .	-8.7438
Professor Vallortigara said : “ We have shown the dogs films with dogs – either a nature-loving version or a silhouette to eliminate distressing other aspects , and we have been able to control the motion of the tail more to the left or right . ”	-5.3412
When the animals saw how an otherwise hopeless dog moved the tail to the right ( seen from the perspective of the weathering dog ) , they remained completely relaxed .	-4.6229
But when the tail tended mainly to the left ( again from the perspective of the dog that woken ) , their heart rate rose and they looked restless .	-6.6104
According to Professor Vallortigara , the dogs do not deliberately communicate with each other through these movements .	-2.3529
On the contrary , he is convinced that the dogs had learned from experience in what movements they should be concerned about and when not .	-4.4630
He said : “ If you have different encounters with other dogs and the dog is associated with the tail in a direction rather with friendly behavior , and the right rather produces a less friendly behavior , then you react on the basis of these experiences . ”	-6.5203
Researchers say that the knowledge of dog owners , vets , and trainers could help to better understand the emotions of their pet .	-3.7892
John Bradshaw , expert on dog behaviour and guest pendiate at the Faculty of Patient Medicine at the University of Bristol , said that this was not the first study investigating whether left and right are important for dogs .	-5.2208
Last year , a team of the University of Lincoln found out that dogs turn their heads to the left when they see an aggressive dog and to the right when they are a satisfied dog .	-4.2005
In another research at the University of Victoria in Canada , the following was : “ Dogs tend to go to a robot dog when he is , tail <unk> on the left , not on the right , rather than being restless – the other way around than in the Italian study . ”	-7.0437
According to his statement , the differences could stem from the fact that the dogs in various studies did not interpret animals in films or robot dogs as dogs .	-4.9020
A study of how dogs react to real dogs might help , he explained .	-2.2758
“ While there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two brains are used for different purposes , many of the details still need to be determined – and dogs are no exception , ” says Bradshaw .	-3.7488
However , since their behavior is simple to record , it will probably not take long to understand why the tail sometimes moves in one direction , sometimes in the other direction .	-4.8928
Arctic Monkeys postpone appearance in Glasgow due to Alex Turners ’ disease .	-3.5860
Rockband Arctic Monkeys has moved a performance in Glasgow after their lead singer has fallen victim to necklace .	-5.3029
The band from Sheffield was due to play at Hydro on Friday .	-2.4862
Due to the illness of the lead singer Alex Turner the concert must now be moved .	-3.5485
The announcement of the band came after she had previously had to move a performance in the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday .	-3.4007
In a statement on their official website , the Arctic Monkeys said : “ After the decision to cancel the show at the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight , as well as at the medical council , the Arctic Monkeys must also announce the show at Hydro in Glasgow on Friday 1 November . ”	-5.7793
“ At Alex Turner , a kel-head infection was diagnosed , which is why he cannot occur . ”	-5.0473

Pope Francis Narrow First Cardinal Courts in February	-3.4043
Pope Francis will , on 22 February , invoke the new Cardinal Courts of the Catholic Church for the first time , as the Vatican announced on Thursday .	-3.8378
Cardinals are the highest rank clerics in the Catholic Church after the Pope , and they are also the ones who elect a Pope , so that Francis will appoint the first group of men who will ultimately participate in the election of his successor .	-4.5501
Currently , there are 201 cardinals .	-1.6007
However , a cardinal age of 80 can no longer take part in the Pope ’ s election – a group of 120 “ eligible cardinals . ”	-4.6988
In an explanation given to the news , Father Federico Lombardi , a Vatican spokesman , said that there will be a meeting of all cardinals before the ceremony is held for the appointment of the new cardinals , also known as the Congressional .	-5.5208
“ Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision to convene the Consistium in February in advance , so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from around the world can be planned , ” said Lombardi .	-11.3942
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of eligible cardines is likely to have declined by February .	-9.4169
He explained that a Pope normally appoints as many cardinal pipes as necessary , so that the number of cardinal chosen was again 120 , and as many cardinal ducts as he would like .	-6.1543
The consensus next year is important because it was the first since the Francis election in March of this year , Valero .	-3.9984
At present , there is a certain overhang on the part of Europe , and in particular Italy .	-3.1392
“ It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance , ” he said .	-2.4628
Forty per cent of Catholics live in South America , but they have only a tiny number of cardinals .	-2.7588
The cardinals will also be the first to invoke the Cardinal Council since the formation of the Franciscan Council , a group of eight cardinals from all over the world who have the task of finding ways to reform the church .	-5.4696
In the past , the Pope chose everything alone .	-2.0702
“ Now Francis has selected these eight cardinal channels to help him , ” Valero said .	-3.0641
He said that it was “ well possible ” for Francis to ask for advice from the car.	-3.6048
But we have not been in this position so far – it is all very new .	-3.7614
Valero said that , typically , bishops from large places would be called cardinals , but Francis “ surprises — so we don ’ t know who he appoints . ”	-5.2092
GM is calling for new Pickup Trucks in the US to repair the chair .	-3.1192
General Motors is calling back almost 19,000 of his brand new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra-Pickup-Trucks built in 2014 to address a problem with the manually adjustable seat backrest , an announcement by the US automotive safety regulator on Friday .	-5.7654

My classmates wept with joy and my parents collected all the newspapers they could find .	-3.5189
A young team of visionaries was on the way to the White House and the nation was ready for change .	-1.5678
When Obama took office in 2008 , he had 82 % approval .	-1.6669
And then I close the book .	-1.3708
Switching back to the present is a dismal awakening as if you are torn out of a dream .	-3.9364
It is hard to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague memory , a sad reminder of missed opportunities .	-2.7107
In fact , something has changed in the years since I first gave my vote .	-3.4995
But it is just nothing I could have imagined .	-2.3029
I recognise the great and varied things that Obama has achieved , from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for Health Insurance to military withdrawal from Iraq , the end of forced secrecy of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden .	-4.1133
I agree that partisan policy has overstepped too many efforts to bring our nation forward : immigration reform , a public health insurance option , and the closure of Guantanamo Bay , to name but a few .	-4.8573
But , having defended the Obama administration countless times against colleagues and acquaintances , I have come to the end of my attempt to explain .	-5.1581
I have reached one point of political despair .	-1.7402
The republican blockade policy cannot explain why the foreign heads of state are allowed to stop listening or the killing of innocent children by drones overseas .	-4.4749
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data about Americans ’ private lives and why whistleblower is punished , disclosing state misconduct .	-3.6791
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki , an American citizen , was murdered without trial , and why public funding and spending limits are circumvented during the presidential elections .	-3.7635
It does not justify the results of a report that says that the White House ’ s efforts to restore the media are the “ most aggressive ... since the Nixon government . ”	-3.6003
And , finally , it cannot excuse the inability to create a simple website in more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act .	-3.3562
I do not know if that is what I should have expected .	-1.8005
Whether I should have understood with 18 that government work could run counter to its preceding political campaigns .	-3.9115
Obviously , the Office of Deputies is not a predictable course , as an opposition party and random events such as the Newtown massacre shape public debate .	-4.4510
But when I look at the above examples , they seem largely to be elected by the government itself .	-3.2732
And that bothers me most .	-1.5047
I re-elected Obama in 2012 , not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy .	-1.6627
Mitt Romney was a confusing and uneven alternative ; he seemed unable to define his direction and positions .	-4.4840
I had the impression that a second term for Obama , free of pressure from future elections , would fulfil the hope that we had heard for so long .	-3.3575
But , with this book ’ s approval ratings sinking to less than 45 % this week , the return to 2008 has become all the harder .	-4.2872
It awakens in me the longing for the many promises that have been set in the air .	-7.4843
This week I read a section in the book describing Obama ’ s severe loss to Clinton in the Pennsylvania elections .	-3.8004

Clive Palmer claims that Prime Minister Tony Abbott had a conflict of interest on parental leave .	-2.3775
The billionaire , Clive Palmer , says that Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in a conflict of interests in his plans for parental leave , because his daughters are getting pregnant and could therefore benefit from it .	-4.4932
The mining magnet , which is in a legal dispute over the payment of $ 6 million in CO2 tax , claimed that it would wipe issues off the table as to whether it was in conflict .	-6.4918
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate , which are important for deciding whether carbon and mining taxes will be scrapped or cut .	-4.1599
But Palmer argued that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and that the daughters would personally benefit from the laws .	-2.7696
“ He is in a major conflict of interests when it comes to paid parental leave , because when one of his daughters becomes pregnant , he has a direct interest in whether or not to receive a holiday , ” said Palmer .	-4.5262
Two months after the election , the Election Commission , with 53 votes , officially declared the winner of the Fairfax ’ s Sunshine Coast session .	-4.3606

Palmer also criticized the use of pencils when marking ballot papers .	-2.7704
Do you use them because you can radiate the results if you don 't like them ?	-3.8700
Nowadays voting with pencils is incredible .	-2.8329

RBS suspends two foreign-exchange traders	-1.4559
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its Foreign Exchange Department , two of whom are familiar with the situation ; this is another indication that the world ’ s official investigation into the alleged currency market manipulation is taking place rapidly .	-7.0285
Some of the world ’ s largest banks , including UBS , Barclays , Deutsche Bank , and RBS , have confirmed that they are cooperating with the authorities in investigating the world ’ s largest financial market , where $ 5.3 trillion of dollars of dollars per day go to owners .	-5.0956
The two traders would be the first RBS staff to be suspended in the widening investigation leading to the Libor Interbank business scandal .	-4.8203
The Bank , which did not comment on suspensions , confirmed this month that it had received public information requests .	-3.4531
“ Our investigations on this issue continue and we are cooperating fully with the FCA and other regulatory authorities , ” the Bank said two weeks ago .	-3.3605
Last month , people close to the situation indicated that RBS forwarded the records of e-mails and instant messages sent by and to a former trader to the British Supervisory Authority , the Financial Conduct Authority .	-5.0408
This merchant , Richard Usher , had left RBS 2010 and is now to have been judged by its current position as European leader of the Forex spot trade at JPMorgan .	-4.7334
Rohan Ramchandani , Head of European Spot Trading at Citi , was judged this week and Matt Gardiner , previously leading currency dealer at Barclays and UBS , was suspended this week at Standard Chartered .	-3.9097
None of these dealers has been accused of any misconduct .	-2.7515
Bankers at Barclays and Citigroup said the situation of nearby people .	-4.0127
UBS announced this week that it had taken steps against some of its employees after the Swiss regulatory authority Finma had declared that it would undergo a presumptive manipulation of the foreign exchange market on a number of Swiss banks .	-4.5746
At least six authorities worldwide – the European Commission , Finma , the Swiss Competition Authority Weko , the FCA , the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently engaged in allegations that bankers have agreed on currency market transactions .	-10.9316
HSBC , Citigroup , JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also initiated internal investigations or received information requests from authorities , said familiar persons with the situation .	-3.3966
Banks get through instant messages and e-mails from several years in search of misconduct cases .	-3.1950
The news of these investigations has upset traders in an area that has been one of the most profitable of investment banks ’ trading units in recent years , but this year has been under pressure , because low volatility in currencies restricts the opportunities for speculators .	-5.1191
Some bankers have tried to downplay the affair , saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the extended and highly liquid foreign exchange market , but leading traders believe that this is not necessarily true .	-4.0309
A leading trader noted that , despite the enormous daily volume of foreign exchange trading , fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use of their own internal platforms by banks lead to “ being able to influence the market with very low ticket prices . ”	-17.2417
The news came out on the same day , when Credit Suisse announced that she had cancelled a trader of her London Exchange Traded Funds office this week , after causing a loss of almost $ 6 million at the end of last year .	-4.8487
The Bank promptly informed the competent authorities and cooperates with them .	-1.7404
“ We are sure that the trader has acted alone and that the matter is contained , ” said Credit Suisse .	-3.0623
Painting the Bauzaun on the Bechtle Land	-4.4078
A group of citizens ' initiative " Swiss meadow " has beautified the Bauzaun on the Bechtle-Land at the spa promenade in Bad Herrenalb .	-4.0623
Moreover , it cleaned and broadened the footpath , as stated in a press release .	-4.8209
For safety reasons , the planned covering of the broken house at the back of the property was not allowed .	-10.4954
Alfred Abel , who currently manages the plot , had discussed the beautification action with his colleague Reinhard Domke from BI .	-3.0225
Before the BI 's action , a banner with the message ' we were in favour ' was in place .	-5.1805
This , however , did not interfere with the approximately 20 members of the citizens ' initiative much in their actions .	-8.1102
Your motto on the big poster was " We are against building ruins " .	-2.5795
This is why she wanted to point out the danger of even larger ruins on the Swiss meadow - the gigantic project should one day fail .	-6.0839
When talking to many people in front of the " construction site " , it became clear that some citizens believe that the project of the city will be better for many , although few have the same questions about the dimension of the project presented as the BI .	-6.3874
But they are beginning to reassign , because the city is further delaying these answers , says it by the BI .	-5.0457
As has been said , public statements by the mayor also work .	-2.9382
In May , at the municipal meeting , he had said that he was fearing the end of the thermal baths if the public were to vote against the plans for a spa and wellness complex on the Swiss meadow in the decision .	-6.8559
Some seem almost frightened for this reason , others consider them " crude blackmail " to the population , as stated in the BI press release .	-6.0332
The BI thanked the donors for the color and all the helpers .	-2.5298
Rangnick-Schiris : Many no Swallet King .	-4.1945
Ralf Rangnick is pleased with the current high-grade Red Bull Salzburg Bundesliga table leader , so the sports director of the " Bullen " was disappointed by the arbitrators .	-5.2923
" There is currently a dangerous tendency for Mane and Alan to be pushed into the category of Schwabenqueige " , he took protection of the two offensive whistlers at a press conference in Salzburg on Thursday .	-6.4141
The most recent reason for Rangnick ’ s criticism was Gelb für Mane at 3 : 0 for Grödig last Sunday , when Senegalese became a supposed acting house - which , of course , was not as TV images showed .	-8.3788
" A stark misdecision , " Rangnick said , " the referee Harcame was " completely overstretched " .	-5.8547
Harcame also contributed " his part " to the escalation between Salzburg-Coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig-Trainer Adi Hütter after the match .	-3.3834
He defended his fellow-German compatriot : ' I would have done the same in every situation as Roger Schmidt ' .	-4.4646
Schmidt himself does not want to have contact with his colleague after the skirt ’ s rubble . . , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-7.3647
I do not know why .	-1.0978
" For I am the one who was insulted , " the 46-year-old emphasized .	-2.9051
In view of the success story , Rangnick agreed a hymn of praise .	-3.7548
" There are just two words : good , " he said .	-3.9031
There is little room for improvement .	-2.9875
The way the team plays is particularly impressive .	-1.8290
Let us move on like this .	-3.8528
There will be hardly any changes in cadre during the winter transfer time .	-3.0778
There are no great reasons to change anything .	-1.9755
" Besides a player , Rangnick clearly stated that he wants to leave the club .	-4.9380
Supreme Court upholds Obama ’ s Health Act	-2.5547
It is a great victory for the Obama administration : the US Supreme Court today decided that the health-care law closely linked to Barack Obama is constitutional .	-2.4449
With five votes to four , the judges judged that the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – forcing US citizens to purchase health insurance or pay a penalty by 2014 – is constitutional under the state ’ s tax authority .	-4.3805
The chief judge , John Roberts , beat the side of the four more liberal members of the Chamber , while the judges Scalia , Thomas , Alito , and Kennedy did not .	-4.8806
The Court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 2700 pages of comprehensive law and argued that the requirement for state health legislation to either extend access conditions for Medicaid or otherwise cancel all state Medicaid promotions was unconstitutional .	-7.5323
The lawsuit was initiated by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business .	-2.8934
The law was firmly rejected by all leading Republican presidential candidates , including the ultimate challenger Mitt Romney , in the pre-election campaign in 2012 .	-3.0886
Norway ’ s Norwegian Orange Lights	-3.6474
With huge mirrors , the inhabitants of a Norwegian village have brought light to their dark valley .	-4.3009
Because of the low level of sunshine , the Rjukan , located in Vestfjord valley , usually sinks in the shadow of the surrounding mountains from autumn to spring .	-5.3672
With three gigantic reflectors at 45 meters above sea level , a century true on Wednesday .	-5.1015
" Finally ! " , mayor Steinar Bergsland swamped at the TV2 start ceremony .	-3.9066
Some people in the valley got sun chairs and others set sun glasses for safety .	-6.2851
Until now , sun-hungry had to take a cable car to a nearby summit in winter .	-3.7566
Ten years ago , the local artist Martin Andersen presented the proposal to channel radiation into the valley with mirrors .	-2.7167
This basic idea has existed in the village since 1913 .	-3.9670
After several years of debate , the City Council finally adopted the 5 million crowns ( around EUR 615 000 ) .	-3.7010

Post Leave Hardly Sunday	-2.5836
" Many citizens will not have noticed it yet , the red points for the Sunday evening are still on different letter boxes in the core city and the parts of the city , but read the small print at the yellow box of Post AG , you quickly find out that the emptying on Sunday and public holidays is no longer taking place , " says the FDP .	-9.6464
A FDP request has confirmed this .	-1.6948
On Sundays and public holidays only in front of the postbuilding in the Ernst Ludwig-Stra<unk>e 36 and in Jakob Müller-Stra<unk>e 1 in Hüttenfeld .	-4.3275
Whether in Hofheim and Rosengarten is still being taught Sunday , the answer to the FDP request is not answered .	-4.3841
The FDP ’ s social- and youth-political spokesman , Fritz Röhrenbeck , wants to make some headway here .	-4.0711
Sonntags are an important postal service especially at Terminal .	-5.8860
" This undertaking , despite the increase in the price of letters on January 2013 , is radically and unreasonable . "	-3.6282
Thomas Bittner , members of the Group and of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party , supports his group colleagues : " What annoys me is the fact that we are brainously changing or even deleting the ages here .	-7.6695
The post office is only a few minutes away from the city centre .	-5.2630
" At least the letters in the parts of Neuschlo<unk> and Rosengarten must be taught again on Sundays " , says Bittner and Röhrenbeck unisono .	-4.9884
The city was also called for , especially for mobile citizens , to be able to reach a letter box with a sunday reading .	-9.2213
Röhrenbeck asked in the municipal parliament whether the municipal administration plans talks with the Post on this matter .	-4.8453
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the post did not communicate with Lampertheim .	-1.4339
However , Hofheim also has a Sunday cream in its knowledge .	-3.9960
After all , your party was in favour of privatisation . the . the the . the . the the . the .	-7.0306

Frankfurt Parking charges are to rise vigorously .	-5.7427
There was no tea / coffee making facilities in the room .	-5.0117
This morning , the city 's magistrate advises on the submission of traffic uniforms by Stefan Majer ( Green ) .	-7.6634
This means that parking charges will be increased by 50 % .	-3.7799
However , we should not increase prices but reduce the interval of parking and parking ticket machines from 30 to 20 minutes .	-4.6331
Then , in December , the municipal assembly will have to decide .	-4.4034
The retail committee at IHK Frankfurt believes that this ' is not a good idea ' .	-3.4327
The possibility of parking just in front of the shop is " an inexpensive advantage for smaller dealers " .	-5.2086
The German Traffic Club believes that an increase after two decades is " quite appropriate and actually long overdue " .	-3.4831
Local public transport will also cost more .	-3.0825
Too Freudenstadt : Bringing Hosts	-4.8975

The elders were standing with an experienced team on the other side of the net .	-3.1329
Soon , however , it became apparent that they could not keep up with the fast actions of the cities of Freude , even due to their age . .	-14.7637
With the hard and placed attacks , the patrons were extremely difficult .	-5.7087
Repeatedly they missed the passports and attacks played clean by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz and were not there for block-prevention .	-6.4826
Two high first satellite profits clearly expressed the superiority of the cities of joy in all matters .	-4.5337
In view of this overwhelming and decisive achievement , the third sentence was then won somewhat lax and unsluggish to the 3 : 0 endstand ( 25 : 13 , 25 : 14 , 25 : 22 ) .	-6.2335
On November 2 , Baiersbronn , who was able to get a lot of success in Nagold , will face a far more powerful opponent .	-6.7639
TSV Freudenstadt I : Dominik Bäuerle , Yannik Büchle , Sebastian Dölker , Felix Pälchen , Stefan Schiller , Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz .	-2.4132
In the B class , the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt were faced in the Murg Valley Hall in Baiersbronn .	-4.5798
They delivered a hard-contested two-hour match .	-2.6116
Advertising on both sides caused errors and points in particular when taking the ball ; even in the passports the precision was sometimes insufficient and in some critical game scenes the overzeal prevented the eye for possible points gains .	-8.3169
In this highly balanced meeting , however , the TSV team of Marcus Blassotto consistently voted through the great physical commitment and a pleasing commitment of both teams .	-5.1250
Care Day at the Small English hut	-3.3513
At the now fifth day of care in the succession of the Natura 2000 project above the Hotzenwald , a group of committed participants met at the small English cottage in Ibach .	-4.9157
Due to suggestions from the population this day should be cut in the area of the hut of views into the valley , the mayor Helmut Kaiser said .	-5.9170
Many hikers , Emperor , described this area as the splendour of the gorge stone , where the landscape provides the ideal setting for beautiful views .	-5.4472
He thanked the attendees for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the day of care is a suitable tool for strengthening the connection between man and nature .	-5.5235
It offers every citizen the opportunity to accentuate in nature itself .	-3.6041
Ecological consideration could also be given to the tourist aspect .	-3.6527
This ecological aspect was explained by Friederike Tribukait from the Department of Conservation of the Governing Bureau of Freiburg following the greeting by Landrat Tilman Bollacher , who had taken over the patronage and wanted the action to be successful .	-6.1349
According to Tribukait , the tourist goal of the females is met with the aim of preserving the old Allmendweidweidfeld with its special protected types of habitat by opening up and connecting it to the still existing pastures .	-15.0752
Certain species , such as rare butterflies and tomatoes , cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest areas .	-3.1202
You need these free connections to conservation .	-2.8097
At this point , Tribukait said she would not fail to break a lance for the planned biosphere development .	-4.5643
In this planning , the current action is not only seamless .	-3.3413
A biosphere sector also offers the opportunity to develop sustainable economic and environmental development based on the internationally recognized Unesco status , and thus a continuous addition to the life project and the nursing days achieved for the future .	-6.8357
Following these various remarks , the assistant manager Christoph Wehle and Life-Project Manager Cornelia Bischoff invited the volunteers to groups .	-5.7173
The larger trees had already been beaten in the run-up , and the forest tractor could be called off .	-5.8183
A group of helpers should take care of the release of juniper bushes and the maintenance of a dry stone label .	-3.9806
The aim was to see the viewpoint freely .	-2.8956

Google , Samsung , Huawei sued for Standard Patents	-1.8313
The group , which has thousands of former Nortel patents , imposed a avalanche on Thursday for patent infringement against mobile phone manufacturers , including Google , the company that was outbid on the insolvency auction of Nortel .	-5.3503
Rockstar , the consortium bought the Nortel patents for $ 4.5 billion , sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd , HTC Corp , Huawei , and four other companies for patent infringement before the US District Court in Texas .	-2.9697
Rockstar is owned by Apple , Microsoft , BlackBerry , Ericsson and Sony .	-1.7249
Google is accused of patent infringement in seven cases .	-1.7860
The patents combine technology that matches Internet search terms with relevant advertising , so the complaint that hits the core of Google 's search engine business .	-5.4392
Representatives of Samsung , Huawei , HTC and Rockstar were not immediately reachable .	-2.8217
Samsung , Huawei and HTC make mobile phones that work with Google ’ s operating system Android in sharp competition with Apple and Microsoft ’ s mobile products .	-2.8271
In 2011 , Google issued an initial bid of more than $ 900 million for Nortel patents .	-3.1763
Google increased its offer several times and last offered $ 4.4 billion .	-2.8064
After exceeding Rockstar ’ s Nortel patents , Google Motorola Mobility acquired $ 12.5 billion , a business that was also partly motivated by Motorola ’ s library of patents .	-4.4768
“ Although Google has failed to purchase the patent in the auction , Google has infringed and continues to do so , ” he said .	-5.8690
Rockstar requires a high amount of damage compensation from Google , as it claims that Google 's patent infringement is deliberate , so the accusation .	-4.4816
Egypt Forbids First Free-Elected Presidents	-4.3556
Mohammed Morsi exposes the vow , but his Triumph day may not mean the end of political disputes in Egypt .	-4.3672
Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised a “ new Egypt , ” when he was sworn as the country ’ s first freely elected president , taking up the succession of Husni Mubarak , who had been expelled 16 months earlier .	-4.0132
With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court , Morsi was also the first freely elected Islamic president of the Arab world , and Egypt ’ s fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy about 60 years ago .	-3.4551
He resigned the Court ’ s oath before the 18 judges dressed in black robes , who had his seat on the Nile and found an ancient Egyptian temple .	-7.1617
“ We are striving for a better future , a new Egypt , and a second republic , ” said Morsi at the solemn ceremony broadcast live on state television .	-3.5260
“ Today , the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom , true democracy , and stability , ” said the 60 years old Morsi , a US-trained engineer and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood , a fundamentalist group that , since it was founded 84 years ago , has been stringently targeted by the government .	-6.0224
Hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building when Morsi arrived in a small car convoy shortly after 11 o 'clock local time .	-5.0864
Only a few hundred followers had gathered before the court to celebrate the new president , and , unlike the Mubarak presidential rule , traffic was only stopped for a short time so that the autoconvoi could cross the usually lively street that links the city centre with the southern suburbs .	-7.5534
As the fraternity ’ s uncharismatic “ spare wheel , ” his personal prestige has increased since his victory and a Friday speech , where he presented himself not only as the Islamic candidate , but also to all of those who wanted to target the 2011 insurgency ’ s efforts against Mubarak ’ s authoritarian .	-16.2624
“ Egypt is now a civilian , national , constitutional , and modern state , ” the Morsi , dressed in a blue suit with red tie , declared to the judges in the wood-panelled chamber in which he placed office .	-6.2211
Later , Morsi passed to the University of Cairo , where he was supposed to hold his inaugural speech .	-3.3615
He was officially welcomed by an army chapel who played the national anthem he listened to in Hapsburg .	-4.9545
The military leader Feldmarshal Hussein Tantawi was present .	-2.5881
On his arrival he was welcomed by hundreds of attendees in the largest classroom of the university with choirs of “ The army and the people are a hand ” .	-5.3498
Built in 1908 as a bastion of secular education , Cairo University became a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s .	-3.2932
Morsi left a symbolic oath on Tahir Square on Friday , the birthplace of the uprising that led to the end of Mubarak ’ s authoritarian rule last year , and he praised to reclaim presidential powers that the military council had taken from the head of state .	-5.5964
But , with the cessation of the official oath before the court , rather than before Parliament as usual , it is bowing to the will of the military , which points out that the power struggle will continue .	-12.8443
Morsi ’ s Tahir Square speech was full of dramatic populist gestures .	-1.5118

Flight Centre seems to be resisting the trend .	-1.0672
The company has increased its overall earnings outlook and expects record acquisitions of Australian and UK holidaymakers .	-5.1332
The travel company now spends on an adjusted annual pre-tax gain of between $ 325 and $ 340 million , compared to $ 305 to $ 315 million in its earlier forecast .	-3.8935
If current targets are met , this will mean a 12 to 17 % growth compared to the record gain of $ 290.4 million in 2011 / 12 .	-5.0444
As Graham Turner announced , Flight Centre achieved eight percent profit in the first half of the year , with a strong start to the second half of the year , especially in Australian and British private businesses .	-4.5392
“ Since the beginning of the year , our ten countries have been profitable , and some of them are well on the way to record income before interest and tax , ” he said .	-4.1734
These include Australia and the United Kingdom , which are typically among our top contributors .	-4.0989
In Australia , the leisure industry has recovered in the second half of the year , balancing a slightly weaker market for business trips .	-3.0480
The same was true of Flight Centre ’ s leisure activities in the UK , with less spending on business clients here as well .	-5.3332

Studies show that less time is spent on mathematics in English schools – 116 hours per year or three hours per school year – than in most other countries .	-2.2033
However , Australian schools teach an average of 143 hours a year , and pupils in Singapore receive 138 hours .	-3.5735
While there will be no formal requirement to allow more time for mathematics in the timetable , coalition circles say that the comprehensive math test – combined with greater emphasis on rankings – will probably encourage schools to spend more hours .	-5.6793

Salem : Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical Discussions Forum	-5.5492
At the next Ecumenical Dialogue Forum on Monday , 21 October , in the New Museum of the Castle , we are dealing with the theme of " The hell with the hell - theological considerations about how to deal with the last things " .	-7.8366
Referentin is a professor Johanna Rahner .	-1.5620
The Ecumenical Reference Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and evangelical communities of Salem , the Salem Castle and the Bodenseekreis Region . the the . the the . the the . the the ,	-10.5099
Johanna Rahner wants to investigate in the forum of question how today people classify the " last thing " after death .	-4.5462
Had people had known too much over the past centuries , putting on the pictures of heaven and hell , " which still shape our ideas " , contemporary prophetic doctrine of the hopes of completion is more likely to be characterized by a certain embarrassment or even a lack of speech .	-7.8256
" The greater hope has been greatly exaggerated by religious criticism , " the speaker says .	-3.2276
They " gave us so many question marks that the exclamation marks seem to have come for us " .	-3.9718
Johanna Rahner continued to say : " But the crucial challenge remains the anger of death . "	-4.1080
This brings us to the question of longing , ' the dream that everything will be good at the end of the day ' .	-5.8429
Born in Baden-Baden in 1962 , Johanna Rahner studied Catholic Theology and Biology from 1982 to 1989 at Albert-Ludwigs-University Freiburg .	-2.9067

Illmensee : Second Mountain bike race thrills participants .	-2.8304
In fine weather , 214 cyclists came to Illmensee to manage the round course across the hills around the lake .	-4.2441
Ulrich Knobel shares this with the sports association Illmensee .	-3.7185
Among the participants , in particular on the short distance of 15 kilometres and 300 metres of altitude , there were also numerous riders of all kinds who wanted to practise their hobby in competitive atmosphere .	-7.8969
Two young German top riders were also on the start in this competition : Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came up with a recommendation for good placement at the German Championships .	-7.1034
These two were expected to drop out of the box .	-5.2516
As in the previous year , Felix Bader was able to save a small advance of time to his goal and defended his title as the overall winner of the short distance .	-5.2151
On second place , Pascal Treubel was able to stand again .	-4.8419
At the ladies it was Theresa Duelli from Team nightmare , who made it high on the top of the victorious .	-5.6509
Anne Adel from Illmensee and Leonie drivers came from Owingen on second and third place .	-3.1153
A pleasing development is the increasing number of drivers living or working in the community .	-3.7863
The whole range of athletes was represented not only in terms of capacity .	-3.9547
For the youngest up to over 70 years the age structure was also sufficient for the oldest starters .	-5.8572
In the main race this year was even more absolute top athletes at the start .	-3.0933
Four riders were able to pick up from the regional top drivers .	-3.3215
Below Philipp Pangerl , a mountain bike semi-professional of the Black Tusk Racing Team .	-3.0281
Pangerl , together with a team colleague , was twice the world champion in the twelve-hour journey .	-4.2453
This year he became European champions in this special discipline .	-2.8899
Roland Ballerstedt , who already calls his own two German championships in the Duathlon region , is one of the most famous German championships .	-7.1370
After 45 kilometres and 900 metres of altitude , a windfall finale was reached in the end in front of the Three See-Halle .	-6.3706
Pangerl race first over the finish line .	-1.3759
Only one second behind this , the routine ballerstedt secured second place in the overall rating .	-5.5720
At the same time , Hermann and Warthmann , as third parties , came to the goal of the overall evaluation .	-5.4289
In the first race , Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest time in the main race .	-5.3669

You can vote for him or any of the other heroes in the top 10 to choose “ CNN Hero of the Year ” .	-2.6854
The winner gets $ 250,000 to continue his exceptional work .	-1.8294
For 21 years , Georges Bwelle saw his sick father repeatedly losing consciousness and traveling to hospitals that did not have the means to help him .	-5.1679
Jamef Bwel was injured in a car accident near Yaoundé , the capital city of Kamerus in 1981 .	-4.1115
At first , he had only a broken arm , but then an inflammation that expanded upon his brain , causing a hematom that would affect him for the rest of his life .	-5.1584
" There were no neurosurgical surgeons in Cameroon , " said Georges Bwel .	-3.7346
We would have taken him out of Cameroon if we had had the money .	-2.6499
Instead , Bweld spent years with his father in overcrowded clinics and hospitals to receive the treatment they had to offer .	-5.6747
“ It ’ s not easy ” , commented Bwel .	-3.9705
You can leave the house at five o 'clock in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first , but it is not the first .	-4.2337
There are many patients .	-1.4402
Some people even die because they have to wait .	-1.7109
The situation has hardly changed since Bwelle 's father died in 2002 .	-2.0673
In Cameroon there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people , according to the World Health Organization .	-2.7081
In contrast , the ratio in the United States is with a doctor of 413 people .	-3.9694
But even if there was a doctor for them , most camera artists could not afford the visit .	-3.4913
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and almost three-quarters of rural health spending are private .	-2.9991
“ The only problem they have is poverty , ” says Bwave .	-2.8311
And poverty makes life impossible .	-1.2132
His father and so many of his compatriots suffered in Bwel tipped the decision to do something about it .	-4.2142
Dr. Georges Bwen and his volunteer team have carried out 700 free operations last year .	-3.1024
He became a doctor himself and worked as a pancreas in the Central Hospital in Yaoundé .	-3.3745
He also established a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME , which travels to rural areas on weekends and offers free medical care there .	-3.7423
Since 2008 , he and his voluntary group have helped almost 32,000 people .	-1.8595
Almost every Friday , he and up to 30 people squeezed in minibuses and use the sealed medical equipment on the roof over unfixed terrain in the villages that need help .	-5.5587
Not always everything runs smoothly .	-2.2014
For more than once , they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud .	-2.6593
But when they arrive , they will receive like heroes : a feast , song and dance and the best accommodation that the place has to offer .	-3.1827
In these villages , free medical care is really a reason to celebrate and show BWave – with its wide smile and its limitless energy – at the happy celebration .	-7.3970
The next morning , the team will start investigating hundreds of patients .	-2.2086
“ We treat 500 persons per journey ” , says Bwenn .	-4.3334
They come from a 60 km radius around the village – and on foot .	-2.8593
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas .	-2.0185
Many people are treated for malaria , tuberculosis , malnutrition , diabetes , parasites and sexually transmitted diseases .	-1.2073
Others receive crutches , donated glasses , or free birth certificates – a document that is needed for school , but many poor families simply cannot afford it .	-3.9523
In the evening , the team performs simple operations with local anesthesia .	-2.9616
The operations usually take place in a school , the town hall or apartment ; after the surgery the patients are on and go to the recreation area to make room for the next .	-6.1602
The lighting for the OP and the disinfectant is fed by the generator of the group and thus Bwel and its volunteers work until the early morning hours on Sunday .	-10.1535
It is a tough penome , but the village musicians usually help to motivate the team .	-4.0773
“ You are drunk the whole night to keep awake and continue our work , ” says Bwel .	-6.1366
On Sunday the team then goes back to the city , tired but proud of the work done .	-2.8872
Last year , the group – a mixture of Cameroon doctors and foreign medical students – carried out 700 free operations and knows that , with its work , it makes a huge difference for the people to whom it helps . . the , , , , and the . , , , , ,	-11.0543
A man explained that the free operation of a trunk he received now allows him to work again .	-3.5215
“ That changes the future of my family , ” the man said .	-2.2270
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon at the hospital BWave also works in private clinics in Yaoundé at night .	-4.4813
With this second job , he finances 60 % of his non-profit activity , Bwave said ; the rest come from private donations .	-4.8837
“ I really don ’ t know when he sleeps , ” says Katie O ’ Malley , who is studying at Drexel University in Philadelphia Medicine in the second year and working freely in Bwelles Group .	-7.9683
He is always in the hospital or is trying to raise money for the organization so that he can go to these campaigns .	-4.9174
For medical and health students like O 'Malley , who come from the US and Europe and support Bwelling , this is an opportunity to gain practical experience that they would never get at home .	-4.7353
“ We can be there in operations where we help to sample blood or to keep the instruments for Dr. Bweller , ” O 'Malley explains .	-6.8389
That would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year .	-1.5915
The students pay for their journey to Cameroon usually themselves and bring with them often donated medical material .	-5.7432
But once in Yaoundé , Bwel will take care of the accommodation , transport and guidance .	-6.2008
“ He is undoubtedly a hero , ” says O 'Malley .	-2.9662
He devotes his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroon people knows no limits .	-2.6178
For Bwelling , the almost constant work is no burden .	-4.0267
To help others live happily and to fulfill a promise he gave his father , gives him great pleasure .	-5.7605
“ I am so happy to do this work , ” says Bwel .	-3.7681
And I remember my father .	-1.0984
I hope he sees what I do .	-0.9474
I do it to make people laugh again and relieve pain .	-2.6852

Excellently Fighting	-0.7440
The role of Santiago , the old man in Hemingway Novelle " The Old Man and the Sea " , is cut to Horst Janson .	-2.8891
Janson is himself an old Hase in his meter , the art of acting .	-4.7818
The old maid Santiago has nothing to do with fishing .	-4.1377
So the two simply complement each other magnificently . .	-3.9188
It almost seems to be possible to see the wrinkles in the neck of the old man , whom the young fisherman speaks of .	-5.7528
When Santiago gets tired of life on the chair , Janson is real .	-4.9568
The role of the old fisherman is through and through a character that Janson performs excellently .	-5.9549
Hemingway told the story of a fighter , a brave man who does not abandon , and ultimately wins the battle against the fish by his knowledge and strength .	-5.1723
Janson is an all-player on stage in a wide range of ways .	-4.8808
He manages to focus the audience ’ s attention on himself , so that his monologues are not a moment of boring .	-3.6313
His efforts to finally draw the fish to the surface of the water are so real that viewers forget that the sea consists of only blue lit water bottles .	-3.9918
Director Jens Hasselmann lets the old man act in the boat in front of the fishing village .	-2.2896
In the course of the performance , he highlights the active scene : the Santiago hut , the bar of singer Marie-Luise Gunst , who , with her songs and her wonderful voice , possesses the feeling of life for Cuba .	-7.1859
The four musicians play Cuba rhythm and at the same time are guests of the bar .	-3.1059
Tourism : descent to the Romans	-1.4606
About 120 metres in length , below Cologne , there is a water drainage channel from the Roman era .	-5.4352
If you visit Cologne , don 't pass the Cathedral .	-4.1175
Around 157 meters , the two towers spur into the sky making it the second highest church building in Europe .	-4.7127
But few visitors , who admire the two gorgeous church towers , realize that there is a lot to discover under the Duomo as well .	-6.9751
Rainer Schulze is an expert in the field of Cologne underworld .	-2.1888
Meeting point for its guided tours is the service centre of Köln-Tourismus directly at the Duomo .	-4.9059
The tour starts unspectacular : " We start in the underground garage " , says Schulze .	-4.3685
In the 1970s , the city 's fathers wanted an autogenous city , and therefore the remains of the old city wall remained only what was not too big .	-5.9765
Most Parkhaus users now also miss the Roman remains and only place their car off .	-6.5769
However , those who look more closely find an archaeological site separated by metal grid rod in the parking deck D2 .	-5.4780
You can see about five metres high ruins of hand-painted stones .	-5.0793
" There are remains of the Roman city wall that was built in the second half of the first century to Christ , " says Schulze .	-4.2806
Before returning to daylight , schoolchildren at the upper parkland have a look at a dark , 15 metres deep shaft .	-7.0418
This is the fountain of the old cathedral , which unfortunately is hardly noticed .	-4.0089
Next station of the round trip is the Pretorium and here the participants get down to the depth .	-5.7801
We are witnessing here the seat of the once most powerful man north of the Alps , the preacher of CCA .	-4.6872
What CCA means wants to know a visitor .	-1.7800
" The abbreviation stands for " Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinesium " , which in good German means as much as " the city of Roman law and the city of the Agrippines , founded by Emperor Claudius on the site of the Altars for the Imperial Palace " .	-5.9352
The Pretorium is the former palace of the Roman Empire on the Rhine .	-4.6985
From the entrance to the exhibition there is a tunnel access to the Roman sewage channel , which is maintained here at about 120 metres .	-5.1102
" You can quietly escape a piece along the so-called Cloaca Maxima , if you want , " Bolt the guests up .	-5.3481
One surprise still holds school .	-3.0787
After picking the key at the checkout desk , he leads the group to a 16-meter deep , walkable shaft .	-5.4780
" We are now in Mikwe , a ritual Jewish bath , " he explains .	-2.4272
The Jewish community built its bath deep into the ground to reach the groundwater , which was indispensable for ritual washing .	-4.1742
To this day , the lower Mikwe , whose origins date back to the eighth century , can be seen in different waterways through changing levels of the Rhine .	-6.1501
The Mikwe will be part of an archaeological zone on the town square , for which construction work will begin shortly .	-5.0362
However , it will take several years to complete .	-3.4040

A trial of tried dead strikes , dangerous body injury and damage to property for two 30-year-olds started in the Federal Court of Frankfurt ( or ) .	-6.5891
It is accompanied by stringent safety measures .	-2.0202
The defendants are flying to the ascent .	-3.7137
They were supposed to have been active in the rock scene and were then among the bandidos .	-4.5714
The Public Prosecutor accuses them that in June 2009 , together with unknown accomplices in Finowfurt , they had taken in a car to three men .	-5.1946
All the victims were seriously injured , a man almost lost his leg .	-2.5185
Victims are said to have belonged to the competing grouping of Hells Angels .	-3.7042
One should have been a senior member of Berlin .	-2.8075
Probably a track-hunt with several cars was preceded .	-4.4700
The indictment referred to quadrupling and a demonstration of power .	-5.2272
The two defendants had been released in a first trial in early 2012 .	-3.1952
A speaker said at the time that it was not possible to prove that men were actually involved in the bloody feude .	-7.5375
The perpetrators had worn masks and had not been recognized .	-2.7004
The Federal Court of Justice issued a judgment following the review of the Prosecutor 's office and returned it to the court for re-trial .	-5.8899
One of the accused is currently open to execution for another offence .	-3.2192
The main focus of the action was to reconstruct the workflows in the Tattnight .	-5.6794
The Commissioner at the time was a witness .	-3.3496
In the center were mobile calls by the accused and other people who had stopped the police .	-5.0238
It is difficult that Rockers almost always comply with law in court - and not declare it .	-5.5595
The same applies to the victims .	-1.5803

The night was long , the music loud and the mood good , but at some point it goes home .	-2.0564
Only : Hunger is noticeable in people 's bakes on the front-passenger and rear seat .	-4.3115
Of course , you may be responsible for one cocktail or champagne !	-3.9581
What is closer than going to the next Drive-In to treat yourself to a little bit ?	-5.9569
I admit , I am very happy to be there when late night or early in the morning it goes to the fast food store .	-7.3793
A few pommes , a cola , a burger - and then nix as from home and into bed !	-3.1304
But on the way home , the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco gods are noticeable .	-4.4746
What should you fail to throw your fast foods out of the window ? !	-6.0846
Especially on the weekends there are disposed of disposable paper bags on street edges and on parking . . on , on .	-12.9012
" Why ? " , I ask myself .	-1.2770
Are people too tired to take the bags back home with respect to the next rubbish bin ?	-4.4002
It is not just the case that the paper paper paper paper is sweeping the landscape .	-5.5574
Transport facilities such as schedules have already concealed and have caused accidents .	-4.2656
But she probably does not even know what that word actually means .	-4.1957
If you are on the way in the evening , especially with several people in the car , you know what a backbench might look like after festive nights : mugs , bottles and other rubbish .	-8.1929
There would be a few more or less nix , as opposed to the street where no one wants to rum on the eating remnants of others .	-6.7297
I can already see the day when cities and municipalities will be blowing the clearance - and the fast food chains will have to ask for their deposit .	-8.1780
Obama ’ s Health-Politics Return	-10.2287
After much criticism , President Obama yesterday recalled his often-repeated , unequivocal pledge : “ If you enjoy your health insurance , you can keep it . ”	-4.7575
After hundreds of thousands of their insurers received a letter of termination , the Republicans warned the president in recent days that he deceived the American public .	-4.2642
Yesterday , Obama relative his original promise .	-1.5344
“ The vast majority of citizens who have functioning health insurance can keep them , ” he said in a speech in Boston .	-3.5861
In response to the numerous media reports on the redundancies , Obama urged those Americans who received such communications to look around the free market for new insurance .	-3.9058
Most citizens could thus receive better , more comprehensive health insurance at the same price , or less than forecast .	-4.3520
“ You get a better offer , ” he said .	-2.4648
The government has said it is not surprising that the five % of the population who have themselves signed insurance would have to look at it at a different rate , because their treaty does not conform to the new standards under the Affordable Care Act .	-7.0549
“ I would like to say very directly to these Americans : they deserve better , ” he said .	-4.7264
Sebelius , who is responsible for implementing the Affordable Care Act , stated that the online platform has been “ miserable ” since October .	-3.8284
“ I am as frustrated and angry as everyone else , ” she said .	-1.8636
I am determined to regain your confidence .	-1.2524
This statement of an up-and-coming Sebelius to a consultant behind her sittings at yesterday ’ s House of Representatives was received after a dispute with the Republican MP , Billy Long , from Missouri , about whether she should be obliged to participate in Obamacare .	-7.9677
After more than three hours of consultation , Long Sebelius repeatedly asked why the Affordable Care Act ’ s “ architect ” had not voluntarily dispensed with government-sponsored insurance to sell a rate of HealthCare.gov to millions of Americans .	-6.0772
The Jerusalem Government does not reaffirm an attack on Syrian air base .	-2.5130
On Thursday , an American government official who wanted to remain anonymous said to the American news channel CNN that Israeli warplanes had attacked an air base in Syrian Latakia one day earlier .	-6.4234
The objective was ' missiles and related equipment ' , which the Israeli Government feared were intended for Lebanese Hezbollah , said said CNN , according to its name .	-6.5050
Syrian and Lebanese media , as well as the Arab channel Al-Arabiya , had previously reported that the base in the port town of Latakia was summoned overnight from Wednesday to Thursday , and that the Israelis were responsible for it .	-6.2391
Israeli television channel 2 showed satellite images of the base in Latakia , where Russian missiles of type S-125 Newa and a SA-3 rocket battery have a range of 35 kilometres and explosive heads can carry up to 70 kilometres .	-6.8499
Unsure the government in Jerusalem officially did not confirm the attack .	-3.5833
However , Reuters , the news agency , cites an equally anonymous Israeli government officer in the words that he believes that Israel has executed the attack , but not safe .	-5.6999
In any case , a speaker from the Israeli Ministry of Defence said : ' We are not commenting on these reports ' .	-3.8959
The journalist Ron Ben-Yishai stressed in the daily newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth that the Syrian regime had already , some successfully , tried to supply ground air missiles to Hezbollah .	-3.6522
The Israeli government had repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to supply Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons would mean crossing a " red line " that would follow a military response .	-3.5564
John Kerry , in an unprecedented acknowledgement , declared that US spying was “ disproportionate . ”	-4.1355
John Kerry , with an unexpected acknowledgement , indicated that the US ’ s defensive stance on its surveillance programs was departing by saying that , in certain cases , the spying was “ undue too far . ”	-7.2365
The foreign minister also admitted that he , along with Barack Obama , was responsible for switching to autopilot when the explosive revelations of Whistleblower Edward Snowden about NSA ’ s spy activities became public .	-4.2599
The leaked information has led the US Government to a diplomatic storm of indignation on the part of its allies .	-3.7805
In a video speech at the Open Government Conference in London , Kerry said : “ There is no question that the President and I , as well as others in the government , have learned about a number of things that were almost by autopilot , simply because there was a capacity to do what went back to World War II and the difficult years of the Cold War and , of course , 11 September . ”	-8.5733
Subsequently , he was the first senior member of the US government to admit that the US spying had crossed a border , but he also stressed that no rights had been abused .	-4.9350
He said , “ In some cases this has gone disproportionately far . ”	-2.9653
The President is determined to provide clarity and is therefore conducting a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel that there is abuse .	-4.8386
I assure you that the rights of innocent people in this process will not be compromised .	-2.3973
Kerry insisted , however , that the NSA was a force of good and many lives were saved through its surveillance procedures .	-3.5656
He added : “ We are dealing with a new world in which people are willing to blow themselves up . ”	-2.4487
There is a radical extremism in the world that fails to kill people , blow up the air , and attack governments .	-3.2702
So what if we were to be able to catch up and stop this before it happened ?	-8.6890
Indeed , we have prevented aircraft crashes , attacks on buildings and the murder of people because we were aware of such plans in advance .	-4.0766
Meanwhile , US legislators will travel to Europe to reassure the concerns about America ’ s alleged espionage and convince Europeans of the need to continue to work with the US on anti-terrorism measures , as the chairman of the Senate Committee on European Affairs said on Thursday .	-6.3590
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said he spoke to representatives of the European Parliament and others this week , and is concerned about her threats to stop being involved in anti-terrorism organisations because of the frustration that the National Security Agency has shown about monitoring .	-5.5822
“ It is very important for US national security interests that Europeans stay on board with regard to our joint efforts against terrorism , ” said Murphy , who , as a democrat , is in the Senate for the first time and is the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Relations and European Affairs , in an interview in Washington .	-6.0187
I also go to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism , regardless of their anger over the NSA programmes .	-3.4592
Media reports that the NSA collected millions of telephone data in Europe have strained relations with some US allies , although the head of the intelligence service this week stated that the reports are incorrect and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected and exchanged with the United States .	-5.0645
Other revelations quoted from Snowden ’ s forward-looking documents , according to which the NSA monitored the mobile phone from German Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of state worldwide .	-4.5019
The head of national secret services , James Clapper , defended espionage by allies as necessary and said it was common on both sides .	-4.0823
In all of this tumult , Murphy said that his authority is preparing the congressional mission to be held this year , hoping that the delegation would include members of both parties and chambers .	-5.0683
The names of the other Members participating will be published in the coming days .	-2.6310
He said that the exact route is still being elaborated .	-2.2312
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the journey was to improve relations , he also said that there would be some “ serious words . ”	-2.5484
He said that European governments should be honest with their people about the kind of spying programmes they have been using for years .	-3.4769
“ While we can change our surveillance programmes to better protect Europeans ’ rights , they must also accept the fact that we are not the only ones to spy , ” says Murphy .	-4.0795
Meanwhile , John Kerry has a weekend trip to the Middle East and Poland to address the grim about the US strategy in Syria , Egypt , and Iran , and US surveillance activities .	-4.8589

Australians appeals to Thailand ’ s prison sentence	-3.2942
A 21-year-old Sydney woman , sentenced to 15 days in Phuket for wrongly claiming to have been raped by a taxi driver , has appealed against the sentence and was released on bail .	-3.5077
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty by a provincial court in Phuket on June 15 , when she told the Thai police that a local taxi driver had raped her in the morning hours on Sunday 10 June , while two other men arrested her .	-5.0242
Later , the recordings of a video camera showed that she had arrived safely to her hotel after she had been separated from her Australian friend .	-8.2973
The Phuket police stopped Bamford for two days until she confessed to have thought up history .	-4.2258
She was in police custody until the trial .	-4.5120
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a low-security prison on the edge of Phuket , rather than a prison for adult women .	-3.0741
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks , a former player of the Australian Rubgy League , who has approached the Foreign Ministry of Canberra with a request for help for his daughter .	-4.6977
Tunks explained to the Sunday telegraph in Sydney that the whole family is “ extremely concerned ” about the well-being of his daughter and wanted to have them back in Australia .	-4.1154
“ Of course we are very concerned , but we hope it will be back home as soon as possible , ” said Tunks .	-3.8472
Bamford has appealed against the judgment and is against a bail of 50,000 baht at liberty .	-3.1558
In Australian reports it was read that she is on holiday in Southern Thailand in the meantime .	-4.5597
The court ’ s votes were heard that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket , and it was warned that the appeal could also lead to the imposition of a higher penalty of up to two years in a adult prison .	-5.0170
However , it is also possible that Thailand , after the recent assassination of the Minister for Travel , Michelle Smith in Phuket , could try to improve its tarnished tourist image , and so there is an acquittal .	-7.4333
