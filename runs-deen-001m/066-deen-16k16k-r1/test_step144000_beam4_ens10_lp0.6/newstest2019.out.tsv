Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour is a right to its territory and has repeatedly opposed his application for membership of the EU and NATO .	-3.6893
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov , an opponent of the referendum on the name change , said he would ignore the vote .	-2.3968

A fire in 1939 left the building seriously damaged , but when the community members of Father Johnson made plans for reconstruction , they entrusted the bell game .	-4.0431
Pärrer David Johnson , son of Father Johnson and successor in St. Martin 's , proudly called the bells of the poor .	-3.9315
The expert who played the bell game in July called it another thing : ' A cultural treasure ' and ' an irreplaceable historical instrument ' .	-3.0530
The expert , Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan , also noted that it was the first bell game in the world played by a black musician , Dionisio A. Lind , who switched 18 years ago into the major bell game at Riverside Church .	-4.1445

In addition , the perfume dealer Fragrance Shop is testing concessions in two sainsbury stores , the first of which was opened last week in Croydon , South London , while a second end of this year is opened in Selly Oak , Birmingham .	-4.5865
Online shopping and a shift to daily shopping of small quantities of food at local shops means that supermarkets need to do more to get people to visit .	-4.4586
Mike Coupe , the head of Sainsbury 's , said that sales offices will increasingly look like merchant houses , as the supermarket chain tries to fight discounters like Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food .	-4.8431
Sainsbury 's has placed Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and also introduced a number of habitats since it bought both chains two years ago , which allegedly strengthened food sales and made acquisitions more profitable .	-4.0200

While the tsunami shelters were built in Aceh , what is not common for other coastal lines .	-4.5784
The obvious absence of a tsunami warning sender in Palu , though a warning has already been in force , may have contributed to the loss of human life .	-3.9738

As good as they were sometimes under Gerrard , they fell far behind these standards .	-9.4400

The US Should Demand Artificial Intelligence	-2.4973
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence , the US should redouble its research investment , Kai-Fu Lee says , investor , and AI practitioners working for Google , Microsoft , and Apple .	-2.8808
These demands came about after US officials made announcements to AI , even though the US lacks a formal AI strategy .	-3.3627
China has now presented its plan last year : by 2030 , it wants to be number 1 in the field of AI innovation .	-3.8968
“ Doubling spending on AI research would be a good start , given that all other countries are lagging far behind the US , and a breakthrough in AI research is just around the corner , ” said Lee .	-10.0074
The doubling of funding could double the chances of the next achievement in the field of artificial intelligence in the United States , said Lee CNBC in an interview this week .	-10.3940
Lee , whose book “ AI Superpower : China , Silicon Valley and the New World Order ( AI superpowers : China , Silicon Valley , and the New World Order ) ” was published this month by Hougton Mifflin Harcourt , is CEO of Sinovation Ventures , a company that invested in one of the most famous Chinese KI firms , Face + + + .	-3.9912
In the 1980 ’ s , he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on a AI system that defeated the highest American Othello player , and later led Microsoft Research and President of Google ’ s Chinese subsidiary .	-6.1397
Lee has recognized the US government ’ s former technology competition , such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( US Defense Forces Agency ) , and asked when the next would take place to identify the next visionaries .	-4.7669
“ Researchers in the US often need to work very hard to get government subsidies , ” said Lee .	-2.3644
“ Not China is responsible for the outflow of high-level scientists , but companies , ” Lee noted .	-2.9555
Facebook , Google , and other technology companies have hired university crypths to work on AI in recent years .	-2.7659
Lee said that a changed immigration policy could also help the US strengthen its AI efforts .	-2.2462
“ I think Green Cards should automatically be offered PhD PhD in AI , ” he said .	-3.4730
In July 2017 , the Chinese Council of State presented its next-generation artificial intelligence development plan ( The Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan ) .	-3.2350
China ’ s National Science Foundation provides funding for people in academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations allocate money to US researchers , but the quality of academic work in China is lower , Lee said .	-12.2197
Earlier this year , the US Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to involve partners from industry and science , and the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence .	-12.5218

Macedonia votes in a referendum on whether to change the name of the country .	-1.8040
On Sunday , the people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on whether their name should be changed in the Republic of North Macedonia , a step that would resolve a decade-long dispute with Greece that had blocked its accession opportunities for the European Union and NATO .	-4.5293
Greece , which has a province called Macedonia , insists that its northern neighbour ’ s name be a territorial claim on the Greek territory and has vetoed the country ’ s entry into NATO and the EU .	-3.4258
The two governments concluded an agreement in June based on the proposed new name , but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slav majority population of Macedonia .	-3.1741
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum , and there is doubt , given a boycott campaign , whether the result will create the 50 % threshold , which is a prerequisite for the validity of the referendum .	-4.7625
The question on the vote on the referendum was : ' Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with the adoption of the agreement with Greece ? '	-2.7045
Advocates of the name change , including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev , argue that it is worth keeping up the price of including institutions such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia , one of the countries that is to emerge from the collapse of Yugoslavia .	-5.1604
“ I came today to vote on the future of the country , it is a decision for the young people of Macedonia to live freely under the umbrella of the European Union , because that means a life in greater security for all of us , ” said Olivera Georgijevska , 79 , in Skopje .	-4.5231
Although not legally binding , sufficient Members have said that they will respect the outcome of the vote so that it becomes decisive .	-4.7148
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament .	-1.5224
The Land Election Committee said at 1 p.m. that irregularities had not been reported .	-3.7818
But turnout was only 16 % – 34 % in the last 2016 general election , and 66 % of registered voters voted in the end .	-4.0502
“ I voted for my children – our place is in Europe , ” said Gjose Tanevski , 62 , a voter in the capital city Skopje .	-2.5252
Macedonia 's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev , his wife Zorica and his son , Dushko , have voted in favour of the referendum in Macedonia on the amendment of the name of the country , which would pave the way for joining NATO and the European Union in Strumica , Macedonia , on 30 September 2018 .	-4.2045
In front of Parliament in Skopje , Vladimir Kavardarkov , 54 , has prepared a small stage and put chairs in front of the tents drawn up by those who will boycott the referendum .	-3.7403
" We are in favour of NATO and the EU , but we want to participate with the heads up , not by the door of service , " said Kavadarkov .	-3.2653
" We live in a poor country , but we also have our dignity .	-1.7869
If you do not want to join us as Macedonia , we can turn to others , such as China and Russia , to join us in Euro-Asian integration . ”	-3.5383
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia , a country with an unemployment rate of more than 20 % . the .	-7.5264
“ I think a large majority will vote in favour , because more than 80 % of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO , ” Zaev said after the vote was cast .	-4.2927
According to him , the “ yes ” result would be a “ strengthening of our future . ”	-3.2743
Last Monday , the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research published the results of a survey : between 30 and 43 % of voters would therefore vote – less than needed .	-3.7580
Another survey conducted by Macedonia ’ s Telma TV found that 57 % of respondents will vote on Sunday .	-2.5864
Of those who want to participate , 70 % voted ‘ yes ’ .	-2.6179
The referendum will only be adopted if turnout is more than 50 % .	-3.0777
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government ’ s policy since it took office in May last year .	-2.4300
Knowing : Sergio Agüero of Manchester City overcomes the entire Brighton defense on its way to the gate .	-4.6612
Sergio Aguero and Rakeem Sterling performed Brighton ’ s defense at the Manchester City 2-0 victory on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester , England .	-4.2604
Aguero made his hit in the 65th minute look incredibly simple .	-3.4704
At the beginning of the sequence , the Argentine stormer received a passport in the middle field .	-3.9857
He tricked out three defenders of Brighton to stand free .	-4.4859
Then Agüero was surrounded by three gardens .	-2.5856
He bypassed a defender before joining several players on the edge of the Brighton Penal Room .	-4.2221
Then he left a pass and gave off to Sterling .	-2.6984
The English stormer used his first contact to play the ball back to Agüero , who then shot with the right – past Brighton Torwart Mathew Ryan in the right side of the gate .	-3.7065
“ Aguero has foot problems , ” said City-Manager Pep Guardiola to the reporters .	-2.1769
" We talked about it ; he played 55 , 60 minutes .	-1.6828
That has happened .	-1.0437
Fortunately , he has reached a goal . ”	-3.4068
But it was Sterling who first led the Sky Blues at the Premier League-Duell :	-2.9036
The door arrived in the 29 minute	-6.3151
In the game Aguero was played the ball deep in Brighton 's territory .	-2.6648
with a nice steep pass to Leroy Sané along the left side .	-2.5545
Sane made a few touches before he led Sterling to the remote posts .	-3.1375
Sky Blues played the ball forward to the net before slipping out of the pitch .	-3.5044

Scherzer Will Gamble Over Rockies	-3.2432
Since the national players were excluded from the competition , there was not much reason to force another start .	-10.0107
But the hard-fought Scherzer hopes to be able to climb the hill on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies , but only if there are any Playoff-implications for the rockies that have a lead from a game in front of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West .	-5.7260
The Rockies secured at least one place in the lead on Friday evening , with a 5 : 2 victory over the national , but the first league title win is still not certain .	-6.2128
" Although we play for free , we can at least bear witness because we know that the atmosphere here in Denver with the people and the other team will probably be the best we have to offer this year .	-4.5121
Why should I not try to do so ? '	-2.7220
The Nationals have not yet announced a start for Sunday , but are supposedly inclined to let Scherzer throw in such a situation .	-4.3457
On Thursday , Scherzer , who would start his 34th day , went up and went on his normal day of rest .	-5.5983

Trump further : “ You see this terrible , terrible radical democrats group , you see that it is happening right now .	-4.4069
And they are determined to regain power with all necessary means , and do not stop , even from bodily times and communities .	-6.0141
They are not concerned about who they are violating , who they have to cross , to gain power and control , that is what they want , power and control , we will not give them .	-4.9452
“ The Democrats ’ goal is to oppose and block , ” he said .	-2.0389
" And you see this in the last four days , " he said and called the democrats ' angry and common , evil and untrue ' .	-4.2822
“ He referred specifically to the democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein , a senior member of the Senate Committee , and thus rewarded a riot from the audience .	-6.6492
" Do you remember their answer ?	-1.7300
Have you read the document ?	-1.2171
No , what .	-0.8538
No , uh no , I , moment – that was really bad body language – the worst body language I have ever seen . ”	-3.0573
The Labour Party is no longer a large community .	-1.5838
It is intolerant of those who say what they think .	-0.7468
When current activists in my local party voted to criticise me , it was hardly a surprise .	-2.4968
Finally , I am the last in a number of Labour MEPs who are saying that we are not welcome - just because we have said our opinion .	-3.3289
My group colleague , Joan Ryan , has been treated in a similar way because she has resolutely opposed anti-Semitism .	-3.3356
In my case , I have been criticised by the motion of censure because I do not agree with Jeremy Corbyn .	-2.6125
Regarding the importance of responsible economic policies , national security , Europe , ironically similar issues , in which Jeremy disagreed with previous Heads of State or Government .	-3.6060
The Nottingham meeting on Friday in the East Labour communication states : ' We want meetings to be inclusive and productive ' .	-4.0384
Most of my time as a local Labour MEP in the eight years was exactly the same as the GC meeting on Friday evening .	-3.7396
Unfortunately , it is not the tone of many meetings today , and the promise of a ' more friendly , lighter ' policy is long forgotten , even if it ever started .	-4.5380
It has become increasingly clear that different views in the Labour Party are not tolerated , and every opinion is judged by whether it is acceptable to party leadership .	-4.7255
This began shortly after Jeremy ’ s inauguration , because the colleagues with whom I had previously thought I would have a similar political attitude expected me to make a U-turn and adopt positions that I would never otherwise have agreed with , whether in terms of national security or the EU ’ s internal market .	-13.9682
Whenever I speak publicly – and it does not matter what I say – there is a tirade of abuse in the social media that calls for diselection , denouncing the center ’ s policy and telling me that I should not be in the Labour Party .	-5.0870
This is not only my experience .	-2.6608
I do know , in fact , that there is more luck than some of my colleagues , because the comments that are directed at me tend to be political . . .	-4.4094
I appreciate the professionalism and determination of my fellow Members who are exposed every day to a flood of sexual or racist abuse , but never shy away .	-4.4242
One of the most disappointing aspects of this policy era is how the scale of abuse has normalized .	-2.4118
Jeremy Corbyn argued last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance .	-1.3906
The reality is that we are no longer the broad church and , with every motion of censure or modification of the selection rules , the party becomes smaller .	-4.3582
I have received a lot of advice over the last two years to take my neck , not to be so loud , and then I would be “ in order ” .	-5.1629
But that is why I did not come into politics .	-2.0166
I joined Labour , a student 32 years ago , for neglecting the Thatcher Government , and this neglect has resulted in my classroom literally collapsing , so I have tried to promote better public services for those who need it most , whether as a council or minister .	-7.4908
I have never hidden my political views , even at the last election .	-2.4401
As far as my political positions are concerned , no one in Nottingham East should have been in any way confused ; the same applies to areas where I disagree with the current leadership .	-4.3832
To those who supported the request on Friday , I would just like to say that I do not understand why they are wasting time and energy to remain loyal to me and the Labour Party when the country comes to Brexit , which is detrimental to households , businesses and our public services .	-4.9560
But the only message I have is not about Nottingham Momentum , but about my constituents , be they Labour Members or not : I am proud to serve you , and I promise you that I will not resist threats of diselection or political opportunities from work in what I believe is the best interest of you all .	-4.9638

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose : Ayr Unflashed	-1.9239
Two late tries may have somewhat distorted the final result , but there is no doubt that Ayr deserves to win in this wonderfully entertaining Tennent 's Premier Match of the day .	-4.6637
They are the only unbeaten of the ten teams to run the table .	-3.2302
After all , it was due to the host ’ s overwhelming defence , but also to the fact that opportunities were better utilised .	-6.6829
" We have been tested so far by our games , and we are still unbeaten , so I must be happy , " he said .	-3.2879
Robyn Christie of Melrose said , “ Thanks to Ayr , they used their chances better . ”	-2.2924
Grant Anderson ’ s attempt at the 14th minute , by Frazier Climo , brought Ayr forward , but a yellow card for Scotland ’ s captain Rory Hughes , who was given for the game of warriors , allowed Melrose to let his figures speak , and Jason Bagbot to score a failed attempt .	-6.2237
Climo summed up the Ayr leadership with a punitive strike before reaching a hit directly at the midterm and then embarked on a solo search for Ayr in the 17,5 pause run .	-8.8102
Melrose , however , began the second half well , and Patrick Anderson ’ s attempt to transform excavation reduced the lag to five points .	-4.7787
After Ayr was rebuilt , the leadership was transformed by Stafford McDowall-Climo .	-7.2586
Ayr 's current captain Blair Macpherson then got the yellow card , and once again Melrose had paid the extra man with an unconverted Bruce Colvine attempt , at the end of a curse of intense pressure .	-5.0082
However , the home page came back , and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card due to a bag without ball from Climo from the penal line , MacPherson made a touch down , the foregoing Ayr in his back .	-6.1161
Climo converted , as already almost after restarting , after Kyle Rowe David Armstrong caught Boxkick and sent the Gregor Henry wing crater by passport to Try number five .	-6.0319

Throughout the Bolivia included , the memory of a coastline lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the nineteenth century is still alive - as is the desire to go back to the Pacific .	-4.8683
These hopes may be at their peak for decades , since Bolivia is awaiting a judgment by the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of discussions .	-4.0548
" Bolivia has the dynamism , the spirit of unity and serenity and naturally expects the result with a positive view " , said Roberto Calzadilla , a Bolivian diplomat .	-2.5761
Many Bolivians will follow the judgment of the International Court of Justice on large screens throughout the country , and hope that the tribunal in The Hague will favour Bolivia ’ s assertion that , after decades of unsettled talks , Chile must negotiate to grant Bolivia sovereign access to the sea .	-4.5870
For Evo Morales , Bolivia ’ s charismatic Indian president – who faces a contentious struggle for re-election next year – much depends on Monday ’ s decision .	-2.9667
“ We are about to recover access to the Pacific , ” he praised at the end of August .	-3.0025
But some analysts believe it is unlikely that the Bolivia court will decide , and believe that even a positive Bolivia decision will not change .	-4.1765
The Dutch UN body has no power to award Chilean territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks .	-3.6623
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice came into being only six months after hearing the final arguments shows that the case was ' not complicated ' , said Paz Zárate , a Chilean expert on international law .	-4.2081
Far from advancing Bolivia ’ s cause , the last four years may have put this back .	-3.6923
“ The question of sea access is being used by the current Bolivian government for its purposes , ” Zárate said .	-3.2263
Moral warlike rhetoric has destroyed any remaining Chilean goodwill .	-2.9557
Bolivia and Chile will eventually resume negotiations , but it will be difficult to continue talks after that .	-2.7821

Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé , Bolivia ’ s representative in The Hague , rejected the idea that the court had unusually quickly decided .	-2.8272
Monday will provide Bolivia ’ s “ an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile , ” as well as an opportunity to end “ 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefit , ” he said .	-3.8354
Calzadilla also denied that Morales , still considered one of Latin America ’ s most popular presidents , is making political use of the issue of sea access .	-3.1101

Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly Saturday .	-1.9226

His comments come at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to resume the Ivory diplomatic talks on nuclear disarmament three months after the meeting with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un in Singapore .	-4.2237

Other oversized accessoires were jewellery , a magician 's hat and even an ananas , but they are not meant to keep your head warm .	-4.9691
Thom Browne showed a number of bizarre masks - and just in time for Halloween .	-1.2370
Many of the colorful masks had pitched lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter rather than Haute Couture .	-3.7187
One creation resembled the scuba diving equipment with snorkels and glasses , while another looked like a molten ice cube .	-4.5967

Style-watchers predict that the huge huts could make their way into the main roads in your vicinity .	-5.2506
The oversized huts have glued to the heels of " La Bomba " , the straw hut with a 60 cm wide edge , which can be seen at each of Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski .	-5.3484
The cult label behind the highly impractical hat injected via social media sent another great creation to the catwalk - a straw bag that was almost as big as the bathing suit model she wore .	-5.9669
The orange shade , filled with refinery and a white leather grip , was the outstanding piece of Jacquemius ' La Riviera SS19 collection on the Paris Fashion Week .	-4.6198

John Edward : Language skills that are essential to global citizens .	-2.6798
Independent schools in Scotland have a record of top academic quality , which continued in 2018 with outstanding results , plus individual and group success in sport , art , music and other collective activities .	-6.4485
With over 30,000 students across Scotland , these schools , represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools ( SCIS ) , strive to offer their students and parents the best level of service .	-3.0209
Independent schools are designed to prepare the students – for further education , including higher education , their desired career and their role as a global citizen .	-5.7255
In the education sector , we have the opportunity to develop and implement a tailor-made school curriculum , whilst we note that modern languages are still popular and desirable in schools .	-4.2593
Nelson Mandela once said this : “ When you speak to a person in the language he understands , you reach his mind . ”	-2.8429
If you speak with him in his own language , he ’ ll get his heart . ”	-6.1047
This is an impressive illustration of the fact that we cannot rely only on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries .	-3.6883
The results of this year show that languages are at the top of the tables with the highest rank in independent schools .	-3.1822
68 percent of students who have studied foreign languages have reached Higher grade A .	-3.5769
The data collected by SCIS ’ s 74 member schools showed that 72 % of students reached a “ Higher grade A ” in Mandarin , while 72 , 69 , and 63 reached Note A among students learning German , French , and Spanish .	-6.2103
This shows that independent schools in Scotland promote foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future .	-3.0580
Language courses have the same status in independent schools and elsewhere as MINT subjects ( mathematics , information technology , science and technology ) .	-3.3066
A 2014 Employment and Qualifications Commission survey found that 17 % of the reasons why employers had difficulty occupying jobs were attributable to a lack of language knowledge .	-4.4446
Thus , language skills are becoming increasingly necessary to prepare young people for their professional future .	-3.3101
Given more promising employment opportunities that require languages , these skills are essential in a globalised world .	-3.0345
Regardless of the career that someone chooses when he learned a second language , he has a real advantage in the future with a lifetime ability like this .	-4.7366
The ability to communicate directly with people from abroad will allow a multilingual person to be ahead of competitors .	-3.9368
According to a YouGov poll with more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013 , 75 % were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation , and French is the only language that is spoken with a double-digit percentage , namely 15 % .	-3.7879
This investment in language teaching is therefore important for today 's children .	-2.9763
When children learn to speak several languages – particularly those of developing countries – they will later have better chances of finding meaningful employment in the labour market .	-4.0385
The schools in Scotland differ in their language supply .	-4.4224
Some schools focus on the classic modern languages , while others that are most important to Britain in 2020 , such as Mandarin or Japanese , will teach .	-4.7202
Whatever your child is interested , there will always be a variety of languages available in independent schools , with teachers specialised in this field .	-3.2426
Independent schools in Scotland want to provide a learning environment that is well prepared for children , and they should be given the necessary tools for their success , whatever the future may bring .	-5.1191
In today ’ s global business , languages remain undeniably important for the country ’ s future , and education must reflect that .	-3.3651
Indeed , modern languages should really be regarded as “ international communication skills . ”	-2.1196
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice , variety , and quality to young people in Scotland .	-2.2314
Il faut bien le faire .	-3.0481

President Donald Trump is starting this evening in Wheeling , West Virginia , with a flood of campaign events .	-2.6293
It is the first of five scheduled electoral events next week , with Trump visiting the Republican-friendly states of Tennessee and Mississippi .	-3.6710
While confirmation of his candidate for the vacant Supreme Court is still pending , Trump must mobilize his electorate for the upcoming midterm election , otherwise there is a fear that the Republicans will lose the majority in Congress when elected in November .	-4.7185
When is Trump ’ s West Virginia Rallye tonight and how can you view it online ?	-2.5527
Trump 's Rally in Wheeling , West Virginia is scheduled for 19 p.m. ET this evening , Saturday , September 29 , 2018 .	-3.4722

Trump will certainly respond to this week ’ s hearings on charges of sexual abuse against his Supreme Court candidate , Brett Kavanaugh , whose endorsement of the the Senate was by at by at least one week .	-18.5012
The main aim of these electoral events , however , is to mobilise the Republicans , who are facing a decisive November election .	-4.1239
According to Reuters , Trump ’ s campaign ’ s goal is to mobilize volunteers and supporters with the five electoral events next week to defend and expand the majority of Republicans in the Senate and House .	-3.4595
“ The majority in Congress is on the president ’ s agenda first , so he is visiting as many states as possible just before the start of the turbulent campaign season , ” said Reuters , a spokesman for the Trump campaign who does not want to be named .	-5.5149
According to the radio network of West Virginia MetroNews , the election event that is taking place this evening at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract the attention of the Pittsburgher media . the , . , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-9.8326
On Saturday , Trump West Virgina , the state he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016 , will visit for the second time this month .	-2.2704
Trump is trying to help the Republicans ’ candidate for West Virginia ’ Senate , Patrick Morrisey , who is lagging behind in the polls .	-2.8030
According to Reuters , Simon Haeder , a political scientist at the University of West Virginia , said that it was not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come to improve his polls .	-3.4744
Ryder Cup 2018 : The US team is ready to fight to maintain hope for Sunday singles .	-4.4121
After three one-sided encounters , the four games on Saturday afternoon were probably exactly what the Ryder Cup needed .	-2.9801
The vibrating pendulum is a freely invented sports concept that the players interned , especially in competitions like this .	-3.8254
So where would they say is the dynamic now ?	-1.9502
“ They had a six-point lead , and now there are four , so it might give us a bit of momentum , ” said Jordan Spiith , when he retired for the day . ” .	-6.0113
Europe is , of course , in the advantage of 4 points and twelve more are still to be played .	-5.9135
However , Americans , as Spiith says , feel a little windy in their sails and there was a lot of encouraging for them , not least the form of Spiith and Justin Thomas , who played together all day and each of three of four points .	-6.6107
Spith was superior from the outset and set a good example .	-4.3313
These bogus cheeky chests became louder when his round continued , giving a decisive putt to reach a draw in the game 4 after he and Thomas withdrew 2 points after 2 games .	-7.0732
His joy over the putt at the 15th hole with which they won the game was such that it was thought that he still believes in the victory of the Americans .	-4.8085
" You really need to concentrate a lot and only worry about your own game , " said Spith .	-3.8956
That ’ s all that remains for each player .	-4.5068
18 holes to leave an impression .	-1.2330
In the last two days , Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood were the only players with more points than Mirity and Thomas .	-3.9466
Europe ’ s strange , but admirable couple plays erroneously and just does everything right .	-4.5362
" Moliwood " was the only couple who did not reach a Bogey on Saturday afternoon , but also prevented it from doing so on Saturday morning , Friday afternoon and Friday morning at the back of nine .	-5.9568
This course , and the way their energy seems to be flowing from and out of this unleashed crowd of spectators , makes it the favorites on Sunday , and if the sun falls over Le Golf , there would be no more popular player sealing a possible European victory as Fleetwood or Molinari .	-7.2564
Probably both on different holes at the same time .	-1.3736
Talking of a European victory now would be too hasty .	-2.7284
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a short process with Sergio Garcia , who was victorious with his partner Alex Noren in the morning .	-2.9415
With a Bogey and two Doubles on the first nine grubs of the Spaniards and the Swede entered a hole from which they never came out again .	-4.7962
On Sunday there is no one to help you out of your hole .	-2.6615
Due to the interactions between the couples , the given advice , the non-given advice and the way a strategy can change in a blink of a eye , it is very fascinating to see the early Foursocks and Foursomes .	-7.5251
Europe has played better as a team and has taken a clear lead in the last day , but this Fourseme session has also shown that the US team has the desire to fight what some , especially Stateside , have doubted .	-7.6980
Europe is doing 10-6 on the Ryder Cup Finalday	-2.3514
Europe will take a solid advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after it emerged from the four and four games on Saturday with a 10-6 lead over the United States .	-4.2287
Inspired by Duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari , the group held two victories over a struggling Tiger Woods to score four points in their previous Le Golf National balance .	-4.7254
The European team of Thomas Bjorn , who took over the preservation of the trophy that she lost in Hazeltine two years ago , dominated a American team with Aussetzern and won the series with 3-1 .	-5.7828
The US offered more resistance in the Four and won two games , but it could not digest the deficit .	-2.8554
Jim Furyk ’ s team needs eight points from Sunday ’ s 12 individual games to keep the trophy .	-2.4687
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four consecutive points while he and Molinari , after a sensational weekend called " Molliwood " , are only the second pair to win four points from their first four matches in the history of the Ryder Cup .	-2.9000
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the football , it was certain that they would strike a sobered Woods and American Rookie Bryson December through an even clearer 5 & 4 .	-5.7937
Woods , who played through two matches on Saturday , sometimes showed brilliant actions , but he lost 19 of his 29 matches in four balls and four in a row .	-5.1765
Justin Rose , dedicated to the morning football , returned to his partner Henrik Stenson in the Foursomes and beat in a 2 & 1 defeat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – place one and three in the world .	-14.6452
On a pleasant , airy day south-west of Paris , however , Europe did not have it in its own way .	-2.6556
On Saturday , the three main winners of Jordan Spiith and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans with two points .	-4.8670
They won a brave 2 : 1 victory against the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the Viererback and returned later to fight Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 : 3 in the 4-of-a-Kind pack after losing the first two holes .	-6.0789
Only twice in the Ryder Cup story , a team returns from a four-point deficit to the singles , although Halter Furyk 's side needs only one draw to keep the trophy .	-4.5779
After two days of second best , however , a Sunday account looks like he would go beyond it .	-4.9941
North Korea says that there will be “ absolutely no ” unilateral disarmament without confidence .	-2.8380
On Saturday , North Korea ’ s foreign minister told the United Nations that the ongoing sanctions would deepen its distrust of the United States and that under such circumstances the country would under no circumstances give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally .	-4.0172
Ri Yong Ho , the world 's annual General Assembly , said that North Korea took " major goodwill measures " last year , such as the cessation of nuclear and missile tests , the dismantling of the nuclear testing site , and the commitment not to disseminate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology .	-5.3503
" But there is no such answer from the USA , " he said .	-3.3543
“ Without any confidence in the US , there will be no confidence in our national security , and in such circumstances there is no way that we will first disarm unilaterally . ”	-3.6049
While Ri revisited the well-known North Korean complaints about Washington ’ s opposition to a “ gradual ” approach to denuclearization , in which North Korea would gradually reap off , his explanation seemed significant , insofar as it did not entirely reject unilateral denuclearization , as Pyongyang has done in the past .	-5.8100
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a first summit between an incumbent US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June , when Kim committed to working on a " denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula " , while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea 's security .	-4.5006
North Korea has sought a formal end to the Korean War in 1950-53 , but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons . the .	-3.4507
Washington has also resisted calls to ease tough international sanctions against North Korea .	-2.5230
The US insists on " denuclearization-first " ( first nuclear nuclearization ) and increase the pressure from sanctions to achieve its purpose in a compelling manner , and even reject the " Declaration of the end of the War , " said Ri .	-6.0248
" The perception that sanctions can force us to our knees is a dream of people who are ignorant of us .	-8.0827
But the problem is that the sanctions that continue to apply exacerbate our suspicion . ”	-3.8655
Ri mentioned no plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump , which the US President emphasized at the United Nations earlier this week .	-3.3014
Instead , the minister held three meetings between Kim and South Korea ’ s leader Moon Jae-in the last five months , adding : ' If the party were to be in this issue of denuclearization in South Korea , not the US , the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have reached such a deadlock ' .	-6.1396
Yet the tone of Ri ’ s speech was dramatically different from last year when he reported to the U.N. The General Assembly , which targeted the US mainland with North Korea ’ s missiles , was inevitable after “ Mr. Evil President ” Trump Kim called a “ missile man ” on a suicide mission .	-5.2050
This year at the United Nations , Trump , who threatened last year to “ completely destroy ” North Korea , praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm , but he also said that much work still needed to be done , and sanctions must remain in place until North Korea wiped out denuclearization .	-5.0601
On Wednesday , Trump said that he had no time for it , saying , ' It doesn 't matter if it takes two years , three years , or five months ' .	-3.7656
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken .	-1.1313
However , in the United States Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo said to the UN on Thursday that ' enforcement of the Security Council sanctions must be continued vigorously and without rigour until we achieve full , final and verified denuclearisation ' .	-4.7586
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to prevent the financing of Pyongyang 's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes .	-2.7026
Pompeo met Ri at the margins of the UN General Assembly and then said that he will return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit .	-3.0025
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year , but his last trip was not good .	-2.1724
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress has been made , and only a few hours after that , North Korea condemned him for “ outright claims . ”	-4.7504
During a meeting with Moon , North Korea promised to dismantle a missile station and a nuclear complex this month , if the United States took ' appropriate measures ' .	-4.0650
He said that Kim told him that the “ related measures ” he wanted were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore , and steps to normalize relations with Washington .	-4.6419
Harvard students take part in the course to find enough peace .	-2.5062
With a new course this year at Harvard University , all students get more sleep to fight against the growing macho culture of the study of the caffeine " passed nights " .	-5.1589
A scientist has found that students at a world-leading university are often unsuspecting when it comes to helping themselves , even when it comes to very simple mechanisms .	-3.8925
Charles Czeisler , professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at the Brigham and Women 's Hospital , designed the course that he considered to be the first of its kind in the USA .	-3.6939
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the impact of sleep deficiency on learning .	-3.2515
In the end , a girl came to me and said : " Why is this just told me now , in my final year ?	-4.5176
She said that never told anyone about the meaning of sleep – what surprised me ” , he told the telegraph .	-3.7007
This is the first time that students have been offered the course , which explains how good sleep habits promote academic and sporting performance and improve their overall wellbeing .	-6.4279
Paul Barreira , professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Managing Director of University Health Service , said that the university decided to introduce the course after it found that students had slept extremely little during the week .	-4.6264
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks .	-2.0458
In one section there is an image of a sleeping hall where students click on coffee tables , curtains , trainers and books to be informed about the effects of cafe and light and how sports performance is influenced by a sleep shortage and the importance of a sleep time routine .	-6.0461
Another section explains to participants how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack , stroke , depression , and cancer .	-2.5952
A map of the campus with interactive symbols encourages participants to think about their daily lives .	-2.3320
We know it will not change the behaviour of students immediately .	-1.7288
" But we believe they have a right - just as you have a right to know the health effects of the decision to smoke cigarettes , " added Prof. Czeisler .	-3.6721
The culture of pride to “ go through the night ” still exists , he said , and added that modern technology and increasing pressure on students and students makes sleeping deprivation a growing problem .	-4.2893
Sufficient sleep of good quality should be the " secret weapon " of a student to fight stress , exhaustion and fear , he said - also to not accept , as sleep deprivation puts the brain into starvation mode and makes it constantly hungry .	-5.6279
Raymond Thus , a 19-year-old Californian who studied chemical and physical biology , helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes last year in Harvard in his first year .	-3.3432
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to take a campus-wide course .	-2.5844
The next step , he hopes , is to call on all doctoral students to complete a similar study programme before they enter the Competition School .	-4.2953
Prof. Czeisler recommended students to set an alarm , when they should go into bed and when they should wake up , and to be aware of the harmful effects of the " blue light " emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting , which can unleash their circular rhythm , leading to problems when they fall into sleep .	-7.3274
Livingston 1-0 Rangers : Mengas Goal informs Gerrards men	-2.9899
Further downward problems of the rangers : After a meeting of Dolly Menga , the 1-to-0 defeat for the unsome Steven Gerrard team came to Livingston .	-6.0753
The Ibrox team wanted to record their first victory since the 4 : 1 triumph in February in St. Johnstone , but the Gary Holt team added Gerrard ’ s second defeat to 18 games as a coach who left his team for eight points behind the disappointed Ladbrokes Premier Hearts .	-6.1521
Menga landed a hit seven minutes before the half-time , and an inspirational Rangers set did not look like they could bring about a compensation .	-6.7419
While the rangers now fall back to sixth place , Livingston climb to third and are only behind Hibernian because of the tordifference .	-4.9586
New problems for the rangers have arisen , because a head wounds had to be supplied to liner Calum Spence after he was hit by a litter item – apparently thrown out by the sector of the fans of foreign affairs .	-10.3169
Gerrard made eight changes to the side that passed to Ayr and directly swept into the Betfred Cup semi-finals .	-3.9042
On the other hand , Holt raised the same Livi-Elf , who made a point for the Hearts last week , and he should have been delighted how his well-trained team never allowed the opponents room for action at any time .	-7.0753
The rangers dominated the ball , but Livingston did better .	-4.3416
You should have hit after only two minutes , when Menga first shook Scott Pittman in the direction of Allan McGregor ’ s Tor , but the middle field player missed out on the door .	-6.9781
A deeper offense from Keaghan Jacobs then went to Captain Craig Halkett , but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only shoot far behind posts .	-3.9149
The rangers took control , but there seemed to be more hope than chatting into their own game , the last third .	-3.1588
After the first quarter of an hour , Alfredo Morelos was clearly of the opinion that he deserved an elfmeter after he and Steven Lawles clashed , but Steven Thomson ’ s judge did not address the Colombia ’ s appeals .	-7.4342
The rangers came only two shots in the first half , but the former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was hardly able to get away from the hustle and bustle of Lassana Coulibal ’ s head jump and the hit of a bisslose Ovie Ejaria .	-6.3449
Although Livi ’ s opening match may have been against the course of the 34th minute , no one can deny that they deserve it alone .	-5.7687
Again , the rangers failed to master a Jacobs standard situation .	-2.5067
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher played the ball , Scott Robinson , who kept the rest and played Menga out for a simple finish .	-4.2075
Gerrard acted during the break when he exchanged Coulibaly against Ryan Kent , and the change immediately affected the game when the wine-player played to Morelos , but the impressive Kelly ran from his line to block .	-4.8813
But Livingston repeatedly urged guests to play the very type of game they like , with lithgow and necklace after long balls long .	-5.1571
Holt ’ s team could have expanded its leadership in the final phase , but McGregor was well placed to refuse Jacobs before Lithgow left the corner .	-6.2732
Glenn Middleton , the Ranger ’ s representative , had another delayed claim to a sentence because he had married to Jacobs , but once again he looked at Thomson .	-5.8932
Almanach : the inventor of the Geiger Counter	-2.1129
And now a page from our Almanac “ Sunday morning ” : September 30 , 1882 , which was more than 136 years ago ... The day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm , called Hans , Geiger , was born in Germany .	-3.6925
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity , an invention that eventually produced the device known as the Geiger counter .	-2.8043
Since then , the Geiger counter has also become a major stay of science , as in the 1950s of the film " Bells of Coronado " , which hails seemingly improbable cowpoke scientist Roy Rogers and Dale Evans :	-5.6809
Mann : ' What about everything in the world is that ? '	-2.7975
Rogers : “ It is a Geiger counter used to find radioactive minerals like uranium .	-2.8267
If you set up these headphones , you can actually hear the effects of the atoms released by radioactivity in minerals . ”	-3.9559
Evans : “ Tell me , but now it ’ s cracking ! ”	-4.6028
Hans Geiger died in 1945 , just a few days before his 63rd birthday .	-1.4552
But the invention that bears its name remains in use .	-1.8755
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “ see ” malignant cells .	-1.3619
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to " see " and kill malignant cells .	-1.4288
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of the treatment .	-1.8371
The procedure includes the extraction of immune cells from a patient , the modification of them in the laboratory .	-3.5534
You can then see a protein that is common to many types of cancer and then inject it again .	-2.4211
A study vaccine shows promising results in patients with a number of cancer species .	-3.3076
A woman treated with the vaccine teaching the immune system to detect rogue cells saw her egg cancer disappearing for more than 18 months .	-3.3498
The method is to extract immune cells from a patient , modify them in the laboratory , so that a protein called HER2 becomes “ visible ” in many types of cancer , and then inject the cells again .	-3.7330
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda , Maryland , said : ' Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine . '	-2.2818
HER2 “ promotes the growth of different types of cancer ” , including breast , egg , lung and intestinal cancer , declared Prof. Berzofsky .	-3.5110
A similar approach to taking immune cells and teaching patients how to attack cancer cells has worked in treating a type of leukaemia .	-3.8449
After his performance at Saturday Night Live , Kanye West , dressed with MAGA hat , left a pro-Trump tirade from the stack .	-2.6325
It wasn ’ t good .	-5.6345
Kanye West was picked up in the studio during a Saturday Night Live show after a sweeping speech in which he praised the US .	-5.5484
Having performed his third song of the night , called Ghost Town , while wearing a Make America Great hat , he defied the Democrats and reaffirmed his support for Trump .	-3.9051
'As often do I speak with a white person and she says , ‘ How can you like Trump , he is a racist ? ’	-3.2234
Well , if I were concerned about racism , I would have been taken out of America long ago , " he said .	-2.4803
The saturday night live show began with a sketch in which Hollywood-star Matt Damon made funny statements to the Senate ’ s Justice Committee concerning Christine Blasey Ford ’ s accusations .	-5.7391
Although it was not broadcast , the film was shared by the comedian Chris Rock in the social media by Wests Sch.	-5.2961
It is unclear whether Rock has attempted to mock West with the post .	-3.7656
West also complained to the audience that he had been hard behind the stage because of his head cover .	-4.5499
" You sent me behind the stage .	-1.7855
You said : ' Do not go there with the hat ' .	-2.8768
You have annoyed me !	-1.2660
And then they say that I am in an abandoned place , " he said , according to the Washington Examiner .	-2.7327
West continued : " Do you want to see the sunken place " and said that he would " put on my superman 's cloak because that means you cannot tell me what to do , you want the world to move forward ?	-8.1225
Try it with love . ”	-0.8475
His comments were quitted at least twice by the audience and the comedians of Saturday Night Live appeared to be displaying , Variety reported , citing one person in the words : “ The whole studio was totenstill . ”	-5.4206
West was later replaced by the singer Ariana Grande , whose former friend , Rapper Mac Miller , died a few days ago .	-2.8298
West surprised many with a performance of the song " I Love it " , dressed as Perrier Bottle .	-3.0176
West received the support of the TPUSA Conservative Group , Candace Turner , who tweaked : " This is for one of the most courageous ghosts : DANKE , DASS DU DICH THE MAFIA WIDERSETT HAST . "	-4.6800
But Talkmaster Karen Hunter twitterte that West is " what he is , and that is absolutely wonderful " .	-3.0297
“ But I will not reward anyone ( buying his music or clothing or supporting his art ) that I believe will embrace and disseminate an ideology that is damaging to my community . ”	-4.1522
It is free .	-0.6358
We also ' , she added .	-1.1313
Before the show , the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and now called “ the being formally known as Kanye West . ”	-3.0598
He is not the first artist to change her name and enters the footsteps of Diddy , also known as Puff Daddy , Puffy and P Diddy .	-2.5661
Mitrapper Snoop Dogg had the name Snoop Lion and of course the later music legend Prince , changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist who was formerly known as Prince .	-3.8017

Kit believes that television can partly be responsible for the rise in toxic masculinity by its very masculine characters .	-2.4535
He continued : What is inherent and what is taught ?	-2.4656
What is taught on television and on the streets gives the little boy the feeling that they have to have this particular side of man ?	-3.5021
I think that this is really one of the big questions of our time – how can we change that ?	-3.8514
Because obviously something went wrong for young men .	-2.0323

The data of the three senators were published shortly after the survey of Kavanaugh .	-1.7453
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identified the source of the posts was associated with Waters ' office and published the information of a Waters employee , Hill reported .	-4.5892
“ This unfounded charge is completely wrong and an absolute lie , ” says Waters .	-3.0577
“ The employee of my employees – whose identity , personal information , personal data , and security were compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false claims – was in no way responsible for this information being read .	-3.9635
This untenable claim is completely wrong and an absolute lie .	-2.4075
Water ’ s statement quickly led to online criticism , including by the former press secretary of the White House , Ari Fleischer .	-4.1317
“ The fact that things are denied is extremely annoying , ” butchers wrote .	-4.2667
“ This suggests that it is inappropriate as a member of Congress .	-2.9629
If anyone is accused of having done something , it must not be evil .	-3.6028
They must not be pertinent .	-2.7125
They must not challenge the motives of the plaintiff .	-2.4615
They must be calm and left . ”	-2.6016
Meyer seemed to compare Waters ’ response to the Democrats ’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh , accused by critics of appearing angry during the hearing on Thursday .	-4.5252
Omar Navarro , a republican candidate who ran next to the sideless Waters in the midterm elections , also expressed his thoughts on Twitter .	-4.3557
“ Big , if true , ” he contacted .	-2.3934
In its statement , Waters said that her office ' informed the competent authorities and law enforcement authorities of the fraudulent claims .	-3.6026
“ We will ensure that the perpetrators are taken to account and that their actions , which are destructive and dangerous to my employees , are brought to justice , ” she continued .	-5.0177
Review from " Johnny English – Man lives only three times " – badly occupied parody with Rowan Atkinson .	-3.2466
In 2003 Johnny English was born and raised in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn .	-6.1380
Is ironic self-satire about the abysmal humanity the new export power of the nation ?	-4.2078
However , for the second time , Johnny English has been granted the license to re-mix things .	-22.0689
He is , of course , the stupid secret agent who , despite his bizarre claims to Smoothie Glamour , received a bit of Clouseau , a sprint Mr. Bean and a clack from this guy , and who contributed a single note to the flagship melody of the fire-fighters during the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London .	-7.0401
It is also based on the traveller and international , mysterious Atkinson , who used to cause chaos in the now forgotten Barclaycard televisions .	-4.9296
There are one or two beautiful moments in this latest Johnny English-comedy .	-2.1639
I loved Johnny English , who is approaching a helicopter in a medieval armor and the main rotor beats briefly against his helmet .	-4.1589
Atkinson 's talent for body comedy is to be seen , but the humor feels rather weak and strangely superfluous , especially since the " serious " film brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible selectively offer comedy as an ingredient .	-4.7534
The humor feels more like directed to children than adults , and for me the crazy misgivings of Johnny English are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson ’ s Mr. Bean Stumfilme .	-4.7827
The perennial premise is now that Britain is in great difficulty .	-2.3516
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the highly secret British network of spies and revealed the identity of all British agents on the ground , to horror the service agent – a regrettably small role for Kevin Eldon .	-3.9935
Emma Thompson is doing her best with this quasi-Teresa-May figure , but there is not much in the script to work with .	-4.4368
Their intelligence advisers inform them that , as each active spy has been compromised , they have to take someone out of retirement .	-5.2768
And that means , the great patchy Johnny English himself , who is now a school champion in a noble institution but gives unsurpassed lessons about how to operate as a Undercover agent : some nice gags here , while English offers a School of Rock Academy over spying .	-6.5718
English is returned to Whitehall for an emergency warrior and reunited with his former long-suffering Kumpel Bough , again played by Ben Miller .	-4.6144
Bough is now a married man who meets a submarine commander , a tireless burschikose role in which Vicki Pepperdine is not entirely effective .	-5.2895
So the Batman and Robin the Chaos at Secret Service their Majesty are back in action and meet on Olga Kurylenkos beautiful fat Fatal Ophelia Bulletova .	-2.8842
Meanwhile , the prime minister is dangerously mired in the charismatic tech billionaire , who claims to be able to solve Britain ’ s computer problems : the dark Jason Volta , played by Jake Lacy .	-4.2505
English and Bough start their odyssey of colorful Highjinks : as a waiter dressed , they ignite a French flash restaurant ; they create chaos by smuggling on board Voltas luxury yacht ; and English triggers pure anarchy when he tries to familiarise himself with a virtual reality headset with the interior of Voltas house .	-6.7236
All the registers have certainly been drawn for this last sequence , but as kindly and simply as it is , the whole thing is reminiscent of child television .	-6.6577
Decent .	-1.9369
And , like the other Johnny Englishman films , I could not resist thinking : can the British film industry Rowan Atkinson not play a role that really does justice to his talent ?	-4.9582
Labour is denying having developed a plan for Britain for a four-day week , for which five days will be paid .	-4.5163
Jeremy Corbyn ’ s Labour Party is reviewing a radical plan that only serves four days a week , but pays for five .	-3.1636
According to reports , the Party wants business leaders to pass on the savings made by the AI revolution to workers by giving them an extra day .	-3.4253
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend - but still bring the same money home .	-3.5242
Sources said that the idea would ' fit ' with the party 's economic agenda and plans to tilt the country for the benefit of workers .	-3.5127
The Trade Union Congress approved the switch to a four-day week as an opportunity for workers to take advantage of the changing economy .	-3.5824
A high-level source from the Labour Party said the Sunday Times : a policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year .	-2.9293
A four-day week is a goal that is consistent with the Party ’ s approach to restoring the economic balance for workers and the Party ’ s overall industrial strategy , but that goal will not be realised overnight .	-5.2358
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea , as the Green Party promised a four-day working week during its 2017 campaign .	-2.7696
However , the entire Labour Party does not currently support this move .	-2.9541
A Labour Party spokesman said : ' A four-day week is not party politics and is not intended by the party ' .	-3.3552
Chancellor John McDonnell used last week ’ s Labour Party conference to define his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy .	-3.3844
Mr McDonnell said that he was determined to regain power from faceless directors and ' profit-makers ' among utilities .	-2.9535
The Shadowkanzler ’ s plans also mean that current water-company shareholders may not recover their entire share , because a Labour Government could " withdraw " from alleged misconduct .	-7.0703
He also confirmed the plans to recruit workers into the business pipelines and to create inclusive ownership funds to distribute 10 % of private sector equity to employees receiving annual dividends of up to <unk> 500 .	-5.3724
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy speak in “ 60 minutes ” about whether FBI investigations against Kavanaugh could change their mind .	-3.2196
Following an ongoing FBI investigation into accusations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh , the final vote to appeal the judge to the Supreme Court was postponed by at least one week , and the question is raised as to whether the FBI republican Senators ’ findings might cause their support for Kavanaugh to be .	-5.9546
In a Sunday interview , Scott Pelley , a correspondent of “ 60 minutes , ” asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI ’ s findings could persuade them to change their mind .	-3.6658
Kennedy appeared more responsibly than his South Carolina colleague .	-2.2412
“ Anyway , ” Kennedy said .	-1.2850
" I said at the beginning of the hearing that I spoke with judge Kavanaugh .	-1.9226
I called him after that happened after this claim came out , I said : ' Have you done it ? '	-3.8322
He was determined , targeted , clear . '	-2.1538
However , Graham 's voice seemed cast in stone .	-2.4699
" I have an opinion about Brett Kavanaugh and it would need a bomb charge , " he said .	-2.7326
“ Dr. Ford , I don ’ t know what happened , but I know that Brett strongly disputed the accusation , ” added Graham with a hint on Christine Blasey Ford .	-5.5297
" None they called was able to confirm it .	-3.1870
It was 36 years ago .	-0.6941
I see nothing new that is changing ' .	-2.1830
'What is the Global Citizen Festival and what is it that poverty is reduced ? '	-6.3712
This Saturday , the Global Citizen Festival will take place in New York , an annual music event with an impressive selection of stars and an equally impressive mission to end world poverty .	-3.3803
At this year ’ s seventh Global Citizen Festival , tens of thousands of people will gather at the Great Lawn in Central Park to experience not only stars like Janet Jackson , Cardi B , and Shawn Mendes , but also to draw attention to the true goal of the event : to end extreme poverty by 2030 .	-4.5428
The Global Citizen Festival , which took place in 2012 , is an extension of the Global Poverty Project , an international interest group aimed at combating poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it .	-3.9693
In order to receive a free ticket for the event , the concert attendees had a whole range of tasks or " promotions " , such as volunteering , e-mail to a guide in the world , a telephone call or another meaningful opportunity to raise the target of poverty reduction and raise awareness of it .	-6.9533
But how successful has Global Citizen been to achieve his goal with 12 years left ?	-3.0423
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a real way of persuading people to call for action , or simply another case of so-called ' clicktivism ' - people who feel that they are sending a tweet by signing an online petition or an online application , as if they were making a real difference ?	-5.3561
Global Citizen says that since 2011 , it has recorded more than 19 million “ actions ” by its supporters , who have pressed for a variety of different goals .	-3.6390
It is said that these actions have motivated world leaders to make financial and political commitments worth more than $ 37 billion , which will affect the lives of more than $ 2.25 billion by 2030 .	-3.3201
In early 2018 , the Group launched 390 operations and announcements from its actions , at least $ 10 billion of which have already been paid or financed .	-3.4731
The group estimates that the funds made available have had a direct impact on almost 649 million people around the world .	-3.6690
One of the most important pledges is The Power of Nutrition , a United Kingdom based partnership of investors and executives committed to “ helping children to develop their full potential . ” The organization pledged to support Rwanda , at $ 35 million , to end malnutrition in the country , after Global Citizens have committed more than 4,700 tweets .	-6.4607
“ With the support of the British Government , donors , other governments , and global citizens like you , we can make the social injustice of undernutrition one day history , ” Tracey Ullman announced the crowd in a live concert in London in April 2018 .	-4.3568
The group also said that , following more than 5,000 actions in the United Kingdom that have led to improving maternal and child nutrition , the government will reach the funding of the Power of Nutrition project for 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions .	-5.9148
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on her website : “ Why do you think we can end extreme poverty ? ”	-2.9553
Global citizens responded : it will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will fall and fail .	-2.7595
Like the great civil law and anti-apartheid movements before us , we will succeed , because we are more powerful together .	-8.8070
The stars Janet Jackson , Weeknd , Shawn Mendes , Cardi B and Janelle Monáe will perform at this year 's New York event , moderated by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman .	-4.2556
US could use the Navy to build a “ blockade ” to impede Russian energy exports – Interior ministers	-3.3605
Washington can use its navy “ if necessary ” to prevent Russia ’ s energy from reaching markets , including in the Middle East , US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke is quoted by Washington Examiner .	-3.4612
Zinke argued that Russia ’ s involvement in Syria – especially in activities at the invitation of the legitimate government – was a pretext for exploring new energy markets .	-4.0433
“ I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is this : they want to negotiate energy , just as they do in Eastern Europe , the southern part of Europe , ” he said .	-8.0386
And according to the officials , there are ways and means to deal with them .	-3.3645
" The United States has this ability to use our navy to ensure that sea routes are open and , if necessary , block to ensure that their energy does not come onto the market , " he said .	-4.0603
Zinke spoke to the participants of an event by the Consumer Energy Alliance , a non-profit organization known as the “ voice of energy consumers ” in the US .	-3.9200
He compared Washington ’ s approaches to Russia and Iran , and noted that they are actually the same .	-2.7048
" The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less to use and replace fuels , " he said , while calling Russia a " one-trick-pony " with an economy dependent on fossil fuels .	-3.3275
These opinions come while the Trump administration was on the mission to boost exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe and to replace Russia , the far cheaper option for European consumers .	-5.0770
Members of the Trump administration – including US President Donald Trump himself – are therefore trying to force Germany to stop the “ inappropriate ” North Stream-2 Pipeline project that , according to Trump , Berlin would turn into “ prisoner . ”	-5.1327
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11-billion North Stream 2 pipeline , which is supposed to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres , is a purely economic project .	-2.8545
The Kremlin argues that Washington ’ s opposition to the project is simply driven for economic reasons and an example of unfair competition .	-2.1906
“ I believe we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers , ” said the Russian energy minister Aleksandr Novak , after a meeting with US energy minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September .	-3.7492
The US position has provoked a backlash from Germany , which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project .	-5.9576
Germany ’ s leading industrial organization , the Bundesverband Deutscher Industrien ( BDI ) , has called on the US to refrain from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow .	-3.2449
" I have a major problem when a third state intervenes in our energy supply , " said the German Federation of Industry ( BDI ) , Dieter Kempf , after a meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin .	-2.9175
Elizabeth Warren Will Take " Hard Look " At Running For President in 2020 , Massachusetts Senator Says .	-2.2049

During a Council meeting in Holyoke , Massachusetts , confirmed that it would consider running .	-2.0718
" It is time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government , and that includes a woman at the top , " she said , according to The Hill .	-2.8876
Following 6 November , I will take a serious look at the presidential candidacy .	-8.0042
Waiting during the smokescreen meeting , President Donald Trump said that ' this country is heading in the wrong direction ' .	-4.6762
" I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy , " she said .	-1.7010
Warren ’ s criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court did not mince Brett Kavanaugh .	-3.9136
Warren said in a tweet on Friday : ' Of course we need a FBI examination before we vote ' .	-2.6501
But a Thursday poll showed that a majority of Warren ’ s own voters do not believe it should run by 2020 .	-3.1412
According to a poll by Suffolk University Political Research Center / Boston Globe , 58 percent of the " probable " Massachusetts voters said that Senator should not run .	-3.9956
Thirty-two per cent supported such a course .	-1.2985
The poll showed more support for a course of the former governor Deval Patrick , with 38 % for a potential run and 48 % against .	-5.1225

Sarah Palin quotes Track Palins PTSD from Donald Trump ’ s Campaign	-2.0921
Track Palin , 26 , spent one year in Iraq after he was convened in September .	-1.5589
He was arrested and charged with an incident involving domestic violence on Monday evening .	-2.1714
“ In the light of what my own son is doing , what he is doing right now after he has returned , I can understand other families that feel the effects of PTSD and some of the injuries that our soldiers are returning to , ” she told the audience in a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa , Oklahoma .	-5.7947
Palin referred to his arrest as “ the elephant in space , ” and said about her son and other veterans : “ They come back a little bit differently ; they come back harder and wonder whether the work of her fellow soldiers and the air force and all other members of the military is respected for the country . ”	-6.4645
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla , Alaska , and charged with domestic violence against a woman , obstruction of an ad for domestic violence and possession of a weapon in an unspeakable state , said Dan Bennett , a spokesman for the police of Wasilla .	-5.3441
18 States of DC support the challenge of a new asylum policy .	-2.6298
18 states and Washington , DC support a legal challenge to a new US policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence .	-2.4655
According to NBC News , representatives from the 18 states and the district in Washington on Friday submitted an Amicus Curiae ( Friend of the Court ) to support an asylum seeker in the lawsuit .	-4.2713
The full name of the plaintiff in Grace ’ s lawsuit against sessions submitted by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the Federal Law is not known .	-4.8289
She said that her partner " and his violent sons of gang members " had abused them , but on 20 July US officials refused to apply for asylum .	-2.8865
She was arrested in Texas .	-0.9543
The state ’ s lawyers supporting Grace called El Salvador , Honduras , and Guatemala , which comprise a large number of asylum-seekers in the US , as nations facing profound problems with gangs and domestic violence .	-4.0247
The new US asylum policy has reversed a decision by the 2014 Appeals Chamber for Immigrants that allows undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum .	-3.9334
The Justice Minister of the District of Columbia Karl Racine said on Friday that the new law ignores decades of national , federal , and international law .	-3.5090
The Amicus Curiae states that , according to German law , all applications for asylum must be assessed in accordance with the circumstances of the respective complaint and such actions are in breach of this principle .	-6.4467
Lawyers continued to argue in the writing that policies refusing entry to immigrants are damaging the US economy because it is more likely that these immigrants will become entrepreneurs and do “ necessary work . ”	-4.5275
Public Prosecutor Jeff Sessions has instructed immigration magistrates in June not to grant asylum to persons fleeing home or gang counsel .	-3.9743
“ Asylum is granted to those who must leave their country for persecution on the basis of race , religion , nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political opinion , ” said Sessions in its Declaration on 11 June .	-5.3287
Asylum was never intended to alleviate all the problems , even the serious ones people face every day around the world .	-3.7945

US ambassadors challenge China “ bullying ” with “ propaganda advertising . ”	-2.4484
A week after an official Chinese newspaper sent a quadruple display in a US daily paper on the mutual benefit of US trade in China , the US ambassador to China warned that he should use the American press to spread propaganda .	-12.1184
US President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to the paid concession of China Daily in the Moines Register - the state with Iowa 's most popular newspaper - after accusing China of interfering in the US Congress elections of 6 November , which confronts China .	-6.0812
US officials claim to Reuters that Trump ’ s charge of trying to interfere in the US election is a new phase in an escalating Washington campaign to exert pressure on China .	-3.1450
While it is normal for foreign states to advertise in order to promote trade , Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an escalating trade war with several rounds of tariffs on imports .	-3.7133
In an early phase of the trade war , China ’ s retaliatory tariffs on Chinese and US experts are supposed to hit exporters in US states like Iowa , where many supporters of Trump ’ s Republican Party live .	-4.3236
Terry Branstad , US ambassadors in China and former longtime governor of Iowa , a major exporter of agricultural products to China , said that Beijing had hurt American workers , farmers , and businesses .	-3.7268
China , in an article on Sunday ’ s Moines Register , wrote Branstad , “ is now vigorously pursuing this bullying through propaganda in our own free press .	-5.3784
“ The spread of propaganda as a paid display in the Moines Register makes use of the estimated American tradition of freedom of expression and freedom of the press , ” Branstad wrote .	-5.0333
" By contrast , at the Beijing newsstand , you will find only limited dissent , and you will not see a real reversal of different views that the Chinese people could have on China ’ s disturbing economic performance , given that the media are firmly in the grip of the Chinese Communist Party , ” he wrote .	-6.9575
He added that ' one of China 's most prominent newspapers was opposed to the publication offer ' , although he did not say what newspaper .	-3.7769
The Republicans gray up with the Kavanaugh debacle voters before the midterm elections , warn analysts .	-3.5599
Many of the top Republicans defended Brett Kavanaugh , a nominee elected to the Supreme Court , even though he was accused of sexual assault , warning analysts that they will see a counterstrike in the forthcoming elections , especially by women .	-4.8129
The emotions were high , most Republicans have already said they want to vote for him .	-2.7021
These things cannot be traced back , Grant Resooner , professor of political science at Syracuse University ’ s Maxwell School , said on Saturday in an article published by The Hill .	-4.0355
Reader said that he doubts that last-minute support from Jeff Flake ( Republican MEP for the state of Arizona ) is sufficient to reconcile angry voters .	-5.5591
“ Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow , nor in November , ” said Karine Jean-Pierre , senior consultant , and national speaker for the progressive MoveOn Group on Friday , as a Washington newspaper reported .	-3.9863
On Friday morning , demonstrators sang : “ November comes ! ” while demonstrating in the corridor of the Senate , when the Republicans who control the Justice Committee decided to join Kavanaugh ’ s nomination despite Dr continued Christine Blasey Ford , reports Mic .	-5.5476
“ Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be immeasurable , ” said Stu Rothenberg , an impartial political analyst , journalists .	-1.7029
“ People say that it is quite far advanced , that is true .	-3.1811
But the figure could be higher , especially in the suburbs and younger voters , 18-29 year-olds , who may not suffer the president , but often do not vote . ”	-10.4963
Even before Ford ’ s official statement , in which she spurred her charges of sexual violence against the Supreme Court candidate , analysts pointed out that a backlash might follow if Republicans drive the candidacy .	-5.3436
“ For the GOP , this has become a mess , ” says Michael Steele , former president of the Republican National Committee , at the beginning of last week , according to NBC news .	-11.6006
“ It is not simply a matter of the choice of committee or the final choice , or whether Kavanaugh will be placed on the replacement bank , it is a matter of how the Republicans handled it and how they dealt with it , ” Guy Cecil , director of US priorities , informed the news officer of a group that helps the Democrats choose .	-8.3494
But Americans are divided about Ford and Kavanaugh ’ s statements .	-2.4118
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 % of respondents said Ford ’ s testimony was definitively or probably believed , while 35 % indicated that they believed definitively or probably Kavanaugh .	-4.4769
Moreover , 38 % said that they thought Kavanaugh had probably or definitely lied during his statement , while only 30 % said the same about Ford .	-2.6352
On the Flake initiative , the FBI is currently investigating the allegations of Ford and of at least one other prosecutor , Deborah Ramirez , reported The Guardian .	-3.2668
Ford told the Senate Justice Committee last week that Kavanaugh had attacked them at the age of 17 .	-2.9722
Ramirez accuses the nominee , the highest judge , of having released his genitals before her at a party during her study time in Yale in the 1980s .	-5.8028
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning a new Internet to challenge Google and Facebook .	-2.2751
Tim Berners-Lee , the inventor of the Internet , is the foundation of a startup company that is to compete with Facebook , Amazon , and Google .	-3.8352
The current project of the technology legend , Inrupt , is a company that builds on the open source platform Solid by Berners-Lee .	-3.3615

Bernard Vann : Victoria-Kreuz clerics from World War I are honored .	-3.1361
The only priest of the Church of England who received a Victorian Reuz as a fighter during the First World War was celebrated 100 years later in his hometown .	-4.9967
The Oberstleutant and Reverend Bernard Vann earned the award on September 29 , 1918 in the attack in Belleglise and Lehacourt .	-5.4199

Desert Island Discs : Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality .	-1.8554
The Olympic diver Tom Daley says that he grew up with the feeling that due to his sexuality everyone is undergoing - but that gave him the motivation to be a success .	-5.3242
The 24-year-old said that he had only become aware of the secondary school that “ not everyone is like me . ”	-3.6094
In the first issue of Desert Island Discs at Radio 4 presented by Lauren Laverne , he said he spoke publicly about the rights of homosexuals to give other “ hope . ”	-3.5063
He also said that a victory at the Olympic Games after the birth of his first child would have become less important to him .	-2.3454
The regular presentations of the long-running show Kristy Young have been released several months as a result of illness .	-3.9524
Daley joined Laverns ’ first program , saying that he felt that he was “ less worth ” than the other because “ it was not accepted by society to stand on men and women . ”	-4.9631
He said , “ To this day , these feelings of the Weniger set and the otherness gave me strength and strength , I needed you to be successful . ”	-5.3873
He wanted to prove that he was “ something , ” he said , in order not to disappoint anyone when he made his sexual orientation .	-4.0490
The two-time bronze medal winner has become a high-calibre LGBT activist , using his presence at this year ’ s Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to de-criminalize homosexuality .	-12.8296

The couple was parents of a son named Robert Ray Black Daley in June , and Daley said his " whole perspective " has changed .	-3.0959
“ Last year , everything revolved around me winning a gold medal , ” he said .	-2.7213
“ But you know what , there are more important things than Olympic gold .	-2.6891
My gold medal is Robbie . ”	-0.8499
His son bears the name of his father Robert , who died in 2011 at only 40 years after a cancer diagnosis .	-2.4172
Daley said that his father did not accept that he would die , and one of the last things he had asked was whether they had their tickets in London 2012 - because he wanted to be in the first row .	-2.9718
“ I could not say to him : <unk> You will no longer experience sitting in the first row , Dad <unk> , ” he said .	-3.7912

The formal Mickelson sat at the Bank on Ryder Cup Saturday .	-2.8844
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game , but he must drastically improve his form so that no sad milestone can be made .	-4.4205
Mickelson , who played for the 12th time at the event that takes place every two years , was put on the bank by Captain Jim Furyk for the football and Foursomes on Saturday .	-11.6471
Instead , as is often the case for the US , the fifth major winner split up his day between the champions and the exercise rounds on the golf course , hoping to overcome his bottom .	-7.0874
The 48-year-old , even at the peak of his career , is never the most straight driver and is not suitable for the narrow Le Golf National Square , where the long Rough regularly punishes failures .	-4.6638
In the ninth match on Sunday , Mickelson meets the British Open Champion Francesco Molinari , who won all four matches this week together with Neuling Tommy Fleetwood .	-4.7446
If Americans get four points behind and get a hot start , Mickelson ’ s match could be absolutely decisive .	-4.9720
Furyk expressed his trust in his man ; what else was left to him .	-3.6583
" He fully understood the role he had today , gave me a clap and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow , " said Furyk .	-3.8557
" He has a lot of self-confidence .	-2.0324
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has done so much for these teams in the past , and this week .	-2.3154
Probably I would not have thought he was playing two games .	-1.8433
I had hoped for more , but it was the result and that is the way in which we felt we had to tackle it .	-5.8132
He wants to be out there , just like everyone else .	-1.2744
So far Nick Faldo is holding the record for most played matches at the Ryder Cup , which will break Mickelson on Sunday .	-4.8587
This could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never really adapted to the heights of its individual record .	-3.7933
The team won 18 times , lost 20 times and played seven times indecisive , but Furyk said that his presence would have been invaluable to the team .	-6.6185
" He is funny , he is sarcastic , funny , he loves to entertain people , and he is a great guy he can have in the team room , " he explained .	-3.6695
I think younger players also had fun measuring with him this week . ”	-3.8600

In 1997 , the Dane debuted in Valderrama , where a team trained by Seven Ballesteros had a ahead of five points against the Americans , but only barely reached the target line and won a sharp margin of 14 <unk> to 13 <unk> .	-6.7838
" It is worth remembering that we were in the lead in Valderrama ; we had a great lead in Brookline where we lost , and in Valderrama we won , but only in a small way , " said Bjorn , after he saw the class of 2018 , now at the top of 10-6 in the Le Golf National , Friday and yesterday at a 5-3 victory .	-7.8931

It is not over when the points are displayed on the table .	-2.9270
Our goal is to win this cup , and we focus on that .	-3.8439
I have always said that I firmly believe in the 12 players in our team , but we are dealing with a strong opponent , the best players in the world . ”	-3.0356
As his players played on a hard golf course , Björn added : " I would never be too fast .	-4.8603
Tomorrow is also another day .	-1.5364
Tomorrow are the personal performances , and that is another thing .	-2.6754
It ’ s great to be outside with a partner when things go well , but if you are out there alone , your skills as golfers are tested for the whole .	-5.3032
This is the message you must convey to the players : Get the best out of it tomorrow .	-3.8212
Now you ’ ll get over to your partner and need to make full use of it . ”	-5.5584
Unlike Björn , the opposing player , Jim Furyk , will seek to make players better off performing on their own than they do as partners , with the exception of Jordan Spith and Justin Thomas , who scored three out of four points . the on . on the . on , on , on , on , on	-14.3911
Furyk himself has already experienced such a sensational turn on the final day , when he was part of the winning team in Brookline , now he is one of the losers after the European team completed the “ miracle of Medinah . ”	-5.7400
" I remember every word that was said , " he said how Ben Crenshaw , the captain of 1999 , had gathered his players on the way to the last day .	-4.7127
We have 12 important games tomorrow , but we want to get started as soon as possible , as we saw in Brookline , in Medinah .	-4.3938

Renewing the timetable for Germany ’ s New Warship	-2.7959
According to reports of local media , however , it will take at least until next year .	-6.3028
The commissioning of the “ Rhineland-Palatinate ” , the flagship of the brand new fregates of the Baden-Württemberg class , has now been postponed to the first half of 2019 , according to the newspaper “ Die Zeit ” , invoking a military speaker .	-9.9553
The Navy should have started vessels in 2014 , but serious problems after the first delivery put the ambitious project under strain .	-5.1498
The four naval Fregatten of the Baden-Württemberg class ordered in 2007 will replace the older ships of the Bremen class .	-3.4917
It is assumed that they have a powerful canon , a range of flight defence and ship defence missiles , and some stealth-technology , such as reduced radar , infrared and acoustic signatures .	-5.3155
A further important advantage is the longer maintenance intervals : the latest ferments are scheduled to be used for up to two years without entering the port . the is .	-7.6344
However , the ultra-modern warships that are supposed to allow Germany to oversea power will already be obsolete by the constant delays when they are finally put to service , as the weekly ‘ Time ’ notes .	-7.1293
The unfortunate F125-Fregatte caught headlines last year when the German navy officially refused to take the ship into operation and returned it to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg .	-4.7887
This was the first time that the navy returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery .	-3.1263
Little was known about the reasons for the ship 's return ; German media mentioned a series of critical “ software and hardware issues ” that would make the warship useless in combat operations .	-5.6825
Software-deficiencies were particularly important since the ships of the Baden-Württemberg class are served by a crew of around 120 seafarers - only half of the crew on the older fregates of the Bremen class .	-5.2272
It was also discovered that the ship had a substantial overweight , limiting the performance and making it difficult for the navy to upgrade in the future .	-6.9978
It is assumed that the 7,000-ton “ Rhineland-Palatinate ” is twice as difficult as ships of the same class used by the Germans in World War II .	-2.9934
In addition to faulty hardware , the whole project 's price tag - including crew training - is also included in the topic .	-5.7271
Instead of the € 2.2 billion originally proposed , the costs now seem to have reached the dizzying figure of € 3.1 billion ( about $ 3.6 billion ) .	-4.1136
The problems of the latest frigattes are particularly important in light of recent warnings that Germany ’ s naval power is diminishing .	-5.4763
Earlier this year , Hans-Peter Bartels , Chairman of the German Parliament ’ s Defence Committee , admitted that the fleet actually “ would go out of the operational vessels . ”	-5.2213
The official said that the problem had grown avalanche over time , as old ships were put out of service without any replacement .	-5.0613
He complained that none of the Württemberg rains were put in service by the navy .	-3.5468
The National Trust leaves the secret life of bats .	-2.9665
New research into a property in the Highlands of Scotland attempts to find out how bats use the landscape to search for food .	-4.1600
It hopes that it will provide new insights into the behaviour of unique flying mammals that can provide guidance for future animal protection measures .	-5.2877
The study by scientists of the National Trust for Scotland will be followed by common and soprano Ppirollen as well as brown long and permanent empires in the Inverewwe Gardens in Wester Ross .	-6.2350
Special recording equipment is placed at the main points of the accommodation to track spot masonry activities throughout the season .	-6.0222
NHS employees and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys with handdetectors .	-3.5756
A sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the call for batches and allow for the types .	-7.0656
The habitat card to be created and the report to be submitted should provide a detailed overview of the behavior .	-4.6522
Rob Dewar , National Trust for Scotland ( NTS ) environmental adviser , hopes to find out which areas of life are most important for bats and how they are used by species .	-3.0299
This information will help to ascertain the benefits of habitat retention , how to best preserve meadow formation and forests for bats and other related species .	-4.6228
Fleathermasonry opulations in Scotland and the whole of Britain have fallen sharply over the last hundred years .	-5.5758
They are threatened by building work that affects their sleeping places and the loss of habitat .	-2.8868
Wind power plants and lighting may also present a risk , as well as fly cats and some chemical treatment of building materials .	-5.7346
Bats are not actually blind .	-1.3642
Adapted to their nocturnal hunting activities , ears are more useful than eyes .	-4.5008
They use sophisticated echo-location technology to identify flaws and obstacles in their journey .	-4.4660
The NTS , responsible for maintaining more than 270 historical buildings , 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country , takes the bats very seriously .	-3.1536
There are ten trained experts who regularly carry out surveys , inspect sleeping places and sometimes also perform rescue operations .	-4.0665
The organization has even set up Scotland ’ s first and only dedicated Fledermaus-Reserve in the Threade-estate in Dumfries and Galloway , which is home to eight of the ten Scottish Fledermaussarts .	-5.8336
According to Manager David Thompson , the property is an ideal habitat for you :	-2.8494
“ Here in Threave we have a great space for bats . ”	-2.9312
" We have the old buildings , many old trees and all the good habitat .	-2.5233
But there is much more to know about bats and the work we do here and on other land helps us understand better what they need to live . ”	-4.8229
He stresses that it is important to check whether bats are there before maintenance works in buildings ; according to him , it is possible that , in the accidental destruction of a single sleeping place , up to 400 females and juveniles may occur – an entire local population may be eliminated .	-7.3713
Bats are protected ; it is forbidden to kill , harass or disturb them and to destroy their sleeping places .	-2.8631
Elisabeth Ferrell , the Scottish member of the Bat Conservation Trust , has encouraged the public to help .	-2.0011
She said : “ We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we simply do not know how their populations are . ”	-3.0113
Ronaldo dismissed rape claims when lawyers sue the German magazine .	-2.2677
Cristiano Ronaldo has branded rape claims against him as " fake news " and claims that people " want to promote themselves " by using his name .	-2.5625
His lawyers will sue the German magazine “ Der Spiegel ” , which published the allegations .	-2.2682
The stormer from Portugal and Juventus was accused of having raped an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009 .	-3.1176
The mirror reported on Friday that he would have paid her $ 375,000 to keep quiet about the incident .	-4.2787
Hours after the allegations were reported , Ronaldo rejected 33 in an instant live video to his 142 million followers the reports as “ fake news . ”	-3.4759
No , no , no , no .	-0.7835
What they say today , fake news , ” said the five-time balloon D 'Or winner .	-2.8726
“ You want to apply for yourself by using my name .	-2.2028
“ That is normal .	-1.2060
They want to draw attention to themselves when they say my name , but it is part of the job .	-2.2858
I am a happy person , and everything is good , ” added the player smiling .	-13.8511
Ronaldo ’ s lawyers are making a complaint against the magazine “ Der Spiegel ” because of the allegations ; according to Reuters , you spoke of “ inadmissible coverage of suspicions in the privacy field . ”	-5.7026
Lawyers Christian Schertz said that the player will claim damages for “ immaterial damage equal to the gravity of injury , which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years . ”	-4.4088
The alleged incident should have occurred in June 2009 in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas .	-2.6246
According to documents submitted to the Clark County District Court in Nevada , Ronaldo and Mayorga withdrew to the player 's room after learning how to get to know them in a nightclub where he raped her .	-7.0267
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo was knocked after the alleged incident , saying that he was “ 99 % ” a “ good guy ” that was abandoned by “ one percent ” .	-4.7565
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex , but it was consensual .	-2.3712
Mayorga also claims that she had gone to the police and made photographs of her injuries in a hospital , but later agreed to extrajudicial settlement because she had ' fear of retaliation ' and was concerned about ' being publicly humiliated ' .	-5.3801
The 34-year-old says that she is now trying to invalidate the agreement , as it continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident .	-3.7757
Ronaldo was about to change to Real Madrid by Manchester United at the time of alleged attack and switched to the Italian giant juve this summer with a 100-million-euro deal .	-4.7741
Brexit : Britain would forever regret losing car manufacturers	-2.3422
“ The UK would regret its time life if , after Brexit , it lost its position as the world ’ s leading car manufacturer , ” said Economist Greg Clark .	-4.1494
He added that it is ' worrying ' that Toyota UK told the BBC that they would temporarily halt production at their plant in Burnaston , close to Derby , if Great Britain left the EU without a deal .	-3.9623
“ We need an agreement , ” Clark said .	-1.2535
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of delays at the borders in the case of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs .	-3.3395
The Burnaston plant , which produces Auris and Avensis for Toyota , produced almost 150,000 cars last year , 90 % of which were exported to the rest of the European Union .	-3.3164
“ If the UK leaves the EU at the end of March without an agreement , I think it will come to a production ban at our plant , ” said Marvin Cooke , CEO at Toyota in Burnaston .	-5.4670
Other British car manufacturers have expressed fears of leaving the EU without agreement on the arrangements for cross-border trade , including Honda , BMW and Jaguar Land Rover .	-2.8708
For example , BMW has already announced that it will close its work in Oxford for one month after Brexit .	-3.0026
The most important concerns relate to what car manufacturers say about the risks of the supply chain in the case of ' no deal Brexit ' .	-3.8160
Toyota 's production facilities are based on production based on demand , which means that parts are delivered every 37 minutes by suppliers from the United Kingdom and the EU for special products .	-5.7667
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without an agreement , there may be delays on the border which , according to industry indications , may lead to delivery shortages and partial shortages .	-3.8983
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day of stock at his factory in Derbyshire , said the company , and so production would be stopped .	-3.4226
Mr Clark said that Theresa May ’ s Chequers plan for future relations with the EU was “ calibrated precisely to avoid such border controls . ”	-6.7150
We need to have a deal , we want the best deal that not only allows us to succeed today , we also want to seize this opportunity , ” he said today at BBC Radio 4 .	-5.2405
“ The reference not only of Toyota but also of other manufacturers is that we must be able to continue with what has become a very successful series of supply chains . ”	-4.7483
Toyota gave no indication of how long the production stop could last , but warned that the increase in costs would , in the long term , cause factory competitiveness and eventually lose jobs .	-6.3394
Peter Tsouvallaris , trade union representatives , and in Burnaston for 24 years , said that trade union members are increasingly concerned : “ My experience is that once they have been dismantled , jobs are lost forever . ”	-4.5982
A spokesman said : ' We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU ' .	-3.5856
The Trump meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again , according to the White House .	-3.0947
Donald Trump ’ s top-class meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could “ be postponed another week , ” as the fight for the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues , the White House was announced on Sunday .	-4.4210
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Advisor Robert Mueller , who examines Russia ’ s electoral interventions , links between Trump and Russia , and the president ’ s possible obstruction of justice .	-4.6065
Whether Trump will or not fire the Deputy Attorney General , and thus jeopardize Muller ’ s independence , Washington has acquired a long track for months .	-5.6468
Earlier this month , the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed wearing a cable to record talks with Trump and make it possible to remove the president from the 25th Amendment .	-3.1430
Rosenstein refused an opinion .	-1.2693
But last Monday he went to the White House , while reports hailed that he was about to resign .	-9.0142
Instead , a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday at the United Nations in New York .	-1.6129
Trump said he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein , but the session was delayed to avoid a clash with the Senate ’ s hearing of the Senate ’ s Justice Committee , in which Kavanaugh and one of the women , Dr. Christine Blasey Ford , accused him of sexual misconduct .	-5.0966
On Friday , Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of the claims against Kavanaugh and continued to delay a full Senate note .	-3.7313
Donald Trump ’ s press speaker Sarah Sanders was on Fox News on Sunday .	-2.0402
After the Rosenstein meeting asked , she said , " A date has not yet been set , it could be this week , I could see that I go back another week , given all the other things that are going on with the Supreme Court .	-4.5928
But we will see and I always keep the press informed ' .	-2.8907
Some reporters would challenge this claim : Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10 .	-2.2219
The guest Chris Wallace asked why .	-0.9828
Sanders said that the lack of briefings was not due to a reluctance to television reporters who behave as self-performers , but she also said : ' I will not oppose them being in the gallery ' .	-6.1170
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase .	-1.9570
'The President carries out more questions and answers than any president before him ' , she said and added , without any evidence : ' We have looked at these figures ' .	-5.1282
While briefing is still going to take place , Sanders said , the press should have the opportunity to put questions directly to the President of the United States , that is infinitely better than talking to him .	-5.4193
We are trying to do a lot of that , and you have seen how we have done this in recent weeks , and it will replace a press discussion if you can talk to the President of the United States himself . ”	-4.2906
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or takes part in public meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries .	-2.3168
Press conferences with one person are rare .	-0.8270
In New York , the president perhaps demonstrated this week why , by making a freelance , sometimes bizarre , appearance before assembled reporters .	-7.6297

Scottish parliamentarians Jane Freeman wrote their letter less than 6 months before Britain left .	-9.5525
The Scottish Government has agreed to cover the cost of the agreed status applications for EU citizens working in its decentralised public service .	-3.8670
In her letter , Mrs Freeman wrote : “ In the course of the summer , negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on exit were continued , with expected decisions in the autumn .	-4.4395
But the UK Government has also stepped up its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario .	-6.0121
I know that this must be a very worrying time for you all .	-2.1380
That is why I wanted to repeat now how much I would value the contribution of each staff , regardless of their nationality .	-7.4122
Colleagues across the EU and beyond bring with them valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve our health care system and benefit the patients and communities that we provide .	-5.4416
Scotland is definitely your home and we want it to stay . ”	-2.2917

Foreign buyers will charge a higher tax rate when buying property in the UK - the extra money will be used for homeless , Teresa May today announced .	-4.6680
This move is seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn ’ s success , attract young voters with promises , offer more affordable housing , and seek high incomes .	-2.8232
The tax will be levied on people and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK , and the extra money will help the government to combat homelessness .	-4.2800

Jack Ross : “ My ultimate goal is to manage Scotland . ”	-0.8806
Jack Ross , currently manager of Sunderland , says his “ ultimate goal ” is to become Scottish manager at some point .	-3.2599
The Scot , 42 , enjoys the challenge of bringing the North East Club up again .	-5.0506
He moved to the stadium of Light this summer , having led St Mirren back to the first Scottish league last season .	-3.5454
“ I wanted to play as a player for my country . ”	-2.1676
I got a B-cap and that was ' s ' , said Ross to BBC Scotland 's sports sound .	-3.3555
" But I have often observed Scotland in Hampden with my father as a child , and it is always something that brought me back .	-2.6007
" But this opportunity would only come if I succeed in club management . "	-3.7161
Before Ross were Dick Advocate , David Moyes , Sam Allardyce , Martin O 'Neill , Roy Keane , Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio Manager from Sunderland .	-2.0373
The former manager of Alloa Athletic says he was not afraid to join the footsteps of these established managers in such a big club , and he had already rejected offers by Barnsley and Ipswich Town .	-4.9581
" The success for me is currently defined by the question " Can I return this club to the Premier League ? "	-6.9704
With its structure and facilities , this club undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League , ” he said .	-2.7780
" To make it there is no easy task , but I would probably only see it successful if I can return the club to it . "	-5.7880
Ross is only three years in his management career , after a time as co-coach at Dumbarton and a 15-month spell for Hearts ' coaching staff .	-3.3050
He then helped Alloa recover from the release into the third class , and gave St. Mirren a master title from the margins of the release during the following season .	-4.1692
Ross also says that during his career at Clyde , Hartlpool , Falkirk , St Mirren , and Hamilton Academical he never felt as well as he did now .	-4.9175
" It was probably a real crossroads , " he recalled when he assumed the direction of Alloa .	-3.3754
“ I really thought that the position as manager is right for me , more than that of a player .	-2.3003

The heat wave in the summer has increased the revenue for British pubs that were hit , but has increased pressure on the restaurant chains .	-5.2476
A sales plus of 2.7 percent in July - revenue in restaurants decreased 4.8 percent , according to the figures .	-5.1992
Peter Martin , from the CGA management consultancy , which compiled the figures , said : " The solar sunlight and England were getting longer than expected participation in the World Cup , so July followed a similar pattern as in June last month , when the pub search increased by 2.8 percent , only the restaurants were more affected .	-8.3381
The 1.8 % decline in catering business in June was only exacerbated in July .	-3.6346
Pubs and bars dominated by drinks were by far the strongest , with Like-for-Like numbers rising more than restaurants fell .	-5.7425
Even the pubs dominated by food suffered under the sun , albeit not as dramatic as the restaurant operators .	-3.7693
It seems that people just wanted to start with a drink .	-4.6047
In the pubs and bars managed , drinks sales rose 6.6 % this month , while food fell by 3 % . '	-4.4439
Paul Newman , an RSS analyst in the field of leisure and catering , said : " These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April .	-3.4059
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the greatest factors when it comes to sales in the off-house market .	-3.3529
It is not surprising that restaurant groups remain under pressure , although a 4.8 % decline in sales will be particularly painful next to continuing cost pressure .	-4.7863
The long hot summer could not have come at any worse time for food operators , and the time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will provide much-needed pause .	-5.2192

Milk pumping that compares mothers to cows led to controversial online discussions .	-3.0397
A dairy pumping company has caused controversial online discussions because of an advertisement comparing breastfeeding mothers to melt cows .	-4.7593
On the occasion of the market launch of the supposedly ' world 's first noiseless and portable milk pump ' , the consumer tech company Elvie published an ironic advertising inspired by music videos to show what freedoms mothers are offered with this new pump .	-4.5102
Four real mothers dance in a hypocrisy surrounded by cows to a number with the following song text : " Yes , I melt me , but you see no cock " and " If you did not notice that there are no eurs , they are my breasts " .	-5.3508
The slogan goes on : ' Pump off , pump off , I feed babies , pump off , pump off , pump off , I melt my Ladies ' .	-2.9576
However , the advertisement published on the Facebook page of the company created controversy online .	-3.7018
With 77,000 calls and hundreds of comments , the video has received mixed reactions from viewers , many of whom say that it highlights the ' horrors ' of the dairy industry .	-3.6248
'It is a very bad decision to advertise cows for this product ' .	-2.1077
Like we must also become pregnant and give birth to produce milk , except that their babies are taken away within a few days of birth , " wrote a person .	-3.7477
The Elvie Milky Pump fits inexorably into a Still Bird ( Elvie / Mother ) .	-4.6936
Another commented : ' understandably traumatic for mother and baby .	-1.7609
But why not advertise with them for a milk pump for mothers who can keep their babies ?	-2.6682
Someone else added : ' External laterwork ' .	-3.0585
Others defended advertising , including a woman who confessed that she found the song “ Urkomisch ” .	-4.0756
I think that is a great idea .	-1.1589
I would have been able to get one if I had allowed one .	-5.0627
I felt like a cow through the pumps .	-3.2439
The ad is a bit crazy , but I took it as what it was .	-2.3171
This is a brilliant product , " wrote a person .	-1.6785
Another commented : ' This is a funny advertisement for mothers who feel pumped ( often at their jobs or toilets ) and like ' cows ' .	-4.5492
This is not an advertisement praising or assessing the dairy industry ' .	-2.8976
At the end of the video , the group of women reveals that they have all danced with the decent pumps in their BHS .	-4.1272
The campaign ’ s concept is based on the recognition that many women who pump milk say they feel like cows .	-2.6292
However , the Elvie Pump is completely noiseless , has no wires or hoses and fits unrelentlessly into a still bra , giving women the freedom to move , to keep their babies and even to go out in the pumping . .	-12.1052
Ana Balarin , Partner , and ECD commented on Mother : " The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that deserves a bold and provocative market launch .	-2.5941
By striking a parallel between the expression of women and dairy cows , we wanted to focus on breast pumps and all its challenges , while at the same time demonstrating , in an entertaining and comparable way , the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring .	-4.9675
This is not the first time that the Elvie pump comes into the headlines .	-2.2389

Hundreds of migrant children moved quietly into a tent camp on the border with Texas .	-2.7515
The number of immigrant children arrested increased even though the monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged , partly because the Trump administration ’ s hard rhetoric and policies made it more difficult to find sponsors for children .	-4.5005
Traditionally , most sponsors have been self-undocumented immigrants , fearing that they risk being expelled when they fight for a child .	-3.7854
The risk was heightened in June , when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their budgets would have to give fingerprints and that the data would be passed on to immigration authorities .	-11.9424
Last week , Matthew Albience , a senior official within the Agency for Immigration and Customs Enforcement , testified to the Congress that the Agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to support unaccompanied minors .	-4.0858
The Agency later confirmed that 70 % of those arrested had no previous criminal records .	-2.2489
" Almost 80 % of people who are either sponsors or budget members of sponsors are illegal here in the country , and a large proportion of them are criminal offenders .	-3.4497
" So we follow these people further , " Albince said .	-4.4265
In an attempt to speed up the processing of children ’ s applications , officials introduced new rules that some of them demand to appear in court within a month of detention , rather than 60 days of what was the previous standard , according to accommodation staff .	-6.9779
Many people will appear not personally , but via a video telephone conference to call for a legal status at an immigration judge .	-4.6210
Those who are not eligible for discharge will be deported quickly .	-2.9526
The longer children remain in prison , the more likely it is that they will be scared or depressed , leading to violent outbreaks or escape attempts .	-3.2763
Proponents have said that these concerns are exacerbated in a larger institution such as Tornillo , where signs that a child is struggling are rather overlooked because of its size .	-5.5064
They added that moving children into the town without having enough time to emotionally prepare them or leave friends could worsen a trauma that many are already struggling with .	-4.4628
Syria calls on US , French , and Turkish “ occupying forces ” to withdraw immediately .	-1.5428
Foreign Secretary Walid al-Moueländer also called on Syrian refugees to return home before the UN General Assembly , even though the country ’ s war has been going on for eight years .	-4.3664
Mouem , who is also Deputy Prime Minister , said that under the pretext of combating terrorism , the foreign forces are illegal on Syrian soil , and “ they will deal with it accordingly . ”	-5.1533
“ You must immediately withdraw unconditionally , ” he said to the Assembly .	-2.0958
Mouem argued starkly that Syria ’ s “ war on terror is almost over . ” More than 360,000 people have died since 2011 , and millions more have been driven out of their homes .	-4.5726
He said that Damascus will continue to fight “ this holy battle until we have freed all Syrian territories from both terrorist groups and “ any illegal foreign presence . ”	-2.6343
The US has roughly 2,000 soldiers in Syria ; mostly train and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad .	-3.3210
France has over 1,000 ground soldiers in the war-torn country .	-2.5722
On the question of refugees , Moualer said that the conditions for return were fine , and he accused “ some Western countries of irrational fears , ” leading refugees to stay away .	-5.1211
“ We called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate the return , ” Moualer said .	-3.8638
“ You politicize a really humanitarian question . ”	-2.5449
The US and the European Union pointed out that there could only be reconstruction aid for Syria if there was a political agreement between Assad and the opposition over an end to the war .	-3.9244
UN diplomats said that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold , Idlib , creates the opportunity to advance political talks .	-3.7933
The Russian-Turkish deal prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian troops on the province where three million people live .	-3.3642
However , Moucaler stressed that the agreement stipulates “ clear deadlines ” , which he hopes will be directed against jihadists , including al-Qaeda fighters , who will be “ wiped out . ”	-7.8729
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee of members of government and opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections .	-2.9864
Mouilten called terms for the participation of the Syrian Government in the committee : he said that the committee ’ s work should be limited to “ reviewing the articles from the current constitution , ” and warned against interference .	-5.5961

External money is flowing into the tightest race of midterm elections to the House of Commons	-3.7569
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania 17 is experiencing a flood of cash thanks to a rebuilding of a congressional district that reached two incumbents in a race for the same seat .	-4.4098
For this new district in the suburb of Pittsburg , the Democratic Conor Lamb – who won a seat in another district in a special election last spring .	-3.0397
Lamb is opposed to another incumbent , Republicans Keith Rothfus , who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania , which clearly overlaps with the new 17th .	-3.8741
The maps were redesigned after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally manipulated in the sense of the Republicans .	-4.0032
The race in the new 17th has triggered an effective campaign finance exchange between the major party funding groups , the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee ( DCC ) and the National Republican Campaign Committee ( NRCC ) .	-5.5068
Lamb was a well-known name in Pennsylvania after winning special elections in Pennsylvania in March for the 18th Congress district in Pennsylvania with great victory .	-3.5419
This seat has been in Republican hands for more than ten years , and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points ahead .	-3.8688

But sanctions were only being considered against El Salvador , which received an estimated $ 140 million in US aid in 2017 , including narcotics controls , development , and economic support .	-3.8271
The proposed sanctions , such as the reduction of financial aid and targeted visa restrictions , would have been painful for the country in Central America , with its high unemployment rate and high murder rate .	-4.1594
During the internal meetings , North American and Central American officials postpone a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to pursue a similar meeting last year that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from entering the United States .	-3.5514
But by mid-September , top officials made it clear that they wanted to continue the conference to effectively end the examination of sanctions against El Salvador .	-3.1007
The intention now is for Vice-President Mike Pence to address the conference scheduled for mid-October to signal the importance the Assembly ’ s government attaches , and to indicate diplomats .	-5.1998

Graham Dorrans of Rangers is optimistic about the match with Rapid Vienna .	-3.1534
The rangers are the host for Rapid Vienna on Thursday , knowing that the victory over the Austrians , following the impressive level in Spain against Villarreal at the beginning of this month , puts them in a strong position to qualify from Group G for the Euroleague .	-4.9326
A knee injury prevented middle field players Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance in the season up to the 2 : 2 draw against Villarreal , but he believes that the rangers can use this result as a springboard for larger things .	-4.6851
“ This was a good point for us , because Villarreal is a capable team , ” said the 31-year-old .	-2.5783

“ It is very amusing – now that we know about Paddington ’ s great success . ”	-1.8874
She said that her father , who had previously worked as BBC cameraman , was inspired to write a children ’ s book of a small toy bear , would have remained optimistic if his work had been rejected , adding that the 60th anniversary of the book publication was “ bitter sweetness ” after his death last year .	-4.8803

FBI inquiries have begun , and Brett Kavanaugh ’ s future is at stake .	-3.0646
“ I thought that if we could really get something like what he was asking for - an investigation that is limited in time and scale - we could perhaps reach a little agreement , ” Mr Flake said on Saturday , and added that he was afraid that the committee will “ fall apart in the midst of a deep-rooted party political blockade . ”	-7.3902

Their reluctance is simply due to the timing .	-2.0609

Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953 .	-7.8899
Most are fleeing China , which has the longest border with North Korea , which is easier to cross than the strictly guarded demilitarized zone between North and South Korea .	-2.4744

He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in committee and called the accusations against him a “ grotesque and coordinated campaign of suicide ” organised by liberals who are angry that Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election .	-4.4534
Pelosi said that she believed that Kavanaugh ’ s statement was that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because he showed that he was prejudicial to democrats .	-4.1969
“ I believe that he himself disqualifies with such statements and the way in which he can be influenced by the Clinton and Democrats , ” she said .	-3.2866
When asked whether , in the event of confirmation and a democratic majority in the House of Representatives , she would seek an amt-raising procedure against Kavanaugh , Pelosi was hesitant .	-4.7927

Kavanaugh is currently District Judge in D.C. Voting Court .	-2.6009
Pelosi added that , as a democrat , she is worried about possible Kavanaugh rulings against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v.	-7.3465
In its deliberations , Kavanaugh dismissed questions as to whether he would overlap certain decisions of the Supreme Court .	-5.4415

She continued : “ I once helped a woman in the executive , who told me that she was also crying when she was angry , but she developed a technique where she every time she was angry and started to cry , to the person with whom she spoke , “ They like to think that I am sad because I am crying .	-6.5362

It was a lost battle .	-1.3062
She found that some of her followers who gave $ 1,000 to men would only give it $ 250 .	-2.9655
“ Do you think I get the lead ? ” she wondered .	-4.9905
When she gave her speech and announced that she would not launch a formal campaign , she was so overwhelmed by emotions - gratitude for the people who supported her , frustration with the system that made it so difficult to collect money and address voters instead of delegates , and anger over sexism - that she was stifled .	-4.5189

How the Trade War between China and the US could be beneficial to Beijing	-3.3633
The opening salves of the trade war between the US and China have been outrageous and no end to the conflict is in sight ; a gap between the two countries can be beneficial to Beijing in the long term , say experts .	-6.0451

China responds with a backlash at every stroke in the US , and it is unlikely that the world ’ s second-largest economy will default in the near future .	-4.5790
Putting Washington in order would mean giving in to the demands , but bowing publicly to the United States would be far too flabel for Xi Jinping , the president of China .	-5.7478
However , if Beijing uses its opportunities correctly , the trade war with the US can have a positive effect on China in the long term by lowering the interdependence of the two economies , experts say .	-5.0625
“ The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing can create the conditions for economic turbulence in one of the two countries is far more dangerous than was previously assumed by observers , ” said Abigail Grace , scientific collaborator at the Center for New American Security , a think tank with Asia focus .	-5.0034
