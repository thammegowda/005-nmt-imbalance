Munich 1856 : Four maps that change your view of the city .	-2.7814
It is an irren garden where young people are to meet today .	-5.8318
A hip band now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel .	-3.9170
Minor gardeners manage the former farmers ’ cause .	-4.0832
The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories to days .	-6.5039
It is annoying if maps are not up to date .	-2.2476
Everyone who had to get up to the ground already knows this , because the Auto-Navi displayed a green meadow instead of a bypass .	-7.4365
The historic maps of the digital Bavarian atlases , an offer of the Bavarian Geoportal government , are far from current - but that is why they are very revealing .	-6.9357
Especially when compared to current online cards .	-1.8729
Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed since the 19th century in the area of Munich 's .	-5.2852
The digital Bavarian Atlas is a patchwork epoch , which is not immediately recognized .	-6.5396
In the great map , more detailed maps were included for cities and communities , so-called primordial sheets .	-6.3199
Bayerns was the capital of the Bavarian metropolitan , .	-14.5049
Your client : Napoleon .	-1.1575
The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .	-2.3238
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and ordered a topographic capture of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .	-4.2632
Although the French troops , with the peace of Lunéville on February 9 , 1801 , finally opted , it was today ’ s neighbors that created the idea of a comprehensive Bayern Card .	-6.4480
Kurfürst Max IV Joseph pushed the project further forward , founded the " Topographic Bureau " - and thus the Bavarian surveying administration .	-4.7797
The Munich Urposisblatt dates back to 1856 and can be found on the Bayerischer Landeslibrary website .	-5.5111
The comparison of Spring / Today is the most impressive of the country 's capital .	-4.2581
The city expanded in every direction and grew together .	-2.8896
An example of this is Untersendling , which still appears relatively isolated in the 1856 map .	-3.1764
Sendling was interfered 21 years after the map was created in 1877 .	-8.6032
Today , Untersendling is located in the middle of the city .	-2.9113
The Houses Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along the present Plinganser Street , which was only named in 1878 by Georg Sebastian Plinganser , a leader of the Bavarian peasant uprising against Austria 1705 .	-5.5748
When you zoom in , a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears : handwritten curtains from the so-called " Urlaub " from which the property tax was derived .	-7.0143
Small plots of plots no longer show farmers there , but miniature nurses of the plant " Land in Sun " .	-6.7934
A large green area is just north of Untersendling .	-2.5315
The Theresienwiese , since 1810 site of the Oktoberfest , was in fact a meadow in the 19th century - not a concrete desert .	-4.2914
On the other side of the isar , the historic map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine .	-2.9430
In the area of today 's district of Au-Haidhausen you will read not only the street name " am Gasteig " or the hill " Auf der Lüft " - but also in large letters " Irren Anstalt " .	-6.0450
Yes , here on the Auerfeldstra<unk>e people were once locked up with delusions .	-4.4759
In 1858 / 59 the Munich Kreiss-Irrenanstalt " Auer Lüft " was established .	-4.7924
In 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von Gudden chaired the institution - that psychiatrist who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .	-4.3592
" He was progressive for his time and , for example , ended the chain of the so-called errs .	-3.8663
In addition , he has prohibited the staff from using violence against the occupants ' , says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Museum of Haidhausen , who has worked for an exhibition with the Institut .	-5.3593
The first room for 280 patients was space , later extended to 500 places .	-4.5515
At some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the district irrigation facility in Haar 1905 .	-5.1605
Since 2006 , the Isar Amper Clinic in Munich Ost , one of Germany ’ s largest psychiatry , has been located there .	-4.8500
The area of the former Auer Anstalt is now where young people meet in the Munich Salesianum .	-4.7968
The order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth home with training companies .	-3.3616
West is TSV München Ost , a football ground in the 1980s .	-4.7826
In 2015 , the “ Casa Don Bosco ” children ’ s house was built , in architectural terms , based on the Irrensk ’ s origins , which had been destroyed by bomb attacks during World War II .	-6.8868
The Marienplatz was registered as " Main Square " around 1856 , and the " Kaufinger Gasse " was the " Kaufinger Strasse " .	-6.7311
A decisive change brought the Second World War to the heart of Munich .	-2.8939
The Allied bombs laid many holes in the city centre in December 1944 .	-3.0605
A large one remained until today - on the Marienhof .	-3.7591
The English Institute , Small Business Houses and a medieval Gruftskapelle once stood at Marienhof , where the preliminary works were carried out on 5 April 2017 , the league for the second S-Bahn access .	-7.4327
With the slider you can compare the old Munich card with today 's aerial image - and fill the hole at the Marienhof .	-4.5383
Missouri ’ s Citizens ' Rights Group Published Travel Warning	-4.7101
The National Association of Colors for the Promotion of Colors has issued a warning to coloured people travelling to Missouri because of the State ’ s discriminatory policies and racist attacks .	-4.4093
" The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri , which is due to enter into force by August 28 , 2017 , calls on Afro-American travellers , visitors and Missourians to pay particular attention to travels through the state and to exercise extreme caution as a number of questionable , race-based incidents have recently been reported throughout the state , " says the opinion of the Group .	-7.3832
A recent Missouri law that makes it more difficult for people to obtain discrimination claims , and the state law enforcement authorities , which are disproportionately targeting minorities , prompted the group to issue travel warning , said NAACP .	-5.5649
" You have violations of citizens ' rights that happen to people .	-2.6424
They are stopped for their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , " said the President of Missouri NAACP , Rod Chapel , Kansas City Star .	-2.8622
'We hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not yet heard . '	-2.6361
It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the USA .	-2.3912
The group cited incidents such as racist offences against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .	-2.4708
Sanders died at the beginning of the year in questionable circumstances , when he had no petrol at all during his journey through the state and was taken in custody by the Missouri police without being accused of a crime .	-6.2191
The Council also draws attention to a recent report by the Missouri Office of the Public Prosecutor Office , which shows that 75 % black drivers are more likely to be white .	-4.9545
" The recommendation is that people are aware of what may happen in Missouri , " Chapel said .	-2.7986
'People must be ready , whether they bring bail or let their relatives know that they are travelling through the state ' .	-4.5646
In 2015 , Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes , according to the latest figures from the FBI ’ s hate crime report , which classifies the state to the 16 .	-4.7778
Travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination .	-2.6811
Previously , the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states adopted immigration laws obliging local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for violations of immigration , which , according to ACLU , will contribute to further racial profiling .	-5.2440
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but recently interest groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US .	-3.5849
Weidezaunprojekt is elementary .	-1.6072
The Fischerbacher Weidezaun project is a success project and will continue next year .	-2.0058
The CDU Untestable Peter Wei<unk> and Kordula Kovac got a picture on site .	-6.0194
At the Schwendemann family rights grave , representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU association met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two Members .	-5.3832
Markus Schwendemann initially provided insights into his farm , where he managed 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , supplied 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and accommodated in five apartments .	-4.7262
For him , the ' Black Forest milk ' is the alternative route to the marketing of the milk of his cows , says Schwendemann .	-5.3439
The holiday guests have only regional tables .	-4.7299
Since he is also BLHV chairman of Fischerbach , he called the Weidezaunprojekt " fundamental " .	-4.5214
I cannot make a profit on such steep land .	-2.9654
The green area for a lot of work , a lot of work needs to be done with the engine lens .	-5.5430
" We have to deal with the conditions and with the topography , " he emphasized .	-3.5877
In 2003 he took over the parental operation and operated it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if it did not run a bio-plant .	-4.3874
For mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : " The commune recognized the importance of the Weidezaunproject and is glad about the Leader Promotion " .	-5.9618
Farmers would have to be supported at the cost of between EUR 3 000 and EUR 4 000 per hectare .	-3.4321
We hope that this will take a long time to go before reforestation .	-5.4437
" The biggest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how to get their business to work , " the mayor stressed .	-5.1229
Farmers are often in the criticism because of promotion .	-2.6101
In 2013 , a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in the field of grazing gr.	-5.6347
The area of disclosure is thus 40 hectares , which may not be explored until at least 2023 .	-3.8577
Half of the total cost of EUR 71 500 was funded by the Leader , a district bore the municipality of Fischerbach .	-5.2506
This leaves farmers EUR 12 610 , which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of pasture .	-3.6666
" The great advantage is the longevity of the fences " , declared Schwendemann .	-3.2114
Kordula Kovac stressed : " You are doing a really good job , without farmers and rural women it is not going " .	-3.7208
Peter Wei<unk> also noted that " best food is produced here " .	-3.9171
The Landscape Maintenance Directive ( LPR ) Baden-Württemberg enables state support for fences .	-2.8421
The aim is to keep the Black Forest open .	-1.8656
The presence of a conveyor set by the LPR is a precondition .	-5.6436
In addition , the area to be fenced must not be traceable ( slope more than 35 % ) and must therefore be threatened by reforestation .	-5.0952
The 2018 Fischerbacher Weidezaunprojekt is currently being submitted by eight participants with 24 plots who want to build just under 16 kilometres of fence .	-5.5235
The area of disclosure is 35 hectares and the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros .	-3.5690
Is nothing more sacrosanct ?	-0.7349
Now , Trump ’ s White House is adopting the Statue of Liberty	-5.4901
The safest sign of regime change is to start attacking statues .	-1.8024
Americans like any other , so the carefully orchestrated fall of Saddam Hussein in Baghdad in 2003 .	-3.2511
Stephen Miller , one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN about the president ’ s proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration with the status of freedom .	-3.7202
To be fair , Miller did not apply the statue itself .	-1.9955
A horde of boat owners and liberty imitators would have lynched him if he had done so .	-2.6113
But he assumed its importance , and in particular the importance attributed to her , when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus was added in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the memorial , to his base .	-5.1112
As Miller Acosta lamented , " I don 't want to go down a whole thing about history , but the status of liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world .	-5.0917
The poem to which you refer , which was later added and is not part of the original Statute for Freedom . '	-3.1188
Miller is factually correct , but as he put it himself , it is not really a matter of history .	-2.7184
It is about contemporary resonance of the upset words of Lazarus , the only one in which a state invites not only some old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : ' Your mothers , your poor , / your afflicted masses , who yearn for free breathing / the wretched waste of your rich coasts ' .	-6.3777
There was never a time when the " misery waste " on our screens was better visible .	-2.9637
Miller did not engage in literary criticism – he made clear that these people are not welcome in Trump ’ s US .	-2.6996
This conflict over the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural dispute : indeed , it is a conflict about America ’ s importance .	-3.6731
Lazarus – and her friends , who worked to put their words at the bottom of their lives after they died – knew very well that they were doing a highly political act .	-6.2595
The sculpture was intended to show the links between French and American Republicans by representing the female embodiment of freedom in a diminished classical image .	-5.3917
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem , the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received one voice .	-2.6780
And she gives herself a very different name : mother of the exiles .	-2.6706
The combination of the poem with the picture is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism .	-2.7673
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , right-wing people wanted to change it for a long time .	-2.3498
In 2010 , the great cry hall of Rush Limbaugh , a kind of Johannes of the perpetrator for Trump ’ s coming , argued that the Statue of Liberty was not inviting anyone , but rather an early neo-conservative , bringing the American flame to the Middle East : “ Lady Liberty is moving forward .	-6.3539
It is meant to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .	-2.1345
The torch is not meant to illuminate the path to the United States . '	-3.6002
It was quite extraordinary that Limbaugh could have met on something here .	-5.3545
The importance of statue is completely a question of the position of perception .	-2.6948
The great imaginative fact of Lazarus was to see her as she was seen by the exhausted , miserable but hopeful people after long and often dreadful trips on the deck of ships .	-4.4148
It really is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and an opportunity to improve their lives .	-2.8486
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome that they must hear .	-2.4969
And that , of course , is not the perspective that the Miller and Trump would ever like to acknowledge .	-3.2722
Their torch should not enlighten the way , but ignite the hatred , which is their only source of power .	-3.6242
World Cup 2017 : Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK Team	-5.1247
Eilidh Doyle is reminiscent of a time when only two Scots were part of the British team .	-2.6192
Neil Black , the leader of the United Kingdom 's athletics , says that the 16-member Scottish quota in the World Cup championship ' will ' make a massive contribution to the team ' .	-6.2806
A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which starts on Friday .	-2.2371
Black believes that ' something special is developing in Scotland ' and the UK 's athletics must learn from it .	-4.0495
" We welcome it , and we try to understand it , and we will continue it until we find it out , " said Black .	-2.1693
" I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done .	-2.7927
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .	-2.2336
British athletics : it has something to do with what they have done .	-2.2811
And also with the type on the street corner .	-3.0480
Whatever the combination of circumstances it is absolutely brilliant . '	-1.6062
Several of the Scottish athletes are medals contenders , including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5.000 m stretch while Eilidh Doyle was elected a team captain by the team .	-6.0262
" Eilidh is rather modest .	-1.8100
Her captain 's speech was incredible , " Black says .	-2.0114
" A number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and motivated .	-2.9382
The passion and real feeling that Eilidh brought quite naturally was great . "	-4.3640
The Commonwealth silver medal winner , who will take part in their fifth World Championships at the 400-m hurdles , says that it is " incredible " that 16 Scots are in the British team .	-5.7643
Scotland ’ s best total number of athletes to date in the World Cup was seven , achieved in 1983 and 2015 .	-4.0703
The Muir midrange runner is on that path , setting five British and two European records last year .	-4.8037
It will participate in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs .	-3.5714
Chris O 'Hare , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot to be seen after a great season that was winning the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games .	-4.8659
Doyle remembers her first World Championships when the only other Scot was in Team Lee McConnell .	-3.5873
The team captain says that she is ' enormously proud ' of the fact that many of her compatriots are not only members of the team , but in some cases will also be involved in medals and finals .	-4.7892
" The special thing about being a team captain is that she was elected by the other members of the team so it was a great honour anyway , but to know that my team-mates voted for me and voted for me , it makes it very special for me " , she added .	-5.2059
" Obviously I am very proud of all the Scots who belong to the team .	-1.7243
It only shows how far we have come .	-1.1165
And they are here as established athletes , athletes , who want to climb to Podien .	-3.9106
With regard to my speech as a captain ?	-2.3984
Yes , I think it went well .	-1.0596
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation because we have a home world championship .	-2.8603
So it is really important to focus on this support and to benefit from our being back in the Olympic stadium .	-4.1092
I get a second chance to go out and compete there and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there . '	-3.4456
Block critics about Facebook : Don ’ t worry about public office if you can ’ t compete with rising voters .	-4.1956
The father of our country knew something about bad press .	-2.0326
Americans loved George Washington , but it didn ’ t take long for newspapers to beat him for everything , from domestic politics to political principles .	-3.2973
He went on to criticize , safely .	-3.8339
But he did not silence his critics .	-0.7410
For , in 1783 , Washington said : ' Freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and stupid , we are being led to slaughter like sheep ' .	-4.2376
This brings me to Maryland , Governor Larry Hogan , who must work to be more like Washington .	-1.9116
Hogan ’ s staff blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .	-4.5113
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him earlier this week .	-1.3603
The staff of the governor dismissed the complaint as frivol , and the online comment was full of a backlash with " Na , and ? " .	-3.1597
" It 's just Facebook , " said many people .	-1.4733
But it is important .	-0.7180
And it is especially important when it is a type like Hogan .	-2.3289
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is remarkably popular .	-2.2230
He has the second-highest approval of the nation ’ s 50 governors .	-2.7355
Hogan is not a reactionary heat head .	-1.1745
He has shown a firm hand in leading his state and strict respect for the principles .	-6.3297
He was also very skilful in using Facebook as a primary tool to connect to his constituents while playing off his unfamiliar post-chemotherapy head .	-6.7002
Therefore , the blocking of people who come to the side of the governor - who is a public forum known as the official forum and who are paid by public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .	-6.2420
In an interview with The Washington Post , Hogans Speaker Amelia Chasse defended the actions of the governor , arguing that blocking comments was nothing more than moderation .	-3.3460
But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hate-filled people who sweep online .	-5.4177
The post spoke to some of the real people blocked by Hogan .	-1.8934
And these are only real people who talk to their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur , and a priest , not trolls .	-4.0331
They all said that their comments were respectful , thoughtful , and not profane .	-2.1579
The parish quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan ’ s Catholic faith .	-2.5937
Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie , Md . , was not full , but she asked for hate crimes .	-3.5594
" I commented politely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news , " she wrote in the commentary area of The Post .	-3.8815
'I also do not value this idea when a number of people take a stand on the same subject , then some people disregard it as a so-called collective effort and do not recognise it as a large group of citizens affected ' .	-6.0989
What the governor described as a " concentrated spam attack " is probably what others would call " sympathy " .	-4.8788
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment .	-2.6963
It is much cleaner than in the past if we had done the same , that employees were sent to gather and burn newspapers with critical editorial articles , or to arrest and silence demonstrators .	-4.9462
But that is precisely what is happening digitally .	-2.0212
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for insulting Facebook and other social media .	-2.5689
President Trump is sued by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed .	-1.7200
One of the first milestones on this issue was last week in Virginia .	-2.1502
The Chairman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment , according to US district judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria , when they expelled a voter from their facebook page .	-4.4428
And in Kentucky , Governor Matt Bevin ( R ) also received a visit from ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter .	-2.3047
This should not be so difficult .	-2.3129
At the moment of Washington , the time of the affordable portal had a similar effect to the Internet .	-4.2676
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800 , and anonymous letters proposed his leadership .	-2.9416
And even then , Washington had anonymous trolls .	-0.8856
The people who used pseudonyms such as " Juricola " , " Valerius " , " Belisarius " and " Portius " wrote all letters of newspapers that laid down Washington 's decisions .	-10.9609
Petitions criticized his position on the Amity Treaty , trade , and shipping with Britain overwhelmed his office , according to the historical documents collected by the Online Papers of the George Washington Project .	-4.6893
But he did not silence them .	-1.1600
Freedom of speech , disagreement and discourses are the basis of our nation .	-7.9756
And true leadership means accepting that .	-1.5075
Ronan Rafferty Hopes for Household Comfort in the Renaissance Club	-2.1728
Former Europeans No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope for domestic comfort in the next three days , as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .	-4.2376
The Northern Ireland , which lasted next year in the Archerfield Links until the final round before he lost against Paul Eales , is associated with the new venue and serves as the ambassador to the Tournament on behalf of the Foundation and CEO Jerry Sarvadi .	-16.7118

Less lung cancer caused by passive smoking	-0.8540
In the past two decades , fewer and fewer people have died of lung cancer because of passive smoking .	-2.3237
This result is a study by scientists from the University Hospital at Hamburg-Eppendorf ( UKE ) .	-4.1045
" According to our estimates , 167 cases of lung cancer are caused by passive smoking each year , " said professor Heiko Becher .	-3.7871
In comparison , he drew up his own study on this issue from 1994 .	-3.1913
At that time , 400 lung cancer deaths were still occurring in Germany due to passive smoking .	-3.3948
The new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health .	-1.8759

It even seldom uses a pot .	-2.3431
In its wooden house in Enarotali , the capital of the Paniai Regency in the troubled Indonesian province of Papua , the housewife usually puts a sweet potato - locally called " nota " - directly into the fireplace .	-5.2736
After half an hour the stolen bone is taken from and swallowed with diligent , unwashed hands .	-5.2040
Degei sits on the mud floor - she has no furniture - where she performs her daily work , such as washing clothes with water from the nearby swamp .	-5.5468
A bucket in a single room serves as a rubber ring .	-2.7386
As the youngest of the four wives of her husband , she was not assigned any fields .	-3.5391
Polygamy is common here .	-2.9443
Of course , late work can be dangerous : most of the villagers are unemployed , and many drink hard , and there are soldiers here .	-3.2551
" No one dares to walk around in the village after 5 o 'clock " , she says .	-3.1106
It is a rare insight into everyday life in the highlands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was taken up in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,026 elders should vote by means of a public survey of occupying forces .	-5.8554
An existing movement that stirred up the independence of Dutch rule quickly turned against the Jakarta government , which maintains control of the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers .	-4.6648
In 2003 , the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua , with the independent part of Papua New Guinea covering the eastern part of the island .	-2.8520
Enarotali is as remote as it is often , with a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire and a 5-minute car every morning with the rental car .	-4.9924
There is no public transport .	-1.0441
The city , with approximately 19,000 inhabitants , consists of wooden buildings surrounded by bamboo fences and corrugated corrugated roofs .	-5.3107
Very few Indonesians have made their journey here , let alone journalists and virtually no foreigners .	-2.6396
Before Christian missionaries arrived , Mee Pago Papuans called Uga Tamee .	-2.6322
There have been other changes .	-2.3329

" We used to have only leaves on our bodies . "	-1.8160
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and some of the worst child mortality and literacy rates in Asia .	-2.7454
But it is also a gold country for Indonesia .	-2.7857
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Grasberg , owned by the Phoenix Freeport McMoran , is just 60 miles from Paniai , a high land province of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants .	-3.8893
In 2015 alone , Freeport accounted for $ 3.1 billion in gold and copper .	-2.2746
Moreover , Papua has an estimated $ 78 billion of wood resources .	-2.4574
But these riches are a source of misery for the Papua , ensuring that Indonesia ’ s powerful military retain a suffocating presence .	-3.9315
A 2005 survey in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid almost $ 20 million to local military and units between 1998 and 2004 , including up to $ 150,000 to a single officer .	-4.1035
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden gans and are treated mercilessly .	-2.8931

Mass deaths in Papua ’ s tribal highlands in the 1970 ’ s became genocide under the Asia-Human Rights Commission .	-3.5089
In the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful demonstrators last year .	-1.4220
" We are losing everything " is stated in a report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane in 2016 , which contains reports of the atrocities of the previous year , such as illegal executions and torture - rape and electrical strikes are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations .	-5.6690
" It is difficult to count the number of victims as incidents occur every week , " says Andreas Harsono , Indonesian researcher for Human Rights Watch .	-2.7075
The screws have increased as Papua 's resources are producing an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia .	-3.4289
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic development is changing as Muslim economic migrants come from the populous Java , Borneo , Sumatra , and Sulawesi islands .	-3.1810
Javanese warung-antines sell fried chicken and gado , serving a mixed vegetables with natural nut sauce .	-5.5141
Local people are struggling to stay with you .	-4.5748
" The migrants have begun selling chickens and vegetables in the traditional market more cheaply than local papuas , " says Abeth You , a 24 year old Paniai indigenous who moved to Jayapura provincial capital .	-5.2368
'It cost Papua , the Mama [ the women ] of Papua , the native Papua market . '	-4.0588
Indonesian President Joko Widodo , known as Jokowi in the People 's Moon , promised to address inequalities and violations in Papua during his campaign in 2014 .	-4.1515
Former Zimmermann secured 27 of the total 29 districts of Papua - including Paniai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jakarta .	-7.8645
But little has changed in Papua , and today the locals feel cheated .	-2.7158
" Our hearts have broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014 , with the expectation that he will fulfil our hopes that justice will be restored , " says You .	-2.9252
Indeed , only two months after Jokowi ’ s inauguration in October , Paniai reached a low point .	-2.3566
On December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children out there and sang Christmas songs in front of a campfire in Enarotali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle .	-3.4182
The frightening children told them that they should turn on their headlights .	-4.2755
One of the soldiers took offence in their tone and came back with four soldiers later , according to the local pastor Yavedt Tebai .	-4.3448
The soldiers who had drunk chased and beat the group with their guns , said victims and witnesses .	-2.5348
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .	-2.1818
One child , the 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo , was hit so hard that he fell into coma .	-3.4988
A few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set fire , and things escalated the next day .	-2.2239
Approximately 1,000 young Papua men , women and children gathered in a football pitch in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice .	-3.8290
They performed ceremonial hunting floors and performed the Waita dance - constantly in circle and imagining a bird song - by Papuas Mee Pago .	-5.1607
Some demonstrators started to muddle stones on police and military posts .	-3.1138
When the mood was fueled , a command was sent to the soldiers about an internal spark : " If the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , " it is said in an official TIME document that was not released to the local media .	-5.0572
Yeremias Kayame , 56 , head of Enarotali 's Kego Koto district , saw the imminent danger and called for rest and urged the crowd to return home .	-3.7723
No one was in the mood to listen .	-1.8461
" When I turned around , I was suddenly shot into my left hand joint , " he said TIME on the veranda of his colorful wooden house .	-3.7289
Kayame still doesn 't know who was flying , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here .	-4.1003
" It was overcrowded , many shots were fired , " he adds .	-2.0661
The local man Alfius Youw was met three times , so his cousin , who was witness to the shootings .	-3.2025
" I ran to him and studied his body to make sure he was , " said Yohanes , who , like many Indonesians , has only one name , the TIME in dark mood .	-4.6724
'I saw that he was dead ... I knocked him . '	-2.5227
The chief inspector of the Papua police force , Yotje Mende , told reporters that his officers wanted to " secure their station " only because they were attacked .	-3.6740
" We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us , " the spokesman for the Papua police , Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo , said in 2015 .	-3.5399
'It is about life and death . '	-0.9775
According to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstrators were killed and many more injured .	-2.4363
The news of the killings came to Jakarta only the following day .	-2.4707
Three weeks , Jokowi delivered a passionate speech in Jayapura in which he expressed sympathy for the victims ' families and swore to address the historical grievances in Papua .	-3.3915
" I want this case to be resolved immediately so that it will not happen in the future , " he said .	-2.4820
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he set up an extrajudicial mechanism to resolve historic human rights violations .	-3.4232
But the excuses started almost immediately .	-1.2681
" Most injuries occurred long ago .	-1.9119
Some were in the 1990s and early 2000 ’ s .	-1.6753
The point is that we have committed ourselves to addressing these infringements , but there are processes that must be passed , " he said .	-3.6179
Then Wiranto withdrew when he spoke with TIME in Jakarta on 5 June and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua .	-3.4255
Instead , " everything is regulated by law , " he said .	-2.3092
Wiranto , who accused the UN of ' crimes against humanity ' , demanding more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor 's bloody vote in 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights violations have already been settled in Papua , including the Paniai incident .	-4.8125
Families of the Paniai victims made such claims with fierce disbelief .	-4.3186
" I have been interviewed four times over the last three years , but there has been no progress , " says Yohanes .	-3.0381
'I am tired . '	-0.5644
He says that years later he still lives in fear .	-2.1137
'I am afraid ' , he says .	-1.3875
'I am afraid to be arrested by the military is afraid to be shot . '	-2.7315
His brother Yacobus reiterated the view that the people of Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident .	-2.7079
He says that he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims .	-2.4086
" After I had buried the bodies , the military looked for me , " he says .	-2.1252
The shooting works have not stopped .	-1.6049
On Tuesday , the Indonesian police shot on villagers in Paniais ’ neighborhood Deiyai .	-2.9579
During a confrontation between villagers and a construction company manager who refused to bring an unconscious man to hospital , one person died and 17 others were injured , including children .	-3.1443
The man who was 24-year-old Ravianus Douw , who drowned when he was fishing in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .	-3.3902
Worse villagers protested against the company 's location office .	-3.4013
The police said that villagers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warning shots .	-2.7204
But locals say that the mobile brigade ( Indonesian paramilitary police ) began to shoot the crowd and killed one .	-3.0478
" We were so in panic , we fear there will be revenge , " says the 29-year-old Domingu Badii , who lives near the hospital and was witnesses how the injured were quickly received here , according to TIME .	-5.4810
'I hid myself in my house for two days ' .	-6.4561
The Deiyai parliament has called for the officers involved to be accountable and for withdrawing the mobile brigade of the police from the area .	-3.5159
Paniai has always been a troublemaker for the Indonesian Government .	-2.1311
The lack of meaningful development reinforces the dissatisfaction of the tribal members of Mee , Moni , Dani and Damal living in the green highlands of Papua .	-3.7750
Many joined the Free Papua Movement ( OPM ) , the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of the Papua by inciting sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers .	-8.8148
Some of the top OPM leaders were from Paniai , including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya .	-5.2959
In response to this , thousands of people have been arrested in Paniai in recent years and have been taken arbitrarily into custody , on the pretext of ' safeguarding national sovereignty ' .	-5.3357
Some people never appear again .	-2.9672
Among the people of Papua , Paniai is known as ' a tragic , forgotten place ' .	-2.9847
Poverty strengthens dissatisfaction .	-1.3713
The little rice being sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals .	-1.9509
Brot is just as out of reach .	-2.8618
The people here are building everything they eat : Nota , fruit and leaf vegetables in particular .	-6.0560
Agriculture is the task of women who can edit four or five sweet potato fields each .	-4.1966
They retain most of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market .	-1.7683
Ten pieces of Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees ( 75 cents ) .	-1.6862
Over time , economic inequalities have grown between the local Papua and the new migrants , who have increased since the opening of new routes to Nabire airport .	-3.8905
The few jobs there are in the region typically go to better educated and wealthier migrants .	-2.4052
Papua rarely have the capital or the skills needed to run its own companies competitive .	-3.4016
" Young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there is no job or money " , says John Gobai , chairman of the Paniai tribal council .	-3.6509
Isolation holds the eyes of the world far away from Papua .	-1.6639
Moreover , restrictions on reporting by international media remain tense .	-1.6930
Earlier this year , French journalists were deported from Papua for lack of coordination with related institutions , Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp , even though they were given the rare permission to film .	-3.0909
According to Phelim Kine , Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch , Jokowi ’ s campaign promises to lift restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development have not been realized .	-3.0729
" There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia 's most troubled eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua : visa refusal and a black list , " he said in a statement .	-3.5320
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely confined to Papua ’ s immediate neighbors .	-10.9759
In March , six Pacific states - Tonga , Nauru , Palau , Tuvalu , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the ' various and widespread breaches ' in Papua , including the Paniai Foundation .	-3.9637
These same countries have historically supported OPM .	-1.1390
The spokesman of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Arrmanatha Nasir dismissed the group 's accusations and said journalists in Jakarta : ' There is still a democratic system in Indonesia , and there is free media , so it is difficult to conceal evidence of human rights cases ' .	-4.7850
Local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .	-1.5589
When an official delegation from the Netherlands visited Jayapura on 4 May , under the leadership of the human rights activist Kees Van Baar , the natives broke their silence and pushed him " We want freedom " , according to a source that also took part in the session but wanted to remain anonymous .	-6.0342
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua says that they will probably not vote for Jokowi again .	-2.7371
" Jokowi is a person who has good intentions , but it is surrounded by people who participate in Paniai 's shots , " says Gobai , the chairman of the tribal council .	-4.8455
He wants Jokowi to know that , apart from the constant threat of a predatory military , the Paniai people are in poor educational and health services .	-3.5016
Gobai says that the Paniai people , like other Papua , regard their voice for Jokowi as a " guilt " that he must repay .	-4.0717
" You do not need money , they just want justice , " he says .	-2.2744
Despite threats and intimidation , the families of the Paniai shooter carried out a final symbolic act of defiance : the victim ’ s body was buried on a ground precisely in front of the police and the military station .	-5.4624
They know that perhaps justice will never come to them , but at least they will not let those responsible forget their crimes .	-3.3066
" A member of our family was killed , " says Yacobus with sinister heads .	-3.1842
'What else can we do ? '	-0.6096
Fire Capture the Dubai ' Torch ' skyscrapers for the second time .	-4.8186
A fire took place on Friday in one of the world ’ s highest living towers in Dubai and forced hundreds of residents to flee from the 337 meter high 79-storey building .	-4.7472
It is the second Brand , which in only two years passes through the high house , which one randomly calls the Torch Tower ( torch tower ) .	-6.2458
The building was evacuated , injuries were not reported and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .	-2.5198
" We slept and we stood up with the fire alarm and shouting the people .	-2.8011
We went down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor , " a resident who named George angab , Reuters told us .	-3.9421
The civil protection authorities in Dubai said that the fire fighting units at 4 a.m. local time ( 00.00 GMT ) cleared the fire and cooled the building .	-5.8171
The government said that it is working to provide accommodation to those affected .	-3.0232
The incident can revive questions about the safety of materials used in outward areas of high-rise buildings around the world .	-3.6414
An investigation by the management of the torch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage from facing , outlining to decoration or insulation , occurred .	-6.0708
In Britain , the police said , they believe that the shelter system for isolation and linking the Grenfel Tower in London in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which around 80 people died .	-5.8809
No Davis Cup Reform : Further Best of Five	-3.5590
The President of the International Tennis Association ( ITF ) has gone through at the General Assembly with his great Davis Cup coup .	-3.7632
At the Ho-Chi-Minh City meeting , the revolutionary proposal for this sport to play Davis-Cup-Ein only on two winning rates was hardly supported by the required two-thirds majority .	-6.3547
The five sets classics , which are often very long but which are also highly valued , remain the traditional winner .	-7.5508
63.54 % of the member countries voted in favour of reform , so ITF President David Haggerty ’ s goal was hardly missed .	-4.3636
" We respect this decision , but we are disappointed that our members did not adopt the entire Davis Cup and Fed Cup reform package .	-3.5251
We need a change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historical contests , " said Haggerty .	-3.5840
They will continue to work to improve the applicants .	-2.7401
It was certainly not until the vote , after many objections , that the proposal to carry the final in a neutral place was made .	-6.7111
New in 2018 is only comparatively smaller details : the finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have the host right in the next year in the first round .	-5.1777
In order to reduce organizers ’ costs , the training place requirements will be made easier and players will have to complete less official media appointments before the Davis Cup .	-5.8289
More than 1 out of 5 US passengers bring banned items onto the plane , finds a poll	-4.8677
A survey conducted by air passengers revealed that more than 20 percent deliberately or unconsciously prohibited objects passed the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 % of which received the aircraft , while accidentally blown banned blades or other items .	-6.8017
Less than 1 % claimed that they had been late discovered that they had mistakenly traveled with guns , ammunition , or explosives .	-3.4102
The survey carried out by a jet charter service , the Stratos Jet Charters Inc . , showed that younger travellers tend to disregard the rules .	-4.2146
Of the respondents who admitted that they knowingly tried to fly with something prohibited by the TSA , 19.7 % millennia , compared to less than 15 % , were members of generation X .	-5.2129
The most common items intentionally passed on to TSA agents were food and liquids .	-2.8356
More than 3 % agreed to have knowingly carried objects with blades through security control , while 2.2 % of female respondents and 3.7 % of male respondents also confirmed that they had deliberately brought banned drugs into the airplane .	-4.5361
The company said it interviewed travellers across the country to find out how many accidentally smuggled goods through airport security and how many would have done so deliberately .	-4.5961
It is no surprise that people who wear most smuggling goods - knowingly or unknowingly - by safety were those who fly most .	-4.6802
However , the company points out that the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing .	-2.1622
People are often unsure what liquids they can take with them or how much of it .	-2.8794
So it is no surprise that most of the liquids banned by the TSA are .	-3.1014
For a time , people thought that TSA could see books as smuggling goods .	-3.2843
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .	-2.0267
Elon Musk ’ s Story of tens of thousands of Tesla customers	-3.1865
Electro-thousand sassa Elon Musk likes to give with the huge number of preconditions for his new Tesla " Model 3 " .	-4.8292
At the same time , he has previously discontinued that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservations .	-5.8396
In addition to the ever triumphant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tesla-Chef Elon Musk has for the first time betrayed another , less glamorous , number when announcing the recent quarterly balance : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 .	-6.4744
In recent months , Musk had often advertised with the more than 500,000 preconditions for the new car , the delivery of which is just beginning .	-5.6260
Now muscle admits : 63,000 of the 518,000 preconditions have already been withdrawn .	-4.2540
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are simply non-binding reservations .	-2.6506
In the event of cancellation Tesla will pay a total of 1000 euros ( US $ 1000 and US $ 1000 in the UK ) ' Reservation deposit ' .	-7.0442
Currently , 455,000 such non-binding reservations were made , musk admitted at a conference with analysts .	-3.9084
However , Tesla 's boss does not believe that the cancellation of approximately twelve percent of all orders could become a problem .	-4.6731
His argument : the challenge to ambitious growth targets is not demand , but manufacturing .	-2.5728
Last year Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles .	-0.7831
In 2018 - all models taken together - it will be 500,000 , one million by 2020 .	-2.8901
There is clear demand for this .	-1.9945
According to Musk , 1800 reservations are currently made per day .	-2.8620
If you order a " Model 3 " today , you can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive its brand new production lines , which have never been tested in practice , without any major interruptions with maximum utilisation .	-6.3988
Many experts doubt that this is possible .	-1.3470
If there are any delays , the fact that reservations are not binding could become a problem for Tesla .	-5.4020
After all , the company cannot prevent unsatisfied customers from running out of droves .	-3.8126
EPA CEO Pruitt is withdrawing from the Obama Era rules to reduce emissions because of a delay .	-5.1616
One day after having been sued by 15 states , Scott Pruitt , the head of the Environmental Protection Agency , took his previous decision to delay implementation of the Obama era rules in order to reduce emissions from smog pollutants .	-4.7261
Pruitt presented the change when its agency met the needs of public environmental authorities more responsibly than previous administrations .	-3.8738
He did not mention the complaint that had been lodged against his previous post in a federal court .	-3.8349
It is a deadline for states on 1 October to meet the 2015 standards for ground-level ozone .	-3.5815
In June , Pruitt announced that he would delay compliance by a year to give his authority more time , study the plan , and avoid " interfering in local decisions or impeding economic growth " .	-3.1291
For a long time Pruitt , who was a public prosecutor of Oklahoma before he was appointed by President Donald Trump , was a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations .	-4.3651
Since arriving in Washington , Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations that the chemical and fossil-fuel industries are resisting .	-3.0075
The sudden reversal from Wednesday is the recent legal setback for the Pruitts regulatory rollback agenda .	-2.0842
Last month , a federal appeal court in Washington decided that the EPA administrator had exceeded his authority when he tried to delay implementation of a rule of the Obama administration that committed oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methanlecks .	-5.3915
In a statement published on Wednesday evening , Pruitt proposed that its U-turn on ozone standards simply reinforce EPAs ’ willingness to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely compliance with the new standards .	-4.6309
" Under previous administrations , CEPOL often failed to meet the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be indicted by activist groups and others , and in an agreement to set the date for implementation , " said Pruitt , who sued the EPA over a dozen times in his previous job .	-5.5742
" We do not believe in judicial regulation , and we take deadlines seriously .	-2.8502
We also take seriously the law and the authority that exists . '	-2.5043
Nevertheless , the EPO 's opinion stated that Pruitt will eventually use its ' delayed authority and all other legally available powers ' to ensure that the rules ' are based on a sound policy and the best available information ' .	-4.8632
Congressional Republicans are pushing for a broader recast of the ozone rules .	-2.6953
A bill approved last month is supposed to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .	-2.5870
The Senate has not put the measure to the vote .	-2.1652
The New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman , who chaired the coalition of states that sued EPAs this week , said that the group intends to maintain the legal pressure .	-4.2486
" The reversal of EPAs , according to our complaints , is an important gain in health and safety for these 6.7 million New York people and the more than 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog flooding into their communities , " said Schneiderman .	-5.1206
New York joined California , Connecticut , Delaware , Illinois , Iowa , Maine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Pennsylvania , Rhode Island , Vermont , and Washington and the District of Columbia .	-1.8719
Soil ozone occurs when pollutants from cars , power stations , oil refineries , chemical plants and other sources react to sunlight in the atmosphere .	-3.0000
The resulting smog can cause serious respiratory problems for sensitive groups of people , and contribute every year thousands of premature deaths .	-2.9079
Public health officials and environmentalists cheered for Pruitts ’ surprising change of course .	-3.3449
" It is worrying how much pressure it takes to get this sensible step from the responsible for protecting the air we breathe , " said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity .	-3.3683
'We must continue to fight the Trump administration 's ideological crusade to appease polluters and their particular interests ' .	-3.3208
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church .	-1.4673
750 years of St. Hilarius Church : On the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church , the old cemetery area in Tumlingen is invited to a serenade at 16.30 p.m. on Sunday , 16 July .	-4.7110
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historic St. Hilarius complex is a popular place to stay .	-3.8368
Visitors of the sixth Benefiz-Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place .	-4.5566
The rescue and maintenance of the oldest building in the village has made Tumlings friends and supporters their concern .	-4.4543
Walter Martini stresses : " It is a unique village jewel " .	-2.3524
In 1267 the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in the original Württemberg book : Count Hermann von Sulz " sold the mountain with the parish church on Tumlingen and the Vogtei " by Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver .	-5.2411
According to the letter of the document , on the hill of Tumlinger , besides the former parish church , there was also a stately court in which the church or the patronage law belonged and not the other way round .	-7.2663
So people were living there as well .	-2.6661
As is evident from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt of 1858 , the village and the Oberdorf , which can now be seen in the townscape of Tumlingen , was the third , the ruling centre of the village .	-7.1649
Old maps dating back to the year 1600 confirm these historical conditions .	-6.5467
The patronage law originated from early medieval own church law .	-3.9952
A Lord who built , equipped , and occupied a church with a priest remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this church .	-5.0102
This was accompanied by the right to establish a priest or to propose a new priest to the bishop .	-4.5110
There were three altars in the church and two bells in the tower .	-1.6305
The biggest of the two salient at Christmas 1673 .	-4.7975
The newly acquired bell then killed for the first time in 1692 , but had to be released later in World War II in 1942 .	-4.5549
In the 30-year war ( 1616 to 1648 ) the window windows were slipped and the bell parts stolen .	-5.3737
The roof was leaked .	-2.0149
In 1796 French troops lay near the church .	-2.7552
They broke out the chancellor and church chairs and used them as firewood .	-2.1175
The remains of the church threatened to fall in 1809 .	-2.1553
Until 1869 , the Tumlinger Hilarius-cemetery also served as the last resting place for the dead of Swiss audiences .	-4.1868
In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Hilarius Church aborted .	-3.7737
Only the church tower was left standing .	-2.7662
During the New Year 's Eve in 1834 , a storm split the church tower and half collapsed .	-4.4445
In order to prevent a misfortune , the tower was broken .	-4.0675
Only today 's tower dwellings were preserved as a witness to the 750 years old church history .	-6.0420
Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem maintain the Hilarius-facility by the " Schafffigen Pensioners " as successors of Dieter Dockhorn .	-3.7731
As organizers , the friends and sponsors of Tumlings invite the sixth Serenade on Sunday 16 July to the old cemetery for the St. Hilarius Chapel .	-4.8801
This is designed by the combo of Kepler Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with contributions by Kurt Küler and Reinhold Matteis .	-3.5181
Local Hartmut Romann speaks the final word .	-3.3543
The program starts at 4.30 p.m.	-1.6723
The entrance is from 3.30 p.m.	-2.9273
To the end of the Serenade there is a restructuring in front of the graveyard .	-5.4416
" Enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows towards the forest " , the organizers highlight the fantastic view .	-5.2738
The serenade is only held in dry weather .	-2.3705
The organizers hope for many supporters to preserve the historical St. Hilarius facility , which is important for tumblers and audiences .	-5.3943

" Boisheim wears himself " does not see any legal precondition for construction and has therefore approached the county council .	-4.6069
Landrat Andreas Coenen ( CDU ) has invited the Boisheim Association to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind power plants in Boisheim Nette .	-5.5160
It has been unlawful .	-1.8345
The association argues that at the time of its approval on 30 December 2016 , no wind power plants could have been approved in the Boisheimer Nette , since at that time in Viersen only there was a wind power center at the municipal border with Schbalmtal .	-7.4989
The construction and operation of wind turbines within this concentration zone are basically possible , but at the same time the concentration zone also means the exclusion of wind energy for the rest of the city .	-6.2974
These zones are designed to prevent the landscape from being parsed .	-5.2015
The city of Viersen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette a few days earlier by amending the expansion plan - but this was not approved by the Düsseldorf district government due to a mold failure .	-7.1983
" Due to the lack of planning legal requirements , the approved approval certificate is still illegal and therefore withdrawn , " said Christoph Erkens , chairman of " Boisheim defeats himself " .	-7.2646
The current state of affairs : before the summer recess , the town council decided once again the wind concentration area in Boisheimer 's net ; the district government 's approval is still pending .	-6.4023
Erkens : " This means that the approval for the installation of wind turbines for planning is excluded here . "	-6.3021
The circle confirms the receipt of the invitation .	-1.4963
" The relevant letters have been received by the circle of Viersen since last week " , one speaker said . the , , , and . , , , , , , , and , , , and , , . , ,	-9.8881
The circle takes it as an opportunity to look again at the matter .	-2.8933
But they probably do not lead to the procedure being stopped .	-3.7158
With regard to ongoing procedures at the administrative court , on Thursday , the circle did not want to give its opinion on the content of the arguments of the association " Boisheim wears off " .	-7.0427
NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW Group , plans to build four , 200 metres high wind wheels on an area at Boisheimer 's net .	-4.9834
Last year , the company , in which the city of Viersen is indirectly involved , had concluded contracts with the owner of the area of around 65 hectares .	-5.2868
With the construction of the four wind power plants , the electricity requirement of some 11 400 households is to be met - roughly one fifth of the electricity requirements of all four households .	-5.8860
NEW Re wants to invest around EUR 20 million .	-1.5808
Last summer , Viersens Stadtsrat gave the green light to purchase three wind turbines at the Linnich Wind Park in Aachen , as well as to participate in a wind turbine in <unk>bach-Palenberg in the county of Heinsberg .	-4.5544
Auto and Traktor are cracking together : Woman dies in a terrible accident .	-4.4609

City and Dealers are planning a " Home-Hope " weekend	-4.1031
In September , Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region will discover new shopping opportunities in the city centre .	-3.9701
The Municipality and the Municipality want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to entice the residents to the city centre for shopping .	-7.4181
As the chairman of the trade association Christian König announced , the " Home Shop " weekend should make customers aware of the offers offered by their own city outside the usual supermarket goods .	-6.6245
Thus , a market with regional suppliers is planned , similar to the weekly market .	-3.9647
Moreover , local companies should be present with their training places .	-4.3357
The shops of the city centre should invite you to the " Midnight Shopping " .	-5.0209
The campaign is not only aimed at residents of the city and the region .	-6.2586
In preparation are advertising spots on the radio , an Internet video and printed scarves that point out at the action weekend , says Christian King .	-4.9098
City administration and commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce .	-2.5795
This means that the trade association and the city will enter another stage of the project " Attractive City " .	-5.2627
These include new offers , such as the first " Active Day " to the Brunnenfest with salespeople Sunday , talks with all the tradesmen and hosts to move them to active participation .	-7.2790
Also attractive offers on Saturday and the waiver of parking fees on that day are part of the concept .	-3.6561
In addition , customers ' potential should be reopened or reopened .	-3.6156
These include guests and tourists .	-3.0862
But many locals , too , would have lost the city ’ s when shopping .	-4.5728
At the end of the day , everyone would have to help revitalise the city centre , to let the entire city and its clubs run .	-7.4147
It was well known to overcome the lethargy that spread with a network , King had said in the spring .	-5.5937
Birgit Streich , head of the IHK Center in Mühlhausen , said that in Germany the third " home shop " day , for the first time , five Thuringian cities are participating .	-14.5792
Apart from Bad Langensalza these are Weimar , Sömmerda , Heiligenstadt and Bleiderode .	-3.3569
The day should ' promote the appreciation of local trade and emphasise its importance to the common good of our cities ' , strikes .	-4.5988

Trump pressured Mexico for leaked transcripts of phone calls , owing to the payment of the border wall .	-4.2055
Transscripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been published by the Washington Post .	-2.3736
On 27 January , in a telephone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto , Trump called on him to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall .	-3.2926
The US President accused him of publicly denouncing the wall , and reportedly told him : ' You cannot say this to the press ' .	-4.8806
Trump started his presidential campaign , promising to build a wall at the southern border of the US , and swore to let Mexico pay for the project .	-3.2771
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and revealed tense exchanges .	-2.7518
Mr. Trump said to Mr. Turnbull that trade for the US would " look ridiculous " , " mies " , and " stupid " , and that the existence of trade mediated by the Obama administration would make him look like a " depp " after he proposed a ban on resettlement of refugees to the US .	-6.0038
Mr Trump ended the call after he told Mr Turnbull , ' that is the most unpleasant call for the whole day . '	-3.4837
Moore ’ s Ford massacre : activists revive racist lynchain as a call for justice .	-3.4041
A 1948-r Ford Mercury traveled through a group of spectators in the rural Monroe , Georgia , and jumped to the Ford Bridge of Moore .	-5.1596
Before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , reached the bridge , a group of white men appeared with guns to block its path .	-10.3326
The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man in a needle-ripening suit - took a long turn on his cigar and looked carefully through the windshield .	-5.3980
Insashes feared it .	-5.6694
" We want this n --- r Roger ! " the man shouted .	-3.4169
'Get him out of the car ! '	-0.8785
Thrilling the silence when a young black man was torn apart by the front-passenger seat .	-4.1504
Fortunately , this dreadful scene , which was played on 22 July , is only one reproduction .	-3.0517
But when a snake is thrown around the neck of " Roger " , almost everyone in the audience met very real sighs .	-5.2312
Since 2005 , lawmakers have returned to Moore 's Ford Bridge to reflect the night when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by Ku Klux Klan in 1946 .	-3.8635
Nobody has ever been accused of murder .	-1.9530
" It is really incomprehensible that in all these years , not a single person has been arrested - although we see them in our communities , although we know who they are , " said Tyrone Brooks , who helps to organise the reproduction .	-5.2716
'It is a stain on a history , but it is a burden on our souls . '	-3.1078
Brooks is a 71-year old former Congressman of the State of Georgia and a civil rights activist for a lifetime .	-3.6608
For him , imitation serves as a dramatic call for action and an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected .	-3.8985
" We want law enforcement , we want to end , we want cure , we want reconciliation , but first we have to get justice , " he said .	-3.4493
'We cannot come to healing and reconciliation until we receive justice ' .	-2.6600
A medical practitioner places a cloth on the body of one of the victims of the Moore -Ford Lynch on 27 July 1946 .	-5.1034
According to FBI acts received from NBC news , more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were suspected in the lynch process .	-2.8259
But no one has ever been prosecuted .	-1.8396
Although suspects have been at liberty for decades , citizens ’ rights say that the double motivation for Lynch ’ s actions has always been known throughout the city : politics and sex .	-4.9451
In April 1946 , a ruling by the Supreme Court allowed the black citizens in Georgia to vote for the first time in the run-up to the summer campaign .	-9.7946
Approximately at the same time as the election , according to the FBI of the Black Farmpenster Roger Malcom , a white landowner , Barnett Hester , staged during a battle - allegedly for a woman .	-4.4499
Brooks said that the rumor in the city was that Hester slept with Malcoms Ms Dorothy and that the baby she wore did not come from her husband .	-3.6929
On July 25 , 1946 , Loy Harrison , a prominent white landowner , paid $ 600 to free Malcom from prison , said the FBI .	-3.3424
He was accompanied to prison by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey .	-1.6001
But when they moved away from prison and moved closer to Moore 's Ford Bridge , a mob surrounded the car .	-2.9549
" As it turns out , it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murders , " concludes an FBI report .	-3.1131
" It is also obvious that there was a plot between state and local prosecutions , which was not only involved in the murders , eliminated evidence and concealed the identity of witnesses " .	-5.0513
Brooks are even more concise .	-2.1122
'It was an electoral massacre , ' he said .	-1.9543
'They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : ' If you register and when you vote , you will pass it here ' .	-3.7256
For almost a decade Cassandra Greene has led the Moore Ford Bridge ’ s annual assassination .	-3.5757
Their narrative is vivid , intriguing , and is rooted in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe is no longer present in America .	-5.9751
It is difficult to watch and even more difficult to look , but Greene said that this is the point .	-7.3970
" We do not want to talk about Lynch , because we then face its inadequacy in all of us , " she said .	-3.8467
" But I cannot build a relationship with you if you do not want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have done through " .	-6.6544
The samples for this year 's production started in June , and on the first day , almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest of black - moved into a room and listened as Greene launched a well-read overview of the play .	-5.8758
Wade Marbaugh is here Greenes Co director .	-2.3447
He has been playing the role of chief clan for years , but he said the role will never be easier .	-3.0037
" I feel dirty because I am not so , " said Marbaugh .	-1.9380
'But I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return to these times ' .	-2.4834
On the other side of the room , actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona , playing Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester , played their lines .	-3.6134
The play starts with Malcom , who shouts and afflicts him , angry that he slept with his wife Dorothy .	-3.7528
'I said n --- he , disappears of my property ! '	-1.9618
Rascona restores the fire .	-2.9337
There is a pause .	-1.0397
And then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .	-2.8469
Greene laughs the loudest .	-1.6595
" What ! " asked Rascona .	-9.1802
He is alarmed and confused .	-0.7416
Was I too harsh ?	-1.1283
'No ' , Greene said , still kicking .	-2.0232
" I just don 't think that white people then said ' n ' .	-4.0496
" But " , " one of the other black actors joked .	-4.0136
'You just have to hit the hard ' R. ' .	-1.3773
And that is where the energy moves in the room , a sense of friendship replaces unease .	-3.8861
Everyone is busy getting this right , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four people killed .	-4.0081
The scene starts again .	-1.3974
This time , when Rascona says the N word , he says it sharp and forcefully .	-3.5221
Absolutely nobody laughs .	-2.5217
This repetition ends by force and quickly .	-2.4079
There are cries , shots and then silence .	-1.8932
A woman dressed with a mourning voice is over the body of the actors and performs Billie Holidays 's mourning commentary " Strange Fruit " .	-6.2505
Her voice breaks at every second word .	-2.2361
About a hundred meters behind it , a group of about four dozen spectators scrambling sweat and tears from their eyes .	-4.2196
The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white .	-1.5135
A pair has moved from Ithaca , New York to see the performance , many just down the road .	-4.0936
They experienced Georgian depressing humidity every nearly eight hours when Brooks led them to the graves of Malcoms and Dorsey on a pilgrimage journey .	-4.4687
Up to this point , the murders have remained an anecdote , but now , when you stand on the same land where the Lynch murders took place , the air feels conspicuous .	-4.3710
When the last notes of the song end , Greene invites the amount to come closer and inspect the body name .	-3.9019
Children hook to their heads , register the falsified blood and the silent bodies and whispers to each other .	-3.9953
" They are not really dead " , mumbles a little boy as he would remember .	-2.9914
After a few minutes Greene of the crowd thanks - and suddenly it 's over .	-2.8481
Actors throw the lynchpart away and wipe out their tears .	-3.0546
Bradshaw embraced Marbaugh , the man in suit that played the clan member .	-3.2710
Nick Rascona revolves around two of his fellow players and then breaks down in their arms , the emotional burden of performance finally breaks with him .	-5.9189
" It is okay " , whispers one of the women .	-1.9077
" We know that is not in your heart .	-1.3035
You did so for one reason . '	-1.3282
Later the audience met the actors for dinner .	-2.6519
On a table , a white pair of Atlanta stimulates the reproduction with a black pair that they just met .	-3.9967
Denise Duplinski fought to find words that left the feeling of performance .	-2.2164
" It is difficult to hear these terrible words and deeds ... from people who look like you and who do this because they look like you , " she said .	-3.2080
'What this really does with me makes me believe that the lynch is still going on ' , she added , ' today it is called only police blueprint ' .	-5.9357
In the same room , Tyrone Brooks Hof holds at his table , eating and remembering civil rights .	-3.1469
He said he already started planning the performance next year .	-2.7313
" In a way , reproduction is inspiring , because it describes the horror of what we have endured , but it is also a moment of learning , " he said .	-9.0299
" It is the case that we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again .	-4.1803
Anyone who does not study their own history is condemned to repeat it . '	-2.5762
" Gods Dawn " reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth .	-2.7549
In the fourth part of Richard Wagner ’ s monumental work , director Frank Castorf places a colourful frivole staging with a huge six-story .	-5.2838
The revolving stage ( designed by Aleksandar Denic ) displays a shabby street corner , including the Wall and Dönerbude in Berlin , a plastic and elastic logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange .	-6.6403
Before that , an open Mercedes-Oldtimer is parked , in which the Rhine fathers position as rockergirls , or alternatively a Isetta .	-6.9485
A stacked oil barrels remind Castorf ’ s leitmot - money , power and greed - that moves through his “ ring ” staging .	-6.2128

Brutal the scene when he beats Siegfried .	-2.2268
Later , Gunther ( Markus Eiche ) must believe this .	-3.2146
The audience thanks the ensemble with a strong applause .	-2.3166
Foster , Milling , Vinke and conductor Janowski are celebrated on a stormy , who is modest and formally shunning hands to the guy .	-7.2236
There is great applause for the festival orchestra , which will be on stage for the first time - again in the face of the great heat in a more relaxed fashion .	-7.3870
Frank Castorf and his regime team were eagerly awaited .	-3.1512
If he had to leave a yellow arrow concert in 2013 , five years later , there were great celebrations in which the single " hole " cries fell . the .	-14.4668
A festival leader Katharina Wagner should have been delighted with this .	-4.1969
" It is noticed that the audience has in some way been combined with the " ring " , " she said shortly before the performance of dpa .	-5.7604
The audience not only made a form of peace with Castorf , but also an understanding of how Castorf looks .	-4.7922
I have a positive feeling .	-2.6239

The US Environmental Protection Agency has removed a decision to delay regulation of the Obama administration , under which states are obliged to reduce the amount of smog-causing emissions , one day after 15 countries complained about taking the Agency .	-7.6067
The EPO late on Wednesday announced the decision to push forward the so-called ' ozone legislation 2015 ' , and said it was showing the Agency 's commitment to cooperate with states .	-5.3527
" We believe in dialogue with and in responding to our state partners , " said EPA CEO Scott Pruitt in a statement .	-2.6647
In June , Pruitt announced the EPAs ’ intention to delay the ozone regulations - in which pollutant emissions are to be measured in one part of the country in order to determine where cuts must be made to meet stricter air quality standards - by one year until October 2018 .	-5.0729
A group of 15 largely democratic states , together with the Colombia district , filed a complaint on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .	-3.6801
President Donald Trump ’ s administration has tried to reduce a wide range of environmental requirements imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that Trump claims to boost economic growth .	-3.4450
The efforts have , however , triggered a setback by the Democrats and nature conservation groups , which are concerned about the impact of greater emissions on public health .	-4.8405
The EPO website says that breathing air that contains ozone can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms " such as asthma .	-4.3592
Community Space :	-1.9462
In the end , the decision was clear : in the case of two votes against , the local council of Fluorn-Winelel decided to set up a common space in the future senior residential area .	-6.7901
Before the discussion there is an important information : the purchase contract for the missing property has been signed , Mayor Bernhard Tjaden reports .	-4.6092
Although it will still be a long time before the communal area , which previously belongs to the church community , there is now no obstacle to planning a private investor project .	-7.0426
There is a discussion about a Community area for this .	-3.5247
One of the two investors still in the boat has offered to attend the community .	-3.0540
On the ground floor , it would provide a living area - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a surface area of 70 square meters for a special price .	-4.1485
The administration and the majority of the local council have the right not to provide such a common area as a meeting place only for the inhabitants of the Provincial Resident but to open it into the community .	-8.1809
As an example the word " knickcafé " made the round .	-3.3715
The decision , which was pre-decided by allocating funds for the current budget as early as last autumn , will be accompanied by funding .	-4.9947
The building is located in the sanctuary area .	-3.5188
The establishment of a Community area , Tjaden reports , would be eligible for a 60 % increase .	-4.2253
The proposed decision , in order to signal to the investor that he would not be lumped between his legs in this regard , suggests that both the saddle - which is linked to the environment - and the Pultroof - would be possible , reducing the height of the grape and building economic power .	-9.1301
Needless to say , Wilfried Sommer does not just mean this addition .	-9.1237
If it helps : unanimity happens to the board .	-4.0359
It is not as easy as the Community area is .	-2.8789
Daniela 's reputation refers to the many buildings with which we are not so much moved forward , which are now being rejected in the common room from the window , she says : ' I am doing my bit hard ' .	-8.8367
Yvonne Staiger is absolutely in favour of the Community area , but totally against local participation .	-3.7784
It views a hidden subsidy to already positive or even foreign investors .	-4.3342
This is not the case , because buying the surface does not give any subsidy , but rather gets a real value that can be marketed in doubt , is the counter .	-8.0392
Staiger ’ s request to properly split up the draft decision has three supporters .	-6.3845
So there are two opposing votes in the original programme that Stefan Haller summarises : ' If we take the decision in this way , we will take a huge step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure ' .	-5.4240
Collision by Car : Cycling on the street	-4.5736
On the crossing of the road an 82-year-old cyclist was captured by a car on Wednesday in Garath and seriously injured .	-4.4402
As the police said , the 82-year-old Langenfelder was on his bicycle at 12.20 p.m. on the Schwarzer Way from Hilden .	-5.5294
The senior wanted to cross the train in the height of the Am Buchholzer Busch .	-3.2775
A passenger car leader in the same direction gave him priority .	-3.1391
When the Langenfelder took to the streets , he obviously did not pay attention to the other traffic .	-6.7243
He got together with a car that steered a 66-year-old Hildenerin .	-3.4734
The man was thrown to the streets .	-2.9389
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to a hospital with a rescue trucks .	-3.3958

This was confirmed by the Italians on Friday .	-1.7118
The Munich-based Manuel Neuer , James , Thiago , Jerome Boateng , Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat are also missing .	-2.4866
Ancelotti was responsible for the five defeats in the last six battles .	-4.4147
" We know we are not in the best physical constitution , " said Ancelotti and added : " The most important point is the balance in the team .	-9.1317
That was not good recently . '	-1.9526
However , the 58-year-old believes in a performance increase during the season 's first official lap .	-4.5397
" Football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation .	-0.8971
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .	-2.0627
The team is ready .	-0.6999
We want to play intelligent , " said Ancelotti , who expects a " difficult , intense game " .	-2.5887
The duel of the two German football awards is attracting the fans .	-4.2038
The match was sold out with 81.360 spectators , sharing the German Football League ( DFL ) on Friday .	-2.9896
Walking from Stern to Stern in Harz	-7.3136
The first " star-path " is to be developed at Harz in Germany .	-4.6805
This is what the Verein Sternwarte Sankt Andreasberg is planning to . in the . , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-7.6899
There is a route of planets in Göttingen - since 2003 .	-3.8872
A " star-trail " came close to the information needs of many visitors , it was said .	-5.8662
It combines nature , science , movement and sporting performance .	-1.9181
Members want to set up panels along the planned route and then inform about stars and constellations .	-4.7849
In the first phase up to 2018 the Association plans " well accessible installations in five to six locations " in the Oberharz .	-5.1180
Infrastructure came from St. Andreasberg , Braunlecht , Hoheegei<unk> and Sieber .	-5.4975
The information on the panels should be supplemented via internet .	-3.0190
That is why a good mobile network reception is important in choosing a location .	-4.1658
Accessibility is also a criterion .	-1.7885
Later , the Star-Train is to be expanded by Zug .	-4.4413
" On the starppath the viewer will learn a lot of interesting facts , for example about the physics of individual stars , " said the association .	-6.6113
Moreover , they learned why stars had different colors or why a star shines more than another , even though it was much further away .	-11.0426
It will also be mediated in which constellation a selected star is located and when it is best to see .	-4.8942
The association has operated the highest situated observatory in northern Germany since 2014 in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg .	-4.1618
According to the Federal Office for Nature Protection , the location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany .	-3.7423
From there , you can see the Milky Way and even the Andromeda galaxy with your eye .	-3.7844
Since 2003 , at the initiative of the Planetarium Göttingen , in the city of Uni there has been something similar to the planned advertisement - the Planetenweg .	-6.4259
Starting in front of Gebhards Hotel in Goetheallee , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planetary path , with its steles , leads up to the Hainberg and the Sternwarte - as well as a " extraterrestrial " site in Diemarden ( municipality of equals ) with the planet Sedna .	-7.3588
The steels with the individual planets - including the degraded pluto at the final point - are set at exactly the distance and scale of one to two billion .	-4.9248
The Earth thus shrinks on a sphere of 6.5 millimeters in diameter , while the exact 75 metres away sun measures 70 centimetres .	-6.0507
The entire distance of the Planetenweg is about four kilometres .	-3.6366
While light requires about eight hours from sun to pluto , pedestrians need a good hour to Stele with Pluto .	-4.3865
Pedestrians are therefore faster than light in the world .	-2.9707
But the march to the next fix star would last half a year .	-2.7138
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko are meeting for the first time , discussing a possible showdown .	-3.1673
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mike Garcia , who should be on a collision course to stage the most exciting pit fight in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .	-5.0466
They were in separate rooms in ESPN-Büros in Los Angeles , until Garcia , the unbeaten World Boxing Council lightweight champion , went down the corridor to greet Lomachenko , the World Boxing Organization Super-Day Champion .	-5.0149
After Garcia 's victory by unanimous decision on the former four-day World Champion Adrien Broner on Saturday at Showtime , both fighters are members of the top five pound-for pound list .	-4.3329

I wish you luck . '	-1.8326
Lomaenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday evening at 7 p.m. on ESPN . . the . the . the , , the , , , ,	-9.3304
When the pair posited photos , Lemachenko-Manager Egis Climate noticed that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the " perfect size " .	-5.1944
" I am a former feather weight " , recalled Garcia .	-2.0392
" I increased for Broner [ to 140 pounds ] , but I 'm not so big .	-2.2451
I am small for 140 .	-0.9672
I would like to come down on light weight .	-1.5690
And he must move on to lightweight [ 135 pounds ] and then we fight .	-2.4949
That is what the fans are asking for .	-2.0281
Let us give them that . '	-0.8485
Lomaenko voted in favour . the . the . the . the the . the the . the	-6.6912
'Boxing needs this fight ' .	-1.8803
Climate asked whether it should be on Pay-per-view , part of a strategy that Lommachenko must fight with a 135-pound debut this year to agree a date with Garcia next summer ( 37-0 , 30 Knockouts ) that also has an interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight title-fight in the Forum on 23 September .	-4.9946
" This fight could take place in pay-per-view mode because all the fans asked for it , " Garcia said , and later said openly to fight at the network that offers the best financial package .	-4.3499
We are the best .	-0.4896
No other name can generate this kind of attention .	-2.0525
Whenever they are ready ... "	-1.0770
Garcia said he valued Lomachenko as " an enormous fighter , " and he might be taking part in his Saturday fight .	-4.4905
But Lomachenko stopped at the generous praise for Garcia and said that he thought the tri-campaign champion from Riverside " look very slowly , I 'm sorry Mikey ... you wanted to co-Out " .	-7.5517
Garcia said the focus is to show strength , then boxes .	-2.0951
Both said they could feel the momentum that was building for their own fight .	-3.6475
" This is the fight that must be carried out .	-2.1112
No other fight attracts so much attention and enthusiasm .	-1.6948
I am more than happy to work on it , " said Garcia .	-1.5316
Lomachenko said : " I waited for the top fighters , and that is Mikey .	-3.8468
It will be a great struggle . '	-1.7171
Four Injured to Reifencer	-2.2696
In the event of an accident on the A7 , on Thursday afternoon , four people were partially injured .	-2.9855
According to the first information , the driver of an Opel Zfira lost control of his vehicle at 4.30 p.m. just before the junction of the market width .	-6.8132
The car dragged to the right into the bad guys , where he fell over and then on the roof in the green strip .	-6.7651
The four occupants - two adults and two children - were partly seriously injured in the accident .	-2.1314
During the first care of the injured by the rescue service , the A7 was closed to the north for about one hour , then the traffic on the left lane on the accident site could be switched off .	-7.5109
Fortunas Hoffmann : ' Tripartite works better '	-4.6179
Andre Hoffmann hopes for the second : 2 season start against Braunschweig that optimizing the defense formation in Aue points .	-4.7339
Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the first season , and the result would not have been the two counterparts against Braunschweig .	-5.9032
" The two opposing forces were too much , and we have to be even more careful in Aue , " says Fortuna Düsseldorf 's defender .	-10.0122
In the Erzgebirge the three-mountain chain is also to be optimised .	-4.1989
And a gate after a push , the forrest no longer want to capture .	-6.3342
" For the future , it will be like no longer standing next to Michael ( Rensing ) . "	-4.3160
Hopfmann is convinced that his team can cope better after the experience in the preparation with the three-string than with the four-string .	-6.8617
" I do not yet know how we will operate in Aue " , says his coach Friedhelm Funkel , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , " because we have players in the trio chain on the half positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gie<unk>telmann who can build well , " said Hoffmann .	-6.5401
'It is a prerequisite , but we need to harmonize even better and we do not make so many mistakes in the construction . '	-6.6121
Of course Hoffmann also goes to Aue to win the game .	-2.4434
" But whether you can speak of a failed start after a draw doesn 't know .	-3.7622
Hoffmann said that the performance could be quite okay .	-4.1047
'But if we can stand by four points on Sunday and concentrate on the Cup , we will certainly be able to speak of a proper season . '	-4.8351
His trainer didn 't want to know about that .	-5.4865
" I only judge the start of the season after six to eight days of play , " Friedhelm Funkel said , who does not want to speak of an advantage over Aue , just because the game of Saxony in Heidenheim had to be cancelled prematurely because of a storm .	-5.5156
" Now they can almost begin the season with a home game , " said Funkel and Hoffmann believes that the Aue players might be a little more fresh , because they would not have a hard and complete game like Fortuna for an uprising favorite in the bones .	-7.2828
" But they don 't know as 100 % where they currently stand , " says the inner defender of Fortuna .	-4.2324
Admittedly , guests from the Rheinland go as a lighter favorite on Sunday in the meeting at finally ( almost ) finished stadium of Aue .	-5.3745
" That we sweep them away just because we are entitled to come under the first six is stupid , " says Funkel , whose balance sheet is very positive with only one defeat against Aue from nine games .	-5.9946
" There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga that must be beaten from the outset , " says Fortunas Chefcoach .	-4.2602
" To make such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant . "	-1.7411
So Funkel doesn 't want to experience Sunday 's players in any way .	-3.6228
New results from the Swedish Asylum Age Review Test published	-4.0533
The recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , which have been subjected to a new method of medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 % of the people tested are older than 18 years , but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .	-5.0421
The Swedish Institute for Forensic Medicine ( Rattsmedinalverktet ) has started to conduct the tests last year .	-5.1852
They should clarify age assessment during the asylum process after the Swedish migration authority ( migrant sale ) was criticised for mistakes in assessing the correct age of some refugees , who were minor years . . the country the country the , , and the the , the , the , , , the , , and , the , , the the the ,	-20.4395
To this day , Migratingverkot has sent out 6,880 cases to be tested and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from the period from mid-March to 31st July 2017 .	-6.0610
Eighty percent ( 2002 ) were judged to be 18 or older , while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the person was " possibly 18 years or older " .	-3.3143
In 432 cases , the conclusion was that the person is " possibly under 18 years old " .	-2.1386
Tests are carried out only in cases where the person 's age is called into question .	-2.6045
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency , the results have been consistent over the past few months .	-3.2146
" We see no big difference in the statistics of recent months , the numbers are fairly constant , " he said the journal The Local .	-2.8465
The high proportion of cases in which the person was judged to be over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has lied over his age .	-3.5807
In May , the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases ' suggesting that the investigated person is 18 years or older ' .	-3.6254
When the Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results , she found that in 243 of these cases , the person had openly said that it would be 18 years old this year .	-3.8038
The method of medical age assessment , where X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRT recordings are made by knee joints , which are then analysed by dentists and radiologists , has also been criticised in some areas .	-5.9712
A skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute , whose work includes assessing people ’ s biological maturity to see whether sooner or later they were usually puberty .	-4.2575
" I had reason to think about this and I do not believe that the type of measurement should be used .	-2.7010
To assess the biological age in this way is very uncertain .	-2.5858
If we cannot say it safely , we should not pretend we could , " he said in the newspaper .	-3.5838
Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of tests : " Generally , you can say that the risk of a child being misjudged as an adult is low .	-3.8439
The biggest risk is if the person is just under 18 , in this case this is about 10 % . '	-3.7034
Full in the Plan	-0.5854
Work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well .	-2.5020
On Wednesday a seven tonnes of heavy concrete part was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach .	-3.6194
" We are very good at the time , it 's running super , " says Reinhold Leicht , leader of the road and transport department in the office of Freiburg .	-5.3738
In April , work started at the same time on all three bridges in need of reconstruction between Schramberg and Lauterbach .	-3.3024
The end is scheduled for October and we are sure that the timetable will be met .	-4.3292
The first bridge , coming from Schramberg , leads across the trombach .	-2.6419
It is a vaulted arch bridge made of concrete , dressed with red buntsandstein and has a total length of 4.80 meters .	-4.4015
It was built in 1900 .	-1.3357
Like the other two bridges , it has come into the year .	-4.1028
To ensure stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly refurbished .	-4.7850
The other two bridges cross Lauterbach .	-2.0917
They are made of red brick .	-3.3084
Both were built in 1939 and were twelve , or 10.60 meters long .	-2.4425
The bridge at the entrance to Lauterbach at the entrance of Lauterbach has now received a 1.30 meter wide bridge cap on the north side on Wednesday morning and seven tons heavy .	-5.7816
This is a marginal fixing which is also used as an operating route .	-4.0300
On the southern part of the bridge a 2.20 meter wide bridge cap will be used on Friday .	-3.1917
This is the route that the pedestrian should take .	-4.0930
The fact that they are finished parts is a patent of the Schramberg company Dizbo .	-4.8071
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps .	-2.0658
The laying of lines through the building in Lauterbach was particularly pointless .	-4.7804
Because there is also a fiberglass cable that many companies are connected to .	-4.2044
Residents were informed of the project in advance of their work by handcraft .	-4.3512
In addition , fish and cancer had to be fished out first .	-3.4809
For bridges between the building farm building and the collector ’ s wine in the direction of Schramberg , traffic is regulated once by a traffic light .	-5.9814
For building work on the bridge at the Lauterbacher entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of hotels " Tannenhof " and " Seven Linden " is completely closed .	-3.9037
The cost of the three bridge renovation operations is EUR 700 000 each .	-3.4241
The whole thing is financed by the country .	-1.6623
AfD in Gerolstein : Bunter Protests in German potato salad	-2.2029
It doesn ’ t happen so often that parties pull together , but when it comes to the Alternative for Germany ( AfD ) , they come together , which is difficult to reconcile .	-5.5334
The parties ( CDU , SPD , Grüne , FDP , FWG , Left ) held during the Volcanoifel Circle Day belong to a broad alliance that shows this day peacefully flag , because the AfD invites in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle Rondell to the poster " great campaign launch " .	-7.9631
And known names start – like Alice Weidel , who together with Alexander Gauland forms the top duo for the federal election on September 24 , and the Vice-Chairman Beatrix of Storch .	-5.3452
But those who have been there for hours before the event begins do not want to listen to the AfD people , but rather demonstrate .	-5.6211
The motto " The Eifel remains colorful " .	-2.7096
Originally the town picnic was planned under the motto " All an table " on the Brunnenplatz , but now takes place on the parking area below the Rondell - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the city hall .	-6.6247
A colorful picture is waiting for you .	-3.4936
And what Christa Karoli , Chairman of the One World Forum and one of the most authoritative organizers , really is pleased : " I love how many people have come here .	-6.6456
There is music and a lot of food , including a " German potato salad , which the AfD could easily eat " , says the woman who brought him with him .	-5.2459
The police have ordered many officials to Gerolstein , and it is also present at the station , which is only a few metres from the venues .	-9.7064
How did the AfD actually come on Gerolstein ?	-1.8864
Mario Hompes from the AfD Volcanoifel reports that he was looking for such an event and got the chance .	-6.5571
The 45-year-old from Günnersdorf had first asked for his resignation , but got a cancellation there because of the already built Laurentiuskirmes there was not enough parking space .	-7.5312
Now the Rondell , Hompes is pleased that " we can have such a nice event here " .	-4.3412
With a view to the event on the Rondelafplatz he says : " This is the good right of the people , the main thing is that it remains peaceful " .	-5.7123
This is also true : around 8 o 'clock there is a band for entertainment on the Rondelvorplatz , in the city hall several speakers , including the Rhineland-Pfalsischer AfD Chairman Uwe Junge .	-7.6447
There are around 200 listeners waiting for the top runners for the federal election , Alice Weidel , and the Vice-Chairman Beatrix of Storch to make their speeches .	-5.6128
The police presence is still unchanged , but so far the officials have had a quiet evening .	-2.8470
The AfD event lasts a little more than an hour , the guests on the ground floor have a longer breath , but there is also planned to clean up shortly after 9 p.m.	-6.5054
The police can depart - no special events .	-2.7837

He said he was sorry for ' all the athletes who were cut away from gold and silver medals at competitions ' .	-4.2744
Despite his comments , the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 , after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia .	-2.8494
" I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , " said IAAF President Coe to the reporters .	-2.0938
'The entire Council and Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation itself realised that it had experienced some fairly hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation was reshaped ' .	-4.9722
Coe said that he was also ' happy ' about Russia accepting the criteria for its reintroduction .	-6.4296
" I think it was a very constructive day , and I think progress has been made , but the Congress supports the recommendations of the task force that this is not the moment to reinstate Russia , " said Coe .	-3.1022
" We must do everything in the next few months to normalise this situation .	-2.4762
The guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate clean athletes from the dead system , " he added .	-2.1882

Doubts about the UN mission in Mali did not reveal to the Leyen Minister that the operation was dangerous .	-3.4219
But it is also very important ' for a country from which we are only divided by two states , ' she said .	-3.7047
The coffins were brought from the Cathedral after the ceremony .	-3.2025

Traditionally , the Danish Royal Spaar is added to the Cathedral of Roskilde .	-3.7257
The sculptor Bj<unk>rn N<unk>rgaard already made a sarcophagus for the two .	-2.2824
The queen agreed with her husband ’ s decision , which was further stated in the communication .	-3.5816
Where Prince Henrik is buried , it is still unclear .	-1.6288
But he does not intend to be buried in his French home .	-3.0324
Prince Henrik had never made a secret of his being unhappy with his title .	-2.8917
After the throne landing of his wife Margrethe in 1972 , he would have liked to have been king .	-4.0317
In 2016 , he retired and renounced the title " prince number " .	-5.6322
Since Henrik had not been given the title and function he wanted , he did not see himself as equal to his wife - even after death , Lene Balsheet , the chief reporter of the Danish Royal House .	-6.5222
Where the final resting place of the 83-year-old will be , it is still unclear .	-2.7206
But he does not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .	-3.5991
He likes the country he has worked for over the past 50 years .	-2.2711
The native Henri de Laborde de Monpezat , son of a French nobleman , had met Margrethe in London in 1965 .	-2.6152
He worked on the theme in the French Embassy .	-2.0744
During his later wife , Prince Henrik had a difficult position among Danes in his almost 50 years of regency .	-5.2591
In a autobiography , Henrik spoke about the first years in Denmark : " A few months after my arrival , everything I did was criticized .	-3.2444
My Danish was fluctuating , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk stockings instead of soft socks , Citro<unk>n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .	-3.7552
Even for the Gauloises , who I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation here of being the brand of critically acclaimed intellectuals , I could not hope for forbearance .	-5.6457
I was different .	-0.7007
I seemed pleased with this position and not ashamed .	-2.3942

Prime Minister Weil wants a swift re-election	-2.7812
CDU and FDP before a possible majority in Lower Saxony	-1.6722
Lower Saxony Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) , after the loss of the red-green government majority , is in favour of a rapid re-election of the land , but he does not want to resign .	-8.8370
Because spoke on Friday for Parliament ’ s dissolution .	-2.3296
Previously , Prime Minister Stephan Weil ’ s government had plunged the surprise of a Green MEP from her country ’ s faction in Lower Saxony into a serious crisis .	-5.0656
Five months before the official election date , the red green coalition in Hanover lost its narrow one-time majority in parliament to the CDU and FDP opposition .	-3.5613
The previous Green MEP , Elke Twestn , established her move with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg ( Destruction ) .	-6.2583

CDU leader Björn Thumler wants to recommend his group to include them .	-2.5944
Thus , the CDU and FDP together would have 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Landtag , SPD and Green 68 seats .	-4.1176
So far , the ratio has been reversed .	-1.2640
The new land day is regularily elected on 14 January next year .	-3.2924
Thumler said that the Red Green Government now had to decide whether it could continue to rule without a majority in this situation .	-4.4155
Stephan Weil considers it essential that the day of land decide its self-resolution as soon as possible .	-5.0029
The CDU Group is expected to decide on how to proceed on Tuesday .	-1.9894
The country ’ s constitution also provides for the country ’ s day to lose the Prime Minister ’ s trust and elect a successor .	-4.5990
'Our Constitution offers several options .	-1.6336
These possibilities must be properly examined by law , " said Thumler .	-3.7156
'All issues will be discussed in a calm manner if they are legally reasonable . '	-4.8465
Thumler called Twestern ' something curiosities ' .	-4.5797
The politician himself stressed : ' I am not a traitor .	-2.4117
I feel very good ' .	-0.9372
She referred to herself as a supporter of black green .	-3.9654
The Greens called for the repatriation of their country 's mandate .	-3.8130
" Of course , we expect that it will immediately return its country mandate , which it has received through the green country list , " said the country 's chairman , Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner .	-7.9624
The Chairman of the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance , Anja Piel , said : ' We regret the decision taken by Elke Twestern ' .	-4.0959

German Chancellor Martin Schulz condemns the passing of Lower Saxony ’ s Green MEP Elke Twesten to the CDU as a betrayal .	-5.3834
" The behaviour of former Green MPs in Lower Saxony is not only betrayal of voters , but also betrayal of Rot-Green , " the head of the Social Democrats wrote on Facebook on Friday .	-3.9654
He supports Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) ’ s decision to have the land day reelected quickly .	-3.3637
Exit Twestern costs the majority Red Green in Lower Saxony .	-4.3548
The political unit " in its hurt vanity and frustration with her personal interests in the face of the country " , SPD Secretary-General Hubertus Heil criticized .	-10.5325
" It is scandalous that the CDU is taking part in Lower Saxony in this filthy game of indignation and trying to capitalize on it . "	-9.4258
Lower Saxony 's CDU Group leader Björn Thumler wants to recommend to his MPs that Elke Twest be included in the CDU .	-4.8905
The leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Oppermann , declared , with personal careers , to distort the outcome of the 2013 rural election .	-4.6637

Minister of Agriculture in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from poisonous eggs , Mr Schmidt ?	-2.4674
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs .	-0.9906
How could the scandal happen ?	-2.0197
How can consumers protect themselves .	-1.2868
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CSU ) is speaking and answering with the German editorial network ( RND ) . the . the the . the the . the the . the the	-9.0042
Mr Schmidt , how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs ?	-1.5300
I can only encourage all consumers to check the eggs in your fridge carefully and to check the stamping pressure .	-3.2645
At the consumer protection portal www.Food Warnung.de , the federal states provide the latest information on the egg charts concerned .	-5.4739
Those eggs should be destroyed or returned .	-2.3246
Even if , after everything we know at present , there is virtually no health risk .	-3.5904
Is Aldi now assuming the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of the supply - because the Federal Minister of Economics is not really aware of the central role of the enlighter ?	-5.8086
Food monitoring is a task for the Länder .	-1.9517
Nevertheless , my House has immediately turned on and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since it became known .	-5.8022
All information and risk assessment is available to consumers .	-2.1220
Trade , like the manufacturers , must ensure that the products sold are marketable and safe to health .	-4.2307
If eggs exceed the maximum residue content of 0.005mg / kg , they cannot be used .	-4.3653
Unburdened eggs can however be sold and consumed .	-2.7428
This time , businesses are not to blame .	-1.1445
Are manufacturing companies and consumers in the same boat ?	-2.4150
The current level of knowledge does not directly blame manufacturing companies .	-4.5074
Instead , they have to face economic damage as a result of presumably illegal practices by service providers . . , , , , , and .	-9.5502
As always , there are too few inspectors in the event of an emergency .	-2.1970
Is it just a matter of personal or coherent competence ?	-3.4928
It was , after all , the official controls that revealed the process .	-3.5134
The truth is , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 % excluded .	-2.6160
It is precisely for this reason that consistent information on such events and the transfer to public prosecutors in cases where criminal offences can be made is essential .	-5.7529
I have already made it clear on several occasions that I expect the authorities responsible to provide full information .	-3.2272
Is regular alarm in food scandals really necessary ?	-1.8462
Consumers have the right to obtain only safe and accessible food .	-2.3741
Consumers are rightly outraged when an insecticidal is used in the food industry .	-3.0259
The leaked money has placed manufacturers , dealers and consumers in a situation that is absolutely unnecessary .	-5.1832
The principle must be clear : the illegal use of the Fipronil insecticidal in the attitude of food-producing animals is unacceptable and must be brought to an immediate end .	-4.9972
Work on this must be consistent and strong at all levels .	-3.1448
I expect all the competent authorities to ensure that this matter is clarified quickly and completely .	-3.9819
How Football ’ s Financial Rules affect Neymar ’ s move to Paris	-5.9846
The rules aimed at preventing unrestricted expenditure by European football clubs will not disrupt Neymar ’ s world record transfer from Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain .	-4.9998
Some of the consequences will come from UEFA for Paris Saint-Germain , because the leading organization that oversees the European game has the power to ban teams from entering the prestigious Champions-League tournament .	-5.6749
Financial fair play rules set up by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will have to prove at some point that the Neymar transfer was financed without any major losses .	-4.7628
Barcelona has paid EUR 222 million ( $ 262 million ) to buy out the Brazilian from its treaty , and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several $ 10 million per year .	-3.9848
Here are some of the financial aspects of the move to France .	-1.9860
PSG certainly can relax the money to sign Neymar and bring it into a galaxy of other stars , given the financing of the team by the energetic wealthy Qatar family .	-6.0331
clubs may spend a lot of money on buying players , but they must compete with legitimate sources of revenue that allow them to play the break event point in their soccer related business .	-6.5236
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA president in 2007 .	-2.8596
Former French players believed that clubs that borrowed huge debts in their quest for success would effectively cheat and risk ruin if banks or owners withdrew their support .	-3.8058
In 2011 , FFP shifted from focus on club debt to monitoring its losses .	-2.7029
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a tougher issue .	-3.8709
During the current three-year FFFP deployment period , which will run until 2018 , clubs may lose $ 30 million .	-4.8808
And , though Platini fell into disfavor by the presidency in 2015 , his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to fight against excessive spending .	-3.8374
" Certainly FFFP is not dead and we will certainly strengthen the rules for the future , " said Andrea Traverso , who is responsible for FFP at UEFA , to The Associated Press last week .	-3.5547
Although the PSG paid the Neymar buy-out clause in a lump-sum , it may distribute the billing amount over the duration of its contract .	-4.3560
Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the revenue turnover for the next five years can be estimated at EUR 44.4 million in the annual accounts .	-5.0269
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 , along with Abu Dhabi , owned by Manchester City , hit the hardest sanctions .	-3.2042
The PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million ( then $ 82 million ) , which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and it was ordered that the team members for the 2014 / 15 Championship league remain limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 .	-5.6597
UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to overwrite financial supervision by blowing their revenue from companies linked to a club ’ s owners .	-5.3431
Whereas a Catholic company could sponsor PSG if the value of sponsorship were to exceed standard market rates , UEFA would not make this a legitimate income .	-4.3998
This was exactly what happened in 2014 , when UEFA decided that the value of PSA ’ s sponsorship was bloated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .	-3.2820
It has been reported that some of the PSG payments to Neymar could come from payments from the WM 2022 organizational committee in Qatar .	-3.9547
But PSG and Qatar 2022 denied that Neymar would become WM ambassadors , and such an manoeuvre could easily be found for UEFA regulators .	-4.3087
The sanctions against PSG so far mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules .	-2.1337
UEFA did not have preparatory discussions with PSG about Neymar 's transfer , said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .	-3.5429
They spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity , because they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation .	-3.4143
The most recent reports show that PSG achieved a profit of more than EUR 10 million in 2015 / 16 with a turnover of EUR 542.4 million .	-3.9753
Accounts for the last fiscal year have yet to be published .	-2.3999
PSG expects Neymar ’ s arrival to be a blessing for sponsoring deals , merchandising , and tricot sales .	-6.1910
The club assumes that sales will increase by at least 30 percent after signature .	-3.2107
The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players go and it tried to prevent Neymar ’ s departure by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP .	-4.2846
" It is a clear case of " financial doping " with the club and the state " , said the President of the La League , Javier Tebas , the Spanish daily newspaper AS regarding Qatar 's ultimate ownership of PSG .	-3.7317
Arsenal Manager Arsene Wenger , whose association is owned by an American sports tycoon , shares the reservations of La League against a state that finances a club .	-2.9416
" It is the consequence of ownership and this has completely changed the entire football landscape over the last 15 years " , Wenger said on Thursday .	-3.3807
" Once a country has an association , everything is possible .	-2.6129
It will be very difficult to respect financial fair play because you can have different paths or different interests when a country has such a large player to represent a country . '	-4.2795

Nostalgia goes into Wet Hot American Summer and Comrade Detective .	-2.6648
This repetition of the story is nostalgic at the same time because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 ’ s , for the 90 ’ s Grunge-Era ( when the thinkers David Wain and Michael Shostalter turned the Sketch comedy " The State " for MTV ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , like Elizabeth Banks , Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd , went to major things .	-6.3200
As a cultural artefact it is also a parody and a embodiment of our facebook capable era of permanent memories .	-3.2191
But as a franchise it feels like time is running out .	-2.0681
" First Day of Camp " functioned surprisingly well , not only because of its absurd humor ( it contained an original story for a talking can vegetable that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .	-4.4294
By being auctioned to the core of the gag - middle-aged actors play horny children who will grow up - they nevertheless failed to win back the last part of the joke .	-5.4844
" Ten Years Later " , with its adults now playing adults , is less emotionally rooted , and its parody is more based on the principle of poisoning , including a riff on the 90s Stalker movies like " The Hand That Rocks the Cradle " ( " The Hand , the Cradle " ) .	-6.1323

It ’ s a lot of fun to see Rudd ’ s eternal young , Matt Dillon ’ s sublime beard of " Singles " , whose former Big Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old boy .	-7.0085
These are the moments of random madness that could fuel this franchise like a kind of repetitive " Seven Up ! " series until he reaches what I consider to be his logical conclusion : " Wet Hot American Summer : Twenty Years Latin " , whose last scene will show the band how to visit the film premiere of " Wet Hot American Summer " .	-5.8849
" Comrade Detective " in Amazon is now reminiscent of a different kind of nostalgia : the revival of the Cold War of " The Americans " , the film " Atomic Blonde " and even " GLOW " with its East to West ringfight iconography .	-4.8027
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as director suggests to be a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two policemen as friends , two Bucharest officers fighting for truth , atheism and the road of Marxism Leninism .	-4.5091
The main roles - a hard-silked Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici , whose dialogues are synchronized by Channing Tatum ( also an actual producer ) and Joseph Gordon-Levit in English .	-5.1581
It is a brilliant idea .	-0.8818
But it is not much more than an idea .	-1.3576
There are some fine gags to see ( the police spend time watching chess on television , as Americans might do with football ) .	-3.9910
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate , Nick Offerman , Mahershala Ali and Chlo<unk> Sevigny - ensures a decent game ' Find out the voice ' .	-3.1530

With six long episodes , the comedy is not fast or often enough .	-4.5385

Since the summer of 2016 , the Public Prosecutor 's Office Konstanz has been investigating organised drug trafficking in the southern German region .	-3.8873
Between the prosecutors in Constanz and Palermo , there was frequent exchange and the investigators of Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .	-4.7212
Therefore , on Wednesday morning , four Palermo officials accompanied the great deal of action .	-3.9609
The investigation was carried out by Italian citizens with close contact with the Italian mafia .	-5.4744
The band should also have their hands on an incident on May 27 in Hüfingen , where several shots were fired into a restaurant early in the morning .	-6.6059
Lack in the Foreign Register	-3.5794
'Data from citizens who should not be present ' : according to a report , the foreign register in Germany is showing considerable shortcomings .	-5.3219
This leads to some serious misdecisions on asylum procedures .	-3.4124
According to a media report , the Federal Government ’ s Refugee Management Commissioner , Frank Jürgen Weg , has drawn attention to large gaps in the Ausländerzenregister .	-5.4320
Defects in the data registered there could ' lead to serious misunderstandings ' in asylum procedures and deportations , warned in an analysis presented by the ' South German newspaper ' .	-5.1285
The register claims that ten million people are registered with foreign citizenship , including some 5.7 million from non-EU countries .	-4.5109
The data will therefore be managed by approximately 600 foreign authorities in Germany .	-3.0587
Because the data has not been properly maintained , the data quality has not been good in parts up to now . .	-10.4612
In individual cases , data from 1921 were found , ' from people who have not lived for a long time or from citizens who have become German citizens and should not actually appear in the register ' .	-5.4391
" Flawed data input can considerably slow return processes , " the report continues .	-2.8471
Statistics on people who are eligible for travel also include EU citizens who are not required to leave .	-5.2181
Such false commitments , however , led to a distorted debate on how to deal with visa requirements , is thus stated in the analysis .	-5.7144
In the meantime , the Federal Government appears to have begun sending refugee families back to Italy with children under 16 when they arrived .	-4.5516
This emerges from an internal paper by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees ( BAMF ) , reports the New Osnabrücker Zeitung .	-9.0219
The paper therefore states that BAMF has been re-conducting these procedures ' with regard to families with children - with the exception of infants and infants - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . '	-6.4043
Since the end of 2014 , this was virtually impossible , as the paper points out the difficult situation on the ground .	-4.4241
Under the Dublin Agreement , the responsibility for refugees is the EU state they reach first .	-4.8856
If a migrant travels to another EU country , that state can return him to the country of entry .	-3.0827
The Office has now commented on the grounds that ' the capacity to receive families with underage children in Italy has significantly increased ' .	-6.3657
Italy has provided guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families .	-1.7558
Even the European Court of Human Rights ( EGMR ) considers these commitments to be sufficient .	-2.8668
Other EU countries would also send refugees back there under the Dublin Agreement .	-2.9851
The domestic political leader of the left-wing group in the Bundestag , Ulla Yelpke , criticized this decision : " Families with children are threatened with conditions of receiving human rights and threats to the welfare of the child because of the deficiencies in the Italian asylum system . "	-7.0480
The Second Best Result	-2.4358
In total , 220 litres of blood from people living in Oberreichenbach , the blood donation service was already available to other people .	-4.4295
At least of the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .	-2.3674
Most importantly , Jürgen Greule , who has meanwhile spent 100 liters of blood .	-5.4080
Traditionally , at the meeting of the council , the municipality appreciates the multiple willingness to donate blood .	-4.1836
" It is brilliant how our body is prepared for it and we pay respect to donors who provide their blood to others , even unselfish , " underscored Mayor Karlheinz Kistner .	-5.9308
" One blood donation helps several people " , explained the director of the German Red Cross ( DRK ) , Holger Maisenbacher , because the cans are disintegrated into their components .	-5.3990
This would allow three people to benefit from blood donation .	-3.0438
Maisenbacher also reported about the actions that will take place in Oberrichenbach in spring .	-3.5057
" This year , with 114 donors , we achieved the second best result , " said the DRK Project Manager .	-3.4566
Obviously , changes to the Theaterhaus a few years ago have led to higher numbers of participants .	-4.0025
Even before that , Thomas Bockstadt , Susanne Reichle , Sandra Schöck , Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer joined multiple donors and received 50 blood donations each .	-3.5590
Half as many as were recorded by Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger , while Tamara Prommer , Petra Schleeh , Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter ten times per 500 milligres of their lifestyle .	-5.9671
The Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25 %	-1.2881
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and inflation weakening have dampened speculation about growth .	-12.9899
The Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain ' low ' when it attached interest rates to family income in the midst of growing pressure .	-4.2883
The Bank ’ s Monetary Committee ( MPC ) policymakers voted to hold interest rates to 0.25 % , with fewer members seeking an increase this month , as weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase .	-4.5454
In its quarterly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts to 1.7 % in 2017 and 1.6 % in 2018 , warning that the pressure on household incomes would continue , with inflation expected to rise to just under 3 % in the autumn .	-3.4141
But they signaled that interest rate hikes would be needed in the next few years to rein in the inflation fueled by Brexit , and said that borrowing might have to rise more than expected in financial markets .	-4.2698
Members also voted to withdraw part of the Mammut restructuring package issued one year after Brexit .	-3.3700
It will demand time for the financing plan to allocate cheaper funding to banks from next February , although it has been said that it is now expected to provide GBP 15 billion more under this system - at GBP 115 billion .	-5.0619
minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : ' In the MPC ’ s central prognosis , gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak in the short term , as pressure on real household income continues to weigh consumption . '	-5.5680
As for interest rates , it reiterated that ' a certain tightening of monetary policy ' would be needed to cool inflation and a ' slightly greater ' level than markets expect .	-4.9012
Markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .	-2.5895
The Bank stressed , however , that increases would be ' step-by-step ' and ' limited ' . .	-6.0127
The Bank ’ s revised growth forecasts for this year and next are relative to the 1.9 % forecast in May and 1.7 % .	-3.4983
It has maintained its growth projection to 1.8 % in 2018 .	-2.0249
The pound fell after that news against the dollar and the euro .	-1.7378
The pound fell by 0.5 % to $ 1.31 , down by 0.4 % to $ 1.11 .	-1.8408
The decision not to change comes after the recent disappointing growth figures have dampened rising expectations for a rate hike , and GDP rose from 0.2 % in the second quarter to 0.3 % in the previous three months .	-4.6773
Growth is expected to reach 0.3 % in the third quarter , even though after the bank will easily recover by the end of the year .	-3.3990
The latest inflationary report offered little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and minor wage increases , as tightening will first become even worse before it gets better .	-5.4852
She added that monetary policy cannot " prevent the collapse of income in the next few years , " but she added that , by the end of her three-year prediction , wages will " recover significantly " .	-5.1774
The economy is also strengthened by rising demand for British goods , owing to the weak pound , which will compensate for some of the lower consumer spending .	-3.8335
The decision comes one year after lowering interest rates to 0.25 % last August , following the shocking EU vote that caused the pound to fall .	-3.0404
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years to achieve total prices and the economy .	-2.6876
Before the Bank ’ s last judgment on interest rates , the call for an increase in interest rates had risen , as inflation increased the pressure on hard-pressed households , with three policymakers demanding an increase of 0.5 % in July .	-4.5564
Last month inflation fell from 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % , even though the Bank said that it was expected to do so and will continue to grow in the coming months .	-4.2591
The Bank said that the excesses relative to its 2 % target were " entirely " attributable to the weak pound .	-3.2523
Andrew Montlake , director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers , said : " Given the recent decline in the swap rates , the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again , because lenders are clamouring for business and want to end the year positively .	-5.4368
The market looks particularly good for those with existing deals expire and with new mortgages , and many with free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . '	-8.8843
NHS ( The National Health Service ) is to prescribe 10,000 controversial HIV drugs .	-2.9844
Patients will receive access to " transformative " HIV prevention treatment from September following a fight before the High Court against the funding of the NHS drug .	-4.4245
NHS England announced that a pre-exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) introduced before sexual intercourse , which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 % , will now be delivered by the health service over a first three-year study for 10,000 people .	-5.7988
He agreed to finance the process after the Court of Appeal confirmed a ruling of the Supreme Court last year , according to which the NHS had the power to pay for PrEP despite the claims that local authorities should finance it .	-5.3906
The coup announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS English-chief Simon Stevens as " important new intervention " , while the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) called this a " decisive moment " .	-4.9271
Sexual health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool , and Sheffield will be among the first to allow people to register , and more clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced in April 2018 across England .	-3.6993
Preexposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) is a result of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .	-6.9258
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces transmission of HIV to infectious people .	-3.0508
Taking PrEP before sexual intercourse means that there are just enough drugs in a person ’ s body to prevent HIV infection .	-3.3803
Such medicines can be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse .	-8.6654
Those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men , transsexuals , and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated .	-8.8396
Clinics identify suitable participants who agree to the study , including men , women , transgenders , and individuals with a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti-retroviral treatment .	-3.3987
People who live in England and are registered with a family doctor can also participate in their local sex clinic .	-4.1941
The program is signed <unk> 10 million and NHS England a contract to supply drugs this week after an international competitive procurement .	-3.4243
The study aims to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence , as is targeted , recorded and implemented on a large scale .	-4.4291
Stevens said : " This major new intervention should complement and surpass the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .	-2.6951
It is another milestone in the progress made over three decades in addressing one of the greatest health challenges facing humanity . '	-3.9115
Deborah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National Aids Trust ) , said : " This is a decisive moment in the fight against HIV .	-2.1026
If PrEP is targeted at vulnerable and vulnerable people , PrEP can change the English HIV epidemic .	-3.3328
From September to September , people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many lives .	-4.0380
We very much welcome this announcement ' .	-1.2874
Ian Green , Chairman of the Terrence Higgins Trust , said : " The priority now must be for the study to be carried out quickly across the country , and that no one at risk of HIV should be left behind .	-4.8114
Now that PrEP test medicine has been obtained , we are on the way to protect more than 10,000 people infected with HIV . '	-4.1487
Sharon Hodgson , Shadow Health Minister , said : " The start of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delay and delay by the government .	-2.8883
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and stop the transmission of this life-changing infection .	-3.0021
This attempt brings us a step closer to the understanding of the advantages of PrEP .	-2.6626
It is now important that this study be carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected with HIV and that they will help us to move closer to ending the spread of HIV in society ' .	-5.0478
Living the great life : intermediate floor and clever designer tricks have transformed these little Earls Court apartment into a spacious home .	-3.7339
In 2014 , Joanne Leigh , a former real-estate banker , narrowed from a large House in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment .	-4.1503
It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags .	-3.5044
" Before that I lived in a much larger room with my ex-in Knightsbridge , " Joanne says .	-2.9506
" I was looking for something comparable to my price .	-1.2703
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings .	-2.0049
I fell in love with her and made an offer on that day ' .	-2.2399
Since its first visit , the 1,000 square foot of the house has been completely overtaken .	-3.9798
Originally a single room property with a nested layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add space and a intermediate floor to make the most of the spacious ceilings .	-5.2782
" I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .	-1.5181
That was my request , " she says .	-1.6695
To this end , she commissioned the Notting Hill architecture and design studio Duck & Shed from Erfan Azadi to use the 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne .	-4.9230
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other , so the architectural challenge was to create a intermediate level where one could stand .	-4.0610
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the task .	-2.4571
" The steel mill is quite complicated , " he explains .	-2.3028
" We had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked on top of each other , without having to buck ourselves .	-5.4991
It was not just a matter of building a simple platform , but of putting the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . '	-4.6849
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms in full height on top of each other - with a lot of additional drama .	-4.1274
A classic copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area for the intermediate .	-4.6504
Played gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program .	-2.5089
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .	-1.8232
A short corridor is mirrored at both ends to allow it to work longer .	-3.1436
In the kitchen the reflection feels like a window in another room .	-2.6510
At the entrance , mirrored units offer space for all the cutlery and glasses of Joanne .	-3.2511
By perceiving a glamorous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .	-3.0546
The staff were very friendly and helpful .	-4.7696
What is special about this is that it is a guarantor house .	-3.8199
" A little bit of engineering went there , " explains Erfan of the steel reinforced , thin MDF door .	-4.2160
'It is counterweight so that when you push the door very easily slides ' .	-3.6877
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Joanne gained an additional 16 m <unk> , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .	-3.2625
" At the end of the day you will sell the site - or how your property is appreciated " , Erfan says .	-3.4090
'A real estate broker will occur in a ruby form and perform a calculation based on the size of the soil ' .	-5.2614
Here they have managed to enlarge the surface of the soil and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the space its luxurious advantage .	-5.2955
" The materials are the things you touch and thus help create an emotional bond in a home , " says Erfan .	-3.0919
" You don 't fall in love with the electrical sockets in the walls .	-2.4494
They are important , but they do not play with your heart . '	-1.6285
It shows that an apartment can be transformed into something quite astonishing by design and by increasing the number of square meters .	-10.7212
In fact , like Joanne , you might decide not to leave them .	-2.2607
Brothers are struggling for a $ 500 million real-estate empire .	-3.1967
Two brothers , four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty , are in conflict with one of Victoria ’ s largest real-estate imperatives , worth more than $ 500 million .	-4.0635
The former director of the ' Carlton Football Club ' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak , only three doors away from his younger brother Paul , who brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business wealth are to be shared .	-4.5307
Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp dispute about separation is taking place in the Supreme Court .	-3.8843
Together with her mother Anna , brothers have collected 38 homes worth more than half a billion dollars , since the family bought a store in Smith Street , Collingwood in 1973 .	-3.6968
The Westco Jeans family was founded there and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores .	-2.9868
It was sold for $ 85 million in 1999 .	-1.2107
This money has been invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the city centre , the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller and shopping centres in the suburbs .	-3.6840
After an agreement with her late father , Colin - described by Paul as " the main operator and the dominant personality " in the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of company assets and Paul about one-third .	-5.2537
A court act states that this means that Colin owns property worth $ 316 million and Paul worth $ 176 million .	-2.6344
The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .	-2.6075
" The departments suggested by Colin have left him with what I thought to be the best objects , " he wrote in a first affiliate in 2015 .	-5.3117
Last Friday , following several failed mediations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place .	-2.7542
The brothers are now also fighting for control of the existing business , from which Colin , as Paul claims , has ruled out him .	-4.8142
Colin argues that this is not true , but suggests Paul is managing some properties incompetent .	-2.1909
In an early affidavit submitted by Colin , he says he hopes to settle the dispute .	-3.6750
" My Italian heritage stipulates that the family is the most important priority , " he wrote .	-2.1689
The costs are rising in the case of hundreds of sites with Affidavits , e-mails and reports by companies including Deloitte , Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer , and leading lawyers , including Allan Myers , QC , and law firms held by both sides .	-5.0119
Mrs De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicacies from the late 1950s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early 1970s .	-4.2122
They took advantage of the security to buy Collingwood 's property , in which Colin opened up the family 's first jeanslands .	-5.1984
Colin says that he started there when he was " the High School in my last years , when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . "	-3.6528
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to share their property with their sons in a friendly way .	-2.7663
" Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to go to court , " wrote them .	-1.9775
Two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lutis Group , while Colin claims that Mark was paid $ 10 million and Luke $ 26 million when the company left .	-4.7606
Both Lukas and Mark said " about the terms of their financial separation " .	-3.5790
Colin was very reluctant , though he was a former AFL board member and , after a 2015 biography , Eddie McGuire was the best friend of television stars .	-4.8504
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers .	-1.2471
Only Colin replied by SMS to say " I really cannot say much " because the case is before the courts .	-3.1426
" It is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and pull our family name through the courts , " he wrote .	-2.3964
In mid-2016 , Colin wrote to the Court that he tried to meet his brother ’ s demands .	-2.8836
" Our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end in our current row , " he said and added that he " still hope for a solution " .	-9.5521
On Friday , that hope seemed to be over .	-1.6684
" Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future , " wrote Colin .	-2.1014
Trump ’ s new chief of staff is planning to limit the president ’ s media abstinence .	-2.3137
Others tried and failed .	-0.9762
Perhaps John F. Kelly can do it .	-2.0450
If so , he will be the first .	-0.8682
Politico reports that the White House ’ s new chief of staff is planning to reduce the flow of information to President Trump – including news media reports – in the hope of holding the boss on a more equal footing .	-3.8381
Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey :	-1.0915
" When John F. Kelly , the White House ’ s new chief of staff , met with senior officials on his first working day , he posed a major problem in President Donald Trump ’ s White House that he wanted to repair : bad information that gets into the president ’ s hands .	-3.7692
Kelly told employees that information about him should go - on paper or in briefing - because the president would make better decisions if he received good information . '	-4.2084
Kelly ’ s diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet .	-2.1310
President Trump ’ s television relationship dates back decades - and now that he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong .	-3.0426
" When candidate Trump was angry for unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of posts to be persuaded , " said former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg in February to Politico .	-4.5750
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that " the key to keeping Trump ’ s Twitter habit under control , according to six former campaign officials , is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a constant praise . "	-4.4650
Okay .	-0.4514
But the idea that Trump ’ s Twitter habit ever was ' under control ' is ridiculous .	-1.7088
Perhaps these campaign officials know something we do not know to others - that , without their interventions , Trump ’ s tweets would have had more fuel .	-7.7663
We will probably never know anything about the tweets Trump has not sent .	-2.0084
If his collaborators managed to keep him out of trouble a few times , then their efforts have paid off .	-5.9940
But no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump from provoking controversy . , , , .	-5.5970
Part of the problem is that people in a White House made up of competing parties are constantly trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump with material that may promote their views from the world .	-3.8733
Politico - all about this story - reported in May about the love of advisers to provide the President with questionable information for strategic reasons .	-5.2763
This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher :	-2.6438
" Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can respond like a volcano to negative press sections , especially those with damaging leaks , and that he is auctioning to find out where they come from .	-4.6403
This was exactly what happened at the end of February , when someone maliciously gave a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com , the website of the Internet provocator Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh of being the source behind a pile of leaks in the White House .	-5.2322
Though Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for harassment , or that he offered no concrete evidence , or that he had voiced and revoked false accusations in the past .	-4.3509
Trump read the article and began to ask staff about Walsh . "	-2.9709
Goldmacher added that the then chief of staff , Reace Priebus , and White House Secretary Rob Porter , have " tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork Trump receives . "	-4.9091
How did it work ?	-1.7834
Kelly attempted three months later to do the same .	-1.6710
Perhaps he will prove to be more effective managers than Priebus , but Trump is still his impulsive self , and his advisers are still seeking influence .	-3.7742
These immovable factors make Kelly 's mission very difficult .	-2.2040

Travelers negotiate a ditch and return to the Millionaire series .	-2.3672
Some of the most prosperous homeowners of the West Midlands are back with some determined travellers on the basis of war , who negotiated a burial burial burial to reclaim a field in front of their homes .	-7.5273
Travellers have parked their 20 caravans in a field outside a wealthy Strait of Solihull , called the " Millionars series " .	-3.8098
They brought horses , babies and an army of transporters when they were only thrown out in May , but without being deterred by a grab from the Council in order to prevent their incursions .	-7.0055
The tactful group found a gap in defence equipment and pushed its vehicles through a section that remained unhindered to find a way .	-4.2032
Outsiders have beaten Solihull 's advice , who said that it was ' useless to deal with the problem ' .	-4.8939
An anonymous resident said : " They went there on Monday evening after they were sent by Bentley Heath , where they threw stones on their passers-by .	-4.0921
The Council must indeed be forced by shame to implement it because it has been useless in dealing with the problem .	-3.8843
Travellers were there in May , they moved forward and are now back again .	-4.1411
More came last night , probably more now . '	-2.9856
She added : ' The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with this by holding long references to protect its parks .	-3.1397
I live on the Street Brook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my common destiny if the Council cannot even stop it . '	-3.2644
A resident who did not want to be named said said , " It is ridiculous that we have just seen the last round of these travellers just to be plundered by another round .	-4.0076
The figures have increased this time and you have even seen a horse in the parking area . '	-3.2666
Solihull , a spokesperson of Solihull , said : " We are aware of an unauthorised camp on the country beyond the Streetbrook Road and are working with the police of Solihull .	-6.9127
To support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible report anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101 .	-3.3672
This will help to create a picture of the situation in which the Court will have to examine when we present our case . '	-3.7472

That is good news for the city .	-1.4500
With the closure of Hotel Birkenhof by the former Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014 , some 30 000 overnight stays per year were lost and also revenue from the Kurtax .	-5.4731
In the autumn of 2014 , with the number of refugees arriving in the countryside dramatically increasing , the hotel ’ s building was offered as a gathering lodge to the district , creating controversial discussions .	-6.9656
The city prevented asylum-seekers from being accommodated by drawing up a plan to build up the area as a hotel location .	-5.6480
The decision was not uncontroversial in the council then .	-2.8396
But above all Freudenstadt ’ s Oberbürgermeister Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and talked about serious interests at the house .	-5.2437
He should be right .	-0.8311
The Luisenhotels group , headquartered in Bad Bergzabern , with its managing director Birgit Scherer , acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a home of the three-star Plus category under the name of Waldhotel Luise .	-5.8019
The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt Object .	-2.4381
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb .	-1.1450
You are hot Hotel Luise , Luisenpark , Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise .	-1.8296
The former Hotel Birkenhof has been standing in front of the entrance for a long time and when you enter the house you will see how extensive renovations are being carried out .	-5.1694
The floors were demolished , ceilings partly dismantled , old bathtubs removed from the rooms .	-3.1873
The entire hotel building is a single building .	-1.5665
There is still much to be done by March .	-1.8266
" It is actually a nice hotel , " says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper .	-2.7507
Everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style .	-2.3229
The rooms are equipped with large walkable showers , the entrance area is redesigned and new windows are installed .	-4.3233
Everything should later become " beautiful bourgeois " , as Thomas Scherer puts it .	-4.0518
'We want to make a jewel out of it ' .	-6.7390
Swimming pool , spa and meeting room are all equipped .	-3.5768
Scherer is the best hotel in Lauterbad .	-5.8138
Waldhotel Luise , with its 60 rooms , wants to be broadened , explains Scherer .	-4.3507
The hotel is ideal for individual tourists , groups and business people alike .	-4.7516
Discussions with OB Julian Osswald and tourist director Michael Krause have already taken place , says Scherer .	-2.9017
The staff were very friendly and helpful .	-4.3670
'We are on the same line . '	-1.1321
Thomas Scherer does not want to be exact when it comes to the amount of investment .	-5.4516
He expects almost one million euros .	-2.6751
The outside installations are also brought in front , which is already clearly visible .	-5.0958
A large terrace is created in a courtyard , which will be open to the public by the restaurant .	-4.2520
Thomas Scherer is optimistic : " Freudenstadt is a good market " .	-1.6950
Russia affair : US Special Counsel sets Grand Jury	-3.9771
According to a report , Special Counsel Robert Mueller is alleged to have used a so-called Grand Jury in the Russian affair for US President Donald Trump .	-4.3485
The panel has started work in recent weeks , wrote the Wall Street Journal , referring to people familiar with the matter .	-4.3839
The newspaper took the step as a sign that Mueller expanded and intensified his investigations .	-3.7331
The CNN channel reported that there have already been initial subpoenas of the body in connection with a meeting between Trump ’ s oldest son and a Russian lawyer .	-4.2596
US intelligence agencies have long accused the Kremlin of interfering specifically in the 2016 presidential campaign .	-1.7125
Mueller wonders whether there were deals between Trump ’ s campaign and Moscow .	-2.7328
The focus of the investigations is on several men who acted as Republicans ’ advisers in the election campaign .	-4.2990
Mueller has reportedly taken more and more notice of Trump ’ s private and business environment .	-3.2646
A few weeks ago , the " Washington Post " wrote that the Trump special investigator had come to the fore personally and investigated whether the president might have obstructed justice in the course of the affair .	-6.6238
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine the available evidence in cases of crime and decide whether to issue a charge .	-5.5860
Grand Jurys will also be named indicative numbers .	-8.5523
Usually they are turned on when there are larger and controversial cases .	-2.9764
The procedure always takes place behind closed doors .	-1.8669
The board can also be activated by the Public Prosecutor 's office to invite people to interrogate under oath .	-4.8379
According to the CNN channel , prejudices about the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer have already been issued .	-3.4154
People who took part in the meeting were invited to make a statement , it was stated in the report . that the the .	-5.4533
They should also provide documents .	-1.0217
Trump , Jr. , along with Trump ’ s advisers and songs-in-law , Jared Kushner , and then campaign leader Paul Manafort , were talking .	-4.9513
Legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the appointment shows that Mueller will not be intimidated in his work and that , if necessary , he will act quickly .	-5.2201
However , it is not inevitable that the Grand Jury should be turned on at the end to decide whether to make a charge .	-5.6974
Nevertheless , the establishment of the body is the beginning of a new phase in the investigation and a new reason for concern for President Trump .	-4.5882
Amidst the new revelations , the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portray the Russian affair as a campaign of his political opponents .	-2.8338
" Russia 's history is a total invention , " Trump said .	-1.9035
The issue gives the Democrats an opportunity to ' feel good , because they have nothing else to talk about . '	-3.4572
His special adviser Ty Cobb stated in a statement that he knew nothing about the establishment of a Grand Jury .	-3.5935
But they also usually work in secret , he emphasized .	-3.6118
The White House is in favour of any measures that accelerated the work of the special counsel in a ' fair ' way .	-4.1958
The former FBI chief , James Comey , has said three times that it is not being investigated against .	-4.3485
There is no reason to believe that this has changed , as the statement went on .	-4.6977
But Mueller was only deployed after Trump fired Comey .	-2.2250
Because of this graft , accusations against Trump had become loud that he wanted to hamper the judiciary .	-4.6971
Comey told a Senate committee in June that Trump asked him to stop investigating then-national security adviser Michael Flynn .	-3.5596
The President is under great pressure because of the investigation .	-1.7976
According to the presentation of US media , the White House collected material against the special investigator and his staff .	-3.9816
The result was speculation about whether Trump would release Mueller .	-2.8518
In contrast to an independent congressional special counsel , such as the Watergate affair surrounding the then retired president , Richard Nixon , Mueller has a position in which , in theory , he could be fired by the Ministry of Justice at the president ’ s insistence .	-5.9416
Several senators from both parties , however , want to prevent such a move .	-2.4513
On Thursday , two groups of republican and democratic senators presented draft legislation that would stop the special counsel from being simply dismissed .	-5.5470
Antarctica : Gigantic Ice Mountain Drives in Antarctica	-2.9922
In the western Antarctic , a gigantic iceberg of Berlin ’ s almost seven times its size has been dissolved by the Schelfeis .	-4.6590
The Bremerhavener Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research took part in this on Wednesday .	-3.2779
The Colossus , which has weighed more than one trillion tons and is 5800 square kilometres , is now heading north and will probably take two or three years until it has melted .	-5.9038
With a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest ice giants registered researchers in the last three decades .	-4.1079
He does not pose a threat to humans .	-1.9782
The extent to which climate change has played a part in the iceberg ’ s demise is unclear after researchers have been informed .	-4.9899
However , for some 30 years there has been a series of unusual breakthroughs of ice cubes in the region , writes the US research centre for snow and ice ( NSIDC ) in a factual background .	-4.7065
According to many researchers , this can be linked to global warming .	-2.5639
The now broken Colos has been part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis .	-4.6847
Schelfeis floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers .	-3.5332
As a result , it continues to grow into the sea and periodically breaks down .	-4.5672
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic peninsula .	-3.0633
Northern this barrel had been disturbed by the balance of growth and breaking up a few years ago .	-5.3843
AWI researcher Daniela Jansen writes a complete skeleton .	-5.4018
There is much to suggest that the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is also at risk , because the front edge has never moved as far as it is now .	-5.8515
In addition , the ice plate is under tension and can collapse if one piece breaks on a key point .	-5.5071
The melting of Schelfeis and Eisberg does not raise the sea level , as it floats on the water and presses ice as much water as it does after the melting itself .	-4.4697
However , the loss of the sledgehammer leads the glaciers to pass directly into the sea and to pass down much faster than before .	-6.2524
This may increase sea levels , but only to a lesser extent , UK research project to monitor Antarctic ( Midas ) .	-4.6864
According to AWI , the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is the fourth largest rope in the Antarctic , with almost 50 000 square kilometres .	-5.0773
At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , on the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters .	-3.5158
It periodically broke down there .	-2.8626
" Although it is natural and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change , the ice sheet is now entering a more dangerous position , " said Martin O 'Leary of British Swansea University .	-4.3399
" This is the longest withdrawal since the records began , " he also confirmed .	-3.6716
Scientists are concerned about whether the Larsen-C-Schelfeis will now grow again or go back in the long term and perhaps fall together , his colleague Adrian Luckman said , ' Our models say that it will be less stable ' .	-6.6718
But that will take decades .	-1.7701
Although these researchers do not attribute the collapse of this giant iceberg to climate change , a great many ice cubes from the Antarctic peninsula have collapsed in recent decades .	-11.2414
This long pinch of the Antarctic extends towards South America .	-2.9577
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey research programme , the Ice Area of the Antarctic Peninsula has fallen by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s .	-3.3049
The rise in temperature has contributed to the decline .	-2.1228
The Antarctic peninsula has warmed around three degrees in the last 50 years , making it one of the areas where the temperature rises the fastest .	-5.6529
CDU Will Personal Pet	-2.4796
As it becomes more and more difficult to occupy vacant positions , the CDU is asking to leave the employers ' association in order to become more attractive .	-4.0983
Just a few minutes before the summer break , Circular Day turned 41 into new administrative positions .	-5.4687
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann .	-2.1232
Once again , 17 apprentices have finished their first working day .	-5.8147
Apparently , the teaching staff around the circle are very much to be desired .	-5.1210
About 620 applications were received for the places to be presented this year .	-3.6760
However , the circle still lacks staff to cope with increased requirements and tasks .	-4.2783
At present there are 50 unoccupied positions in Mettmann county .	-3.5452
Among other things , they concern doctors and engineers as well as general administration forces .	-4.2971
The CDU , together with the FDP and the UWG , now wishes to take the initiative to address the shortage of skilled labour in the administration .	-5.1973
According to the wishes of the parties , the administration shall ' draw up a concept for personnel production and development ' .	-4.8775
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs for professionals , but also to counter the shortage of applicants for the future .	-5.1260
The overall concept should be internally and externally oriented , show concrete measures for newcomers and include a training offensive , call for CDU , FDP and UWG .	-4.8219
That sounds like a good approach .	-1.3986
The circle is dealing with personnel problems that were not previously known .	-4.8974
Other cities recruit good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .	-2.1349
We are talking about a genuine ' competition between public employers ' .	-2.5842
In addition , a large number of employees who leave the service due to illness or age .	-3.7284
It is therefore high time to act so that more jobs do not remain vacant .	-4.3931
But Klaus-Dieter peoples , leader of the CDU Group , and his party go beyond the joint motion .	-4.2531
He recently created a fierce surprise in the month of December , when he publicly challenged the ceiling on personnel costs and stunned the other parties .	-7.0636
People want to see every possible way to get out of the community employers ' association checked .	-5.4220
" If we do not come to a satisfactory solution in the short term , then the district administration with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the surrounding towns - should aim for a pet mate , " says the people . ,	-8.5994
In this way , the CDU is trying to pay employees and officials better than the public service tariff system actually provides .	-5.5717
The salaries are currently fixed , increases or more money only available if you change to a higher level that is geared to professional years .	-5.7787
But the functions of the circle have grown more and more in recent years .	-2.9822
Only a few weeks ago , new spaces had to be created in which employees concerned themselves with the provisions of the new law on the protection of prostitution .	-4.2422
Not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers , Landrat Thomas Hendele and director Martin Richter have a problem : they have too few staff .	-3.5233
Italy ’ s Toys on NGO Migration Rescues	-3.6727
Italy has warned NGOs deploying bailouts for migrants in the Mediterranean that they cannot continue this if they do not abide by new rules for their operations .	-3.9248
" If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , " said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin newspaper La Stampa .	-3.5018
Minniti ’ s warning came one day after the Italian authorities seized a boat from the German aid organisation ' Youth Reset ' because their team had effectively collaborated with human traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration .	-5.1975
The aid organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to comment on detailed accusations by the Italian prosecutor , Ambrogio Cartosio .	-3.7730
" For us , saving human life is and will remain our top priority , so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , " said the organization in an opinion on social media .	-5.5146
'We can only judge all the allegations that are made at the moment after we have collected all the information and have the opportunity to assess the situation ' .	-5.0720
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the Youth Retet boat , the Iuventa , since October .	-3.6872
It is suspected that his crew will take on board hose boat migrants delivered directly to them by human traffickers , and that the smugglers will be able to depart so that the ships can be used again .	-6.5875
At least such a meeting supposedly took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the act of the Public Prosecutor whose content was published by Italian media .	-3.3480
The crew is suspected of overseeing the authority of Italy 's coastguard , of overseeing the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other motives .	-4.5676
Under the code of conduct , boats such as the Iuventa must above all have an Italian police officer on board who supervises their activities .	-3.6520
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the code : Save the Children , MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain .	-2.6630
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be deemed unnecessary but acceptable , because they would not entail ' essential changes or obstacles ' of their rescue operations .	-8.4078
Among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel Laureate Organization is doctors without frontiers ( MSF ) .	-7.7483
Minniti has now said that the number of migrants arriving after the rescue operations in Italy has fallen sharply in recent weeks , suggesting that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast guard and to cooperate with local mayors have borne fruit .	-4.1977
" In the last few days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , " the Minister said .	-2.3452
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives , and with Chad , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants they are hoping to reach Europe .	-3.6644
Rising and Trials	-1.3232
Nine Weiler Biker , the " Berlin outpost " and two guest cyclists met in Wachenheim in the Nordpfalz for four days at Trials and Sightseeing .	-4.7517
There were three friendly guides at your disposal .	-3.0420
Accommodation in Wachenheim Valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .	-2.8639
The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome addition .	-2.1183
The first tour led to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards .	-4.1473
It was followed by viewpoints , some of them on towers above the plague forest and the upper plains .	-6.2150
In between , there were always prolonged increases that rewarded the long trials .	-5.3487
On the second day , it went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and to the Wurstmarkt . , the , the , the . , , , , ,	-7.5102
Again , the viewpoint was ripe , combined with " flowy " trials and moderate increases .	-5.4685
On the last two days there were again many altitude meters .	-3.7242
Caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and refuges brought welcome breaks .	-2.7698
In Bad Dürkheim the bikers breathe healing soles in the open-air content board .	-3.3558
New town is also under construction .	-5.2008
After 173 kilometres and almost 4500 metres of altitude , the group met the plucker forest from its best side - sporty and culturally .	-4.8523
Konsole instead of Rasen - Bundesliga is preparing for e-Sport	-3.6932
In the future , are the sports stars sitting against computer consoles instead of going through the stadium roses in wind and weather ?	-6.8683
Fact is : E-Sport has long become a serious industry , a lucrative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gear .	-4.5953
This was recognized by the first Bundesliga , which is becoming increasingly involved in this area .	-3.6969
In 2015 , VfL Wolfsburg began , later the FC Schalke 04 followed , and most recently the VfB Stuttgart , which founded an e-sports department in mid-July and had two professionals contracted for the FIFA 17 computer game .	-5.7333
" We hope this will inspire new young target groups for the VfB , " says Executive Board Jochen Röttgermann .	-3.4020
He is sure ' that a number of clubs will climb up this train ' .	-4.2188
Next weekend , the World Football Federation FIFA will organise the first " Interactive Club World Cup " in London , where the gamers of different clubs compete against each other .	-4.8195
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg , for example Manchester City , Paris Saint-Germain or the PSV Eindhoven qualified .	-2.8627
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-Sport .	-1.7273
The former coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players .	-2.4116
" The real football must address the 14 to 30 year-olds in particular , that young people will still enter the stadium in the future , " says the 52-year-old .	-5.8194
And : the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian ones .	-3.0958
With prominent e-athletes under contract , online presence could be much more frequent in these markets than just sending the Bundesligaman to Asia once a year .	-5.8161
What is this all about ?	-2.0181
In e-Sport , computer games such as " League of Legends " , " Dota 2 " , " Counterstrike " or the football simulation FIFA are performed at competitive level .	-4.8359
As in normal sports , leagues have long established themselves in which the professionals compete against each other .	-4.4582
And in the 2022 Asian games , E-Sport is already part of the official program .	-2.2216
But is it really a real sport ?	-2.2586
For many , the idea certainly needs to be used to .	-3.8960
Ingo Frobous , too , has long been grappling with the question .	-4.1651
For the professor at the German Sports School in Cologne , E-Sport is a sport because it is competent and shows many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in classical sport - for example , increased heart frequencies , stress reactions , hormonal changes .	-5.2742
It also needs cognitive skills , technical and tactical understanding and fast reaction capability .	-3.0308
Professional gamers should train not only on the console but also their body and look for nutrition .	-4.1008
'The fitte player is a good player ' .	-2.3246
However , humorous also sees problems : ' Doping is becoming more and more a topic ' .	-4.4293
Controls are difficult to carry out in online games , and classic sport structures were missing in the scene .	-5.1761
The scientist highlights the high inclusive impact of e-sport .	-4.7570
Players are on the international road , like a large global family , there are no intercultural barriers .	-4.1144
A study of the Deloitte management and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software ( BIU ) forecast rapid growth for E-Sport .	-5.2747
In 2016 , it implemented EUR 50 million in Germany , mainly through advertising , sponsoring and big tournaments .	-4.4079
Revenue is expected to be 130 million in three years .	-3.0948
That is little against the just EUR 2.4 billion in the football league .	-4.1750
However , e-sports ' no longer far from other established sports such as handball , basketball or ice hockey ' , write Deloitte consultants .	-3.8826
Internationally , many countries have gone further .	-3.3139
Great markets are Asia and the US , where ex-basketball players Shaquille O<unk>Neal and Baseballstar Alex Rodriguez are participating in the US Team NRG eSports .	-3.5419
Hollywood-Schauspiler Ashton Kutcher invests in the Unikrn eSports betting .	-3.3955
There are things that are happening in Europe too .	-2.8976
In a Norwegian school E-Sport was introduced as a subject of education , says Froböse .	-3.5614
In the Netherlands and in France , according to Dutt , football clubs are now obliged to set up an e-sports department .	-4.6910
" When compared to Europe , Germany lags behind , " says VfB Board Röttgermann .	-4.0563
It is only in nostalgia to decay , and to clarify the old times is no longer enough .	-4.9340
It is a matter of preserving the tradition of the association , but of simultaneously orientating the company to the modern market .	-4.0585
" We live in a digitized world " , says Dutt . . , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-5.1254
'It cannot be said that only football remains the same as it has always been ' .	-4.7882
Poison oak - The Egg alternatives to cooking and baking	-6.9273
In the meantime , almost all the Länder have been hit by the toxic eggs scandal .	-3.7135
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord have reacted and have taken all eggs out of sale in Germany .	-3.7843
Only eggs should be removed from the shelves which have no fipronical proof .	-5.7094
Michelle Carter has condemned the texts of suicide by Conrad Roy .	-2.9891
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two and a half years because she has encouraged her friend through texts and calls for suicide .	-3.0526
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars , and five years were suspended on probation .	-3.4608
Carter was sentenced in June for negligent killing of Conrad Roy , who died on 13 July 2014 .	-2.7973
The father of Roy said at the hearing on Thursday : " My family is uncomforting .	-2.8783
My son was my best friend . '	-0.9300
Carter was allowed to remain vacant until the appointment was .	-3.3585
She was confronted with a maximum sentence of 20 years , but her lawmakers argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness .	-9.2309
Carter dressed in red pants and a cream-coloured blouse , with tears in the eyes , with suspended hands and downward eyes when condemned .	-4.2789
" Her actions have killed Conrad Roy , " the prosecutor said to the court .	-2.6764
" She finished his life to make her own better .	-1.8978
She did not accept responsibility , " she said .	-2.3094
'She has shown no respect ' .	-2.7986
But Carter 's lawyer said that it was ' a terrible circumstance that she deeply regret ' .	-4.2664
Judge Lawrence Moniz said , however , that he did not find out that her " age or maturity , or even her mental illness , have a significant impact on their actions " .	-3.3923
A Public Prosecutor read a statement by Roy 's mother Lynn Roy who said that there is ' no day when I do not charge the loss of my beloved son .	-3.8744
I want him to be proud of me and of how I go about everything .	-4.8335
Roy 's sister , Camdyn Roy , said she would be " persecuted " by the realization that she would never participate in the wedding of her brother or be an aunt for his children .	-3.6674
" Not having this only person with whom I have been together since my birth every day is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , " she said .	-3.3766
The case seems to set a legal precedent , as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide .	-10.1557
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in 2014 by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle .	-1.9584
The case attracted national attention after Carter ’ s text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life .	-2.3561
" Look up , jump from a building , get yourself , I do not know there are many ways , " she said in several news that she sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on holiday with his family .	-5.1493
In the moments before his suicide , she wrote : ' You must do it , Conrad ' and ' Everything you need to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy ' .	-4.1535
Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention by the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from the case by some press .	-2.4409
The case has divided legal opinion .	-2.5377
Among the few who defended Carter , Amanda Knox was convicted in 2007 for murder of her fellow British woman in Italy before she was released two years ago .	-3.5652
Mrs Knox , 30 years old , published a comment in Los Angeles Times : ' Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not prison ' .	-2.6881
Joshua Kimmich : Learning from the new Mini Lahm of FC Bayern	-2.4834
The fact that Joshua Kimmich was allowed to run as a captain at the Audi Cup is no coincidence .	-12.3388
The FC Bayern mourns the Confeder Cup winner a great season - Extra-Motivation does not harm .	-6.2020
Something else was different on his place in the cabin , which Joshua Kimmich saw immediately , even if the additional garment was very , very small .	-3.8541
But as there was no Philipp Lahm or Manuel Neuer on the second day of the Audi Cup , he stopped his ties .	-5.9246
" The trainer did not announce it " , the Confed-Cup winner subsequently told us , after his first assignment as Bayern captain .	-6.3829
Well , the stalemate could have gone better than at the 0 : 2 against the SSC Naples .	-3.7674
But Kimmich could also interpret the character of the coach .	-2.6255
Not the eight years old Arturo Vidal had been chosen as the leader of the C-Elf , who had been made up of young players , debutants and professionals who had just been on holiday .	-7.2804
Sugar is best spread out to those who are more suspicious of what you want to keep at bay .	-6.6242
Those who have chosen to accede to the heritage of Lahm can only use a small extra motivation .	-13.1383
Kimmich confirmed : " This is what you would like to assume responsibility as a player .	-3.6286
On Wednesday , the 22-year-old flattened the field as a mini lamb .	-4.7141
To the right , that is his position , the white binding on the arm did the rest .	-4.1370
And at all , Kimmich was looking like the one who could take the ruder in the best way .	-7.9676
He gave instructions to try to direct the unintended force .	-3.4162
He had a glance for the whole while many others were busy with himself .	-3.5527
Vidal 's lack of fitness overshadowed ( scarcely clapped ) ; Renato Sanches was hitting devil out of the service of the trip to Asia ( even as a result ) ; and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle were not negative in her first appearance in the Bayern Trikot .	-9.4217
After all , it sounded quite good .	-4.0697
Süle ran off next to Kimmich , Rudy before the defense , both acting sovereign .	-5.9178
The renowned Napoli storm was often difficult , and Süle also tried to succeed in the construction of the game .	-6.4923
His colleague , Mr Rudy , admitted that the result was ' not the way we hoped for it ' .	-6.6144
But he , too , performed well at the debut .	-4.0210
relocation , temporary agency : " I got this style for as well " .	-6.5527
After the match , one saw how unfamiliar this Bavarian world is for the new entrants .	-6.0912
Rudy , for example , did not give one or two interviews in the catacombs , but certainly gave six or seven interviews .	-2.6262
After a few quick statements , Kimmich left in the back of his new gamers .	-5.4541
There he heard an interesting sentence from Süle : " I have already noticed what is going on here .	-3.7840
At Bayern , you simply have to win every game " .	-2.7617
He will no longer have to teach the new . .	-8.6247
Alaba Motived <unk>FB Ladies	-3.1220
David Alaba believes in the success of our <unk>FB ladies	-2.3805
Austria ’ s most famous football player registered on Twitter just before the match and wanted the <unk>FB ladies all the best .	-5.0414
The Bavarian Legionary is almost club mate of <unk>FB Captain Schnaderbeck and is working with our ladys .	-5.5566
The tweet of the Austrian footballer of the year and champion-league winner should be a special injection of motivation .	-4.4880
Perhaps our ladies could also need the famous Bayern Dusel .	-3.7040
Businesses happy with the Rhineland-Palatinate Minister : Economics praises Wissings Tempo	-3.6816
It was often inconceivable that the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when Eveline Lemke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economy for Rhineland-Palatinate .	-3.9992
This is apparent after more than a year in which the new Minister for Economic Affairs , Mr Volker Wissing ( FDP ) , is in office .	-3.4091
At T V request , chambers and businesses from the region speak of a shift in economic policy - and at the same time impede the old minister .	-4.6967
Frank Natus , Chairman of the Trierer Enterprise Association ( VTU ) , says : " Wissing responds to the wishes of the economy that Lemke has all blocked " .	-3.6492
The biggest turnaround for NATO is infrastructure policy : the closing of motorway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country 's priorities .	-5.0377
This year , the ministry hopes for a planning process , with building law due to be established by 2021 .	-5.5799
The West Riding Trier , which is in the urgent need of the Federal Road Traffic Plan , also plays a role in the country ’ s plans .	-10.5986
The aim is to start the route in December 2020 , Secretary of State Cornelia Holtmann says .	-3.4204
Natus sees it as a signpost to support regional but internationally competing companies .	-3.9718
The Chamber of Commerce ( IHK ) Trier , as suggested by Wissing , is seeking a Rhineland-Palatinate label in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to halt the trend of German wine exports , which has lasted for ten years .	-5.7811
In addition , Wissing has an open ear for people who want to start their own company , the ICC applauds .	-4.7754
The Trier Handwerkskammer sees the new Master Bonus as an additional incentive for young trainees , says CEO Matthias Schwabach .	-4.9744
Predicted is a € 1000 premium for the master exam and € 2500 for graduates who have completed their own studies within ten years .	-6.4692
But the country remains a long list of homework .	-4.2618
The road construction project is quick to get facts , but at the same time the country lacks the necessary staff , says Jan Glockauer , Managing Director of the IHK Trier .	-6.4842
Of the 56 new engineers who want to adjust Wissing in the area of land mobility , there are currently only 29 posts in vacancy .	-7.8340
The ICC is calling for more contracts to be given to external offices .	-3.1750
Christian Baldauf , the CDU group ’ s violin , refers to calculations by the Court of Auditors that in 2017 and 2018 invest more than EUR 20 million less in maintaining highways than proposed .	-5.9156
Frank Natus also expects a concept of the country as to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region .	-4.2555
The country 's broadband expansion to date is also stark .	-4.4486
In 2016 , regional companies only evaluated grid supply in an IHK survey with a note of 3.4 .	-3.7679
They complained about broken Internet connections and interruptions .	-2.6287
On the other hand , former economist Eveline Lemke is out of politics at the moment and is still in the Board of Directors of wind power company Pro Wind .	-5.5536
The Green Group left Lemke in April to become President of a private college in Karlsruhe , where , after four months of disagreement , it was already clearing the field again .	-4.8688
Audi is supposed to change 850,000 Diesel Vehicles - car manufacturers are facing a backlash .	-2.9058
A day before Audi announced that BMW would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles .	-2.7525
The chairman of the BMW said that the company believes that ' there are smarter options as a driving restriction ' , referring to banning or restricting diesel vehicles in European cities , including Munich , where BMW is based .	-6.0442
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be 3 million Mercedes vehicles in Europe modified to reduce its diesel emissions .	-2.8334
None of them described the business as a call-back .	-3.0733
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions rules .	-3.3855
But the nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are regarded as carcinogens and can cause asthma .	-2.1087
The costs for car manufacturers to install equipment to neutralise diesel exhaust gases are also increasing , which makes it difficult to keep cars competitive .	-5.1785
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of feeding powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem .	-3.0667
Businesses are trying to avoid the mistakes made by Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of what is known as the ' phasing off ' equipment , in order to comply with the rules when a car has been tested , but which are going back in normal driving conditions .	-8.2063
In the United States several Volkswagen employees have been charged , others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic .	-3.2579
Last month , the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .	-2.4138
Former manager , Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio , is Italian and therefore is not protected from extradition and could be tried in the United States .	-3.0770
Earlier this year , Audi was included in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circumvent emissions legislation in Europe , and a question focused on the United States has been extended .	-4.5831
The inclusion of Audi in the study could place a heavy burden on Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to Volkswagen 's profits .	-4.1873
This Embassy has the Floss on Saturday at Isar	-6.3346
The city wants to protect the Isar .	-2.3029
To make sure that the visitors of Isar can take part , a visit to Munich will take place tomorrow , with a special message .	-6.5477
On Saturday , when we return to the Isar again , there will be a big floss between Flaucher and Reichenbach bridge .	-12.0318
And this is not a common floss , with isar tourists .	-3.8738
Special the building reference will clarify .	-3.6285
On the floss you can see a large info transparency .	-3.4196
It shows a Müllberg .	-1.6172
The launch of a public awareness campaign to appeal to Isar visitors .	-3.2288
The motto " True Love is ... " is to sharpen understanding for the isar as a worthy poaching .	-4.8828
Last summer the floss went over the isar , and this year too , there were further actions and measures to achieve a respectful and environmentally conscious approach .	-8.1613
Mordillos Knollennasen and Laughter for suffering	-3.0223
Mordillo was at times one of the most published cartoon drawings , the bone nets of his characters are his trademark .	-5.1230
Also at 85 , the Argentinian still signs and works on a film .	-3.1398
His message : laugh , " because there is too much suffering in the world " .	-2.1348
Guillermo Mordillo was born on August 4 , 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .	-2.0488
In his early years as an artist , he was among other things a draught for greeting cards , which frustrated him .	-6.5198
" The happiest day in my professional life was the day when my job lost , " he once said .	-1.4337
After his visits to Lima , New York , and Paris , he succeeded in the breakthrough in the 1960s : with the publication of his cartoons in " Paris Match " and then in " Stern " and other leading magazines around the world .	-6.7356
Even in China Mordillo found many fans .	-1.3101
Again and again the artist of cities reads inspiration .	-4.0436
Large , round Mordillo figures stumble in drawings with the shale tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .	-3.1783
According to his personal data , he is still sitting at the drawing table today , working almost ten hours a day .	-4.1340
His droll figures continue to spread around the world via calendars , puzz, books for children and , t-shirts , pleats and watches .	-5.7077
He has been working on a cartoon film and a TV series with his characters for six years .	-3.6582
The main person in the movie " Crazy Island " is a giraffe - Mordillos most popular pet in his drawings - which has a thousand feet as an counter player .	-4.3603
His characters speak for the first time in the 3D movie , which is to be released on the cinema screen in 2019 .	-5.2091
" I don 't know exactly what they will say , it 's strange for me , " says Mordillo .	-2.4766
The script is not written by him .	-1.3880
That is why he focuses more on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced without word .	-5.5735
Provence ’ s Provence Threat to Climate Change	-4.0700
It has become a symbol of Provence in the south of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .	-1.9309
The lavender is declining due to insects reminiscent of droughts and because of disease , causing great headaches to scientists and farmers trying to find solutions .	-4.9159
Eric Chaisse , expert of the agricultural research institute CRIEPAM in Provence , said : " The lavender in Provence is effective because in recent years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change , which has caused much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn .	-4.9845
This has implications for the life of lavender .	-2.6067
There is also a small cicade , a microbacterium that transports the dwarf , and in very dry weather there are many of them . '	-4.2873
And there is a lot at stake .	-1.7954
Lavendel oil not only attracts holidaymakers , it is also very much needed for perfumes and cosmetics .	-5.2199
Eric Chaisse said : " Instead of having very long herbs with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , underdeveloped and either missing or weakened .	-2.2461
So we have fewer essential oil parts . '	-1.7997
The solutions taken include better water distribution and a slowdown in soil evaporation , as well as plant spraying with a protective mixture of sound and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drying .	-4.9191
The town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhön is celebrating its 1200-year-old existence .	-4.1469
The festivity is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival .	-4.0513
Herbs , juices , traders , vagants or a country nesting camp are to be found in the city centre on these days .	-6.3264
The assassination of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico	-1.9942
The weekly Riodoce staff usually meet on Wednesdays to review their plans to report on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime , corrupt officials , and ceaseless drug wars .	-5.3501
But on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .	-2.2064
They have been informed that it is important to change their routine .	-2.0031
Two high-ranking journalists are discussing what feels safer : taking their children into the office , who were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009 , or leaving them at home .	-5.6832
Security experts have written three words on a board on the front of the room : opponents , neutrals , allies .	-2.9314
They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no proof is required , perceptions and building feelings suffice .	-3.0783
There are drug smugglers , politicians , businessmen , journalists suspected of being on the government ’ s salary list or cartels , a catalogue of criminals who make Mexico ’ s mess dangerous .	-4.1430
There is no rest from the violence , and as bodies accumulate throughout the country , there are increasing numbers of journalists : at least 25 , since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012 , 589 are under federal protection , and so far there have been at least seven deaths this year in seven states .	-5.4535
Among the latter is their editor and inspirator of Riodore , co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas .	-4.0148
" The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , " Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books about violence related to drugs .	-2.9545
His absence is deeply felt , although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez showing his middle-finger with the word " Justice " is hanging on the facade of the Riodope building .	-15.1965
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the reporters discuss their divided topics , the trauma , their alphabetical dreams , insomnia , paranoia .	-3.7958
Although a special law firm was set up in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists , according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists , it only introduced two criminal proceedings .	-4.0763
As with most thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organised crime each year , journalists ’ murderers are rarely brought to justice .	-3.2807
With Riodore , they are still insisting on treating the violence of Sinaloa , although they are uncomforting and although the terrain is now more treacherous .	-5.7379
Without information on the murderers , without justice , the meeting to discuss security has little use , says Ibarra .	-2.7030
" It is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , " he says .	-1.2768
'As long as we do not know the Why , we all distrust . '	-2.4344
On the morning of May 15 , Valdez left the Riodore newspaper office in the provincial capital of Culiacan .	-3.5670
He was forced from his car and 12 times was shot at him , probably due to the name of the newspaper - which is translated into " Twelfter River " .	-6.0175
The shooter drove out in his car and damaged it near .	-2.7970
Valdez was 50 years old .	-0.6621
He left a woman and two adult children .	-1.4313
rumors tend to circulate freely in Culiacan .	-2.2859
But there is virtually nothing but silence on the subject of Valdez .	-2.2175
Since Guzman ’ s arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January , Sinaloa has become one of the country ’ s bloodiest battlefields , as rival factions are fighting here to fill the vacuum .	-2.8609
There is no point in Sinaloa that someone or several people are shot in the streets every day , or that the cemetery is full of decorated two-storey mausoleums for drug kings , who are larger than many homes for the living .	-6.2929
Forget for one minute that there is a state of ' rest ' when only one cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States .	-3.5444
Nevertheless , and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work , Ismail Bojorquez ( 60 ) , a co-founder and director of Riodoce , is crumbling with the guilt that he could not protect his friend .	-3.9500
He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder .	-1.2809
First of all , in February , there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez , a leader of one of the rival cartel groups in the war with Guzman ’ s sons .	-4.4795
This release may have angry the sons , Gangmembers suspected that they bought each copy of the output as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks .	-5.0729
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for its own security after seizing another newspaper that had published the same story .	-3.0977
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .	-1.6442
He had survived for so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there .	-2.4994
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 , when he joined five colleagues to establish Riodoce and sold $ 50 .	-4.8870
In Sinaloa , " it was impossible to practise journalism without encountering the drug problem , " said Bojorquez .	-3.3864
Over time , the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting , and revenue and advertising grew .	-3.7115
Reporters loved to publish tough inquiries without fear of censorship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat .	-4.1610
Eight years after the founding of Riodore , she received the prestigious Maria-Moors-Cabot award for her work in Latin America .	-3.4082
In the same year , Valdez won the ' International Press Freedom Award ' of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in pursuing the Mexican drug history wherever it led .	-3.6894
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid .	-0.6515
" I want to continue living " , he said at the time of the CPJ award .	-2.5427
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa " is a way of life " , he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV .	-2.2958
" You have to take on the job that you as a journalist - either that or you play the stupid .	-4.3474
I would not like to be asked : ' What did you do in the face of so many dead ... why did you not say what was going on ? '	-2.9648
The Riodope team miss Valdez , the fun google , who was able to escape like a dockworker , the friend who was generous with his embrace and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .	-6.5390
They trusted their routine .	-2.1086
He would always wear his hat .	-0.8527
He would always go to El Guayabo , the bar opposite the office , and always sit there at the same table .	-2.7952
Now they ask : Was his love for routine his adoration ?	-3.1418
His death has also forced them to question their own assumptions about how they can best do their work while remaining alive .	-3.4800
" You don 't like it when you deal with their women , their children , their clean shops , their domestic runways " to move drugs .	-4.6366
" These things were not allowed , " said Bojorquez .	-1.7540
The result , even in the best times , is a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation .	-2.1875
Trust your own instincts .	-0.8105
If it smells wrong , stay away .	-1.5635
The anger is , the editor of Riodore Andres Villarreal said , ' Geruch a sense that can be deceived ... and then the matter has happened with Javier . '	-4.5729
The old rules , as he and others say , no longer apply in Sinaloa , as in Tamaulipas , Veracruz , Guerrero , and other states , where a poisonous mix of lucrative smuggling routes , weak institutions , and corrupt government officials is at home .	-3.9851
The landscape is constantly changing .	-1.2077
In the space where Riodore ’ s staff met for security training , no mobile phones were allowed suddenly ; days before , it became known that spyware , which was sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .	-6.2488
Two police officers sought protection against the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 <unk> C ) in the shadow of a tree .	-2.5701
They were mandated by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a mid-class area of Culiacan .	-4.5326
Half in joke , some of the reporters wondered whether these officers are among the 50 % of the policemen who the governor himself described as untrustworthy .	-4.6083
It has been months since the reporters went to the mountains , where the drug gangs are de facto under control .	-4.2252
For this week 's edition , Riodoce has clicked on three main stories .	-2.5625
There was the murder of the brother of former known Boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa .	-2.3673
They also had an exposé on government spending that concentrated on the Governor ’ s hometown .	-3.8861
And there was a group that led to abduction in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan , one block away from the Office of the Prosecutor .	-3.4240
There was no official word about who was abducted or how it happened , so we had to be careful when there was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favourite place for drug traffickers and authorities .	-4.2955
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belonged to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party ( PRI ) , which ruled all political levels almost throughout the century .	-4.5167
A number of PRI governors have recently been accused of corruption in high-risk cases .	-8.0063
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant , including one in which a son of " El Chapo " Guzman escaped a military attack .	-4.3134
Only a few months earlier , readers would have seen the Valdez column as the most informed source of abduction .	-3.3115
" We had known what happened before , " said Villarreal , 46 , with the nickname " El Flaco " because of its slim body stature .	-3.6811
" Now all channels of communication with our sources have broken . "	-2.2998
The Valdez office has been transformed into a storage space for characters and stickers protesting against the murder of journalists , because the staff have become something they have never expected : activists on behalf of the press .	-4.8997
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few characters and went to a demonstration next morning for another journalist to the Office of the Public Prosecutor .	-11.2797
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after Valdez was killed .	-1.5318
A burned body has been discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests that it is his .	-2.0519
Journalists have become louder across the country by writing down ' SOS Press ' in walking paths and buildings in organised protests .	-3.7679
On that day , the director Bojorquez is out of Washington trying to gather international support for justice in the Valdez case .	-4.1141
During a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez , Ramirez accused the authorities of spying journalists and killing them because they told the truth .	-3.0919
She has since asked for the government to redistribute it because it is concerned that its anger has violated its objectivity .	-4.2749
Valdez had repeatedly said that in Mexico journalists were ' surrounded ' by organised crime , involved government officials and an equal society .	-3.3340
In his last book , Narco Journalism , he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs , but also on orders from politicians and security forces who were under one blanket with organised crime .	-5.4888
Last year , the media guard group " Articulo 19 " allocated more than half of the attacks on police and civil servants journalists .	-3.3877
" In Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth , " said Ramirez .	-2.4438
Obviously , the killings have a dissuasive effect .	-6.2335
Nobody forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago .	-2.3548
Your body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Zeta cartel : ' I am here because of my reports ' .	-3.3577
A computer keyboard and headphones were located next to their separated head .	-3.4067
Some branches have chosen to close , like the El Norte newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March .	-2.9129
Others continue , as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of its director in 2004 .	-2.5042
In 2010 the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the front page with the title " What do you want from us ? "	-9.5325
Some journalists fled from their home countries , or even from the country .	-2.9984
It is a painful decision .	-0.6254
It is difficult to find work in exile , and they are still watching the streets and looking for dangers .	-2.4067
And sometimes they are being driven , as seems to be the photographer Ruben Espinosa , who was murdered in 2015 with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the flight from Veracruz .	-3.8768
For those who stay behind and continue working , it is a daily dance with risky decisions .	-2.8452
Ibarra , who once wanted to be a poet , admits that drug trafficking is scaring him .	-2.2719
" Mexico goes to hell , and that is why I became a reporter , " he said .	-3.0343
At midnight last Friday , when the last issue had already ended , the editors of Riodoce sat in front of the office on the platform of the citizens , and drowned beer when all their phones started to sum up . . on the . on the .	-13.1288
A series of shooting foundries with gang rivals and security forces near Mazatlan bathing resort had left 19 confirmed dead .	-4.2964
The war continued to escalate , as promised by a number of cartel embassies in the region .	-2.1486
From the Bordsteinkante you have posted news on the Riodoce website via mobile phone .	-5.1789
The front page had to be changed the next day .	-1.6346
Sirenen hooked near - another arbitration in the area .	-3.8709
Bojorquez had a look at the policemen holding guards to see if they were ready .	-2.9949
If they were afraid at all , they did not .	-2.0796
Riodoce ’ s staff followed his tracks under the huge portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible to all Sinaloa .	-6.0691
'How can you just think of closing it , ' said Bojorquez , ' when the same day Javier was murdered , the intern asked me to send her to the streets for reporting . '	-5.6164
Dinosaurs used camouflage to escape his enemies .	-2.6876
At first sight , it looks like a statue , though frightening .	-2.2720
Researchers have now found that the first insights of the incredible nashorn of a Canadian mining worker were so well received that experts described it as the " Mona Lisa of Dinosaurs " .	-4.9383
It was so well received that they even found that his rugged skin was of reddish brown - and they said she had had had had had something of a " troubled past " .	-5.4503
The report in the Current Biology magazine called it " the best-preserved armoured dinosaur ever found and one of the best dinosaurs in the world " .	-3.7725
The fossil is a newly discovered type of nodosaur that lived in the middle of the Crescent period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .	-4.1250
Its unbelievably well-preserved state has amazed researchers who describe it as ' really remarkable ' .	-4.4473
According to reports in National Geographic , the pest is the most preserved fossil of its kind .	-2.7801
It was found by Shawn Funk when he grub on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta , Canada .	-2.3335
He met on something that seemed miserable from the surrounding rock , and decided to watch more closely .	-5.0491
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology .	-1.8115
They spent the next six years uncovering wild animals within the 2,500 pound ( 1,100 kg ) heavy earth clumps .	-3.9126
After all this hard work , the final result is now ready to be revealed .	-1.9262
" If you blink a little with your eyes , you might almost think it has slept , " said the main author , Caleb Brown , scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum , where the creature is to be seen .	-8.5542
" It will enter into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and well-preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaur . "	-3.8581
Researchers found that , although it is covered with an armor and resembles a changing tank , dinosaurs that were likely to be swept by meat were threatened .	-5.9676
The hard-paneled dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators and used a shielding technique known as a counterclaim that is also used by many modern animals .	-5.1799
This would have allowed him to get better into his environment and escape from his enemies , experts say , suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs .	-5.5356
The 110 million years old creature from the Nodosaurier family made headlines in May for the first time and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology .	-3.6294
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell , one of a team that spent over 7,000 hours uncovering it carefully .	-3.9807
The astonishing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of drawers and armor through his body .	-4.8743
They discovered the faction , a common defense method in animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was darker than its bottom .	-3.6133
Although concealment is common , the results are surprising , as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of the animals living today .	-4.9110
It suggests that the dinosaur was chased by enough pressure from meat eating dinosaurs that the evolution encouraged confrontation to be disguised as a means of survival .	-4.4507
But most contemporary animals using concealment - think of deer , zebra , or belts - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey , signaling that this nodosaur has faced a real struggle for survival .	-5.5266
" Strong predatory behavior on a massive , deeply panned dinosaur shows how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the Creed Age must have been , " said Brown .	-4.6822
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was redbrown .	-2.0176
Scientists continue to study the animal ’ s references to his life , including his conserved intestine , in order to find out what it had eaten as his last meal .	-4.3350
They believe that the dinosaur , when he died , was slipped into a river and sent out to the sea , where he sank on the back to the sea floor .	-4.6430
At that time Alberta was as warm as South Florida today , and rivers and oceans probably spread more inland than they are today .	-2.9802
" This nodosaur is truly remarkable because it is fully covered with conserved slippery skin , but it is also preserved in three dimensions and retains the original shape of the animal , " said Brown .	-6.3017
" The result is that the animal looks almost the same as it was in the early Crescent Age .	-4.0704
You don 't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it , and if you look a little with your eyes , you might almost think he 's sleeping . "	-4.7927
The Crescent Age was a time when huge theropods , carnivorous dinosaur , standing on two legs , pulled through the earth .	-4.1054
Although the king of them , the tyrannosaurus Rex , lived millions of years after Borealopelta , the armored dinosaur was driven by some of his awful ancestors .	-3.3099
The Acrocandoraurus is a 38 foot ( 11.5 m ) long and six tons of hard monsters .	-5.9664
The scientists whose latest findings appear in the Current Biology magazine believe that Borealopelta was sank in the sea after death and mutated in the mud .	-4.4879
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he grub on March 21 , 2011 in Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in North Alberta , Canada .	-2.9227
According to the museum it is the world ’ s best-preserved armoured dinosaur , including skin and armor , and is completely from the snout to the hip .	-4.0863
The creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,300 kg ) .	-2.3896
It contained two 20-inch long tips raging from his shoulders .	-2.8414
Researchers believe that Western Canada has swamped the pandered herbivory until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea .	-6.1691
But the Dinosaur ’ s underwater coverage preserved its armor in exquisite detail .	-4.1409
The auctioned remains of this special specimen are preserved so well that the remains of the skin still cover woody panels along the dinosaur .	-5.0084
As Michael Greshko has written for National Geographic , such conservation level is so rare as a lotto win .	-3.5864
The more I see it , the more confusing it is .	-2.1963
Auctionated remains of the skin still cover the woody panels that carry the animal 's skull .	-5.3899
His right forefoot is on his side , his five fingers are spurred upwards .	-4.0873
I can count the shoes on his sole ' .	-2.0056
In the Committees : Mass Carambolage on A8 : Many Injured	-3.9378
A heavy accident on Thursday evening at the A8 : Nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carambulage .	-6.5214
There are many injured , kilometres of traffic jams and gaffers .	-3.3881
On the motorway Stuttgart-München ( A8 ) , about 20 people were injured on Thursday afternoon in a mass carambolage .	-5.3940
According to the police , at 5 p.m. , between the stations Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen ( district of Aich-Friedberg ) during a thunderstorm , almost 30 vehicles , including probably trucks , were intertwined .	-6.9136
The exact number of injuries was not available at first .	-3.6837
It is about minor or heavy injuries , said a spokesman .	-4.0171
A large supply of rescue vehicles was at the site of the accident .	-4.1656
The A8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich .	-2.0711
A approximately ten kilometer long backlog was formed in the Munich Motorway .	-7.9259
As an AZ reporter reports , there were also massive obstacles on the headway - through numerous gaffers .	-5.7422
The fire brigade took note of the characteristics of the drivers , who now face sensitive penalties .	-5.8450
Shortly after 18 : 45 , a second accident occurred on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and Dasing .	-3.2949
There was a collision between a passenger and a passenger car .	-3.5443
A rescue helicopter was on the way to the scene .	-2.9064
Deutsche Bahn : Group tests " Comfort Check-in "	-2.8086
It is a moment that almost everyone has already experienced : nothing terribly sits in the train and sleep .	-4.9020
Or one is deepened in his work and has just a brilliant idea .	-2.9237
And then : pufff .	-0.9674
Come the sheep and wake up an unwise or tear the passenger out of the workflow .	-6.2397
Card control .	-2.3127
But the days of interruptions are about to end .	-4.6589
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing fuss-free ticket control .	-2.9649
You simply confirm by mobile that you take your seat and thereby devalue the ticket .	-4.1518
Currently , a test run runs on two tracks .	-3.2771
" When the offer becomes available , we extend it .	-2.5327
It will be available in Germany at the beginning of next year on many other long-distance routes , " said a railway trainer .	-5.9864
" Comfort Check-in " calls the train ticket depreciation without Schaffner .	-4.9497
To be able to use them , you have to meet certain requirements : you need a smartphone or a tablet .	-4.9262
And you have to have booked an online ticket , which is what most passengers already do .	-4.4645
You have to buy it through the app of the train , the DB Navigator , which is the most convenient way of booking your ticket .	-5.2201
Last but not least , you need a seat reservation .	-2.4978
Because the " Comfort Check-in " works like this : you get up the train , call your ticket under " My Tickets " .	-5.9994
For the test customers a button on electronic devaluation will appear .	-4.6825
The train attendants get a message on their mobile devices that passengers X are in the train and have taken the booked seat Y .	-5.2476
When the train attendant takes place at the ticket control , he knows that there is a passenger with an already paid online ticket .	-5.6429
So we can continue to sleep , continue working and keep quiet .	-3.4989
The " check-in " has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should benefit passengers .	-4.1970
" If you want to travel with our train attendants without ticketing , you can check in the DB Navigator .	-6.3837
This makes it possible for passengers to personalise their travel time on the train " , says Michael Peterson , Marketing Board of DB Ferntraffic .	-3.8387
Second plus : " And our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs " .	-3.0545
Those who often train know that , in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket controls are one of the biggest problems .	-4.9854
Because often you own , but in any case one of your fellow travellers does not have all the documents you need to obtain online tickets .	-6.5006
Either the credit card or the ID card or any other document you have to provide .	-4.6767
The result is endless discussions between train attendants and passengers , resulting in a bad atmosphere in the section or the space and delays in controlling their own tickets and , in the end , taking the Schaffner time to address other concerns .	-7.2889
Only a few test customers can still use the new service .	-8.5075
And this also only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen .	-2.2787
Other train numbers on the same track are not yet available .	-3.0744
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question : ' What rows ? '	-2.7686
On August 9 , 2014 , Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core .	-2.4204
Only a day after she arrived in New York City , the dungeon in St. Louis sat on the bed of an airbnb apartment that she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone .	-4.2034
She stumbled over a post from someone in the High School .	-1.9895
" The police have just killed an 18-year-old child , and it is still on the street , " it was said there .	-3.7891
Confused because nobody else had posted the information on their feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .	-2.5222
A user with the handle <unk> TheePharoah was constantly retweeted on their timeline .	-3.3387
The rapper from the area of St. Louis was about to win live the death of Michael Brown , an unarmed black 18-year-old killed by a white policeman in Ferguson , Mo .	-3.8399
He posted a picture of Brown ’ s lifeless body , which was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours .	-3.5543
" This is wild " , says Ferrell .	-4.2215
But death was nothing new for them and their community .	-1.7397
She left her cell phone to return to tweets later on on to people on the Canfield Drive . on .	-7.0827
There were photographs of the police band and people who wrote and of a man who claimed to be Brown 's father , who was wearing a shield with the inscription : ' Ferguson 's police have just killed my unarmed son ! '	-5.3743
She watched a live feed where a policeman stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a beautiful dog .	-3.4629
In another video , she said , another policeman made his gun and shouted : " I 'll kill you ... animals all . "	-4.8732
" This is not customary , " Ferrell remembered her statement .	-3.6866
'That is not the kind of murder we used to and which we can typically call . '	-6.8361
At this moment I felt Schuttelfrost .	-6.0242
I was angry and wept . '	-2.3762
She booked a return flight and went home the next day .	-1.5877
After landing at 23 : 00 , she took her 6 year old daughter from her father 's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning .	-4.9514
What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the theme of a new documentary film , " Who Streets ? " , in cinemas from 11 .	-3.6235
It is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resilience that exists from the point of view of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers .	-4.0297
When Ferrell joined Ferguson with her daughter , who was wearing a flower dress and a matching crown , the two talked a conversation that she had innumerable times before this morning » about the black experience and the black state <unk> .	-5.0048
" You remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? " she remembered what she said .	-3.6870
" We are now going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that was not right .	-2.6199
I could not take it with me , " said Ferrell later .	-2.3391
" What happened today is a culmination of what happened in the past .	-2.4975
They need to know it , they need to see it , and they need it to be raised .	-4.2211
It must be well developed , not only activism and organization , but also the different strata of the black experience and the black constitution , and what we must do to become free to liberate ourselves .	-4.1666
Although I have the good fortune to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience blatant racism , she is no different to the next black child of women .	-3.9568
I feel I would do her a bad service to keep her out of it . '	-2.9393
The first station , when she arrived in Ferguson , was located on South Florissant Road , a place opposite the police force , which became a campground when activists waited for the possible non-charge of officer Darren Wilson .	-6.0974
Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch .	-2.8599
They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators .	-2.0843
Slowly , a new type of activism began to take shape for Ferrell .	-2.8223
" My activism changed completely after August 9 , " she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities .	-3.4720
" I had no experience in organizing .	-1.5238
It has come . '	-1.9561
Weeks later , Ferrell met during an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan , one of the co-director of the film .	-2.1800
Torayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado Farrar just wanted to " document " what happened .	-2.8736
A question came to Ferrell : ' Do you want to document or try to find a story you can use ? '	-3.9251
This skepticism has been nourished by countless cases of people , often whites , in a community that has benefited from their pain and resilience .	-3.9703
As Torayan recently stated in an interview , ' We had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson did not centralise their votes and we wanted to do it differently ' .	-8.8817
Folayan had already collaborated with the then co-director Damon Davis , an artist from the area known for his activism for death row occupants .	-4.0398
His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project , together with six other local residents , was followed by the team of " Who Streets ? " in the years after Brown 's shooting .	-5.7780
" This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us , " we , , " , Davis .	-4.5101
'That was the main thing for me , as these people are presented , because that is how I shall be represented ' .	-4.9140
The aim was not to focus on Ferrell 's experience - to show that the movement " is not a Messias leader , but a community that comes together , " said Folayan - she proved to be the most open participant in the film .	-4.4663
As a result , documents of " Why Streets ? " show surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell 's life as she falls in love and marries her wife .	-4.4428
" I felt like naked , " said Ferrell and laughed when she first saw the finished product .	-2.3597
'But I understood that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people . '	-3.9949
In addition , Ferrell ’ s story repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black-Lives Matter movement .	-2.5183
Two of the three founders of the movement who , after killing the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 , identified the film " BlacklivesMatter " in social media as gay .	-3.9455
" Black , gay women in managerial positions have carried the movement as a whole , " said Ferrell , " and so we are constantly fighting on different fronts .	-4.4807
Black , gay women must bear the brunt of everything . '	-1.7370
Folayan agreed to note that " the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women " .	-2.9488
However , she insists that " this is not an affirmative type of action " where Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film due to her identity .	-3.7993
" She was the person who spurred this energy , " she said .	-2.5937
" It is not a coincidence , although she was at the front line because in a life on these crossings as a black , gay woman is so much at stake .	-4.6711
You can feel your energy through the screen ' .	-1.9411
In the meantime , Ferguson ’ s news cameras have long since disappeared , but the racial links between the community and the police continue .	-3.9240
Ferrell is on probe for 2 <unk> years because of the blocking of a motorway during a demonstration .	-3.6304
She describes the social atmosphere of the area she calls her home : ' A Chaos ' .	-3.7669
Nevertheless , she is listening to a voice and feels committed to this memory since she took to the streets three years ago in Ferguson .	-4.9104
" It is our duty to fight for our freedom .	-0.8156
It is our duty to win .	-0.5850
We must love and support each other .	-1.1127
We have nothing to lose , apart from our chains . '	-1.9562
From ' Dream ' to ' Grö<unk>enwahn ' : TV readers are discussing bit-gallery .	-4.6350
The bit gallery moves people although it is not yet built .	-3.2027
But the idea of a shopping centre on the southern end of the pedestrian zone splits the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .	-4.3538
The issue scarcely limbs .	-3.8966
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page " Volksfreunde Bitburg " .	-3.1012
While some say about the bit-gallery : " That would be a dream " ( Anja Becker ) or " That would be really great " ( Nicole Schasten ) , the other side comes from : " Don 't need a man " ( Siggi Betzen ) or , quite simply , " Lars Scholz ! " .	-13.0689
While supporters are relying on a gallery to attract more customers to the city , the other shops also benefit from it , opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will be bleeding .	-7.4884
In addition , the gallery is planned on exactly the plot where the farmhouse is located , where 13 direct distributors offer their products .	-5.6485
At the beginning of the construction work this will stop .	-4.1346
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall in the new building - for the roof place with possibility of sitting outside .	-5.2714
Simone Zimmer : " We have been buying for many years in the Farm Market Hall almost weekly .	-4.0047
Our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of our peasants are always very happy .	-8.5093
Also we discovered the butchery for us .	-2.4773
We hope that there will be a chance , even during and , above all , after the construction of the gallery , to this offer .	-4.4786
There are other cities as well .	-2.2772
Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . '	-2.9075
Gerd Densing : " Whether direct marketing people are located in a market hall in the gallery , the rental price is high .	-4.8996
It is not likely to be very low in the new project ' .	-4.2376
Eva Kilic : " Why shopping malls in Bitburg ?	-2.5482
Whether clothing , footwear , droughts or supermarkets , I find this superfluous .	-3.9507
There is enough of that in our town .	-2.3982
You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .	-2.9603
However , since there is not even a proper weekly market here , it is all the more important that we at least maintain the market hall .	-4.6534
After all , the goods offered there are fresh , are mostly offered directly by the producer and are also inexpensive .	-4.2318
As you can see , shop shops in a shopping centre are only registered by larger companies , because the rents there are often not viable for a retailer .	-5.6936
Sadly , there is almost no longer any specialisation and what remains of it will probably disappear . '	-6.1589
Wolf Fandel : " A shopping centre with a market hall doesn 't fit for me .	-2.9173
And the gallery does not fit into Bitburg .	-1.5929
First of all : Where should the Farm Market Halle go during the construction time ?	-4.2888
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long term , if the bit gallery really does come in .	-5.6804
Or does the ghost bit gallery already manage to drive all the business from Bitburg ? '	-4.3027
George Marquet : " That simply will not work .	-1.6653
And no one needs a shopping centre that is empty .	-2.8135
I think it would have been better to promote a real agricultural market , rather than this gallery .	-3.1360
But for a farmer market hall , I think there is no longer any place for pointless construction projects in Bitburg thanks to the insane number of people .	-7.1952
If the farmhouse market hall is broken , a bit of culture will disappear . '	-4.4021
A matching similarity : Artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA .	-2.6967
In the middle of the Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces - white , black and brown , which are almost invisible - hanging on cables from the ceiling .	-4.0309
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tuturers and Haarcuts , who were sent to her by Chelsea Manning .	-4.6022
Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison , where the former intelligence analyst sanctioned a 35-year sentence after making them public as secretly classified diplomatic messages on WikiLeaks ’ site .	-4.9519
The new exhibition , opened on August 2 , is called A Becoming Resemblace ( A suitable similarity ) .	-3.8547
She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg , whose discipline brought together her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Manning , a transwife and pioneering dissident whose condemnation was transformed by Barack Obama when he was only three days in office .	-5.1406
Dewey-Hagborg , through the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted from manning and from the 30 portraits that could look like one with these genomic data , has a sharp , though somewhat intellectual commentary not only on the formability of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also on identity .	-5.7932
Manning , who was born in Bradley Edward , but has already spoken openly about the identification as a woman since her puberty , was condemned in 2013 for 20 charges , including six violations of the spy law , computer fraud and theft .	-4.5852
The prison was suppressed , so much so that there was only one photograph - a grained , black and white selfie in which man clearly sits on a driver seat and wearing a platinum blade - with which she was associated .	-7.5642
In 2015 , Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of her 2012 project , Stranger Visions .	-3.2297
In it , the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette stumbling and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to create an image of what these people could look like .	-5.9803
That was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine .	-2.0555
" They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , " explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition .	-3.3198
And she could not be visited at this time and she could not be photographed , so take contact with Chelsea and ask her whether she wanted to make a DNA portrait .	-3.5236
The artist and her Muse imprisoned became unequal correspondents who exchanged several letters over the course of two years .	-4.5311
They even created a comic " Suppressed Images " , illustrated by Shoili Kanungo , which foresaw a future in which President Chelsea 's verdict would be converted and it would be able to see the exhibition personally .	-4.5344
Indeed , just a few days after the book was published , Obama would demand the release of Manning after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome kind of happy meeting .	-4.1695
There is also now something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Trump is waging a war against whistle-blowers from the government camp and transgender-troops to find new , tweet-capable ways to further unravel the rigid divisions that he should fix .	-6.9931
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said that ' things happen for a certain reason ' .	-2.9245
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Manning called with her overwhelming signature ( the " i " in her family name is attached with a heart ) an end to " automatic fragmentation , whose basis was gender , race , sexuality and culture . "	-5.3318
On the opposite wall , its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand feet of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .	-3.3889
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show , by including the 200 letters ( or nucleotides according to the advanced scientific lexicon of the artist ) , how astonishingly similar , at least in biological terms , we are all .	-3.4962
" What people hopefully will take with them is that our genome is not concerned about who we are and how open genetic data are for an interpretation and how subjective they are , " said Dewey-Hagborg , whose video work of 2007 , Spurious Memories , is also to be seen .	-3.5482
'DNA data can tell so many different stories , so it is 30 of these stories . '	-2.8977
The last piece of the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room , is a page from the comic novel mentioned above .	-4.7512
It shows manning how , with a free phone , it appears in the hands of the disciplines in the United States like King Kong .	-6.9632
" When they cold your speech , they won , " it says .	-3.7867
'So never mouth ' .	-2.3684
" It came directly from a letter she wrote to me , " said the artist who greets Philadelphia .	-2.0403
'I still get goosebut when I talk about it ' .	-2.3892
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition personally - just as it was forward-looking in the comicbook - but if it should do it , it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks , by their own genomic simulacrs , which collide like hordes of protesters .	-6.3137
It was also purposeful , like everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 " 2 , manning stature ) in which their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil .	-4.5910
" In the past I had her on the wall , but I wanted her to feel like a crowd , " said Dewey-Hagborg of the portraits .	-2.3891
" I wanted it to feel like a mass movement formed with Chelsea , like the movement that was behind its liberation . "	-2.7067
Professor of Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford University sought for killing .	-4.1727
A national hunt is underway for a professor at Northwest University and an employee at the University of Oxford , who are being sought as suspects after a man was killed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago .	-5.5861
On Monday , arrest warrants for Wyndham Lathem ( 42 ) and Andrew Warren ( 56 ) were issued for murder due to their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau , as shown by the acts of the court of office of Cook County .	-4.6615
The documents say that Cornell Duranleau , 26 , died after several stings .	-2.7548
A Community warning system published by the police force in Chicago states that the body was discovered on 27 July .	-2.6427
Officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .	-2.1454
Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead at the site of the event , and detectives study the cases as murder , while the police actively seek the two suspects , officials said .	-5.0463
Latehem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwest University since 2007 .	-2.6024
Alan K. Cubbage , Vice President for University Relations , said in an email statement that Lathem has now been validated and has been excluded from entering the Campus of Northwestern University .	-15.1543
" This is now a criminal matter investigated by the competent authorities , and Northwest University is cooperating in this investigation , " said Cubbage .	-8.0516
Warren is a senior treasury assistant at Oxford University .	-2.3115
A spokesman at the University and Somerville College said in an email statement that ' we are in contact with the police in Britain and are ready to help the US investigation authorities in every way possible ' .	-4.6424
The statement added that Warren ’ s colleagues were shocked , and they want him to be .	-3.4013
Chief Communications Officer of Chicago , Anthony Guglielmi , said he strongly urge suspects to face up to the authorities .	-2.6675
" The police have an idea of their place of residence , and our efforts to find them strengthen themselves , " said Guglielmi .	-3.0699
Guglielmi said that local , regional , and national authorities help find the suspects .	-2.4830
Guglielmi said that the police received a call from the property manager of the Grand-Plaza building , who had just received a mysterious tip stating that something had happened in the apartment 1008 .	-4.3006
The police described the scene as very cruel .	-0.9496
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident also took place on 27 July .	-2.6185
It was confirmed by security cameras that rubber and warriors were in the building .	-4.9386
" We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship , " said Guglielmi .	-1.6947
The management team at Grand Plaza issued a statement to the residents : ' The police are currently working on the timeline and the victim 's background and is exploring a variety of motives , including a possible domestic event . '	-4.8254
'We will complete the WADA Road Map in the near future ' - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko	-3.2321
Russian Vice Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that it will not take long for the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) to be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti-doping agency ( RUSADA ) .	-11.3309
" At a certain stage of compliance with the criteria of the roadmap RUSADA has been granted the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD ( UK Anti-Doping ) .	-3.6792
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this regard , " said Mutko on Thursday .	-2.6315
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA roadmap to comply with the code describing the criteria for resettlement of RUSADA and was recently published on the organization 's website .	-3.7127
According to Mutko , there is nothing that could give cause for concern to Russia .	-2.6091
" Everything has been announced , everything is implemented .	-1.8304
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and the WADA in the near future , " he added .	-1.9248
However , one of the criteria set out in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by WADA by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport .	-4.7476
On the matter , Mutko said : ' We are carrying out the investigation because our anti-doping system has admitted a mistake .	-4.0966
All the measures have been implemented .	-1.4847
But there were no public programmes , and we will not admit something that does not exist . '	-3.0337
Mutkos ’ words were in line with those of Vitaly Smirnov , the head of the independent Russian anti-doping Commission .	-3.1563
Smirnov had problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organisations when talking to the Russian branch of RSport at the beginning of the day , but then added : ' We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .	-5.7107
Nobody wants to accept this report unconditionally , " Smirnov added .	-3.2476
RUSADA was excluded from carrying out metering controls in Russia in November 2015 , following the WADA ’ s doping scandal .	-4.2583
However , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping ( UKAD ) .	-2.0342
After a visit to Moscow 's headquarters in July , WADA Director-General Olivier Niggli declared that RUSADA ' is moving ' in the right direction ' to be reinstated .	-4.8715
Aldi is not Selling Eggs	-5.1210
This was shared by business groups .	-3.0019
It was a purely precautionary measure , which stated in the communication that no health damage could continue to occur .	-6.3140
From now on only eggs will be delivered to Aldi , which has been demonstrably tested in a negative way on fipronical antiparasite .	-8.0361
Aldi wants to make clarity and transparency with his customers .	-4.3004
The start-ups that will help your company not to become the next Uber .	-2.8142
Amy Erlett wanted to measure the happiness of your employees in your e-commerce start-up , but the polls didn 't work .	-4.2678
Answers were often vague , unhelpful , or , worse still , fraudulent .	-1.6421
And even if you promised anonymity , some workers did not trust the process .	-1.1141
" There was simply never consistency and objectivity , " says Erratt , who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Society Madison Reed .	-3.0992
She called people from outside for help .	-1.4369
A new breed of human resources start-ups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel .	-3.2312
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it enables companies to conduct surveys , address specific groups and demographic groups , provide anonymity and complaint hotlines , and in some cases , whistleblowers allow C-Suite executives to bypass and address directly to the board .	-5.3635
" You now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health , but where is the Fitbit for your company ? " said Jim Barnett , co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement .	-4.2925
Erratt said that they gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint .	-3.9509
In addition to the snap surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat map of the company , which shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which executives have low approval results - so you can drill , why .	-5.9947
Companies come to understand that they must remain at the top of the workplace culture so that you do not become the next Uber involved in scandals since a former employee published a blog post describing an environment of harassment punishing those who spoke .	-5.4696
For start-ups like Glint , this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity .	-3.1621
Global governance , regulation , and compliance could hold more than $ 118.7 billion in 2020 , according to the Let 's Talk Payments website .	-3.1250
Denver , Colorado , Start-up Convercent , which helps companies prevent and recognize bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity early this year in the midst of the Uber everything discredited .	-3.6483
Convercent has almost 600 clients , including Airbnb , Microsoft and Tesla .	-1.6871
Uber has recently registered as a client .	-1.8613
Like Glint , Convercent is enabling companies to send customised " pulse " surveys , gather confidential responses in real time and view the heat types of your problem areas .	-5.7883
It also provides an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior .	-2.4650
When the chief executive is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .	-3.2419
" The court of public opinion has captured regulators , " said Patrick Quinlan , founder and managing director of Convercent .	-2.8991
When a company is found that treats its employees badly or acts unethically , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycott , employee turnover and complaints , Quinlan said .	-4.1173
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations , has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have a simple way to reach their company headquarters .	-4.2134
In the past , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously .	-4.3314
It was often intimidation and inconvenient experience , said James Vitrano , Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel , who said that there was no good way to monitor staff complaints .	-3.4663
Now that the company Convercent is deploying , problems previously hiding by leaders sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , harassment or unfair internships - can be identified and addressed more quickly .	-5.3577
" I can get closer to this holistic , 360-degree view of employment experience , " said Vitrano , who leads the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday .	-3.3570
'And we protect our shareholders from employment litigation ' .	-3.2462
Companies began to take ethics , values , and staff engagement more seriously in 2002 , after the accounting company Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations by the Enron scandal , said Quinlan .	-3.8001
But it took until the ' social media came to their right ' that companies realised that they could not prevent their dirty laundry from going online .	-3.5140
" Before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , " he said .	-1.4005
Glint and Convercent both offer your software as a service and burden companies with recurring charges for using their products .	-4.1128
It is a business model and an opportunity that finds the consent of Venture Capital investors , who supported both start-ups .	-7.9390
Convercent received $ 10 million in funding in February from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital , raising all capital to $ 47 million .	-2.1782
Glitzern secured $ 10 million in November from Better Venture Partners , bringing all of its funding to $ 60 million .	-3.6718
These investments are hardly surprising , given the interconnected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .	-2.5142
There is a growing complexity of research that shows that today ’ s employees expect more from their jobs than they have done .	-5.2743
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley , high salaries and interesting projects are only operations .	-2.8322
The staff want to have the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated and that you are giving your time to a company with a positive mission .	-4.1164
" If people are happy to be in a company that belongs to their voices , and that the work you do is worthwhile , they feel more committed to making this company successful , " said Nina McQueen , Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn , which uses both Convercent and Glint .	-5.2099
Investors are yielding returns when their portfolio companies run well , and companies are doing well when they work and are committed .	-5.8047
If third party analytics tools promise to increase commitment and commitment , it is no wonder that you will find support .	-3.5768
The data on the involvement of employees according to the experts in the workplace culture is important .	-5.1240
But the data will be useless if a company ’ s managers do not take action .	-8.3840
Indeed , when a company asks staff for feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way .	-3.2293
And if change does not come quickly enough , or at all , it can breed disappointments and demotify employees .	-4.1397
" If you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be ready to have 4,000 talks , " said Russell Raath , President of Consulting at the business management company Kotter International , who has seen too much data collection companies .	-4.9592
" For if you do not follow staff will ask themselves , " Have you really heard me ?	-3.2490
Do you care about this ?	-2.5003
And whom do you not care about why should I ? '	-2.5210
Madison Reed , who is now conducting monthly staff surveys , was able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported on Glint , so Erratt .	-4.3141
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees , it was able to reorganize several teams within the company through the speed of decision making and the quality of communication , and add a communication training to address the problems .	-5.3956
At Ruby Tuesday , the company always receives new insights about its employees , and it hopes that in the long run this will lead to better ties between workers in an industry known for high turnover .	-5.7452
" If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose the people , " Vitrano said .	-2.0101
" And if you lose people , you lose also customers .	-1.8894
And if you lose customers , you will lose businesses .	-2.0803
The NCAA is removing the two-day practice and making a long day for the Bruins .	-4.1771
It 's up to 23 o 'clock when a lot of UCLA football players are chatting on one side of the new training fields of the team at the campus .	-5.8642
Some have drawn their trikote parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .	-4.3329
For a good part of the team these uncomfortable minutes are a lunch break .	-3.2126
Players enrolled in summer courses will return to their final exams after the three-hour exercise , before returning to the Waterman Football Center the next morning at 6.30 pm .	-5.2279
" This is a real tree-mill for the guys the next three days , " said Bruins-Trainer Jim Mora just before Monday became Tuesday .	-3.8543
The NCAA has eliminated two-day exercises to ease the burden of players and has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .	-4.1852
Therefore , the UCLA ’ s first three training sessions should begin at 19 : 15 to meet players ’ already completed timetables .	-5.5498
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins moved the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and carried out practical exercises for the first time during the summer school during Moras six seasons in Westwood .	-5.5029
20 before the formal game preparation begins , Texas A & M kicks off in September .	-5.3488
Mora said he would support NCAA 's rule change , even if it added another point to the player 's busy routing .	-4.7883
" We put this enormous burden three or four days on it , and it is very challenging , " said Mora .	-2.3490
" And they simply pressed it through , they chase on , they are great people .	-4.1987
I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time it will be really great . '	-4.0342
The UCLA will end its practices once the camp has finished , which , given the clear lines of its fields , will not be easy to do with the adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center , a top-class hotel , which has already been provided with foot balls that have placed a protective net behind a gate gate .	-9.5479
Brun players are supposed to occupy the hotel this weekend , but Mora admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .	-4.5951
" We will use our security , " Mora said .	-1.9382
" This is a real problem , and it is not farfetched to think that people rent a room there and then prepare to record an exercise .	-4.3765
If you have the video tape of an exercise , it is quite a good deal .	-2.9189
But we have security forces there , and we have security forces at parking 8 .	-2.2413
We will do the best with what we have .	-1.1963
I am not so worried .	-3.2494
We have a plan . '	-0.7298
Facebook wants to intensify fact-finding review in the fight against counterfeit news .	-3.1594
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with fake reports to factual auditors from third parties and then display their results under the original paper , said Thursday ’ s largest online social network , one of its efforts to combat fake news .	-6.5746
In an opinion on its website , the company said that it will start using updated machine learning methods to identify possible false reports and send them to factual auditors who may see results from the factual article .	-6.5892
Facebook was criticized as one of the main distributional points for so-called fake news , many of which believe have also influenced the 2016 US presidential election .	-3.9710
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with French voters being flooded with false stories in the run-up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan to penalise social media networks if they fail to eliminate hateful postings quickly , as they did before the September elections .	-4.5863
On Thursday , Facebook , in a separate statement in German , said that a test of the new factual review will be launched in the US , France , the Netherlands and Germany .	-3.8390
" In addition to knowing what stories are being challenged by third party fact-auditors , people want more context to make informed choices about what they read and share , " said Sara Su , product manager for Facebook news in a blog .	-4.5688
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the " related article " and will work on other changes to his news feed to reduce false messages .	-3.6347
Creating a comic novel : A Castle in the History of England	-2.1961
In his recent past , the little Scotney Castle was on display in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s .	-3.7439
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cosy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become an inspiration for a graphical novel by Jamie Rhodes , a mophaarigen Yorkshire with a love for historical documents .	-4.6491
" I think it is so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years , " he is loathing .	-4.6216
'What a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hands ' .	-2.0184
" A Castle in England " covers the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney .	-5.5896
It is not Rhodes 's first book , based on an archive : he wrote 2014 ' Dead Men 's Teeth and Other Stories ' , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotionally .	-3.2304
" I reacted only to the thumb prints on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700s who worked for the Jacobins , " he says .	-5.1618
" That is his fingerprint !	-2.4698
And letters always smack of smoke , because at that time a fire was incited because of light .	-5.3029
For someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if it were .	-4.2566
Oh , I love Archive ! '	-1.0741
For someone who has been hit with old papers in such a way that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ( " To be honest : I have a little overvalued my welcome ) , this seems all too beautiful to be true .	-6.2442
Rhodos spent his days exploring the " new " Victorian castle , seeing through the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle , such as the mounted hues on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in tombs .	-5.7337
He walked through the grounds and ruins of the old castle and talked to landscape carers , gardeners and sometimes to artists working on the illustrations of his book .	-4.8151
Then , at night he drank " whiskey and began to write " .	-1.5376
The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown , as the National Trust only gained full access in 2006 when the last heir , Elizabeth Hussey , died .	-4.4612
When Rhodes arrived a decade later , the employees just began to look after the archive that he described as " hundreds of years in which aristocrats said " Oh , wield it on the attic " .	-12.1394
Tagebuckers , letters from the time of the English Empire , maps that represent who owned what : " You might think that land conflicts would be boring " , says Rhodes , " but there was a birch to fight the two families .	-6.3700
Young people , let everyone go ! '	-3.2581
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to explore English on a broader basis , including ' The Labour ' , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the farming revolt of 1381 .	-5.5295
" There is a record of a turmoil in 1380 at the castle , in this book entitled ' Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex ' , says Rhodes .	-3.9196
" The uprising began in this area and I thought that an uprising was a good start .	-2.6213
Perhaps the two are linked ? '	-1.6414
Other stories are deeply rooted in the history of the castle - like ' The Priest ' , which tells the story of the Jesuit Father , whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation .	-5.3746
Or ' The Smuggler ' , which depicts smuggler Arthur Darrell from the 18th century , who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coffin was excavated ) .	-13.2696
The Darrells are Rhodes ' favourite family of Scotney : " Gentlemen seemed to be pretty funny , repeatedly making debts and spending money on things they could not afford .	-4.5647
Other generations of Darrell men triggered their debt crises by marrying wealthy old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well-looking boys , with a talent to promote inheritance . '	-4.7239
After finishing his job at the castle , Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences .	-3.6910
He spent two weeks in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämanmäki , the site of a sanatorium dating from the early 20th century , which has since been reclaimed by nature .	-5.1630
But Scotney has a special place for him .	-1.9603
" I was sad to go back , " he says .	-1.2413
It was like : ' Oh , now I have to deal with the dead life again ' .	-3.3138
Campaign : Hidden over 300 years old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf .	-2.7405
With the cover of the 301 year old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf , the city of Bad Honnef started its campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand on Friday .	-4.6814
Until Thursday , mayors Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team at Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and slogan secret .	-2.0953
At the end of August there will be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth .	-2.8514
" Too nice for us .	-2.0334
Or ? " , the makers of the action have been asking since yesterday on the posters at the Rhöndorfer Chapel .	-5.4322
" We don 't think this ( of course ! ) really , " they write on their yesterday released website .	-4.4210
" But we use this measure to gain your attention .	-1.0737
And to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .	-1.5377
Basically , we firmly believe that we , as a Bad Honnefer , know all about the beauty and attractiveness of our city . '	-4.8055
The action is more than " just " a logo and a slogan , it goes on .	-3.3227
" It is necessary to formulate a single promise , one that gives the city a distinctive distinctive distinctive distinctive distinctive characteristic " .	-10.2568
After all , they stand up to competition with other communities .	-2.3418
Bad Honnef will cost its new umbrella brand and campaign an average of five digits .	-4.6400
Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan ’ s Fear of the Army	-1.5370
Every year in early August in Ankara the Supreme Military Council ( YAS ) advises on retirement and promotions in the Official Corps .	-4.8198
So , too , this week .	-2.2229
At first glance a normal procedure .	-1.3571
But nothing is routine with Turkey ’ s armed forces one year after the coup .	-3.0710
The sitting was no longer held in the primary building , as in the past , but in the Prime Minister ’ s office . the were . the , the , , , , , , ,	-8.8937
The deliberations have now also been attended by the five Vice-Prime Ministers , as well as the Ministers for Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs .	-5.2329
Civilians in the YAS were the majority .	-4.2404
The military government is pulling the reins .	-2.9683
The Chief of Staff , Hulusi Akar , remains in office , but the army ’ s commanders , the airforce , and the navy were dis.	-5.3716
Since the failed coup , head of state Erdogan has steered 169 of the 326 generals and admirals .	-3.2308
More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army , mostly due to alleged connections to the movement of the exile preacher Fethullah Gülen , who sees Erdogan as a dragon driver of the coup attempt .	-5.5383
Since this week in Ankara , 486 people who have been directly involved in the coup attempt are being negotiated .	-4.6102
Even on the day after the coup , Erdogan had called the attempt to overturn the " gift of God " because he gave him the opportunity to " clean up the armed forces " completely .	-6.6328
But does Erdogan really have a grip on the army ?	-2.1881
At the end of February , the newspaper Hürriyet published an article entitled " Unease in the Military Headquarters " .	-2.5612
The newspaper wrote that there are concerns at the General Staff about an increasing " Islamisation " of the army , which manifests itself among other things in the lifting of the ban on the head of soldiers .	-5.5383
The large-scale operation of the army and the security forces continues .	-4.3177
In mid-July , Erdogan fired other 7395 civil servants , including 2303 police officers and 546 soldiers .	-4.3575
In so doing , it seemed that Erdogan had tamthe military .	-3.3370
The generals used to be the main masters of the country .	-1.9649
Three times , they invoked their role as guardians of the secular order .	-5.5233
After his victory in 2002 , Erdogan pushed back step by step the military ’ s power , not least with reference to the European Union ’ s reform requirements .	-4.7098
Former officers say that Erdogan is deliberately driving the Islamicisation of the armed forces .	-3.3104
In the magazine " Vocal Europe " , a notorious unnamed officer who sought asylum after the coup for fear of persecution abroad , the Turkish army would be " full of extremists and salafists " in a few years ' time .	-5.4663
If that happens , such a development could not leave NATO cold .	-2.7089
At any rate , after the purge , there are doubts within the alliance about the Turkish army 's readiness to operate .	-3.8358
Leadership structures and operational capabilities are " weakened " , say NATO diplomats .	-2.5819
Washington Change the Green Card Rules	-1.7880
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the Green Card rules , said President Donald Trump , quoted by the media .	-1.9475
It envisages reducing legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stricter rules on obtaining visas for temporary work permits and restrictions on family orientated visas .	-3.8176
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and endorsed by the President .	-1.5507
The bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .	-2.4620
'This law will reduce poverty , raise wages , and save billions of dollars for taxpayers , and will do so by changing the way in which citizens from other countries receive Green Cards . '	-4.2126
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .	-1.4771
This new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English , who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , " said Trump , quoted by the American media .	-3.9865
Ministry of Rennsteigshuttle Reforms	-4.9780
Over the past few months there have been frequent disputes over the future of the race cabinet - now it is planned to be done very quickly .	-7.2946
It is planned to be built before the end of the year at the Marod Track , which runs the tourist railway .	-5.9638
According to the Ministry of Transport , in order to safeguard the future of the race hut in the long term , construction work is to start on track this year .	-5.1041
" With the decision to continue to order and renovate the route Ilmenau-Stag , the country is committed to this mainly important link for tourism " , stated Secretary of State Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt .	-6.6160
The cost of the route repair was about EUR 2.5 million .	-3.8737
Of that sum , the country receives 75 % .	-2.9087
The contract , on the basis of which the shuttle is to be ordered from the country in the future , is now finally agreed , Sühl declared .	-10.3410
The Ministry and the Südthuringen Railway as a operator are already agreed on the technical details .	-4.2627
" Thus the road map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated , " said Sühl .	-3.3316
The planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be concluded for 11 years .	-9.3430
This should regular the race track on December 2017 .	-2.9863
The race track is a popular rail link between Ilmenau and Rennsteig stations , especially for tourists .	-5.6658
Over the past few months , during a pilot operation , it has been tested whether the route is being used by a sufficient number of people to be able to in again in the future . .	-14.6423
The track is also heavily payable in parts .	-3.0388
The rise of sex robots is real , and we should be worried .	-1.4506
Precisely when you thought that it could not become even more crazy in 2017 , there is a new report on technological developments in the sex robot sector .	-4.5857
Yes , indeed .	-0.8329
Sex robots are a big thing at the moment .	-1.6423
Recently , the Foundation for Responsible Robotics ( FRR ) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years .	-2.0856
According to Noel Sharkey , a professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR , we must start taking their rise seriously .	-3.2925
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the chest and the type of finger nail .	-3.2972
'People make fun of it , but companies deliver a lot of it , and we will see it much more often , ' said Mr Sharkey in publishing his new report .	-5.3914
Modern sex dolls have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence .	-4.2841
The user can also customize his robot according to his convictions , choosing everything from the eye color of the robot over the shape of the chest varnish to the type or color of his fingernails .	-4.7727
But it is even more worrying because many robots have the " personalities " that would make a Stepford-woman look progressive . .	-9.3467
Modern sex dolls have developed into a silicone skin robot .	-2.9512
For example , the RealBotix robot allows its users to customize their robots to the properties they find attractive , such as shyness .	-4.3829
And then there is the Roxxxy Gold Sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as " Frigid Farrah " , which gives the impression of intimidation and " Wild Wendy " with a " adventurous " personality .	-5.0475
" Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is as adapted to your personality as best as possible " , hitting the website of True Companion .	-8.0648
So she likes what you like , and she does not like what you do not like , etc .	-2.1365
She also has her moods during the day - just like real people !	-3.2691
She can be tired , fixed on conversation or she can be " in mood " !	-2.3554
There are many worrying aspects to this rise of sex robots - not least because they are replacing real human relationships - but the subservient female characteristics , the allusions to rape , when one moves to Frigid ( that is , resisting ) Farrah , one worries most .	-6.5616
On its website , True Companion Roxxxxy compared with a vibrator , but for men .	-4.8087
" If women ( sic ) can have a vibrator , why can men not have Roxxxy ? " says it on the website .	-3.8942
However , these sex robots are not just a fetish or just a different sex toys .	-3.3583
Their origin and increasing refinement point to a little darker and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with subjugation as an optional addition .	-4.1230
Most men will not , of course , hold sex robots , and while the FRR notes its rising popularity , they will remain temporarily on the brink of consumer culture .	-4.8416
But what leaks through the peripheral areas can be very instructive in relation to the spirit of the time we live in .	-4.3404
And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission .	-2.1372
There is a certain overlap that these advanced sex robots appear at a time when the rights of women are under threat worldwide , when there is a president in the White House who has boasted of having sexually assaulted women .	-4.6986
The most frightening aspect of the TV series ' The Handmaid 's Tale ' ( ' The Report of the Magd ' ) is not the graphic images , the faded body and the eyes , but how realistic this vision works .	-5.1155
The Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment this does not feel like a great leap .	-2.6150
The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical similarity to real women as realistic as technically possible ( though with porn proportions ) .	-3.7834
Their growers want them to feel human , to imitate the movement of a real body .	-2.2773
But , when it comes to their " personalities " , robots are not real women .	-2.2315
They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply leave them .	-11.2166
They have no mediation or background history , nothing that indicates independence or anything that could disrupt the imagination of total submission .	-3.5654
In other words , they are decent slaves .	-2.0430
Or , to put it another way of saying it in 2017 : Doomsday .	-3.9869
Trump ’ s Great Performance ?	-0.9280
He makes Mitt Romney the Introduction of Common Understanding	-3.2475
It has become a trump ’ s trump ’ s trump that the political divisions that have polarized the US electorate have also split families in small format .	-4.3804
Around Christmas and Harvest Day , US newspapers have had advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump ’ s relatives .	-5.1291
We all allegedly apply to burst our filter bubbles .	-3.0663
Less noted is Trump ’ s power to bring families together .	-2.1804
I mention this because my cousine , a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Republicans in our family , visited me in New York this week .	-3.0657
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .	-1.8716
With Trump in the White House , anyone who knows her , including the republican kinship she had fought for decades over politics , is suddenly and oddly on the same side .	-4.7025
This is certainly a good thing about the dining table , but it strikes me in another context that it also involves significant risks .	-5.1903
The left has been strengthened by Trump , but the distorting effect of his presidency has the strength to push us all to the right .	-3.3101
When we talk about ' normalization ' and Trump , we are referring to the gruesome possibility that one day his patrons will no longer throw us off .	-5.9864
But there is an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump “ normalizes ” right-wing Republicans , who suddenly seem to be the embodiment of prudence relative to his standards .	-4.6265
I find myself today affected by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney 's urcomic version of the madness - the cartoon roof that saw 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax statement looked like ) - both of which actually seem to be a very mild crime compared to Trump .	-7.3121
If Trump goes , the Republicans ’ next candidate must be only mentally healthy to qualify as immeasurable improvement .	-3.3870
When my cousine was in the city , we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park , the largest carousel of the New York Parks Department , and the best three dollars that you can spend in the city if you don 't need a coffee .	-5.3141
The horses are enormous , the Fiberglas designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are tricky and the animals turn away to look full of fear of their own shoulders - extremely fine and the climbing music conveys this in a strange way .	-6.1893
So many clichés of a city disappoint : the views of high buildings become old , the Skylines become familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city does not live up to the dream .	-4.0421
Thirty-five years later , and I am still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage - the Theme Pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a big circle in northern London .	-4.9561
The Central Park carousel , however , is still a strange magic experience , as there are two years here , one 11-year-old and two women in the 40s , and they all have a great time .	-6.8811
If I could have evaluated the carousel , I would have given him the full number of points , but fortunately nobody asked about it .	-4.0487
On the other hand , this week in a department store I was forced to evaluate my " experience " with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card .	-3.6464
In the coffee shop on the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to balance the evaluation with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the ladder .	-4.5321
This not only slows down what should actually be a neutral exchange , but also exerts pressure on the server to put personality in a situation where no need is needed .	-11.0615
The poor wife in the department house was excused to be grinding while I was tired of the experience of extending her credit card with five stars .	-5.6887
Oscar Pistorius moved to hospital with breast pain .	-3.0051
Pistorius left hospital for the second time .	-1.4939
Last year , he was brought to the hospital because of the treatment of cuts at his wrists , which he received from the prison authorities after a case in his cell .	-6.1983
Pistorius was sentenced to a first death sentence for murder following an appeal by the prosecutors .	-3.3736
He killed Steenkamp in the early morning of Valentine Day 2013 by shooting her several times through a door to the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria .	-4.7363
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a night invader hiding in the cabin .	-3.2406
The prosecutors have announced their intention to lodge an appeal this time against Pistorius 's six-year prison sentence , which they say is too lenient .	-4.3858
The national law enforcement authority said that it would appeal to the South African Supreme Court , and the appeal could be heard this year .	-3.9563
Pistorius is in danger of increasing his sentence to 15 years if the prosecutors .	-9.1753
There is no death penalty in South Africa .	-0.8842
When Bauer Arnold finds a odd egg .	-1.1649
As the last of the Blumberg schools , the four plaintiffs were made up of nurses and ephenoves in vacations and secondary schools .	-7.1202
In the future , three of the discharges will go to high school , four to the secondary school .	-5.4557
On Tuesday evening , schoolteacher Angelika Sitte welcomed parents and representatives of the public at the Bürgerhaus Biesental in Epfenhofen .	-3.1264
As a symbol of the school release , the 29 students of the four classes , led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder , chose a young eagle to grow up in the Hühnerhof but then be released into freedom .	-5.7341
To this end , the brave Schar produced a musical entitled " Der Adler im Höhnerhof " .	-5.8498
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg and let it break off of his chickens .	-3.0680
Instead of a chicken , a small eagle came out .	-3.5851
But the hope of making a chicken from him was broken up , the eagle spread his wings and disappeared on a high mountain .	-5.1420
After that , the three and four classes showed a chicken dance in the Yvonne Frank insertion .	-4.4845
The Hens danced with the young gockles , the cylinders bore to the bet .	-3.2246
The eagle stands for integration , said director Angelika Sitte .	-3.0762
The boy was different from the other boy ( chicken ) , but was one of them .	-4.6345
But he will never be like a chicken .	-1.3298
His provision is to be free .	-1.8480
She wanted every four plaintiff to feel accepted in his new school .	-2.5596
My thanks go to my fellow MEPs , former teacher Michael Müller , who always jumps into school passes and parents ’ representatives .	-6.0022
The pumping time was over now , explained Class teacher Sophia Schumacher .	-3.2370
She reluctantly leave her students after two years of teaching , because it was a really great time .	-4.3280
Finally , they were able to rely on the four plaintiffs .	-3.3490
Finally , all students had a song of summer time and vacation time .	-6.2673
Great joy broke out among children .	-2.3728
For the new school year , eight first class candidates are registered .	-3.4650
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece	-0.9767
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece , informed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted from television .	-3.4082
In the morning of August 1 , a group of illegally camping people was arrested in Sithonia , including the two Bulgarians .	-3.5518
They were released the same day , while an investigation is under way .	-3.3036
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported bTV that the Bulgarians were released later .	-2.0034
The Greek authorities have tightened control over free camps and have imposed significant penalties on anyone found in a place not intended for that purpose .	-4.7649
The controls continue throughout the season .	-2.2514
The ministry said that the court can impose a fine .	-2.0726
Software Update for Diesel Vehicles : What Needs to know Now	-3.1954
How exactly is the software update going ?	-2.3069
Do diesel drivers have to take part in the action ?	-2.3791
Overview the most important questions and answers .	-2.3702
At the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of approximately 5.3 million cars .	-2.5075
They are meant to improve the exhaust behaviour of cars in emission classes Euro 5 and in part Euro 6 .	-4.4786
Euro 4 diesel or worse are excluded .	-1.4440
Anja Smetanin of ACE Auto Club Europa gives opinions :	-2.5455
Is the new action mandatory ?	-1.1617
No , the negotiated software updates are voluntary .	-1.2216
" The mandatory updates previously apply only to the vehicles that have shot software , " says Anja Smetanin .	-3.7633
The KBA has ordered its retrofitting .	-3.6060
How and when will customers be informed about updates ?	-2.0228
Manufacturers have announced that it will be implemented quickly in the next few months , but have not yet given an exact date .	-4.4028
Daimler has advised that each party must be registered .	-3.8873
If an inspection is due in any case , it will be carried out within its framework .	-3.8198
How long should the overall conversion take ?	-3.8382
" Hard to say , " says Smetanin .	-2.5248
This depends on the commitment of the manufacturers and political pressure .	-2.6025
'Because we have seen that car manufacturers do not act voluntarily on the subject of the environment up to now . '	-8.2697
How long should the update last ?	-1.0913
The retrofit itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .	-3.4110
Time consuming could be getting an appointment .	-2.1590
What do drivers who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group do ?	-3.2697
The ACE advises you to wait .	-1.6554
Presumably , foreign manufacturers would follow , says Smetanin .	-3.4663
Is there a massive fall in the price of Euro 4 cars ?	-3.0317
The ACE fears this .	-1.1100
But it is precisely in the regions where driving bans are at risk .	-3.5435
In rural areas there has been no loss of value for older diesel .	-2.8970
ACE advises you to wait for sale .	-1.8747
LL Cool J is awarded Kennedy Center .	-2.7308
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington .	-1.0954
President Trump ’ s first prize promise to become political .	-2.0634
One laureate does not want to come from protest .	-2.6132
LL Cool J ( 49 ) is the first rapper to receive one of the most coveted awards from the renowned Kennedy Center .	-2.2456
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday , singer Gloria Estefan ( 59 ) , Lionel Richie ( 68 ) and choreographer Carmen de Lavallade ( 86 ) and TV producer Norman Lear ( 95 ) are the people .	-3.4190
The awards will be handed over early December .	-1.5549
Traditionally , US President Donald Trump will host a reception and participate in the awarding together with his wife Melania .	-3.4601
Lear , a prize-winner with progressive TV series , has already announced that he will not participate in the gala .	-6.1684
The New York Times said : ' This presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even to deprive them of the resources - and this is a burden on me ' .	-5.3151
The 59-year-old Estefan emphasized that she will use the conversation with Trump to clarify her point of view .	-2.7092
The Kennedy Center , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital .	-2.5542
Previously , he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature for his work .	-9.5302
We Make the City Life	-2.5986
Roland Wacker , Haslach ’ s urban builder , will retire next year .	-3.2725
The job is already posted - suitable candidates are scar, however .	-9.3411
Wacker has been a city builder for 31 years .	-2.5976
And the work still gives him great fun as he mediates in the press .	-4.1639
He reports varied but also demanding tasks that await his successor .	-3.3724
At the same time , he is surprised that no application has fulfilled the requirement profile .	-3.9527
The city is looking for an architect or building engineer at the earliest possible time .	-4.1517
In this way - taking into account the regular deadlines for termination - there will be enough time to edit .	-6.5378
Since Haslach serves as the Lower Construction Authority for the Administrative Community , the Applicant must provide relevant accounts .	-4.5597
Because this function definitely wants to keep the city .	-3.1271
If they can no longer fill them , citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice .	-4.8975
But proximity to the people is important to the city and to it itself , says Wacker , who reports about a good working climate and good sentiment between the authorities and citizens .	-5.8564
In more than 30 years in office , a number of important projects have accumulated , with pride looking back at wackers .	-4.4303
" We make the city worth living " , it is safe through the building office and its employees .	-5.1754
However , in the future there will be varied projects on the agenda : the transformation of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofen park will be kicked off .	-6.1624
The Kinzigbrücke between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renewed , the stadium animation is still subject .	-4.3150
The latter alone will cost around EUR 1.5 million , ' if we do it right ' , Wacker estimates .	-3.9700
" All in all , great tasks await my successor .	-1.8790
The work here is fun . '	-2.2976
The design would be available for an urban champion of wide leeway .	-6.1848
Haslach ’ s own farm and gardener can be very flexible in many ways .	-5.5726
" You can move a lot , " says Wacker , and the design of the green spaces is often commended by citizens and visitors .	-4.2013
Since the old town is listed as an ensemble , it is important to have " an eye for what fits in " when new buildings are approved , the outgoing mayor of the city emphasizes .	-5.3875
At any rate , the city mayor bears a great responsibility .	-4.4166
He is a builder , ' in the end everything is running over my table ' .	-3.2128
He can count on many years of support and coordination : Markus Neumaier ( high building ) has been in the process for ten years , Manfred Schöner ( lower-building for 15 years .	-12.9510
Wacker also wants his successor to stay long : " We are looking for someone who really wants to be identified and maintained with the job " .	-5.2964
For continuity is important not only for a good working environment , but also for the further design of the city .	-8.3193
If you want to teach Roland Wacker , you should be able to study as a graduate engineer or Bachelor with technical expertise in the fields of building and construction planning law .	-8.0617
The Municipal Office is responsible for high and lower-construction , construction planning , basic employment issues , urban property management , urban farm with a building and city garden as well as underground building rights authority , including monument protection .	-10.0979
Bicycles thrown on guided tours : South Train Train Tra.	-5.2249
According to the police , the so far unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bicycle on the lines of the railway transfer in the area of the Leobener Stra<unk>e ( B116 ) .	-4.6963
They were so badly damaged that the freight train had to be stopped .	-3.5232
Scientists go out of two male dancers and have been looking for them since the night hours .	-4.9672
Near the town there were witnesses of a rosary scooter and a bicycle driver .	-4.1560
" This goes far beyond a whisper tree , " said <unk>BB spokesman Christoph Posch about the APA .	-5.4151
The perpetrator would have placed himself in great danger and also endangered the traffic of trains .	-5.2141
Besides the damage to the locomotive and the facility , the delay minutes and the costs of rail replacement , rail users could also have their hands on the perpetrators .	-6.7549
Overall , the speaker said that it was ' significant ' .	-4.5430
The damage was remedied again on Friday afternoon , and rail traffic on the southern railway route could be carried out without disabilities .	-7.3763
Nearly ten passenger trains were issued on Friday morning , two of them were long-distance traffic .	-5.2077
Freight trains were not eliminated , but they were delayed .	-3.2678
According to the <unk>BB spokesman Christoph Posch , about 200 metres of superstructures had to be exchanged .	-4.4490
Isolators and masts were also damaged .	-1.6345
Red meat , dairy products , and chocolate could help relieve IBD ( inflammatory disease ) .	-2.8660
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system .	-1.4287
But a new study claims precisely the opposite : a diet rich in meat based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory diseases .	-2.8326
The unholy state , which affects around 1.3 million in the United States and 300,000 in the United Kingdom , causes stomach rings and blasts , recurring or bloody diarrhes , weight loss and extreme fatigue .	-6.2362
While people are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products in order to alleviate their symptoms , researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan from proteins contributes to the development of immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine .	-4.7577
Leading researcher Dr Marco Colonna explained that immune cells patrol the intestine to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in food do not penetrate the body .	-3.9409
Cells that are able to trigger inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue .	-3.9578
If the balance tends to be too far towards inflammation , an inflammatory disease may result .	-3.6087
Experiments found that there is a kind of tolerant immobilization cell in mice that has a specific bacterium in its implants .	-6.2260
And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .	-3.0349
Professor Colonna said : " We have established a connection between a bacterial type - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbiome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .	-4.0693
The more Tryptophan the mice had in their diet , the more they had of these immune cells " .	-2.8984
He proposed that the combination of L. Reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promote more tolerant , less inflammatory intestilius if the same system also affects humans .	-5.4191
The postdoctoral dissertation Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Baragan examined a kind of immunomancel that promotes tolerance when she found that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same stem , which had been kept separate , had not .	-7.8980
She suspected that the difference was with the mice intestinal microorganisms - the community of bacteria , viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract .	-4.9888
Dawn of the mice were DNA sequenced and six types of bacteria were found that were present in the mice with the immune cells but were missing in the mice .	-5.3300
mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they lacked a intestinal body and did not develop this type of immune cells , and they were created by L. Reuteri and the immune cells .	-6.3800
To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system , researchers L. Reuteri grew in a liquid and then transferred small quantities of liquid - without the bacteria - to immunature cells that were isolated from the mice .	-5.0041
Immune cells evolved into tolerant cells .	-2.1364
When the active component was cleaned from the fluid , it proved to be a byproduct of Tryptophan metabolism known as indol-3 milk acid .	-4.3546
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice ’ s feed , the number of such cells increased by about 50 % , but when the tryptophane levels were halved , the number of cells fell by half .	-3.6155
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerant cells as mice , and that most of us L. reveteri protect in our gastrointestinal tracts .	-3.4518
It is not known whether Tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in humans with inflammatory dysentery .	-4.2749
She said : " The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote , because these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine .	-3.4160
It is possible that high tryptophane levels in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population . '	-15.6999
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has committed a " genius " with Nemanja Matic .	-2.4520
At Manchester United signed a " genius " with Nemanja Matic , Jose Mourinho believes , after the midfielder had his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday .	-4.7925
The <unk> 40 million signature of Chelsea began with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre-season game , before the UEFA Super-Cup begins on Real Madrid on Tuesday , and impressed in the Halter role as people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira invaded .	-6.5666
However , Matic was excluded from the blues preparation Asian tour and managed only 45 minutes , which allowed Mourinho to improve before the premier league season started .	-5.6821
" He needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks soccer , " said Mourinho .	-1.8518
'We will help him to be ready sooner than later ' .	-1.6224
Besides Matic , Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started in Aviva stadium , when Mourinho designed his start XI for the start of the season .	-5.0657
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted another three new commitments , but he insisted that the club had already done a " fantastic job " to fulfill three of its four priority new commitments .	-3.4587
" To receive three of four , thank the club , " he added .	-2.7852
'I will be happier if they get four out of four for me , but they made a great effort . '	-4.1503
Boeing Makes Dreamliner in the Sky	-4.0432
Boeing has painted a Dreamliner 's silhouette into the sky .	-2.4033
The pilots fled from Seattle in the U.S. State of Washington , but the drawing began in Marquette in U.S. state Michigan and moved in the form of a Dreamliner over the USA , that is several thousand kilometres .	-4.8896
The action lasted 18 hours and one minute .	-1.0600
On the radar screens was the form of a Dreamliner .	-3.0056
The whole thing was a test for new engines .	-3.3326
Boeing had already made such advertising earlier .	-2.4872

New Slipping for Martin Schulz - Hannover , We have a Problem	-2.8035
As the wind turns , when Sigmar Gabriel was SPD chief , the Social Democratic Prime Minister always looked forward with some concern to Berlin before the elections .	-5.8654
Just no headwinds from the party 's central , but no headwinds from the federal government - the main desire of the electoral fighters was .	-8.0436
Since Martin Schulz led the party , that has changed fundamentally .	-2.2835
Since then , employees from the Willy Brandt House have been watching the events in the SPD rulers of the country with growing dismay .	-5.8276
What Schulz got from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in the approach .	-2.9277

After the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony , the Bundes-CDU views a general signal against coalitions of the SPD and the Greens .	-4.0193
" This shows once again : Rot-Grün simply cannot govern reliably , " said CDU Secretary General Peter Tauber to the editorial network Germany ( RND ) .	-3.8570
The surprise of a Green MEP 's departure has plunged Prime Minister Stephan Weil 's government into a serious crisis .	-3.6076
Five months before the country ’ s election , his red green coalition lost its one-time majority to the CDU and FDP opposition .	-2.6969
The Grünen Federal Managing Director Michael Kellner has called on the breakaway Grünen deputy from Lower Saxony , Elke Twesten , to return .	-6.2911
Transferring to the CDU clearly distorts the will of the electorate .	-3.2167
Elke Twelve must immediately return her mandate , " said the Federal Managing Director and campaign leader of the Greens to the editorial network Germany ( RND ) .	-9.9112
" All this must not be true , " a SPD campaigner is chasing when the new Hiobs message reaches the party headquarters on Friday morning .	-7.2136
Stephan Weil , the SPD prime minister of Lower Saxony , is in charge of the CDU without its own ruling majority , following the takeover of Green MEP Elke Twest .	-6.9089
It is the provisional culmination of a whole series of major and small crises in SPD countries ’ associations .	-3.8411
And no one knows what ’ s next .	-2.1455
The misery began with the unexpected defeat in the Saarland election in March .	-3.0069
A blue eye , not more , calmed the comrades at that time .	-3.1059
After the national elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia , things will be different .	-3.0139
That became the case - and the situation became much worse .	-4.5781
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into a bump , and the Düsseldorf bankruptcy simply threw the party around .	-6.1501
In the weeks after , the comrades rushed again .	-5.2193
Then , when they had just created new courage , the G-20 Summit in Hamburg came to light . the the . the the . the the . the the .	-8.7227
And with him came the next low .	-1.6211
Mayor Olaf Scholz , the last strong SPD leader , lost his nimbus at that weekend because he sat in the Elbphilharmonie while his city burned .	-3.7638
And because , in crisis communication , he then made pretty much everything that can be done wrong .	-5.1309
Since then , Scholz has struggled for his political survival .	-1.9418
Now also Stephan Weil .	-1.5214
The Dutch Prime Minister has been criticising for some time because of the VW emissions trading banks and his role on the Supervisory Board .	-4.6884
Mixed surveys were added .	-2.4693
Nevertheless , or perhaps precisely for that reason , because in recent weeks , attempts to put emphasis in the covenant .	-6.6277
The ambition of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin remained unchallenged with comrades around Martin Schulz .	-5.1843
They allowed him to grant him because they promised to stabilise the party by means of a Because .	-6.1820
The exact opposite may now happen .	-2.3905
Because of the bipartisan twist , the Niedersachsen Greens are basically not to blame .	-4.7340
And Schulz certainly not .	-2.1618
For the time being , therefore , the comrades are trying to keep their own ranks closed .	-3.1914
Their anger is aimed at the Greens , and above all at the breakaway parliamentarian Twen .	-5.5925
" It is intolerable and anti-democratic as Mrs Twestern puts her own careers above everyone 's interests " , says Matthias Miersch , the leader of the party left in the Socialist Group , the editorial network Germany ( RND ) .	-5.4946
Mrs Twolf has been elected to Parliament not because of her person as a direct candidate , but on the list of the Lower Saxony Green countries , according to the Lower Saxony Member .	-6.0793
The logical consequence would be that it returned its mandate .	-2.0316
Thomas Oppermann , head of the SPD Bundestag Group , deplores an " undemocratic manoeuvre " .	-3.2948
" The voter 's desire four years ago was clear : people made Stephan Weil the prime minister , " Oppermann says , who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as the top candidate for the Bundestag elections , the RND .	-5.7888
" Now the personal career prospects of a future CDU MP distort the result of the election , " Oppermann continued to say .	-4.6019
He called for the background to be clarified .	-1.9782

Funding for City Centre III	-3.1803
Those who want to restore their house in the years can soon receive support from the country .	-4.9537
More information about the Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives STEG Stadtwork on Wednesday .	-5.3113
At the beginning of the information event , Schindler once again gave a look at what has happened .	-4.0221
Sanctuary facilities have been in existence since 1991 .	-2.9152
At the time , in the Field of Recovery from 1991 to 2004 , Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the grant .	-5.2264
In the 2005 to 2016 rehabilitation area , the grant was still 60 % .	-4.1535
For handicapped people , the existing renovations are a " success project " - it is important to promote internal development and not just to develop new areas .	-12.2454
On 4 April , the Presidium of the government , Karlsruhe , informed us that there will be a Reformation Area III .	-4.8579
The total funding was EUR 833 333 , of which EUR 500 000 would come from the country and the rest of the community of Senegingen .	-5.2628
What is the origin of a sanctuary ?	-3.6973
Schindler argues that people will continue to study where the ' really old ' houses are .	-5.4186
There is also a role to play , however , as to whether there is any interest in the planned area .	-4.4495
If necessary , territorial borders could then shift again .	-3.2540
STEG was represented on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel .	-2.8966
Keller presented the contents of the Federal District Programme " Social City " , within which the renovations would then be carried out .	-4.1110
At the heart of the programme are the revitalisation of inner cities , the improvement of living and working conditions and the maintenance and development of infrastructure .	-4.9854
These measures would be carried out on an object basis , i.e. per plot .	-4.7536
The remediation area would then be laid down as a Articles of Association .	-4.3826
The eligibility period for funding has been in operation until 30 April 2026 since 1 January 2017 .	-2.8067
However , until September of this year , the stocktaking would take place once again , in which those involved in the recovery area would receive a questionnaire to fill in .	-7.1253
In November or December , if possible , the Statute should be adopted so that the remediation can start next year .	-6.1535
Pietzschmann then declared that each municipality had to carry out the said preliminary investigations .	-4.3578
It is a matter of assessing urban grievances and deciding when to regenerate and to what extent .	-4.2786
A remediation note will be included in the property ’ s description for the property in .	-5.4994
Pietzschmann will come again to Sensingen and make an image of the situation , she promised .	-4.2388
Gotzel stressed that a key success factor for the project was the participation of the participants .	-3.4288
Therefore , there will be questionnaires which will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be completed by the end of the summer holidays .	-4.2817
The yellow questionnaire is the " building and ground sheet " , which deals , among other things , with the construction state and the recovery plans .	-4.9742
In the grey questionnaire , the " Household and Housing Arch " , you can find details of the size , distribution and residents of a living room .	-6.1381
The blue " operating sheet " must be filled only if business premises are operating in the building .	-4.9098
However , it should be noted that Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same a request for funding . . the , , , , , , , , , , , , and , , ,	-8.0289
Moreover , new construction measures are not eligible for funding .	-7.0562
Schindler also stressed that the distribution of funds operates according to the " greyhound principle " - who comes first , flies first .	-5.3611
No subsidies can be reserved for later .	-4.7615
Finally pictures of the project " Centre of the City II " were shown in order to make the attendees " graceful " .	-6.3401
British inventors set themselves a microchip to come home and car with a handmovement .	-4.1398
A British inventor is the first in the country equipped with a microchip to open up his door , enter his office , and even start his car with a handmoving .	-8.6214
Steven Northam , 33 , had implanted the tiny chip between thumb and newbie and now offers the service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through its company BioTeq .	-4.9681
He joined Dr. Geoff Watson , a consultant Anaesthetist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester , Hants , to ensure that the implant procedure is conducted in accordance with medical standards .	-4.3670
The technology resembles a cat and dog implanted microchip and lasts only 30 seconds .	-2.4237
The company of Mr. Northam would also like to change the locks on houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip , all for a surcharge of <unk> 300 per castle .	-5.0741
The married father of one has now built in both his home and his BMW Z4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel .	-4.0534
The White House ’ s Advertising Costs to Taxpayers ThThous. :	-6.5909
The White House ’ s decision to fly a naval helicopter to South Lawn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month costs taxpayers up to $ 24,000 , according to the military ’ s figures left to the TIME magazine .	-4.7237
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on 17 July in the White House with American construction programs .	-14.3674
President Donald Trump , Vice President Mike Pence , and White House officials have made a tour of products from all 50 countries .	-2.7362
Connecticut helicopters were exhibited in addition to a Maine yacht , a Wisconsin fire-fighting car and a Mississippi forklift truck .	-4.6423
The White House ’ s military office required the presence of the helicopter in a fragmented order or FRAGO , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on South Lawn , following the signs of Marine Helicopter Squadron One ( HMX-1 ) , the unit responsible for operating the helicopter .	-11.3024
" I just wanted you to be aware of this , because it is such an unusual event with a high visibility " , the HMX-1 commander wrote on the eve of the event his executive , the Deputy Marine Command for Aeronautics .	-5.2835
The news showed that the helicopter arrived at 3 o 'clock on July 17 at the South Lawn on July 17 , and so long before the grass was cleared on this evening between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 .	-5.8228
The note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed , a second team would be required for the return flight , owing to the limitations of the service hours .	-5.6760
The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event , while the security personnel on the ground remained on the aircraft during the time .	-4.8188
It was not clear from the records provided by TIME whether a second flight crew was eventually required .	-3.9002
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes .	-2.2856
Data records indicate that HMX-1 asked whether the event could violate the provision .	-3.2075
" One question we asked was whether it was a violation of the hatch act and we were informed that this was not the case , " wrote the commander .	-3.4386
" Sounds as if you are closed , " the Vice-Command replied .	-3.6916
The event " Made in America " was called the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act .	-2.9593
But official events also have political overtones .	-1.4935
At the event , the President gave impetus to the reform of the Senate ’ s health reform , and he promoted efforts to curb government regulations .	-5.6601
The use of the aircraft known as the Marine One or Air Force One for politically beneficial purposes is hardly a new phenomenon .	-2.2825
Presidents are obliged to use them for travel .	-2.2660
But requesting their use only for a photo OP is unusual .	-2.9169
Trump carried out an investigation in February , when the presidential aircraft carried out taxi services against the background of his first campaign rally in Melbourne , Florida , and his Twitter account is full of news complaining about the use of the presidential aircraft by his predecessor .	-5.2133
" The White House is enthusiastic about the " Made in America " show , which shows products from all 50 countries produced by American workers with American materials , " said the Deputy Secretary of the White House , Lindsay Walter .	-4.9588
HMX-1 crews often take training flights in the Washington and South Lawn area to replace the US president at the White House with accurate census rates .	-5.1735
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July , HMX-1 in the White House held 58 training land .	-8.1177
Flight for the " Made in America " event was the training requirement of the flight crew for the month , said a civil servant .	-3.5565
Helicopter units additionally flew 11 hours a day for " non-presidential support missions " .	-2.8300
The White House said that taxpayers took the burden on none of the other props presented at the event .	-3.1265
One of Sikorsky 's spokesmen said that the company was not involved in helicopter deployment on South Lawn .	-3.9400
HMX-1 has no budget records for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .	-3.1289
According to the US Department of Defense hourly rates for the 2017 financial year , however , the DoD refund for the VH-3D amounts to USD 24,380 per hour .	-4.1962
The aircraft ’ s record is 30 minutes from the Navy Corps Air Facility ’ s home base in Quantico in Virginia .	-4.2123
The White House argues that the actual costs of operating the helicopter are well below this rate .	-1.8024
'Setting taxpayers ' costs on the basis of estimates for reimbursement rates is highly misleading , ' said Walters .	-4.0514
'These estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds ' .	-2.8504
According to a 2015 RAND study , the reimbursement rates for DoD do not include personnel costs , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance , and contract conclusion .	-3.9019
At that time , the former White House press spokesperson , Sean Spicer , defended the deployment of the helicopter for the event .	-3.0108
" The idea is to present things made in America this week , " said Spicer .	-1.7664
" And I know that Sikorsky and the federal state of Connecticut are very proud that they are contributing to our national security and I assume that hundreds , if not thousands , of people depend on it .	-10.2189
And I think , like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicopters and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly .	-2.2767
It is , of course , appropriate to emphasise this . '	-2.1272
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter when he took his tour of South Lawn for the event , but he was in the driver ’ s seat of a fire-fighter car .	-5.2221
In the White House , Trump spoke to Sikorsky ’ s representatives and talked to the media about his own fleet of corporate products .	-3.2093
'I know Sikorsky very well ' , the President said , ' I have three of them ' .	-1.9258

How America can harm OMV	-2.4991
Indeed , Donald Trump was unhappy when he signed Wednesday evening under the law to tighten sanctions against Russia .	-3.8869
" In his haste to enact the law " , the Congress wrapped a few " unconstitutional regulations " , he planted .	-4.8149
The response from Moscow was also as sharp as expected , and even Brussels was foaming against the US initiative .	-4.4009
The proposal , however , envisages punishing European companies that help Russians build gas pipelines into the EU .	-3.6439
Consequently , investors of the domestic OMV have been worried since then , which together with other European companies co-financed the construction of the Russian East Zealeitung Nord Stream 2 .	-6.0953
The threat scenario is huge .	-1.2891
However , it is too early to assess the consequences , according to the official statement of the oil company .	-3.8607
In fact , Donald Trump himself would have to bring the sanctions to life by an executive order .	-3.1847
Twelve weapons are at his disposal .	-2.4972

The city runs in Krefelder Area 46 Kindertasstätten , in 44 children receive a warm meal at lunch time .	-5.3287
In the last Kita year , 2800 children each sat on the tables , and the needs grow steadily .	-4.6585
" Meanwhile , not only eat children who are cared for 45 hours a week in the kita at noon , " explains Pomeranz .	-4.8228
'The offer is also valid in the 35-hour support system if children stay until 2 p.m. '	-4.9135
As of September 1 , 46 part-time staff have kitchen service : they heat up the meals provided , complement the salad , raw food and fruit , add the meals individually , leave the food , disable , wash and clean the kitchen .	-9.8549
'Employees are assigned firmly to a kita ' , says Pomerania .	-3.9218
The size - there are two groups as well as seven group facilities - decides the hourly range .	-3.9142
" The kitchen heroes are now firmly part of the Kita team , " says Pomeranz satisfied .	-3.6622

This continuity is important for children .	-1.0990
The cleaning of the kita rooms - so far also the responsibility of the kitchen staff - will be done by special cleaning staff .	-4.9838
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen services - in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen service , also has the charm that it has shown to be the most economical for the city in the cost comparison between its own regime and its foreign expenditure , says it from the press office .	-8.8991
This is even though 46 part-time employees are being reset .	-4.2492
" But these hours do not count so much for about 750 people in the educational area , " says Sonja Pomeranz .	-4.6175

A trade union wants to be sure of the long-term commitment to production at its Glasgow plant by biscuit manufacturer McVitie .	-4.7416
GMB Scotland said that the company was silent about the future of investments at the Tollcross booth .	-3.4957
More than 500 employees work in the plant , which produces hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits along with other products .	-4.2492
McVities owner , Cardis , said he has invested more than GBP 5 million in recent years .	-4.1561

In a letter to the company 's branch office , GMB Scotland McVitie asked for ' to express concern that funding for the modernisation of production lines is not being pushed forward ' .	-5.1061
GMB ’ s senior executive , Drew Duffy , said : “ The fact that we cannot get clarity from the General Affairs Manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross is deeply affecting our members .	-5.2920
Generals of families have worked here , and workers are concentrating strongly on the local community and the Glasgow region , an important pillar of decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage .	-4.9162
Therefore , from the point of view of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the background of Brexit , the rising cost of living and the chronic decline in production , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a flourishing production presence at McVitie ' .	-5.2913
One of the spokesmen of Cardis said : " The Tollcross branch office only received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday , and the company will respond directly to this , as we value the constant commitment of employees and trade union representatives .	-7.7961
Two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross , where some issues were discussed openly .	-2.6917
We discussed with the staff that , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and insecure economic climate , we are constantly reviewing our business - and this applies to all our business areas and sites - to remain competitive .	-5.5370
She added : " Over the past few years , we have invested more than GBP 5 million in our Tollcross booth , especially in production lines and operational improvements .	-4.7529
We fully recognise the legacy of Tollcross as a production site , and if our operations at the site change , the workers and their trade union representatives will be the first to know . '	-5.4886
Did the PSG Barcelona warned Neymar three years ago ?	-1.5807
The page of La League may regret its interest in Marco Verratti .	-2.7853
Paris Saint-Germain will not relax her persecution at Neymar after making an offer of <unk> 189 million to trigger his exemption clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago of the world record fall ?	-4.7716
The sensational approach has fueled the summer transfer window , because the League 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than twice the previous brand , with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United last season for <unk> 89 million .	-4.1373
Upon completion , Neymar will become the world ’ s most expensive player and the world ’ s highest-paid professional athlete .	-4.3844
Barcelona is angry about the way Neymar forced his way out , although a source near the Catalan board insists that the club has always done its best to take care of it since its arrival in Santos in 2013 .	-4.2298
But was the football world warned three years ago by the PSG president about this prospect ?	-2.5861
When Manchester City announced interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014 , Nasser Al-Khalifi had a strong warning for each club that would sign one of the best players of PSG .	-4.0002
" I am not worried because they know that if they affect one of our players , then we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact their players , " said Al Khalifi .	-3.4967
" We respect all clubs .	-0.7919
But if they try to sign one of our players , they will have consequences . '	-3.4817
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish Association expressing interest in the PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer .	-3.7911
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the International of Italy to leave under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its prices for Neymar .	-4.2919

It would greatly serve the image of the Catholic Church if Müller and the councillor expressed their deepest regret at their own omissions or their false assessment of what happened at the time .	-5.5944
On the other hand , the Vatican Confederation , " Osservatore Romano " , criticized the " double standards " of reporting violence in the Cathedral .	-5.2758
As far as the attacks in Regensburg are concerned , no one doubts that they are ' shameful and shameful acts ' which should be punished and prevented in the future ; but what is striking is the ' degree of media manipulation ' , such as the author Lucetta Scaraffia , historian and member of the Italian National Bioethics Committee .	-5.9945
" The habit of describing the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion for that to be normal , " writes Scaraffia .	-4.2553
Fürstin Gloria von Thurn und Taxis also meant in the interview with the Bavarian Radio : " You love to go to the church and this is a found lunch " .	-5.7628
She also pointed out that in her youth ' beatings had been a normal pedagogical instrument ' to be ready with frenzy children , as I was . '	-6.5227
They would find it unfair to apply today ’ s standards to previous decades , because the world has changed .	-2.6476
When it comes to the reports of abuses , the Pope 's brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared .	-11.3646
Quite wrongly , author and historian Michael Hesemann , who wrote the memorial book " My brother of the Pope " with councinger , in 12 languages .	-5.1546
" I have to protect Georg Ratzinger , " says Hesemann , " because all this had nothing to do with him " , he evaluates the results of the final report .	-3.3064
What exactly is in the 440-page report presented by the lawyer Ulrich Weber , who was appointed by Bishop Regensburg with the Enlightenment ?	-4.3637
In total , 547 Regensburger Domspats were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s with high plausibility .	-4.6196
The final report refers to Georg Ratzinger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : " In summary , it can be said that in many cases , Domkapellmeister R. used forms of physical and mental violence .	-5.0753
Especially with high emotionality , the punishment could also be more severe for pupils .	-5.2391
However , unlike many other accused , many victims appreciate the general humanity of R. and , in many cases , even combine positive memories with him despite violence ' .	-5.6986
In the interview , Hesemann explains why he believes that the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Cathedral treasure Georg Ratzinger has been relieved .	-6.2985
Mr Hesemann , the 440-page report on the " incidents of the use of force against protection beams in the Dutchschutz " gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger .	-6.3653
On the one hand , many students highlight its " humanity " .	-2.6132
On the other hand , it also appears as a cholera and perfectionist , who has often become practical , if a cathedral did not musically achieve top performance .	-6.4657
How do you view this final report as your biograph ?	-2.0352
Michael Hesemann : If you take the trouble and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the rear , you might wonder why the name Georg Ratzinger comes in .	-4.3256
He is just eight pages dedicated to him and is clearly free of any suspicion of complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .	-5.6356
The processes of violence at the upstream school also took place outside its scope .	-4.3539
It can be accused , at best , of being too late or of having not taken seriously enough initial suggestions .	-5.7247
The domain spazing ymnasium on which it acted was felt by virtually all the respondents as - literally - " redemption " , " sky " and " better world " .	-5.9614
The vast majority of his students , Georg Ratzinger , also exhibits an excellent testimony , describes him as " warm-hearted " , " popular " , " sincere " , " competent " and " understandable " , as extremely good teachers , who regularly adored the guys with cakes , biscuits and bons and " always surrounded by children 's grapes " .	-6.5089
Only a minority complains about its perfectionism and high emotionality , which has led to outbreaks .	-10.0817
He admitted , deeply regretted , and apologized , that he was not only grabbing with stools and throwing the keyring to the ground , but also spread ear-cowardly and too frightened boys to the hair or ears .	-10.5549
It must be said , however , that in the period in question , the 1960 ’ s and 1970 ’ s , such educational methods were widely used among parents and teachers .	-5.6539
Do you also know such breeding methods ?	-2.1949
Of course , I think each of us who was born before 1968 .	-2.0391
I , too , have seen this in a secular school , a state gymnasium .	-4.2757
Compared with what this report is actually about , namely appalling sexual abuse and pre-school violence , this is , of course , a trivial matter .	-5.2028
One wonders if it is not more to do with his notoriety and role as brother of Benedict XVI that many media were toppling him .	-6.7116
Many who have never understood the Bavarian Pope are still working diligently .	-3.7581
But the truth is : the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect !	-2.9496
A great deal has been said in the media in connection with the report about abuses in the Dutchschwitz area .	-5.4203
Will Georg Ratzinger be accused of any involvement or cowardice in the final report as regards sexual abuse ?	-3.6536
Michael Hesemann : It is clearly no .	-3.0118
Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted to the master of the Cathedral .	-3.2067
Not even parents were envy .	-1.8459
" I never dared to talk to my father or mother about it , " said a person who is responsible for the others , " It was all very embarrassing to me " .	-6.3974
The real problem in educating sexual abuse was and is that most victims are silent of shame .	-3.8186
If they did not entrust themselves to parents and siblings , they certainly would not have been a chorus leader who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators in a way that would have been professional .	-6.5194
How does the Domspato-Schüder Ratzinger ’ s role in cases of abuse assess ?	-5.7020
Michael Hesemann : As a student put it , " I see ... no case in which he ( Georg Ratzinger ) would have had timely knowledge and could have stopped the perpetrator .	-6.3150
I also think it is really absurd to believe that it is precisely these that have opened up to him ... more forcefully or more clearly , than to their parents , internal leaders , confidence teachers , etc .	-8.0118
That you talk to him about sex ... - unthinkable ' .	-3.3388
The report thus comes to the very clear conclusion : ' It was not possible to confirm within the framework of the study that pupils and / or their surroundings were entrusted to him in advance ' .	-6.1372
As far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg Ratzinger is thus entitled to be free from any .	-4.0265
Nor can he be accused of not having prevented or prosecuted him .	-4.0887
There is therefore no reason to link his good name to these brutal crimes , as unfortunately happened in some cases .	-3.8165
In the media there was much to be read about " violent processes " at the Dutchschutzen , Germany .	-6.5066
The former master of the dome , Georg Ratzinger , is accused of in the report " Weihnachten " .	-4.5574
Does he have to live with this charge ?	-7.5166
Michael Hesemann : This is the big problem , that everything in the reporting was mixed up and mixed up into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violent processes and somewhere , right in the middle of everything , Georg Ratzinger .	-5.3123
Yet that , in turn , is an abuse of the report .	-2.3174
There is , after all , a clean divide : between the pre-school and the gymnasium of the dome , between sexual abuse and violent processes , and , let us say , other accusations .	-6.7853
The report also deals with incidents dating from 1945 , including four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choir leader of the Cathedral .	-5.3105
All the appalling caning pedagogy , the cases in which cracks from Sadist teachers were regularly harassed and painted and were horribly suffering , occurred at the Vorschule in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen , where truly scandalous conditions have been prevented .	-8.4975
He had nothing to do with those champions of Dom Kapellmeister Georg Ratzinger , because he got the boys to face only when they were already at the Domspazingymnasium .	-7.7114
At that , as most witnesses emphasize , was the subject of " pre-school " taboo .	-2.9870
You were only happy to escape and enjoyed so much better treatment and for many even " paradise " states .	-4.2804
What was different on the Domtrengymnasium ?	-3.0180
Michael Hesemann : Although there was already discipline , there was no sadistic violence . . , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-7.0714
This also applies to Georg Ratzinger , in which the report concludes that ' many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and , in many cases , even combine positive memories with him despite violence ' .	-5.1089
At most , the accusation remains of having looked away .	-3.7924
In spite of all the efforts made , the report could only define two periods of time in which it was reported by pre-school conditions . , , the , , , the , , , and the , , the . , , , , ,	-11.8919
The first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish himself and wanted to hear nothing about what happened at a school where he did not work and was responsible ( so the witness ) , and then again in 1993 .	-7.3976
Did Georg Ratzinger keep his ears in front of the states ?	-2.4989
Michael Hesemann : No , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatogynymnasium , which the report even reproduces .	-3.5655
He pointed out to him ' that beatings will continue in the pre-school period ' .	-6.1975
Even with the risk of negative press releases , he recommended urgent intervention .	-2.8284
This was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed when caning was long banned in Bavaria .	-4.3866
Before that , they took place in a legal grey area , as everyone else knows .	-3.1998
For him , too , it was difficult to assess where people could perhaps have been exaggerated or dramatic and where the permitted limit had really been exceeded .	-5.8125
Nor can it be said that he has always looked away .	-3.8737
That is simply not true .	-1.1655
It was in 1980 that the caning sentence at schools in Bavaria was officially abolished .	-3.3488
Festin Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today 's pedagogical standards to that time .	-3.5440
How do you see that ?	-1.7065
Michael Hesemann : We historians talk about the " trap of anachronism " , that is , the danger of evaluating past moral standards today .	-4.5380
The Prince is right there .	-1.8169
But this does not , of course , apply to sexual abuse , which was disgusting at all times , nor to what was said in the pre-school of resistance and violence on innocent children ’ s souls , which goes far beyond what was then common .	-14.1462
That is all very terrible and I am glad that it is finally put up .	-4.0081
But at the same time I have to protect Georg Ratzinger , because all this had nothing to do with him .	-2.9403
His means of disciplining and punishing , that is to say , wrestling and learning the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .	-7.0523
Then , as a physical punishment was banned , he also strictly adhered to it .	-4.7849
How did Georg Ratzinger portray his time in the discussions with you for the book " My brother of the Pope " ?	-4.0421
Can the subject of caning also be discussed ?	-2.8826
Michael Hesemann : Well , the book is about the life of his brother Joseph , Pope Benedict XVI , tells from his perspective , since the patrons played only a minor role .	-3.8380
Nevertheless , I do not hide the fact that he led a strict regime there .	-4.3309
But this , too , must be said : without this perfectionism , without calling for unconditional discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world rank in the now more nationally known Regensburg Cathedral , true cultural ambassador of Europe and its musical tradition , which went on tour in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .	-7.8843
With biscuits and bonbonuses you won ’ t make any big singers or any success out of discouraging cracks , regardless of the area , but always discipline , passion , and self-reliance .	-9.3404
What kind of people did you see Georg Ratzinger in talking about her book ?	-4.1861
Michael Hesemann : Through the work on the book and beyond , I really got to know Georg Ratzinger very well and have experienced him again and again as a wonderful , humorous , heartfelt , heartfelt and unbelievable person , who could not imagine doing anything for a fly .	-9.2401
I regularly get into contact with him , visit him , read to him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family , 23 years after he was .	-5.1473
So those who still do not forgive him that he was strict among them are clearly in the minority .	-5.1064
Most of his books are now grateful to him for enriching their lives and bringing the world of music to them .	-4.9037
And that he was always a good paternal teacher - a strict father , of course , that may be - but also a lovable devotee to whom they still stand up today and which they worship .	-8.0992
And I would like to make it quite clear once again that all the accusations are methods of education that were on the agenda at that time .	-6.3043
We can be glad that we have overcome this time long ago .	-2.5545
But it is highly unfair to make a man just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to become a media scapegoat .	-3.8496
The evil intention behind it is all too obvious .	-2.9466
The report that has just been published relieves it .	-2.6330
Now , the decency , a 93-year-old man , who has earned a great deal of merit , would finally be in peace without the people outside Bavaria and perhaps Germany .	-7.6240
