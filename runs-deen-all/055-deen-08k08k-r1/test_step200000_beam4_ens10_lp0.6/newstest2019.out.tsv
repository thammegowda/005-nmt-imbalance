Welsh agents worry " to look like dodges "	-8.7912
There is dismay among some Members of the Assembly about a proposal to change its title to MWPs ( Member of the Welsh Parliament ) .	-3.7848
The reason for this was plans to change the name of the National Assembly in the Welsh Parliament .	-2.2160
Members of all parties to the National Assembly have concerns that they may be spoiled by this .	-4.6671
A Labour MEP said that his group " dreams about Twp and Pwp " .	-10.6466
Note for the reader : " twp " in Welsh means " controlled " and " pwp " means " cake " .	-3.7995
A member of the Assembly of Plaid Cymru said that the group as a whole was ' not happy ' and proposed alternatives .	-3.4069
A Welsh Conservative said that his group was “ open ” to change the name , but pointed out that “ MWP ” ( member of the Welsh Parliament ) is only a short verbal leap to “ Muppet . ”	-3.9560
Note : The Welsh letter W is pronounced similar to the U in English .	-2.3226
The National Assembly Commission , which is currently working on a bill for name changes , said : ‘ The final decision on the name of members of the National Assembly is , of course , up to the members themselves . ’	-5.3469
With the Government of Wales Act 2017 , the Welsh parliament was given the opportunity to change its name .	-2.3464
In June last year , the Commission published the results of a public hearing on the proposals , which broadly endorsed the change in the name in the Welsh Parliament .	-10.5346
On the question of the title of Members of the Assembly , the Commission preferred Welsh Members of Parliament or WMPs , but the VAT option received most support in a public survey .	-4.6444
Members of the Welsh Parliament seem to propose alternative options , but the fight to reach a consensus could cause headaches to Chairman Elin JONES , who is expected to submit a bill for these changes in the coming weeks .	-5.3341
The legislation on reforms will include changes in the functioning of the Assembly , including the rules on disqualification of members of the Welsh Parliament and the design of the exclusion system .	-5.2406

On Sunday , the electorate will vote on the amendment of the country ’ s name to the Republic of North Macedonia .	-3.9545
The referendum will be held to settle a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece , where a province is named Macedonia .	-8.8316
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour is a right to its territory and has repeatedly objected to his application for admission to the EU and NATO .	-3.9188
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov , an opponent of the referendum on change of name , said he would ignore the vote .	-2.3553
However , the proponents of the referendum , including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev , argue that the change of name is quite simply the price to pay for accession to the EU and NATO .	-3.5902
St Martin ’ s Silent Glocks , as Churches in Harlem have Problems	-9.4963
" Historically , the old people with whom I spoke said that there was a bar and a church at every corner , " said Mr Adams .	-3.4593
" Today there is neither . "	-3.0391
He said that the disappearance of pubs is understandable .	-1.4545
" People link together in a different way , " he said today .	-4.4162
'Kneipen are no longer living rooms in the neighbourhood where you meet regularly ' .	-3.4861
As for churches , he fears that money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders expect .	-3.5046
Churches could be replaced by multi-family houses with condominiums filled with the kind of people who will not help the remaining sanctuaries of the district .	-4.8919
The overwhelming majority of people who buy housing in these buildings will know , he said , ' and will therefore accelerate the day when these churches are closed completely , because it is unlikely that most of those who move into these condominiums will become members of these churches ' .	-5.5524
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became the black metropolis in 1870 – Metropolitan Community , St. Martin 's a decade later .	-2.2866
The original white methodological community withdrew in the 1930s .	-2.8751
A black community that practised a religion nearby bought the building .	-3.6694
St. Martin 's was taken over by a black community under the parish of John Howard Johnson , who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street , a main street for shopping in Harlem , which opposed the hiring or promotion of black people .	-13.9914
A fire in 1939 left the building severely damaged , but when the members of the community of Father Johnson made plans for reconstruction they commissioned the bell game .	-10.5434
Father David Johnson , son of Father Johnson and successor to St. Martin 's , proudly called the bell game " the bells of the poor . "	-3.1117
The expert who played the bell game in July called it another thing : " A cultural treasure " and " an irreplaceable historical instrument " .	-2.9342
The expert , Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan , also noted that it was the first bell game in the world played by a black musician , Dionisio A. Lind , who 18 years ago moved to the larger bell game at the Riverside Church .	-4.3985
Mr Merriweather said that St. Martin 's did not replace him .	-1.8668
What has happened in the last few months at St. Martin was a complicated history of architects and builders , some were brought by church laymen and others by the bishop 's diocese .	-5.4850
The sacristy – the parish body composed of laymen leaders – wrote to the diocese in July with the concern that the diocese would " try to pass the costs on to the sacristy " , although the sacristy was not involved in the appointment of the architects and contractors of the diocese .	-5.9373
Some members of the community complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese .	-2.7743

The attack took place shortly before seven in the morning near the beach of Beacon in Encinitas .	-2.8797
Chad Hammel said KSWB-TV in San Diego that he dived with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help , and then paddled with the others to save him from the water .	-5.0042
“ First I thought someone was happy because he caught a lobster , ” Hammel said , but then I noticed that someone cried : “ I was bitten ! ”	-4.9053
I was bitten !	-7.9166
Hammel said that he noticed this when he came to the boy .	-4.5612
I cried to everyone to get out of the water : " There is a shark in the water ! " Hammel said .	-4.1871
The boy was brought to the Rady Children 's Hospital in San Diego , where his condition was documented as critical .	-2.4817
The shark responsible for the attack is unknown .	-1.8669
The rescue swimmer Captain Larry Giles said at a media meeting that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks ago , but it was found that it was not a dangerous shark .	-5.4344
Giles added traumatic injuries in the upper body of his victim .	-1.5528
Officials closed the access to the beach of Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami 's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for security reasons .	-2.2222

Sainsbury plans to conquer the UK Beauty Market	-2.1609
Sainsbury 's takes over Boots , Superdrug and Debenhams with shelves with beauty products in the style of the department , which are filled with specialist assistants .	-6.0979
As part of an extensive push to the UK beauty market , which continues to grow and is worth $ 2.8bn , fashion and homeware sales will fall back , with the larger 11 branches that tested the country and brought it to more stores next year to show success .	-7.4522
The idea of investing in the beauty market has arisen from the fact that supermarkets are looking for ways to use the shelving used in the past for television , microwaves and household goods for new products .	-4.5265
Sainsbury announced that the range of beauty products will be doubled on 3000 products by including for the first time brands such as Revlon , Essie , Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw in the product portfolio .	-4.2214
Existing L 'Oreal , Maybelline and Burt 's Bees assortment will also be given more space in branded areas , similar to those found in shops such as boots .	-11.7057
The supermarket chain is also revitalising its own “ boutique ” makeup brand , which offers many popular vegan products among young buyers .	-4.7097
In addition , the perfume dealer Fragrance Shop tests concessions in two Sainsbury shops , the first of which was opened last week in Croydon , South London , while a second end of this year will be opened in Selly Oak , Birmingham .	-4.5474
Online shopping and a shift to daily shopping of small quantities of food in neighborhood shops mean that supermarkets need to do more to get people to visit .	-4.5335
Mike Coupe , the head of Sainsbury 's , has said that sales outlets will increasingly look like department stores , as the supermarket chain is trying to combat discounters like Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food .	-4.5560
Sainsbury 's has placed Argos-Outlets in hundreds of stores and also introduced a series of habitats since it bought both chains two years ago , supposedly strengthening food sales and making acquisitions more profitable .	-4.0805
The former attempt by the supermarket to revise its beauty and pharmacy departments ended with a failure .	-3.3351
Sainsbury tested a joint venture with boots in the early 2000 ’ s , but it ended unetschieden , and the revenues from pharmacies ’ shops could not be shared .	-4.6012
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury 's sold his 281 pharmaceutical store three years ago for <unk> 125 million to Celesio , the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain .	-3.5280
In four Lloyds stores , the range of luxury skin care products from brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy is to be greatly extended .	-11.2213
Paul Mills-Hicks , Head of Advertising Sainsbury , said : “ We have changed the appearance of our shelves for beauty products to improve the equipment for our customers .	-4.1510
In addition , we have invested in the training of employees to assist the customer .	-4.5288
Our brand portfolio leaves nothing to be desired .	-2.6638

Dragons The Star Peter Jones went " angry " after TV presenter Holly Willoughby withdraws from the $ 11 million lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencers and ITV .	-4.0221

Holly Willoughby angered Dragons ' Den-Star Peter Jones because she withdrew at the last minute from her collective lucrative lifestyle brand to focus on her new madness contract with Marks & Spencers and ITV . .	-9.7572
Sources say that Jones was angry when the gold girl of television admitted during a tense session on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow , Buckinghamshire , that their new businesses , worth up to <unk> 1.5 million , meant that they had not had enough time to devote themselves to their home wear and accessories brand Truly .	-4.9819

When Willoughby , 37 , announced on Instagram that she would leave Truly , Jones left Britain and flew to one of his holiday homes .	-2.4839
One source said , " It was really high on Holly 's list of priorities . "	-7.2105
It should be its long-term future and secure it for the coming decades .	-3.1956
Their decision to withdraw has left all parties in complete disgust .	-5.3706
Nobody could believe what happened on Tuesday – just before the start .	-2.6135
" Marlow HQ has a warehouse full of goods that can be sold . "	-2.8823
Experts believe that the removal of the " This Morning " moderator , which is one of the UK 's most bankable stars , could cost the company millions because they have invested heavily in products such as pillows , candles , clothing , and homewear , and because of the potential for further delays in the launch of the market .	-5.5554
And it could mean the end of a long friendship .	-1.8917
For ten years , Willoughby and his husband , Dan Baldwin , Jones and his wife Tara Capp have been close .	-8.0191
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones , 52 , joined as Chairman in March .	-2.5698
The couples make holidays together and Jones has a 40 % stake in Baldwin 's TV production company .	-3.9477
Willoughby is said to be a M & S trademark and replace Ant McPartlin as the host of ITV 's I 'm A Celebrity .	-3.8571
A source of information around Jones said yesterday evening : ' We would not comment on his business matters ' .	-3.7182

Trump said so in his mocked “ news spokesman ” vote .	-2.7114
“ I have not made any compromises . ”	-2.1941
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump welcomed her first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step toward North Korea ’ s denuclearization .	-2.9345
But denuclearization negotiations are blocked .	-2.0681
More than three months after the Singapore Summit in June , Ri Yong Ho , North Korea ’ s leading diplomat , told United Nations leaders that the North does not see a “ appropriate response ” from the US to North Korea ’ s early disarmament measures .	-4.5613
Instead , he noted , the US continues sanctions to sustain pressure .	-3.6492
Trump adopted a much more optimistic stance in his rally speech .	-2.4220
“ We are making good progress with North Korea , ” he said .	-1.2847
“ We wanted to wage war with North Korea .	-1.2530
Millions of people would have been killed .	-0.8476
Now we have this great relationship . ”	-2.1041
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results , such as ending missile tests , liberating hostages , and transferring the mortal remains of American soldiers home .	-4.3846
And he defended his unusual approach when he talked about relations with Kim .	-2.3899
" It 's so easy to be presidential , but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this packed arena , about 200 people would be there , " Trump said , pointing to the crowd right in front of him .	-6.0750
In Indonesia , a tsunami and an earthquake kill hundreds and devastate an island .	-1.1865
After the Lombok earthquake , for example , foreign NGOs were told that they were not needed .	-2.6320
Although more than 10 % of Lombok ’ s population have been relocated , no national disaster has been declared , a prerequisite for catalyzing international aid .	-12.7508
Sumbung said : ' Unfortunately , in many cases they have made it very clear that they are not asking for international aid , so it is a small challenge ' ,	-4.4844
While Save the Children is setting up a team to travel to Palu , it is not yet sure whether foreign staff can work on site .	-4.6568
The spokesman of the National Civil Protection Agency , Mr Sutopo , said that Indonesian officials would assess the situation in Palu to see whether international organisations can contribute to the aid .	-3.5532
Unfortunately , given the earthquakes that Indonesia is enduring , the country is not well prepared for the forces of nature .	-3.6628
While the tsunami shelters were built in Aceh , what is not common for other coastlines .	-4.3746
The obvious absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu , although a warning was already in force , may have contributed to the loss of human lives .	-3.8842
Even under favourable conditions , traveling between the many islands of Indonesia is difficult .	-2.8752
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated .	-1.1959

The Cromwell Parliament ’ s statue will be the recent success of the History Review series .	-5.0056

However , the Cromwell Society described Mr Crick 's proposal as " folly " and as an " attempt to rewrite history . "	-2.9873

Perhaps the wrong cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the last century .	-2.5100
Sir William Hamo Thornycroft ’ s great presentation of Cromwell testifies to the opinion that prevailed in the nineteenth century and still prevailing in parts of history : that Cromwell is worth celebrating .	-4.8955
Mr Goldsmith said on ‘ Sunday Telegraph ’ : ‘ Cromwell is regarded by many , perhaps more in the late nineteenth century than today , as a defender of Parliament against external pressure , in his case of , of course , the monarchy .	-7.3374
Whether this is an absolutely correct representation is the subject of the ongoing historical debate .	-3.1896
To be sure , the conflict in the mid-seventeenth century shaped the subsequent development of our nation , and Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure that stands for one side of the divide .	-4.1267
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth remembering and celebrating . ”	-1.7726

As a result of the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students , Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador swore never to use military force against civilians .	-9.3222
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that the military would never use the military to oppress the Mexican people .	-3.6949
On October 2 , 1968 , troops had ended a peaceful demonstration of left-wing student groups with weapons , killing around 300 people .	-4.4452
Lopez Obrador has promised to provide financial support to Mexican students every month and to open other free public universities .	-4.0565

The US Should Double Spending on Artificial Intelligence	-2.6900
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence , the US should double its research investment , Kai-Fu Lee , investor , and AI practitioner , who has worked for Google , Microsoft , and Apple .	-3.0396
These demands arose after US government officials have made announcements about AI , even though the US lacks a formal AI strategy .	-3.7488
China has now presented its plan last year : by 2030 it wants to be the number 1 in the area of AI innovation .	-4.0911
“ Doubling spending on AI research would be a good start , given that all other countries are far behind the US , and a breakthrough in AI research is on the brink , ” Lee said .	-3.9497
Doubling funding could double the chances that the next achievement in artificial intelligence in the US will be achieved , Lee CNBC said in an interview this week .	-3.7394
Lee , whose book “ AI Superpowers : China , Silicon Valley and the New World Order ( AI Superpowers : China , Silicon Valley and the New World Order ) ” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt , is CEO of Sinovation Ventures , a company that invested in one of China ’ s best-known AI companies , Face + + .	-3.5078
In the 1980 ’ s , he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on a AI system that defeated the highest-ranking American Othello player , then leading Microsoft Research and President of Google ’ s Chinese branch .	-5.0725
Lee has recognized former US government technology competitions , such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( US Defense Research Agency ) , and asked when the next would take place to identify the next visionaries .	-4.1530
“ Researchers in the US often have to work very hard to obtain government grants , ” Lee said .	-2.7425
“ It is not China that is responsible for the outflow of high-ranking scientists , but companies , ” Lee said .	-10.2147
Facebook , Google , and other technology companies have hired universities to work on AI in recent years .	-4.0281
Lee said that a changed immigration policy could also help the US strengthen its AI efforts .	-3.0392
“ I think Green Cards should automatically be offered to PhD students in AI , ” he said .	-3.4194
In July 2017 , the Chinese State Council presented its next generation artificial intelligence development plan .	-2.8755
China ’ s National Natural Science Foundation provides funding for people in academic institutions similar to how the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to US researchers , but the quality of academic work in China is lower , Lee said .	-4.3543
Earlier this year , the US Defense Department established a joint Artificial Intelligence Center to involve partners from industry and science , and the White House announced the creation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence .	-3.9484
And this month , DARPA announced an investment of $ 2 billion in an “ AI Next ” initiative .	-2.2684
As far as the NSF is concerned , it is currently investing more than $ 100 million per year in AI research .	-2.2126
Meanwhile , US legislation , which sought to create a national security commission for artificial intelligence , has not been heard for months .	-4.7614
Macedonia votes in a referendum on whether to change its name .	-2.3485
On Sunday , the people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on whether their name should be changed to ' Republic of North Macedonia ' , a step that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that had blocked its accession offers for the European Union and NATO .	-4.4249
Greece , which has a province called Macedonia , insists that its northern neighbour 's name constitutes a territorial claim on the Greek territory , and has vetoed the country 's entry into NATO and the EU .	-3.4964
The two governments concluded an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name , but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of Macedonia .	-2.9622
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he would not vote in the referendum and , in the face of a boycott campaign , there are doubts as to whether the result will create the 50 % threshold , which is a prerequisite for the validity of the referendum .	-4.4991
The question in the voting paper on the referendum was : ' Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with the adoption of the agreement with Greece ? '	-3.1896
Advocates of the name change , including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev , argue that it is worth the price of continuing admission to institutions such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia , one of the countries to emerge from the collapse of Yugoslavia .	-3.8970
“ I have come today to vote on the country ’ s future ; it is a decision for the young people of Macedonia , so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union , because that means a life of greater security for all of us , ” said Olivera Georgijevska , 79 , in Skopje .	-4.4192
Although not legally binding , enough Members have said that they will abide by the outcome of the vote so that it becomes crucial .	-3.9493
A two-thirds majority in Parliament is required to change the name .	-2.5914
The Landtag Election Committee said at 1 p.m. that there were no reports of irregularities .	-4.4938
But voter turnout was only 16 % – 34 % at the same time in the last general election in 2016 , and 66 % of registered voters ended up voting .	-4.6430
“ I went to vote for my children – our place is in Europe , ” said Gjose Tanevski , 62 , a voter in the capital Skopje .	-3.2588
Macedonia ’ s Prime Minister Zoran Zaev , his wife Zorica , and his son , Dushko , voted in favour of the referendum in Macedonia on the change in the country ’ s name , which would pave the way for him to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica , Macedonia , on 30 September 2018 .	-3.7759
In front of the parliament in Skopje , Vladimir Kavardarkov , 54 , prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of the tents put up by those who will boycott the referendum .	-3.6844
" We are for NATO and the EU , but we want to participate with the heads up , not through the service door , " said Kavadarkov .	-3.3855
“ We live in a poor country , but we also have our dignity .	-1.8630
If you do not want to join us as Macedonia , we can turn to others , such as China and Russia , to join Euro-Asian integration . ”	-3.1672
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia , a country with an unemployment rate of more than 20 % .	-2.0336
“ I believe that a large majority will vote in favour , because more than 80 % of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO , ” Zaev said after his vote .	-4.0435
According to him , the result “ yes ” would be “ strengthening our future . ”	-3.3574
Last Monday , the Macedonian Institute for Political Research published the results of a poll : between 30 and 43 % of voters would vote – less than necessary .	-3.0038
Another poll conducted by Macedonia ’ s Telma TV found that 57 % of respondents will vote on Sunday .	-2.5112
Of those who want to participate , 70 % said yes .	-3.1203
The referendum will only be adopted if voter turnout exceeds 50 % .	-2.8418
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government ’ s policies since it took office last May .	-2.7885
View : Sergio Agüero of Manchester City overcomes the entire Brighton defense on the way to the gate .	-3.9182
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling did Brighton ’ s defense at the Manchester City 2-0 victory on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester , England .	-3.1557
Aguero made his 65th minute hit look incredibly simple .	-3.0135
At the beginning of the game sequence , the Argentine storm received a pass in the middle field .	-3.4214
He tricked out three defenders from Brighton to play free .	-3.2043
Then Agüero saw himself surrounded by three green shirts .	-2.1857
He bypassed a defender before he ran several players on the edge of the Brighton Penal Area .	-3.7670
Then he made a pass to the left and handed over to Sterling .	-9.3940
The English storm used his first contact to play the ball back to Agüero , who then shot with the right – past Brighton Torwart Mathew Ryan in the right side of the gate .	-4.9706
“ Aguero has foot problems , ” said City-Manager Pep Guardiola to the reporters .	-2.3331
" We talked about it ; he played 55 , 60 minutes .	-2.0456
That has happened .	-1.2355
Fortunately , he scored a goal at the moment . ”	-2.4568
But it was Sterling who initially led Sky Blues in the Premier League Duel :	-3.1147
The Gate came in the 29th Minute	-2.7732
In the game Aguero was played the ball deep in the territory of Brighton .	-2.7258
with a nice steep pass to Leroy Sané along the left side .	-2.7715
Sane made a few touches before leading Sterling to the remote post .	-3.3344
The Sky Blues played the ball forward on the net before slipping out of the field .	-3.4637

Scherzer wants to Play Rockies	-4.0253
Since the national players were excluded from the Playoff competition , there was not much reason to force another start .	-3.5900
But the hard-fought Scherzer hopes to climb the hill on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies , but only if there are still playoff implications for the rockies that have a lead from a game before the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West .	-4.6134
The Rockies won at least one place ahead with a 5 : 2 victory over the national on Friday evening , but the title win in the first league is still not certain .	-6.3833
" Even though we play for free , we can at least bear witness , because we know that the atmosphere here in Denver with the people and the other team will probably be the best we have to offer this year .	-4.7710
Why should I not try to do this ? '	-3.6033
The nationals have not yet announced a start for Sunday , but are allegedly inclined to let Scherzer throw in such a situation .	-4.2773
Scherzer , who would make his 34th start , threw up on Thursday and threw his normal day of rest .	-3.7996

Everything we have achieved is at stake in November .	-1.4192
Still five weeks to one of the most important elections in our lives .	-3.1558
This is one of the great , great - I do not stand , but I really stand , so I fight everywhere for great candidates , he said .	-4.6843
Trump continues : “ You see this terrible , terrible radical Democratic Group , you see that it is happening right now .	-3.8843
And they are determined to reclaim power with all the necessary means , and they are not stopping from bosses and communities .	-6.6371
They do not care who they violate , who they have to cross to get power and control , that is what they want , power and control , we will not give them .	-4.6270
“ The Democrats ’ goal is to oppose and block , ” he said .	-2.1230
" And you see it in the last four days , " he said and called the democrats " angry and common , evil and untrue " .	-4.1388
“ He referred in particular to the Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein , a senior member of the Senate ’ s Legal Affairs Committee , and thus harvested loud bubbles from the audience .	-5.3731
" Do you remember their answer ?	-2.1550
Have you read the document ?	-0.9223
No , what .	-0.8389
No , oh no , I , moment – that was really bad body language – the worst body language I have ever seen . ”	-3.1769
The Labour Party is no longer a broad community .	-1.6356
It is intolerant of those who say what they think .	-0.8609
When momentum activists in my local party voted to criticize me , it was hardly a surprise .	-2.3329
Finally , I am the last in a number of Labour Members who say that we are not welcome - just because we have said our opinion .	-3.5228
My group colleague , Joan Ryan , has been treated in a similar way because she has firmly opposed anti-Semitism .	-3.8974
In my case , I have been criticised by the motion of censure because I do not agree with Jeremy Corbyn .	-2.1859

The communication for the East Labour meeting in Nottingham on Friday states : ' We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive ' .	-2.5646
Most of my time in the eight years as a local Labour MEP was exactly the same as the GC meetings on Friday evening .	-3.8291
Unfortunately , it is not the tone of many meetings today , and the promise of a ' more friendly , softer ' policy has long since been forgotten if it ever started .	-8.9306
It has become increasingly clear that different views in the Labour Party are not tolerated , and every opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to party leaders .	-3.5672
This began shortly after Jeremy took office , because the colleagues with whom I had previously thought I had a similar political attitude expected me to make a reversal and take positions with which I would never otherwise have agreed , whether in relation to national security or the EU internal market .	-6.0249
Whenever I express myself publicly – and it does not matter what I say – a tirade of abuse in the social media , which calls for diselection , denounces the policies of the centre , and tells me that I should not be in the Labour Party .	-5.1605
This experience has not only been my experience .	-3.6841
I do know , in fact , that there is more luck than some of my colleagues , because the comments addressed to me tend to be political .	-4.2924
I appreciate the professionalism and determination of my colleagues , who are subjected to a flood of sexist or racist abuse every day , but never shy away .	-4.3226
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the level of abuse has normalized .	-2.5120
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance .	-1.4339
The reality is that we are no longer the broad church and , with every motion of censure or amendment of the selection rules , the party will be smaller .	-4.7501
I have received a lot of advice over the last two years to pull my neck , not to be so loud , and then I would be “ OK . ”	-5.1482
But that is why I did not come into politics .	-3.2577
I joined Labour as a student 32 years ago , because of the Thatcher Government ’ s neglect , which led to my classroom literally collapsing , and as a result I have tried to promote better public services for those who need them most , whether as a municipal council or a minister .	-6.8642
I have never hidden my political views , even in the last election .	-2.6577
As far as my political positions are concerned , nobody in Nottingham East should have been confused in any way , and the same applies to areas where I disagree with the current leadership .	-4.1687
To those who supported the request on Friday , I would just like to say that I do not understand why they are wasting time and energy to remain loyal to me and to the Labour Party when the country is heading towards a Brexit that harms households , businesses and our public services .	-4.7123
But the only message I have is not to Nottingham Momentum , but to my constituents , whether Labour members or not : I am proud to serve you , and I promise you that I will not be deterred by threats of diselection or political opportunism from work in what I think is the best interest of all of you .	-6.3504

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose : Ayr Unbeaten at the Le	-2.2603
Two late tries may have distorted the final result somewhat , but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win in this wonderful entertaining tennt 's Premiership Match of the Day .	-4.6580
You are now the only unbeaten of the ten teams to list the table .	-4.2615
In the end it was due to the outstanding defense of the host , but also to the fact that chances were better used .	-6.3893
" We have been tested so far by our games and we are still unbeaten , so I must be happy , " he said .	-2.7996
Robyn Christie von Melrose said , “ Thanks to Ayr , they have made better use of their opportunities . ”	-2.2933
Grant Anderson ’ s 14th minute attempt , transformed by Frazier Climo , brought Ayr forward , but a yellow card for Scotland ’ s captain Rory Hughes , who was given for the game of Warriors , allowed Melrose to make numbers speak , and Jason Baggot to make an untransformed attempt .	-4.2391
Climo stretched the leadership of Ayr with a shot of punishment before he reached a half-time hit and then made a solo search with which he succeeded in the 17 : 5 break for Ayr .	-6.8289
But Melrose began the second half well and Patrick Anderson 's attempt , transformed by Baggot , reduced the backlog to five points .	-3.2956
After the reboot , Ayr built the lead when a Try was turned by Stafford McDowall-by Climo .	-6.1198
Ayr 's current captain Blair Macpherson then got the yellow card , and again Melrose let the additional man pay with an unconverted Bruce Colvine attempt at the end of a curse of fierce pressure .	-3.7357
But the home side came back , and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for a Tackling without a ball from Climo , MacPherson made a touchdown , the advancing Ayr in the back .	-5.7040

Throughout the enclosed Bolivia , the memory of a coastline lost to Chile in a bloody conflict of resources in the nineteenth century is still alive , as is the longing to return to the Pacific .	-5.1436
These hopes may be at their peak for decades , as Bolivia awaits a ruling by the International Court of Justice on 1 October , after five years of consultation .	-4.5681
" Bolivia has the dynamism , the spirit of unity and the serenity and naturally expects the result with a positive view , " said Roberto Calzadilla , a Bolivian diplomat .	-3.4475
Many Bolivians will follow the ruling of the International Court of Justice on large screens throughout the country , hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will prefer Bolivia ’ s claim that Chile will have to negotiate after decades of unsettled talks in order to grant Bolivia sovereign access to the sea .	-5.0806
For Evo Morales , Bolivia ’ s charismatic indigenous president – who faces a controversial struggle for re-election next year – much depends on Monday ’ s decision .	-9.1168
“ We are about to regain access to the Pacific Ocean , ” he praised at the end of August .	-2.8095
However , some analysts consider it unlikely that the court will decide in favour of Bolivia , and believe that even a positive decision for Bolivia will not bring about any change .	-3.8159
The Dutch UN body has no authority to grant Chilean territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks .	-3.6822
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice came about only six months after hearing the final arguments shows that the case was ' not complicated ' , said Paz Zárate , a Chilean expert on international law .	-4.3403
And far from advancing Bolivia ’ s cause , the last four years may have postponed it .	-3.1855
“ The issue of sea access is being used by the current Bolivian government for its purposes , ” Zárate said .	-4.5061
Morale ’ s bellicose rhetoric destroyed any remaining Chilean goodwill , suggested .	-3.5368
Bolivia and Chile will resume the negotiations at some point , but it will be difficult to continue the talks afterwards .	-3.6468

Monday will “ offer Bolivia an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile , ” and will provide an opportunity to “ put an end to 139 years of mutually beneficial disagreements , ” he said .	-4.7553
Calzadilla also denied that Morales , who remains one of Latin America ’ s most popular presidents , is politically using the issue of sea access for his purposes .	-3.7672

North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not come , unless it can trust the US .	-8.2130
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that his nation will never defuse its nuclear weapons first if it cannot trust Washington .	-2.1532
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday .	-1.5012
He called on the United States to honour the promises made during a summit of the two rival leaders in Singapore .	-2.6000
His statements come at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be resuming the diplomatic talks on nuclear disarmament held on ice three months after the meeting with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un in Singapore .	-4.0869
Ri says that it is “ a dream ” that continued sanctions and the US ’ s opposition to a declaration ending the Korean War will ever push the North to its knees .	-5.0417
Washington will only agree with the declaration that Pyongyang has taken comprehensive disarmament measures .	-4.2856

The designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a series of crazy , oversized headcovers for their SS19 collection on the catwalk , which inspired the style of Paris Fashion Week .	-3.9788
Very unpractical hats flooded Instagram this summer , and these designers sent their striking creations over the catwalk .	-9.5521
The most outstanding piece of Valentino was an exaggerated beige hat decorated with a feather-wide edge that flooded the heads of the models .	-4.0503
Other oversized accessories were watermelons with jewellery , a magic hat and even an ananas , but they are not intended to keep the head warm .	-4.7720
Thom Browne showed a number of bizarre masks - and just in time for Halloween .	-1.6901
Many of the colourful masks had accumulated lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter rather than Haute Coution .	-4.1508
One creation resembled the diving equipment with snorkel and glasses , while another looked like a melted ice cup .	-3.5206
And if you have this incredible fashion trend , you are lucky .	-2.5900
Style observers predict that the huge hats could make their way into the main streets nearby .	-9.2855
The oversized hats have glued to the heels of " La Bomba " , the straw hat with a 60 cm wide edge , which can be seen from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski .	-4.6396
The cult label behind the highly impractical hat sprayed over social media sent another great creation to the catwalk - a straw beach bag that was almost as large as the swimsuit model she wore .	-5.2505
The orange bag , filled with Raffia hem and a white leather handle , was the outstanding piece in Jacquemus ' La Riviera SS19 collection at the Paris Fashion Week .	-4.1790

Independent schools in Scotland have a record of excellence in academic excellence , which continued in 2018 with once again excellent results , including individual and group success in sport , art , music and other community activities .	-6.5520
With over 30,000 students across Scotland , these schools , represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools ( SCIS ) , are striving to offer their students and parents the best level of service .	-3.5030
Independent schools are designed to prepare students – for further education , including at universities , for their desired career and for their role as world citizens .	-4.8981
In the education sector , we have the opportunity to develop and implement a tailor-made school curriculum , which shows that modern languages are still popular and desirable in schools .	-4.6165
Nelson Mandela once said , “ When you talk to a person in the language he understands , you reach his mind . ”	-3.6345
When you talk to him in his own language , he hears . ”	-3.2424
This impressively illustrates that we cannot rely only on the English language if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries .	-4.1585
The audit results this year show that languages are at the top of the tables with the highest levels of existence in independent schools .	-3.9245
68 percent of students who have studied foreign languages have reached the so-called “ Higher grade A ” higher class A .	-4.8731
The data gathered by the SCIS ’ s 74 member schools showed that 72 % of the students reached a “ Higher grade A ” in Mandarin , while among the students who learned German , French and Spanish , 72 , 69 and 63 reached note A .	-10.9724
This shows that independent schools in Scotland promote foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future .	-3.1486
Language subjects have the same rank in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere as MINT subjects ( mathematics , information technology , science and technology ) .	-3.7052
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission on Employment and Qualifications found that 17 % of the reasons why employers had difficulty filling vacancies were attributable to a lack of linguistic knowledge .	-10.7755
Therefore , language skills are becoming increasingly necessary to prepare young people for their professional future .	-3.3097
With more promising employment opportunities that require languages , these skills are essential in a globalised world .	-3.3958
Regardless of the career someone chooses when he has learned a second language , he has a real advantage in the future with a lifelong ability like this .	-4.4417
With the possibility of communicating directly with people from abroad , a multilingual person will automatically be ahead of the competitors .	-3.3071
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013 , 75 % were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation , and French is the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage , 15 % .	-4.0419
That is why the current investment in language teaching is important for today 's children .	-3.1872
When children learn to speak multiple languages – especially those of developing countries – they will have a better chance of finding meaningful employment in the labor market .	-4.2072
Schools in Scotland are different in terms of their linguistic offer . . the the . the the the . the the . the	-8.7582
Some schools focus on the classic modern languages , while other languages that are most important for Britain in 2020 , such as Mandarin or Japanese .	-4.2326
Whatever your child is interested , a number of languages will always be available in independent schools , with teachers specialized in this field .	-3.9634
Independent schools in Scotland want to provide a learning environment that is well prepared for children , and they should be given the necessary tools for their success , whatever the future may bring .	-6.4797
In today ’ s global business world , languages remain undeniably important for the country ’ s future , and this must also be reflected in education .	-3.4974
Indeed , modern languages should really be regarded as “ international communication capabilities . ”	-2.5736
Independent schools will continue to offer young people in Scotland this choice , diversity , and top quality .	-3.2782

It is the first of five planned electoral events next week , and on his tour , Trump also visits the Republican-friendly states of Tennessee and Mississippi . the the the . the the the , the , the the , the the	-9.1422
While his candidate ’ s confirmation of the vacant position in the Supreme Court is still pending , Trump must mobilize his electorate for the upcoming midterm elections , otherwise fearing that the Republicans will lose the majority in Congress when elected in November .	-6.4177
When is Trump ’ s West Virginia Rallye tonight and how can they be viewed online ?	-2.6376
Trump ’ s rally in Wheeling , West Virginia , is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight , Saturday , September 29 , 2018 .	-3.1841
You can follow Trump ’ s West Virginia Rally online by live stream on YouTube .	-2.6759
Trump will certainly respond to this week ’ s hearings on allegations of sexual abuse against his Supreme Court nominee , Brett Kavanaugh , whose confirmation of the Senate ’ s office was postponed by at least a week until the FBI ’ s investigation was completed .	-6.3357
The main aim of these electoral events , however , is to mobilize the Republicans , to whom a decisive election is about to take place in November .	-4.8386
According to Reuters , the goal of Trump ’ s campaign is to mobilize volunteers and supporters with the five elections next week to defend and expand the majority of Senate Republicans .	-3.8410
“ Congressional majority is on the president ’ s agenda , so he visits as many states as possible just before the start of the turbulent campaign season , ” said a Trump campaign spokesman who does not want to be named , Reuters .	-14.5357
According to the West Virginia MetroNews radio network , this evening ’ s Wesbanco Arena election event in Wheeling could attract Ohio and Pennsylvania supporters and attract the attention of the Pittsburgh media .	-3.4790
On Saturday , Trump will visit West Virgina , the state he won in 2016 with more than 40 percentage points , for the second time this month .	-2.2067
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate , Patrick Morrisey , who is lagging behind in the polls .	-2.7834
According to Reuters , Simon Haeder , a political scientist at the University of West Virginia , said that it was not a good sign for Morrisey that the president had to come to improve his poll values .	-8.0658
Ryder Cup 2018 : The United States Team is ready to fight to maintain hope for Sunday singles .	-3.4755
After three unilateral encounters , the four games on Saturday afternoon were probably exactly what the Ryder Cup needed .	-3.2017
The vibrating pendulum is a freely invented sports concept that the players have internalized , especially in competitions like this .	-4.2600
So where would they say is the momentum now ?	-2.2375
“ They had a six-point leap forward , and now there are four , so we probably have a little swing , ” said Jordan Spieth , when he withdrew for the day . ”	-10.9116
Europe is , of course , at the advantage of 4 points and 12 more are still to be played .	-5.5838
As Spieth says , however , Americans feel a little wind in their sails , and there were many encouraging things for them , not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas , who played all day together and each had three out of four points .	-5.2398
Spieth was superior from the beginning and set an example .	-2.7694
This conspicuous jubilee became louder as his round continued , he squandered a decisive putt to win a draw in game 4 after he and Thomas scored 2 points after 2 games .	-8.3943
His joy with the putt on the 15th hole with which they won the game was so much that one thought he still believes in the victory of the Americans .	-5.5662
" You really have to focus heavily and only worry about your own game , " said Spieth .	-3.8390
This is all that each of these players still has .	-4.3831
18 holes to leave impression .	-1.6787
In this Ryder Cup , Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood were the only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in in the the last two days . .	-11.0544
Europe ’ s strange but admirable pair plays flawless and just makes everything right .	-4.3570
" Moliwood " was the only couple who did not score a bogey on Saturday afternoon , but they also avoided the bogey on Saturday morning , Friday afternoon and Friday morning .	-5.4427
This race and the way in which its energy seems to flow and from this omission of spectators makes it the favorites on Sunday , and when the sun goes down over Le Golf National , there would be no more popular player sealing a possible European victory than Fleetwood or Molinari .	-6.4377
Probably both at different holes at the same time .	-1.8805
Talking now of a European victory would be too hasty .	-2.9297
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a short process with Sergio Garcia , who won the morning with his partner Alex Noren .	-2.9635
With a bogey and two doubles at the first nine the Spaniard and the Swede dig into a hole from which they never came out again .	-4.5133
On Sunday there is no one to help you out of your hole .	-3.2813
Due to the interactions between the couples , the given advice , the non-given advice and the way a strategy can change in a moment , it is very fascinating to watch the football and Foursomes from close by .	-6.2534
Europe has played better as a team and has taken a clear lead in the last day , but this Foursome-session has also shown that the US team has the desire to fight , something some , especially Stateside , have doubted about .	-6.0886
Europe Leads 10-6 on the Ryder Cup Final Day	-2.7729
Europe will take advantage of a solid advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after it emerged from the four and four games on Saturday with a 10-6 tour of the United States .	-4.5891
The inspired Duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the group with two victories over a fighting Tiger Woods to score four points in the Le Golf National .	-4.2190
The European team of Thomas Bjorn , who competed for the preservation of the trophy that she lost in Hazeltine two years ago , dominated a suspension-fighting American team , and won the series 3-1 .	-6.0067
The US offered more resistance in the four , winning two games , but it could not digest the deficit .	-2.8201
The team of Jim Furyk needs eight points from the 12 individual games of Sunday to keep the trophy .	-3.5798
Fleetwood is the first European Rookie to win four consecutive points , while he and Molinari , after a sensational weekend called " Molliwood " , are only the second couple to win four points from their first four games in the history of the Ryder Cup .	-3.7782
After breaking Woods and Patrick Reed into the football , it was certain that they would beat a sobering woods and American Rookie Bryson Dechambeau through an even clearer 5 & 4 .	-5.2682
Woods , who dropped through two matches on Saturday , occasionally showed brilliant action , but he has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in four-legged balls and fours , and seven in a row .	-13.1883
Justin Rose , rested for tomorrow ’ s football , returned to Foursomes to his partner Henrik Stenson , and beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – place one and three in the world .	-4.8099
On a pleasant , airy day southwest of Paris , however , Europe did not have it in its own way .	-2.6191
The triple main winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans on Saturday with two points .	-3.4645
They won a courageous 2 : 1 victory against the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-pack and returned later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 : 3 in the four-pack after they lost the first two holes .	-9.6120
Only twice in the Ryder Cup story , a team returns from a four-point deficit to the singles , although Holder Furyk 's side only needs a draw to keep the trophy .	-4.4414
However , after two days of secondary testing , a Sunday account looks like it would go beyond it .	-6.5010
North Korea says that “ there will be no unilateral disarmament without trust . ”	-2.9286
North Korea ’ s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions would deepen its distrust of the United States , and that the country would not , under such circumstances , unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons .	-10.5960
Ri Yong Ho said to the annual General Assembly of the World Corps that North Korea had taken " significant goodwill measures " last year , such as halting nuclear and missile tests , dismantling the nuclear testing site , and the obligation not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology .	-6.0665
" There is no such answer from the USA , " he said .	-3.4824
“ Without any confidence in the US , there will be no confidence in our national security , and in such circumstances there is no way that we will first disarm ourselves unilaterally . ”	-3.9327
While Ri resumed the well-known North Korean complaints about Washington ’ s opposition to a “ step-by-step ” approach to denuclearization , rewarding North Korea with gradual steps , his statement seemed significant inasmuch as it did not completely reject unilateral denuclearization , as Pyongyang did in the past .	-4.7237
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a first summit between an incumbent US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12 , when Kim committed to working towards a “ denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula , ” while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea ’ s security .	-4.1177
North Korea has sought a formal end to the Korean War in 1950-53 , but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons .	-2.7937
Washington has also resisted calls for a relaxation of tough international sanctions against North Korea .	-3.0799
The US insists on " denuclearization-first " ( first denuclearization ) and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its purpose in an imperative way , and even reject the " declaration of the end of war " , said Ri .	-5.1219
" The perception that sanctions can force us into our knees is a dream of the people who are ignorant of us .	-3.4750
But the problem is that continued sanctions exacerbate our mistrust . ”	-2.0793
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump , which the US President emphasized at the United Nations earlier this week .	-3.4606
Instead , the minister raised three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the last five months and added : ' If the party were South Korea 's denuclearization rather than the US , denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have reached such a deadlock ' .	-4.8322
Nevertheless , the tone of Ri ’ s speech was dramatically different from last year when he reported it to the U.S. N. The General Assembly , which targeted the US mainland with North Korea ’ s missiles , was inevitable after “ Mr. Evil President ” Trump Kim called a “ rocket man ” on a suicide mission .	-4.4108
This year at the United Nations , Trump , who threatened last year to “ completely destroy ” North Korea , praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm , but he also said that much work still needed to be done , and sanctions must remain until North Korea destroyed denuclearization .	-4.6900
On Wednesday , Trump said that he had no timetable for this , saying : " It does not matter whether it takes two years , three years , or five months .	-7.6891
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken .	-1.4050
However , in the United States Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo said to the United Nations Security Council on Thursday that : ' The enforcement of the Security Council sanctions must be vigorously and without lack until we achieve full , final and verified denuclearization ' .	-5.8251
Since 2006 , the Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea to prevent the financing of Pyongyang ’ s nuclear and ballistic missile programs .	-2.7814
Pompeo met Ri on the margins of the UN General Assembly and then said that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit .	-9.4419
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year , but his last trip was not good .	-10.0676
He left Pyongyang in July , saying that progress had been made , and only a few hours later , North Korea condemned him for “ transitional demands . ”	-5.2834
At a meeting with Moon this month , North Korea promised to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the United States took ' appropriate action ' .	-3.8672
He said that Kim told him that the " appropriate measures " he sought were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore , and steps to normalize relations with Washington .	-3.7019
Harvard students take part in the course to find enough peace .	-3.0528
With a new course this year at Harvard University , all students get more sleep to fight against the growing macho culture of studying the caffeine-intoxicated nights .	-5.6988
A scientist has found that students at a world leading university are often unsuspecting when it comes to helping themselves , even when it comes to very simple mechanisms .	-4.3619
Charles Czeisler , Professor of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Specialist at Brigham and Women 's Hospital , designed the course , which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States .	-8.8416
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the impact of sleep deficiency on learning .	-3.4970
In the end , a girl came to me and said : ' Why is that only now , in my final year , told me ?	-8.1242
She said that she never told her about the meaning of sleep – which surprised me , " he said to the telegraph .	-3.9786
The course , which will be offered this year for the first time , explains to students how good sleep habits promote academic and sporting performance and improve their general well-being .	-4.8516
Paul Barreira , Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Managing Director of the University ’ s Health Service , said that the university decided to introduce the course after finding that pupils had slept extremely little during the week .	-4.7720
The 1-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks .	-2.3471
In a section there is a picture of a dormitory in which students click on coffee cups , curtains , trainers and books to be informed about the effects of caffeine and light and how sports performance influences by lack of sleep and the importance of sleep time routine .	-9.6819
Another section explains how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack , stroke , depression , and cancer .	-3.1938
A map of the campus with interactive symbols encourages participants to reflect on their daily lives .	-2.4258
We know that it will not change the behaviour of students immediately .	-2.3105
" But we believe that they have a right - just as you have a right to know the health implications of the decision to smoke cigarettes , " added Prof. Czeisler .	-3.6093
The culture of pride of going through a " night " still exists , he said , and added that modern technology and increasing pressure on pupils and students to sleep deprivation is a growing problem .	-4.7634
To have enough sleep of good quality should be the " secret weapon " of a student to combat stress , exhaustion and fear , he said - even to avoid having sleep deprived the brain in hunger mode and making it constantly hungry .	-6.9215
Raymond So , a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology , helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes last year in his first year in Harvard .	-2.6840
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to push for a campus-wide course .	-2.5810
The next step , he hopes , is to call on all the doctors to undertake a similar study programme before entering the University of Applied Sciences .	-5.3624
Prof. Czeisler advised students to set an alarm when they should go to bed and when they should wake up , and to be aware of the harmful effects of the " blue light " emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting that can get their zirkadian rhythm out of the clock , leading to sleep problems .	-6.9521
Livingston 1-0 Rangers : Mengas Goal EarGerrard Me	-2.5520
Further external problems of the Rangers : After a hit by Dolly Menga , Livingston lost 1-to-0 for Steven Gerrard 's unlimited team .	-5.9040
The Ibrox team wanted to record their first victory since the 4 : 1 triumph in February in St. Johnstone , but the team of Gary Holt added Gerrard 's second defeat in 18 games as a coach who left his team eight points behind the disappointed Ladbroke Premiership Hearts .	-5.6043
Menga landed a hit seven minutes before the half-time , and an inspirational ranger setting did not look like it could compensate .	-5.5498
While the rangers now fall back to sixth place , Livingston climb to rank three and lie behind Hibernian only because of the gate difference .	-4.9456
New difficulties for the rangers are emerging , as Calum Spence , a liner judge , had to be given a head wound after he was hit by a throwing object – apparently thrown out by the sector of foreign fans .	-8.1223
Gerrard made eight changes , passing Ayr , to the semi-final of the Betfred Cup .	-4.5895
In contrast , he set up the same Livi Elf , who took a point on the Hearts last week , and he should have been enthusiastic about how his well-trained team never left the opponents room for action .	-8.5009
The rangers dominated the ball , but Livingston did better .	-4.3292
They should have met after only two minutes , when Menga ’ s first defeat , Scott Pittman , sent to Allan McGregors Tor , but the midfielder delayed his big change at the goal .	-6.5545
A deep blow from Keaghan Jacobs then went to Captain Craig Halkett , but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only shoot far behind the post .	-4.4373
The rangers took control , but there seemed to be more hope than Veretrauen in their own game , in the last third .	-3.6422
Alfredo Morelos was clearly of the opinion after the end of the first quarter of an hour that he deserved an elf meter after he and Steven Lawless collided , but arbitrator Steven Thomson did not respond to the Columbian appeals .	-5.7898
The rangers only get two shots in the first half , but the former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was barely out of Lassana Coulibaly ’ s head jump and the hit of a bizarre ovie Ejaria .	-5.7311
Even though Livis may have been the 34th minute open strike , nobody can deny that they deserve it alone for their efforts .	-5.6421
Again , the rangers failed to master a Jacobs standard situation .	-2.6957
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher Scott Robinson played the ball that kept the rest and picked Menga out for a simple finish .	-3.5904
Gerrard acted during the break when he exchanged Coulibaly against Ryan Kent and the change immediately affected the game when the winner played to Morelos , but the impressive Kelly ran from his line to block .	-5.1905
But Livingston always drew guests to play exactly the kind of game they like , with Lithgow and Halkett jumping long balls after long balls .	-4.8359
Holt ’ s team could have expanded its leadership in the final phase , but McGregor stood up to refuse Jacobs before Lithgow headed out of the corner .	-4.7076
The Rangers Representative Glenn Middleton had another belated claim to a punishment because he hadged with Jacobs , but once again Thomson looked away .	-5.7852
Almanach : The inventor of the Geiger Counter	-2.1958

New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “ see ” malignant cells .	-1.4414
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to " see " and kill malignant cells .	-1.5075
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of treatment .	-1.7742
The procedure includes the extraction of immune cells from a patient , modification of them in the laboratory .	-3.0507
You can then see a protein that is common to many cancers , and then inject again .	-2.6641
A study vaccine shows promising results in patients with a number of cancers .	-2.1545
A woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to detect rogue cells saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months .	-3.5346
The method is to extract immune cells from a patient , change them in the laboratory , so that a protein called HER2 becomes “ visible ” , which occurs in many cancers , and then inject the cells again .	-3.9332
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda , Maryland said : ' Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine . '	-2.1949
HER2 “ promotes the growth of various types of cancer , ” including breast , egg stock , lung and intestinal cancer , explained Prof. Berzofsky .	-4.1958
A similar approach to taking patients from immune cells and teaching them how to attack cancer cells has worked to treat a type of leukaemia .	-3.2499
After performing on Saturday Night Live , Kanye West , dressed with MAGA cap , left a pro-trump triad from the stack .	-4.5700
It Was Not Good	-1.3519
Kanye West was shot out in the studio during a Saturday night live broadcast after a sweeping speech in which he praised the US . President Donald Trump said he would be in 2020 .	-6.2444
Having performed his third song of the night , called Ghost Town , while carrying a Make America Great cap , he stoked the Democrats and reaffirmed his support for Trump .	-4.4461
" As often as I speak to a white person , she says , “ How can you like Trump , he is a racist ? ”	-2.9672
Well , if I were concerned about racism , I would have left America a long time ago , " he said .	-2.8967
The Saturday Night Live Show began with a sketch in which Hollywood star Matt Damon made herself funny about Brett Kavanaugh ’ s statement before the Senate ’ s Justice Committee on Christine Blasey Ford ’ s accusations that Kavanaugh had sexually compelled her .	-5.2770
Although it was not broadcast , the film material of West ’ s Schwätz was shared by the comedian Chris Rock in the social media .	-3.9636
It is unclear whether Rock has tried to mock West with the post .	-3.2666
West , too , had complained to the audience that he had had been hard behind the stage , because of his head cover .	-5.6719
" They harassed me behind the stage .	-1.3815
You said : ' Don 't go out with the hat ' .	-4.0759
You annoyed me !	-1.5503
And then they say that I am in a given place , " he said , according to the Washington Examiner .	-2.4835
West continued : " Want to see the sunken place ? " , saying that he would " attract my Superman curtain , because that means you cannot tell me what to do , you want the world to move forward ?	-6.5834
Try it with love . ”	-1.1043
His comments were reviewed at least twice by the audience , and the comedians of Saturday Night Live seemed to be laying , reported Variety , and quoted one person in the words : “ The whole studio was dead . ”	-5.5163
West had been used as a substitute for the singer Ariana Grande , whose former friend , Rapper Mac Miller , died a few days ago .	-3.1603
West surprised many with a performance of the song " I Love it " , dressed as Perrier Bottle .	-2.8539
West received support from the leader of the conservative group TPUSA , Candace Turner , who twittered : " This is for one of the most courageous spirits : DANKE , THE MAFIA WIDERSETZT HAST . "	-4.3312
But Talkmaster Karen Hunter twittered that West is simply " what he is , and that is absolutely wonderful " .	-2.7851

" Game of Thrones " star Kit Harington lives out toxic masculinity .	-2.7878
Kit Harington is known for his swinging role as Jon Snow in the brachial medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones by HBO .	-3.0397
But the actor , 31 , has annoyed the stereotype of the machoheld and has said that such roles on the canvas often make small boys feel hard to be respected .	-5.4023
Kit said to " The Sunday Times Culture " that he thought something went wrong and asked how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the <unk> MeToo era .	-3.7083
Kit , who recently married his co-star Rose Leslie , also 31 , admitted that he thought it was very important to solve the problem .	-2.4436
I personally feel quite strong at the moment - what have we done with masculinity ? , he said .	-3.6086
What have we taught men in their youth about the problem we are now seeing ?	-2.6948
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its very masculine characters .	-2.9641
He continued : What is innate and what is taught ?	-2.1861
What is taught on television and on the street gives the little boy the feeling that they have to have this particular side of the Man ?	-4.7734
I think that is really one of the great questions of our time – how can we change that ?	-3.8301
Because for young men , something has obviously gone wrong . .	-7.8698

HIV / AIDS : China reports 14 % rise in new cases	-2.0524
China has reported an increase of 14 % among the citizens living with HIV and AIDS .	-2.8219
According to health authorities , 820,000 people are affected in the country .	-1.9990
In the second quarter of 2018 alone , 40,000 new cases were reported .	-1.2087
In the vast majority of new cases , the virus has been transmitted through sexual intercourse , which is a change from the past .	-3.6206
Usually , HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions .	-2.9683
But the number of people with HIV this way was reduced to almost zero , Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province .	-4.1253
However , compared to last year , the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 .	-3.1862
The transmission of HIV through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community .	-2.1575
Homosexuality has ceased to be a crime in China since 1997 , but discrimination against LGBT people is widespread .	-2.6644

The democrat based in Los Angeles believes that the claims of ultra-left-wing members and websites have been launched .	-4.6972
" lies , lies , and even more disgusting lies , " Waters said in an opinion on Twitter .	-4.8320
Published information reportedly included US Senator Lindsey Graham ’ s private addresses and telephone numbers from South Carolina and US Senators Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch , both from Utah .	-4.0073
The information was published on Thursday , posted by an unknown person on the Capitol Hill during a hearing of the Senate on allegations of sexual misconduct against the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh .	-4.4070
The data of the three senators were published shortly after the survey of Kavanaugh .	-2.3850
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the job was associated with Waters ' office and published the information of a Waters employee , Hill reports .	-4.6091
“ This unfounded charge is completely wrong and an absolute lie , ” Waters continues .	-3.5812
“ The employee among my employees – whose identity , personal information , personal data , and security were impaired as a result of these fraudulent and false claims – was in no way responsible for reading this information .	-4.1899
This unfounded claim is completely wrong and an absolute lie .	-3.9277
Waters ’ explanation quickly led to online criticism , including by the former press secretary of the White House Ari Fleischer .	-3.4189
“ The denial of the matter is extremely annoying , ” wrote Fleischer .	-3.8390
“ This suggests that it is unsuitable as a congress member .	-2.6426
If someone is accused of having done something , he must not be evil .	-2.5193
They must not be upset .	-2.4128
They must not question the motives of the plaintiff .	-2.3169
They must be calm and calm ” .	-7.1818
Messischer seemed to compare Water ’ s response to the Democrats ’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh , accused by critics of appearing angry during the hearing on Thursday .	-4.1363
Omar Navarro , a Republican candidate standing alongside the seated Water in the midterm elections , also expressed his thoughts on Twitter .	-3.9733
“ Big , if true ” , he tweeted .	-2.7530
In her statement , Waters said that her office ' informed the competent authorities and law enforcement authorities of fraudulent claims .	-3.7281
“ We will ensure that the perpetrators are captured and held to account for their actions , which are destructive and dangerous for my employees , ” she continued .	-3.9886
Review of " Johnny English – Living only Three times " – Bad Parody with Rowan Atkinson	-4.1021
It is tradition to look for hints in every new film with a British tendency to Brexit , and this seems to be applicable to this revival of the Johnny English Action-Comedy Spoof franchise , which began with Johnny English in 2003 and was re-launched in 2011 with " Johnny English Reborn " .	-6.3885
Is the ironic self-satire about the abyss of mankind the new export possibility of the nation ?	-3.6466
In any case , the glossy , rubber-eyed and incompetent Johnny English has been licensed for the second time to reproduce things .	-6.0752
He is , of course , the stupid secret agent , who , despite his bizarre claims to smoothie glamour , got a little clouseau , a spritzer Mr. Bean and a stick from this guy , and who contributed a single note to the flag melody of the firemen at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics .	-7.8787
It is also based on the traveller and international , mysterious Atkinson , who once participated in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV shows , always left chaos .	-4.6720
There are one or two beautiful moments in this latest Johnny English-comedy .	-1.8360
I loved Johnny English , who approaches a helicopter in a medieval armor and the main rotor beats against his helmet .	-4.3170
Atkinson 's talent for body comedy can be seen , but the humor feels pretty weak and strange superfluous , especially as the " serious " film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible confidently offer comedy as ingredients .	-4.6978
The humor feels like being directed more to children than to adults , and for me the crazy misfortunes of Johnny English are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson ’ s Mr. Bean silent films .	-4.5794
The everlasting premise is that Britain is in great trouble .	-3.3053
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the highly secret British network of spies and revealed the identity of all British agents on the ground to horror the serving agent – a unfortunately small role for Kevin Eldon .	-4.0611
Emma Thompson is doing her best with this quasi-teresa May figure , but there is not much in the script you can work with .	-4.0290
Their intelligence advisers inform them that , as every single active spy has been compromised , it must get someone out of retirement .	-4.6496
And that means the great patchy Johnny English himself , who is now a schoolmaster in a noble institution but gives unsurpassed lessons about how to operate as an undercover agent : some nice gags here , while English offers a School of Rock Academy about spying .	-6.3494
English is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency letter and reunited with his former long-suffering Kumpel Bough , played again by Ben Miller .	-4.6586
Bough is now a married man who meets a submarine commander , an overwhelming burschikose role in which Vicki Pepperdine does not fully apply .	-5.3590
So , the Batman and Robin des Chaos at the Secret Service of their Majesty are back in action and meet on Olga Kurylenkos beautiful femme Fatale Ophelia Bulletova .	-10.8892
Meanwhile , the prime minister is dangerously beaten by the charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain ’ s computer problems : the sinister Jason Volta , played by Jake Lacy .	-4.0234
English and Bough begin their odyssey of colourful high-jinks : as waiters dressed , they ignite a French flash restaurant ; they create chaos by smuggling on board Voltas luxury yacht ; and English triggers pure anarchy when he tries to familiarize himself with a virtual reality headset with the interior of Voltas House .	-5.0230
All the registers have been drawn for this last sequence , but as lovingly and omitted as it is , the whole thing is reminiscent of children 's television .	-6.9166
Quite moderately .	-1.5731
And , as with the other Johnny English-movies , I could not help but think : can the British film industry not give Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice to his talent ?	-4.7579
Labour denies having developed a plan for Britain for a four-day week for which five days are paid .	-3.2307
Jeremy Corbyn ’ s Labour Party is reviewing a radical plan in which Britons work only four days a week , but are paid for five .	-3.3768
According to reports , the party wants business leaders to pass on the savings made by the Artificial Intelligence Revolution to workers by giving them an additional day .	-4.2209
Staff would enjoy a three-day weekend - but still bring the same money back home .	-3.7956
Sources said that the idea would " fit " with the party 's economic agenda and plans to overturn the country for the benefit of workers .	-3.7997
The Trade Union Congress has approved the transition to a four-day week as an opportunity for workers to benefit from the changing economy .	-4.3344
A high-level source from the Labour Party said the Sunday Times : a policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year .	-3.8913
A four-day week is an objective consistent with the Party ’ s approach to restoring economic balance for workers and the Party ’ s overall industrial strategy , but this objective will not be achieved overnight .	-4.9919
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea , as the Green Party promised a four-day working week during its 2017 campaign .	-2.6737
However , the entire Labour Party currently does not support this move .	-3.8204
A Labour spokesman said : ' A four-day week is not party policy and is not intended by the party ' .	-9.0366
Chancellor John McDonnell took advantage of last week ’ s Labour Party Conference to concrete his vision for a socialist economic revolution .	-3.9122
Mr McDonnell said that he was determined to regain the power of faceless directors and profiteers at utilities .	-3.3132
The shadow Chancellor 's plans also mean that current shareholders of water companies may not be able to recover their entire share , as a Labour government could make deductions due to alleged misconduct .	-6.5059
He also confirmed the plans to appoint employees to the company management and to create inclusive ownership funds to distribute 10 % of private sector companies ’ equity to employees who receive annual dividends of up to <unk> 500 .	-5.4934
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk in “ 60 minutes ” about whether the FBI investigation against Kavanaugh could change their mind .	-2.7961
An ongoing FBI inquiry into charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh postponed the final vote on the appeal of the judge to the Supreme Court by at least one week , and raised the question of whether the FBI ’ s findings could lead Republican senators to abandon their support for Kavanaugh .	-5.1904
In an interview broadcast on Sunday , Scott Pelley , correspondent of “ 60 minutes , ” asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI ’ s findings might encourage them to change their mind .	-4.0447
Kennedy appeared more open than his colleague from South Carolina .	-2.0359
“ In any case , ” Kennedy said .	-1.3971
" I said at the beginning of the hearing that I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh .	-2.2073
I called him after that happened , after that claim came out , I said : ' Have you done it ? '	-4.5664
He was determined , targeted , unambiguous . '	-2.3092
Graham 's voice seemed to be cast in stone , however .	-7.8061
" I have an opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and it would need a bomb charge , " he said .	-2.2914
“ Dr Ford , I don ’ t know what happened , but I know that Brett has vehemently denied the charge , ” adds Graham to Christine Blasey Ford .	-4.8498
" Nobody who called it could confirm it .	-3.5111
It was 36 years ago .	-1.4331
I see nothing new that is changing . '	-2.4105
" What is the Global Citizen Festival and has ensured that poverty is reduced ? "	-2.2400
This Saturday , New York will host the Global Citizen Festival , an annual music event with an impressive selection of stars and an equally impressive mission to end poverty in the world .	-3.4107
This year ’ s seventh Global Citizen Festival will bring tens of thousands of people together at the Great Lawn in Central Park to experience not only stars like Janet Jackson , Cardi B , and Shawn Mendes , but also to highlight the true goal of the event : ending extreme poverty by 2030 .	-4.2589
The Global Citizen Festival , which took place in 2012 , is an extension of the Global Poverty Project , an international stakeholder aimed at combating poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it .	-3.5294
In order to get a free admission ticket for the event , concert visitors had a whole series of tasks or " actions " , such as volunteer work , an email to a leader in the world , a telephone conversation or other useful ways of raising the target of poverty reduction and raising awareness of it .	-6.7040
But how successful has Global Citizen been with 12 years remaining to achieve its goal ?	-2.8559
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert , a real way to convince people to call for action , or simply another case of so-called " clicktivism " - people who feel like sending a tweet by signing an online petition or an online application ?	-13.1407
Global Citizen says that it has recorded more than 19 million “ actions ” from its supporters since 2011 , pushing for a variety of goals .	-3.0635
It is said that these actions have motivated world leaders to make financial and political commitments worth more than $ 37 billion , which will affect the lives of more than $ 2.25 billion by 2030 .	-3.4754
At the beginning of 2018 , the Group launched 390 operations and announcements from its actions , of which at least $ 10 billion has already been paid out or financed .	-4.3683
The group estimates that the funds allocated so far have had a direct impact on almost 649 million people around the world .	-3.3497
One of the most important commitments is The Power of Nutrition , a UK based partnership of investors and executing organizations committed to “ helping children develop their full potential . ” The organization promised $ 35 million to help Rwanda end the country ’ s malnutrition after more than $ 4,700 has been received by Global Citizens .	-5.7351
“ With the support of the British Government , donors , other state governments , and Global Citizens like you , we can make the social injustice of malnutrition one day history , ” The Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman announced the crowd in a live concert in London in April 2018 .	-4.0473
The group also said that , after more than 5,000 actions in the UK , which aimed to improve nutrition for mothers and children , the government will finance the Power of Nutrition project 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions .	-4.6419
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on their website , “ Why do you think that we can end extreme poverty ? ”	-2.6533
Global citizens replied : it will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will fall and fail .	-3.2052
Like the great civil law and the anti-apartheid movements before us , we will succeed , because we are more powerful together .	-3.3427
will be performing the stars Janet Jackson , Weeknd , Shawn Mendes , Cardi B and Janelle Monáe at this year ’ s event in New York , hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman .	-3.3126
US could build a “ blockade ” with the Navy to impede Russian energy exports – Home Affairs Minister . the the the the . the the the . the the . the	-8.0630
Washington can use its navy “ if necessary ” to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets , including in the Middle East , US interior minister Ryan Zinke is quoted by the Washington Examiner .	-3.9151
Zinke said that Russia ’ s engagement in Syria – particularly in activities inviting the legitimate government – was a pretext for exploring new energy markets .	-3.9173
“ I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is this : they want to negotiate energy just as they do in Eastern Europe , the southern part of Europe , ” he said .	-8.5113
And , according to officials , there are ways and means to deal with it .	-3.5149
“ The United States has this ability to use our navy to ensure that the sea routes are open , and , if necessary , to block them to ensure that their energy does not come onto the market , ” he said .	-10.6496
Zinke spoke to the participants of an event at the Consumer Energy Alliance , a non-profit organization that calls itself the “ voice of energy consumers ” in the US .	-3.3001
He compared Washington ’ s approach to Russia and Iran , and found that they are indeed the same .	-2.9561
" The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less to use and replace fuels , " he said , while calling Russia a " one-trick pony " with a fossil-fuel economy .	-3.0856
The opinions come , while the Trump administration was on the mission to boost the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe and replace Russia , the much cheaper option for European consumers .	-3.9436
That is why members of the Trump administration – including US President Donald Trump himself – are trying to persuade Germany to stop the “ inappropriate ” Nord Stream-2 pipeline project that , according to Trump , would turn Berlin into Moscow ’ s “ prison. ”	-10.3921
Moscow has repeatedly emphasised that the $ 11-billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline , which is to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres , is a purely economic project .	-3.6029
The Kremlin argues that Washington ’ s opposition to the project is simply driven for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition .	-2.1900
“ I believe we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument for exerting pressure , and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers , ” said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak , following a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September .	-3.9301
The US stance has provoked a backlash from Germany , which has confirmed its commitment to the project .	-3.6683
Germany ’ s leading industrial organization , the Federal Association of German Industries ( BDI ) , has called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow .	-4.0814
" I have a big problem when a third state intervenes in our energy supply , " said Dieter Kempf , the German Industry Association ( BDI ) , after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin .	-3.3337

Warren burdened President Donald Trump during the Rathaus Meeting , saying that he is " leading that country in the wrong direction " .	-4.5698
" I am very concerned about what Donald Trump does with our democracy , " she said .	-1.9981
Warren ’ s Criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court did not take candidate Brett Kavanaugh ’ s mouth .	-5.3131
Warren said in a tweet on Friday : ' Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote ' .	-2.7989
However , a poll published on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren ’ s own voters do not believe that it should run in 2020 .	-3.1339
According to a survey by Suffolk University Political Research Center / Boston Globe , 58 % of the " likely " Massachusetts voters said that the senator should not stand .	-2.7743
Thirty-two percent supported such a race .	-2.2217
The poll showed more support for a run by former Governor Deval Patrick , with 38 % for a potential run and 48 % against .	-3.4302

Sarah Palin quotes Track Palins PTSD at Donald Trump ’ s campaign	-2.1369
Track Palin , 26 , spent a year in Iraq after being convened in September .	-1.9514
He was arrested and accused of an incident of domestic violence on Monday evening .	-2.3247

Palin described his arrest as “ the elephant in the room , ” and said to her son and other veterans : “ They come back a little bit differently , they come back harder and wonder whether the work of their co-soldiers and the air force and all other members of the military is respected for the country . ” .	-10.7329

18 states DC support the challenge of a new asylum policy .	-1.7747
18 states and Washington , DC support a legal challenge to a new US policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence .	-3.3149
According to NBC News , representatives from the 18 states and the district submitted an Amicus Curiae ( Friend of the Court ) on Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker in the quest for law .	-4.2560
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace versus Sessions litigation filed in August by the American Civil Liberties Union against the Federal Law is not known .	-3.7104
She said that her partner " and his violent sons of gang members " had abused them , but on July 20 , US officials refused to apply for asylum .	-12.2461
She was arrested in Texas .	-0.8741
The federal lawyers supporting Grace described El Salvador , Honduras , and Guatemala , which comprise a large number of asylum seekers in the US , as nations facing profound problems with gangs and domestic violence .	-4.2474
The US ’ s new asylum policy has reversed a 2014 complaint chamber for immigrants that undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence can apply for asylum .	-4.6475
The Minister of Justice of the District of Columbia Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new law ignores decades of national , federal and international law .	-3.2658
The Amicus Curiae states that , according to German law , all asylum applications must be judged according to the circumstances of the respective complaint and that such action violates this principle .	-5.4350
Lawyers continued to argue that the policy that denies immigrants entry is harming the US economy , because it is more likely that these immigrants become entrepreneurs and “ do necessary work . ”	-4.9435
Prosecutor General Jeff Sessions instructed immigration judges in June to stop granting asylum to individuals fleeing domestic or gang power .	-3.9538
“ Asylum is for those who have to leave their homeland for persecution on the grounds of race , religion , nationality or belonging to a particular social group or on the basis of political opinion , ” said Sessions in his statement on the law on June 11 .	-5.4058
Asylum was never intended to alleviate all the problems , even the serious ones that people face every day around the world .	-3.4527

US ambassadors accuse China of “ bullying ” with “ propaganda advertising . ”	-2.3745
A week after an official Chinese newspaper placed a four-page ad in a US daily newspaper on the mutual benefit of US trade in China , the US ambassador to China Beijing suggested using the American press to spread propaganda .	-4.8276
U.S. President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to the China Daily paid supplement in the Des Moines Register , the state with the most sold Iowa newspaper , after accusing China of interfering in the US congressional elections of 6 November , which China denies .	-5.1634
US officials claim to Reuters that Trump ’ s accusation of Beijing trying to interfere in the US election is a new phase in an escalating Washington campaign to put pressure on China .	-3.1700
While it is normal for foreign countries to advertise to promote trade , Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an escalating trade war with several rounds of tariffs on imports .	-3.5767
In an early phase of the trade war , China ’ s retaliation tariffs , according to Chinese and US experts , should hit exporters in US states like Iowa , where many Trump ’ s Republican Party supporters live .	-3.7921
Terry Branstad , an American ambassador to China , and former long-time governor of Iowa , a major exporter of agricultural products to China , said that Beijing had injured American workers , farmers , and businesses .	-3.6604
China , Branstad wrote in an article of opinion in the Des Moines Register on Sunday , “ is now pushing this harassment through propaganda advertisements in our own free press .	-5.3735
“ By spreading propaganda as a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register , China ’ s government is using the valued American tradition of freedom of expression and of the press , ” Branstad wrote .	-4.4374
" By contrast , at the newspaper stand in Beijing ’ s streets , you will find only limited dissenting voices , and you will not see any real opposition from different opinions that the Chinese people might have about China ’ s worrying economic development , given that the media are firmly under the control of the Chinese Communist Party , " he wrote .	-7.0744
He added that " one of China 's most prominent newspapers contradicted the offer to publish , " although he did not say which newspaper .	-3.6060
Republicans gray with the Kavanaugh debacle voters before the midterm election , warn analysts .	-3.4813
Many of the top Republicans defended Brett Kavanaugh , a nominee elected to the Supreme Court , even though he was accused of sexual assaults , and analysts warn that they will see a backlash , especially of women , in the upcoming elections .	-5.1426
Emotions were high , most Republicans have already said that they want to vote for him .	-9.4497
These things cannot be repatriated , said Grant Reeher , Professor of Political Science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University , on Saturday in an article published by The Hill .	-3.0515
Reeher said he doubted that the last-minute support of Jeff Flake ( Republican Member for the State of Arizona ) was sufficient to reconcile angry voters .	-5.4888
“ Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow , nor will they forget it in November , ” said Karine Jean-Pierre , senior consultant and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn on on Friday , as a Washington newspaper reported .	-3.5844
On Friday morning , the protesters sung : “ November is coming ! ” while demonstrating in the corridor of the Senate , when the Republicans who control the Justice Committee decided to continue with Kavanaugh ’ s nomination despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford , reports Mic .	-4.3889
“ Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be immeasurable , ” said Stu Rothenberg , an impartial political analyst , journalists .	-1.5175
“ People say that it is already quite advanced , that is true .	-3.3384
But the figure could be higher , especially among suburban and younger voters , 18-29 , who may not suffer the president , but often do not vote . ”	-4.4432
Even before Ford ’ s public statement , in which she made her accusations of sexual violence against the Supreme Court candidate , analysts noted that a backlash could follow if Republicans pushed the candidacy .	-4.9919
“ This has become a confusing chaos for the GOP , ” said Michael Steele , former Chairman of the Republican National Committee , at the beginning of last week , according to NBC News .	-3.7444
“ It ’ s not just a matter of choosing the committee or the final election , or of putting Kavanaugh on the substitute bank , it ’ s about how the Republicans handled it and how they dealt with it , ” said Guy Cecil , Director of the US Priorities , a group that helps to elect the Democrats , the news channel .	-7.5586
The Americans , however , are divided on what Ford and Kavanaugh have said .	-9.0453
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 % of respondents in Ford definitely or probably believed testimony , while 35 % stated that they definitely or probably believed Kavanaugh .	-4.3447
Moreover , 38 % said that they thought that Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his statement , while only 30 % said the same about Ford .	-3.5686
On the initiative of Flake , the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one other prosecutor , Deborah Ramirez , reported The Guardian .	-10.0804
Ford said last week before the Senate ’ s Justice Committee under oath that Kavanaugh had attacked them at the age of 17 .	-3.3217
Ramirez accuses the nominee for the highest judiciary of having exposed his genitals before her during her studies in Yale in the 1980s .	-5.8568
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning a new Internet to challenge Google and Facebook .	-2.3004
Tim Berners-Lee , the inventor of the Internet , is setting up a startup company to compete with Facebook , Amazon , and Google .	-3.0259
The current project of the technology regulator , Inrupt , is a company that builds on the open source platform “ Solid ” by Berners-Lee .	-3.8504
Solid allows users to determine where their data is stored and which people may have access to what information . .	-9.1611
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company , Berners-Lee joked that the goal of Inrupt was to take over world rule .	-3.7528
“ We must do it now , ” he said about the startup .	-2.0916
“ It is an historic moment . ”	-1.3489
The App uses Solid technology to help users create their own personal online data storage or POD .	-3.8217
Data storage may include contact lists , task lists , calendars , music libraries and other personal or professional tools .	-2.5211
It is like Google Drive , Microsoft Outlook , Slack and Spotify all available on a browser and all at the same time .	-1.8651
The special thing about the personal online data storage is that it is entirely up to the user to access what type of information is possible .	-9.1912
The company calls it “ empowering people through data . ”	-2.1861
According to the CEO of the company John Bruce , Inrupt will provide resources , processes and appropriate know-how in order to make solid accessible to a wide range of users .	-4.1878
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee , Bruce , a security platform acquired by IBM , some employees involved in the project , and a community of voluntary programmers .	-2.8524

Bernard Vann : Victoria Kreuz-Cleric from World War I is honored .	-3.1792
The only priest of the Church of England who received a Victoria Cross during the First World War was celebrated 100 years later in his hometown .	-3.5929
The Lieutenant Colonel and Reverend Bernard Vann earned the award on September 29 , 1918 at the attack in Bellenglise and Lehaucourt .	-4.1496
However , he was killed four days later by a hedge guard and did not know that he had won the highest British military award .	-4.3810
A memorial stone was revealed by his two grandchildren on Saturday at a parade in Rushden , Northamtonshire .	-2.8623
One of his grandchildren , Michael Vann , said that it was “ incredibly symbolic ” that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after the heroism of his grandfather .	-2.5697
According to the London Gazette , Colonel Lieutenant Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin canal in September 1918 , “ with very dense fog and under heavy fire by field protection and machine guns . ”	-10.7570
Later he stormed down to the shot line , leading the line forward with the “ biggest gallery ” before moving a field gun and pushing the pull three times .	-7.6681
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German shooter on October 4 , 1918 – just under a month before the end of the war .	-3.4317
Michael Vann , 72 , said the actions of his grandfather were ' something I know I could never do justice to , something that inspires humility ' .	-3.9314
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also put down a wreath after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band .	-3.7909
Michael Vann said he felt “ very honoured to participate in the parade , ” and added : “ The bravery of a real hero is reflected in the support he receives from many people . ”	-3.8279
MMA fans stayed awake all night to see Bellator 206 , instead getting Peppa Pig .	-2.5024
Imagine you have stayed awake all night to see the whole Bellator 206 event just to avoid seeing the main event .	-4.6169
The plan in San Jose consisted of 13 battles , including six main battles and was shown live at night in Britain on Channel 5 .	-4.3556
At 6 o 'clock in the morning , just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared to confront each other , spectators in the UK were able to watch the coverage switched to Peppa Pig without any .	-7.0894
Some were unimpressed after they wake up until the early hours of the morning , especially for the fight .	-5.2129
A fan on Twitter described the change to the children 's cartoon as " some sick joke " .	-2.9456
" It is a state regulation that at 6 o 'clock in the morning these contents were not suitable , so they had to switch to children 's programs , " said Dave Schwartz , Bellator Senior Vice President of Marketing and Communication , when asked for the transmission .	-4.5880
'Peppa the pig , ' yes . '	-1.3928
Bellator ’ s Managing Director Scott Coker said that in the future they will work on their planning to involve British spectators .	-4.1335
" When I think about the repetition , we will somehow get it , " Cocker said .	-3.5995
" But it is 6 in the morning on a Sunday there and we will only be able to fix it on Sunday of our time , Monday of their time .	-4.2062
But we are working on it .	-1.5537

We tried to repair it , we thought it was a technical error .	-2.0864
But it was not , it was a problem for the government .	-2.7712
I can promise you that it will not happen next time .	-2.3001

Desert Island Discs : Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality .	-2.0505
The Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up with the feeling of being inferior to everyone because of his sexuality - but that gave him the motivation to become a success .	-4.3235
The 24-year-old said that he had only become aware at secondary school that “ not everyone is like me . ”	-4.3093
In the first issue of Desert Island Discs at Radio 4 presented by Lauren Laverne , he said he spoke publicly about the rights of homosexuals to give other “ hope . ”	-3.1078
He also said that a victory in the Olympic Games after the birth of his first child would have become less important .	-3.1814
The regular presenter of the long-running show , Kristy Young , has released several months due to illness .	-3.7544
Daley appeared in Laverne ’ s first program , saying that he felt as an adolescent “ less worth ” than the others , because “ society did not accept standing on men and women . ”	-5.7779
He said , “ To this day , these feelings of less value and difference have given me the strength and strength I needed to succeed . ”	-3.9775
He wanted to prove that he was “ something , ” he said , in order not to disappoint anyone when he was guided by his sexual orientation .	-4.8162
The two-time bronze medal winner has become a top-class LGBT activist , using his appearance at this year ’ s Commonwealth Games in Australia to urge more countries to decriminalize homosexuality .	-3.8484
He said that he was speaking because he was lucky enough to be able to live openly and without consequences , and because he wanted to give others ' hope ' .	-4.6696
The triple world champion said that he fell in love with a man , the US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black , whom he met in 2013 , which he was very surprised about .	-3.7856
Daley married the Oscar winner , who is 20 years older than him , last year , but the age difference was never a problem .	-4.3617
“ When you go through so much in such a young age , ” he first attended the Olympic Games at the age of 14 , and his father died of cancer three years later , according to him , it was hard to find someone at the same age who experienced similar high and low levels .	-6.7080
The couple was parents of a son called Robert Ray Black-Daley in June , and Daley said his " whole perspective " had changed .	-3.4413
“ Last year , everything revolved around me to win a gold medal , ” he said .	-3.1492
“ But you know what , there are more important than Olympic gold .	-2.6551
My gold medal is Robbie . ”	-0.8710
His son bears the name of his father , Robert , who died in 2011 at just 40 years after a cancer diagnosis .	-2.7613
Daley said that his father did not accept that he would die , and one of the last things he asked was whether they had their tickets for London in 2012 - because he wanted to be in the first row .	-3.0823
“ I could not tell him : <unk> You will not experience sitting in the first row , Dad <unk> , ” he said .	-3.9854
“ I held his hand when his breathing stopped , ” he said .	-3.8813
The following year , Daley joined the 2012 Olympic Games and won Bronze .	-2.9408
“ I dreamed of this all my life – to dive into the water in front of the local audience at the Olympic Games – there is no better feeling , ” he said .	-5.0956
This has inspired his first choice of songs – Proud von Heather Small – with this song he has prepared for the Olympic Games and is still doing goose watching .	-6.3434

The Weak Mickelson sat on the Bank ’ s Ryder Cup Saturday	-4.3778
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game , but he must dramatically improve his shape so that it does not become a sad milestone .	-4.4371
Mickelson , who played for the 12th time at the event that takes place every two years , was put on the bench by Captain Jim Furyk for the football and Foursomes on Saturday .	-10.7311
Rather than being at the heart of what happened , as is so often the case for the US , the five-time Major winner shared his day between guys and rounds of practice on the golf course , hoping to overcome his depth .	-7.0060
The 48-year-old is never the most straightforward driver , even at the height of his career , and is not suitable for the narrow Le Golf National Square , where the long rough regularly punishes failures .	-4.5930
And as if the place alone was not challenging enough , Mickelson meets the British Open Champion Francesco Molinari in the ninth match on Sunday , known for his precise shot , who won all four matches this week together with Neuling Tommy Fleetwood .	-6.1706
If Americans have four points behind and a hot start when starting the 12 single games , Mickelson ’ s match could be absolutely crucial .	-10.5695
Furyk expressed his trust in his husband ; what was left to him .	-4.2645
" He fully understood the role he had today , gave me a clap on my back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow , " said Furyk .	-4.1770
“ He has a lot of self-confidence .	-1.9133
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has done so much in the past for these teams , and this week .	-2.2539
I probably didn 't think he would play two games .	-3.2506
I wished to see more , but that is the way we had to deal with it .	-6.1021
He wants to be out there , just like everyone else .	-2.0802
Until now , Nick Faldo will record the most played matches at the Ryder Cup , which will break Mickelson on Sunday .	-5.0843
This could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career , which has never fully matched the heights of its individual .	-3.4682
Mickelson won 18 times , lost 20 times and played seven times tied , but Furyk said that his presence would have been invaluable for the team .	-4.9150
" He is funny , he is sarcastic , funny , he loves to entertain people , and he is a great guy he can have in the team room , " he said .	-3.0345
I think that the younger players had fun measuring with him this week , which was nice to look at . ”	-5.0413
It offers much more than just the game . ”	-1.4298
The European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great leap forward can disappear soon .	-3.4830
Thomas Bjorn , the European captain , knows from experience that a great lead in the last day 's individual games can quickly become an uncomfortable ride at the Ryder Cup .	-4.9347
In 1997 , the Dane debuted in Valderrama , where a team trained by Seve Ballesteros had five points ahead of the Americans , but only just over the finish line and won $ 14 to $ 13 with a thin margin .	-6.7220
" We remember that we were in the lead in Valderrama ; we had a great lead in Brookline , where we lost , and in Valderrama we won , but only scarcely , " said Bjorn , after watching the Class of 2018 , now leading with 10-6 in the Le Golf National , Friday and yesterday at a 5-3 victory .	-6.7575
History will show me and everyone in this team that it is not yet over .	-3.0458
You will be absolutely bored tomorrow .	-2.5532
Go out and do the right things .	-1.7786
It is only over when the points are displayed on the board .	-3.5568
Our goal is to win this cup and we focus on it .	-3.3012
I have always said that I firmly believe in the 12 players in our team , but we are dealing with a strong opponent , the best players in the world . ”	-3.0179
Enthusiastic as his players played on a hard golf course , Björn added : " I would never be too fast .	-4.9745
Tomorrow is another day .	-1.5892
Tomorrow come the personal appearances , and that is another matter .	-2.5490
It ’ s great to be out there with a partner when things go well , but if you ’ re out there alone , you ’ ll test your skills as a golfer .	-6.3980
This is the message you have to convey to the players : to get the best out of you tomorrow .	-4.6818
Now you are handing over to your partner and he has to make full use just like you . ”	-5.3028
Unlike Björn , the opponent Jim Furyk will strive to make his players perform individually better than they do as partners , except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas , who have scored three out of four points .	-5.1409
Furyk himself experienced such a sensational turn on the final day , when he was part of the winning team in Brookline , now he is one of the losers after the European team achieved the “ miracle of Medina . ”	-5.6157
" I remember every damn word , " he said to the question how Ben Crenshaw , the 1999 captain , had gathered his players on his way to the last day .	-3.9849
We have 12 important games tomorrow , but we want to start as soon as possible , as we have seen in Brookline , in Medinah .	-4.5045
Once a dynamic has developed , the pressure on the middle matches is high .	-5.7244
We have built up our composition accordingly and brought the guys out as we felt , you know , we try to create something special tomorrow . ”	-5.3791
Thomas , together with Paul Casey , Justin Rose , Jon Rahm , Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter , should lead the other European in the top rankings against Rory McIlroy .	-3.8097
I put this group of guys in this order because I think it covers the whole way , " said Bjorn about his individual selection .	-2.7540
Reflecting the timetable for Germany ’ s New War Ship	-4.2576
The German navy ’ s newest frigate should have been put into service as early as 2014 to replace warships from the Cold War era , but now , according to reports from local media , it will take at least until next year , owing to flawed systems and escalating costs .	-6.3548
The commissioning of the Rhineland-Palatinate , the Baden-Württemberg class ’ s flagship ship , has now been postponed to the first half of 2019 , according to the newspaper “ Die Zeit ” , invoking a military spokesman .	-5.2227
The navy should have put the ships into operation in 2014 , but serious problems after the first delivery burdened the ambitious project . the the . the the the the . the the the . the the the	-9.7568
The four Baden-Württemberg class frigates ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the older Bremen class ships .	-3.3542
It is assumed that they have a powerful cannon , a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles , and some Stealth technologies , such as reduced radar , infrared and acoustic signatures .	-4.8242
Another important advantage is longer maintenance intervals : the newest frigates are to be used for up to two years without entering the home port .	-5.3847
But the state-of-the-art warships that Germany is supposed to allow overseas power projection will already be obsolete if they are finally put into service , as the weekly newspaper “ Die Zeit ” notes .	-5.6646
The unfortunate F125 frigate caused headlines last year , when the German navy officially refused to launch the ship and returned it to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg .	-4.1419
This was the first time that the navy returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery .	-2.7771
Little was known about the reasons for the return of ships ; German media mentioned a series of critical “ software and hardware effects ” that would make the warship useless in combat missions .	-4.5370
Software deficiencies were particularly important because the ships of the Baden-Württemberg class are operated by a crew of around 120 seamen - only half of the crew on older frigates of the Bremen class .	-5.1255
It also turned out that the ship had a significant overweight , which would limit performance and make future upgrades difficult for the navy .	-5.4620
It is believed that the 7,000-ton Rhineland-Palatinate is twice as heavy as ships of the same class used by Germans in World War II .	-3.9280
In addition to faulty hardware , the price tag of the entire project , including the training of the crew , is also discussed .	-5.5684
Instead of the originally estimated EUR 2.2 billion , the cost now seems to have reached the dwindling figure of EUR 3.1 billion ( about $ 3.6 billion ) .	-5.0664
The problems with the newest frigates are particularly important in the light of recent warnings that Germany ’ s maritime power is waning .	-4.9495
Earlier this year , Hans-Peter Bartels , Chairman of the German Parliament ’ s Defence Committee , admitted that the war fleet actually “ runs out of operational ships . ”	-3.7321
The officer said that the problem has grown avalanche over time , as old ships have been abandoned without any replacement .	-5.1800
He complained that none of the Baden-Württemberg frigates were put into service by the navy .	-2.2967
The National Trust belongs to the secret life of bats .	-3.1183
New research on a property in the Scottish Highlands is trying to find out how bats use the landscape for food search .	-4.2125
It is hoped that it will gain new insights into the behaviour of the unique flying mammals , which can guide future measures to protect animals .	-5.0014
The study by scientists of the National Trust for Scotland will follow in common and soprano pipelines , as well as brown long and permanent bats in the Inverewe Gardens in Western Ross .	-4.8466
Special recording devices are placed at the main points of the accommodation to track bat activities throughout the season .	-4.6836
NHS employees and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys with hand detectors .	-2.0573
A professional sound analysis of all recordings determines the frequency of bat calls and assigns the calls to species .	-3.5576
The habitat map and the related report should provide a detailed overview of the behavior .	-4.3877
Rob Dewar , National Trust for Scotland ( NTS ) nature conservation consultant , hopes to find out which areas of the habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by the species .	-11.3037
This information will help determine the benefits of living space management , how to best preserve meadows and the forests for bats and other associated species .	-4.6856
There has been a sharp decline in bat populations in Scotland and the whole of Britain over the past hundred years .	-3.8501
They are threatened by building work that affects their sleeping places and the loss of living space .	-3.8796
Wind power plants and lighting can also pose a risk , as can fly-catcher strips and some chemical treatments of building materials .	-5.5905
The bats are not blind .	-9.2237
Adjusted to their nightly hunting activities , the ears are more useful in the prey catch than the eyes .	-6.7624
They use an elaborate echo location technology to locate errors and obstacles in their flight .	-10.5691
The NTS , which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings , 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country , takes bats very seriously .	-3.1392
There are ten trained experts who regularly conduct surveys , inspect sleeping places , and sometimes also carry out bailouts .	-4.2744
The organization has even set up Scotland ’ s first and only dedicated bat reserve in the thread estate in Dumfries and Galloway , home to eight of the ten Scottish bat species .	-3.9449
According to Manager David Thompson , the property is an ideal habitat for them :	-2.0810
“ Here in Threave we have a great area for bats . ”	-2.6995
“ We have the old buildings , many old trees and all the good habitat .	-2.3881
But there is still much unknown about bats and the work we do here and on other plots helps us to understand better what they need to live . ”	-3.5635
He stresses that it is important to check whether bats are there before maintenance work in buildings , according to which it is possible that , when a single sleeping place is accidentally destroyed , up to 400 females and boys die – a whole local population may be erased .	-7.0729
Bats are protected ; it is forbidden to kill , harass or disturb them and destroy their sleeping places .	-4.0257
Elisabeth Ferrell , Scottish employee of the Bat Conservation Trust , has encouraged the public to help .	-1.8858
She said , “ We still have a lot to learn about our bats , and for many of our species we simply do not know how their populations are . ”	-10.6800
Ronaldo rejects rape claims when lawyers sue the German magazine .	-2.2987
Cristiano Ronaldo has branded rape claims against him as " fake news " and claims that people " want to promote themselves " by using his name .	-3.3023

The storm from Portugal and Juventus was accused of raping an American named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009 .	-2.4875
He was then supposed to have paid $ 375,000 to keep silence on the incident , Der Spiegel reported on Friday .	-11.0382
Hours after the allegations were reported , Ronaldo , 33 in an instagram live video to his 142 million followers rejected the reports as “ fake news . ”	-3.1841

They want to draw attention to themselves when they say my name , but it is part of the job .	-2.0851
I 'm a happy person , and everything is good , ” the player added smiling .	-3.6787
Ronaldo ’ s lawyers are preparing a complaint against the magazine “ Der Spiegel ” because of the claims ; according to Reuters , you spoke of “ inadmissible reporting on suspicions of privacy . ”	-4.8225
Attorney Christian Schertz said that the Player will claim compensation for “ intangible damage equal to the severity of the injury , which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years . ”	-4.6609
The alleged incident was reported to have taken place in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in June 2009 .	-3.1056
According to documents submitted to the District Court of Clark County in the US state of Nevada , Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player ’ s room after meeting them in a nightclub , where he raped them anal .	-5.9084

The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex , but it was consensual .	-1.5792

Brexit : Britain would always regret losing car manufacturers .	-2.5565
“ The UK would regret it in a lifetime if it were to lose its position as the world ’ s leading automaker after Brexit , ” said Economist Greg Clark .	-5.3660
He added that it was ' worrying ' that Toyota UK announced to the BBC that they would temporarily stop production in their Burnaston plant , near Derby , if Great Britain left the EU without a deal .	-13.7811
“ We need an agreement , ” Clark said .	-1.2453
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the effects of border delays in the event of no-deal Brexit could cost jobs .	-3.1675
The plant in Burnaston , which manufactures the Auris and Avensis brands for Toyota , produced nearly 150,000 cars last year , 90 % of which were exported to the rest of the European Union .	-3.1736
“ If the UK leaves the EU at the end of March without an agreement , I believe that production stops in our plant , ” said Marvin Cooke , CEO of Toyota in Burnaston .	-4.2564
Other British car manufacturers have voiced concerns about leaving the EU without agreement on the arrangements for cross-border trade , including Honda , BMW and Jaguar Land Rover .	-3.3272
For example , BMW has already announced that it will close its plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit .	-7.8308
The main concerns relate to what automobile manufacturers say about the supply chain 's risks in the event of a ' no deal Brexit ' .	-3.8857
Toyota ’ s production facilities are based on demand-oriented production , which means that the parts are delivered every 37 minutes by suppliers from the United Kingdom and the EU for special manufactures .	-5.9182
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without an agreement , there may be delays at the border that , according to industry data , may lead to supply shortages and partial shortages .	-4.4048
It would be impossible for Toyota to hold more than a day of stock in his Derbyshire plant , the company said , and so production would be stopped .	-3.4112
Mr Clark said that Theresa May ’ s Chequers plan for future relations with the EU was “ precisely calibrated to avoid these border controls . ”	-2.9284
We have to have a deal , we want the best deal that not only allows us the current success , we want to seize this opportunity , ” he said to the BBC Radio 4 programme today .	-5.4149
“ The indication not only of Toyota , but also of other manufacturers , is that we must be able to continue with what has become a very successful series of supply chains . ”	-3.9626
Toyota did not indicate how long the production stopover could take , but warned that the rise in costs would , in the long term , affect the competitiveness of the plant and eventually lose jobs .	-7.1985
Peter Tsouvallaris , a trade union representative and employed in Burnaston for 24 years , said that the trade union members are increasingly concerned : “ My experience is that once they are dismantled , jobs are lost forever . ”	-5.7809
A government spokesman said : ' We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU ' .	-3.2915
Trump ’ s Rosenstein Meeting could be postponed again , says the White House	-2.7989
Donald Trump ’ s high-calibre meeting with Deputy Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein , General Prosecutor , could “ be postponed another week , ” as the fight for Supreme Chancellor Brett Kavanaugh continues , the White House read on Sunday .	-11.7306
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller , who examines Russian electoral interventions , the links between Trump and Russia , and the possible obstruction of the judiciary by the president .	-4.2552
Whether or not Trump will fire the deputy prosecutor , and thus jeopardize Müller ’ s independence , Washington has been doing a great deal for months .	-5.1611
Earlier this month , the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed wearing a cable to record talks with Trump and make it possible to remove the president from the 25th constitutional addition .	-2.9869
Rosenstein rejected an opinion .	-1.4572
But last Monday he went to the White House , while reports hailed that he was about to resign .	-3.6609
Instead , a meeting with Trump , who was at the United Nations in New York , was announced for Thursday .	-2.7791
Trump said he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein , but then the session was delayed to avoid a collision with the Senate ’ s Committee on Justice , in which Kavanaugh and one of the women , Dr. Christine Blasey Ford , accused him of sexual misconduct .	-4.6576
On Friday , Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of claims against Kavanaugh , and continued to delay a full Senate vote .	-3.4026
Donald Trump ’ s press spokesman , Sarah Sanders , was on Fox News on Sunday .	-3.1241
Asked after the Rosenstein meeting , she said : ' A date has not yet been set , it could be this week , I could see that I am going back another week , given all the other things that are going on with the Supreme Court .	-5.5356
But we will see and I keep the press always up to date . '	-6.6892
Some reporters would contest this claim : Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September .	-10.1595
The guest Chris Wallace asked why .	-0.9230
Sanders said that the lack of briefings was not due to a reluctance towards television reporters who behave like self-actors , but she also said : ' I will not be against them standing in the gallery ' .	-5.6918
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase .	-2.1728
'The President carries out more questions and answers than any president before him ' , she said and added , without giving evidence , ' We have looked at these figures ' .	-5.1283
Briefings will still take place , said Sanders , but the press should have the opportunity to ask the President of the United States questions directly , so it is infinitely better than to talk to her .	-4.8638
We are trying to do a lot of that , and you have seen how we have done it in recent weeks , and it will replace a press conversation if you can speak to the President of the United States itself . ”	-4.7449
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends public meetings or press conferences with attending dignitaries .	-2.3720
Press conferences with one person are rare .	-1.0460
In New York this week , the president perhaps showed why , by making a free-lance and sometimes bizarre appearance before assembled reporters .	-4.9129
Brexit Fears : Letter to EU Workers in the NHS Scotland	-2.5566
The Health Minister has written EU employees in Scotland ’ s NHS to express the country ’ s gratitude and hope that they will remain after Brexit .	-4.6150
Members of the Scottish Parliament , Jane Freeman , wrote their letter less than 6 months before Britain left the EU .	-3.3927

The Treasury expects an additional revenue of up to GBP 120 million per year to go to support homeless people .	-4.2500
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp rate when buying property in the UK - the extra money will be used for homeless , Theresa May announces today .	-3.8995
This move is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn ’ s effort to attract young voters with promises to offer more affordable housing and aspire to high incomes .	-3.8585
The stamp fee is levied on people and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK , and the extra money will help the government fight homelessness .	-4.2827
The surcharge - which is levied in addition to the current stamp tax , including the higher rates for second flats and rentals introduced two years ago - could be up to three percent .	-4.8563
The Ministry of Finance expects an additional revenue of <unk> 120 million per year .	-2.9968
Approximately 13 % of the new buildings in London are purchased by buyers who do not live in the UK , driving up prices , making it difficult for first-time buyers to buy a property .	-5.1257
Numerous prosperous regions of the country , especially the capital , have become “ ghost cities , ” as many foreign buyers spend most of their time outside the country .	-3.6418
The new policy comes only a few weeks after Boris Johnson had asked for a stamp tax section to help more young people to have their first home .	-3.9132
He accused large construction companies of keeping home prices high by buying land cheaply , but not building it , and also called on Mrs May to abolish quotas for affordable housing in order to put an end to the housing shortages in Britain .	-6.4787
Mr Corbyn has announced a concise set of proposed housing reforms , including rental controls and ending indebtedness clearance .	-4.3560
It also wants to give the Councils more powers to build new houses .	-2.4346
Mrs May said , ‘ Last year I said that I devoted my premiere to the resurgence of the British dream – life should be better for every new generation .	-4.4251
And that means putting our broken housing market in order .	-2.2717
Britain will always be open to people who live , work , and want to build a life .	-2.4077
It cannot be right , however , that it is as easy for foreign companies and people who do not live in the UK to buy homes as it is for hard-working British citizens .	-4.1919

“ I wanted to play as a player for my country . ”	-2.2649
I got a B-cap and that 's it , " said Ross to BBC Scotland 's sportsound .	-3.2618
" But I have often watched Scotland in Hampden with my father as a child , and it is always something that brought me back .	-2.6920
" This opportunity would come only if I succeed in club management . "	-4.3471

The former manager of Alloa Athletic says that he was not afraid to go into the footsteps of these established managers in such a large club .	-9.3505
" The success for me is currently defined by the question " Can I bring this club back to the Premier League ? "	-2.9094
With its structure and facilities , this club undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League , ” he said .	-2.7724
" Creating it there is no easy task , but I would probably only see myself successful if I could bring the club back there . "	-4.6318
Ross is only three years in his management career , after a time as co-trainer at Dumbarton and a 15-month spell for Hearts ' coaching staff .	-3.2182
He then helped Alloa to recover from the relationship to the third class , and gave St. Mirren the edge of the relationship to the master title in the following season .	-5.3502
Ross also says that during his career at Clyde , Hartlepool , Falkirk , St Mirren , and Hamilton Academic he never felt as comfortable as he is now .	-4.0968
" It was probably a real crossroads , " he remembered when he took over the direction of Alloa .	-2.6658
" I really thought that the position as manager is the right thing for me , more than that of a player .	-3.5079

The summer heat wave has increased revenue for the busy British pubs , but has increased pressure on restaurant chains .	-3.6250
Pub and bar groups experienced an increase in sales of 2.7 percent in July - but revenues in restaurants decreased 4.8 percent , according to the figures .	-16.6831
Peter Martin , of the CGA management consultancy , who compiled the figures , said : " Continued sunshine and England longer than expected continued participation in the World Cup resulted in July following a similar pattern as in the previous month of June , when the pub search rose by 2.8 % , only that the restaurants were even more affected .	-7.1573
The 1.8 % drop in the gastronomy business in June only intensified in July .	-3.6465
Pubs and bars dominated by beverages were by far the strongest , with the Like-for Like numbers rising more than the restaurants fell .	-5.7652
The food dominated pubs also suffered from the sun , albeit not as dramatically as the restaurant operators .	-3.7720
It seems that people just wanted to go out for a drink .	-3.4377
In managed pubs and bars , sales for beverages rose by 6.6 % this month , while food fell by 3 % . "	-10.9672
Paul Newman , an RSM analyst for leisure and hospitality , said : " These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April .	-3.1461
Weather and the impact of social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the out-of-home market .	-4.4779
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to be under pressure , although a 4.8 % decline in sales compared to the previous year will be particularly painful alongside the ongoing cost pressure .	-5.6796
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food operators , and the time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will provide the much-needed break .	-4.2519
Overall , sales growth in pubs and restaurants , including new openings , was 2.7 % in July , reflecting the slow introduction of new brands .	-2.8639

Milk pump advertising , which compares mothers with cows , led to controversial online discussions .	-2.7608
A dairy pump company has provoked controversial online discussions , owing to an advertisement that compares breastfeeding mothers with milking cows .	-4.8101
On the occasion of the launch of the supposedly " world first silent and portable milk pump " , the consumer tech company Elvie published an ironic advertising inspired by music videos to show what freedoms mothers are offered with this new pump .	-4.7866
Four real mothers dance in a haystack in the midst of cows to a number with the following lyrics : ' Yes , I melt , but you see no tail ' and ' If you have not noticed that there are no people , they are my breasts ' .	-6.4917
The slogan goes on : ' Pump off , pump off , I feed the babies , pump off , pump off , pump off , I melt my ladies ' .	-2.4976
However , the display published on the Facebook page of the company has caused controversy online .	-3.7514
With 77,000 calls and hundreds of comments , the video has received mixed responses from the spectators , many of whom say that it illuminates the " horrors " of the dairy industry .	-3.3907
'It is a very bad decision to advertise cows for this product ' .	-2.1529
Like us , they too must become pregnant and bear to produce milk , except that their babies are taken away within a few days after birth , " a person wrote .	-8.5439
The Elvie milk pump fits inconspicuously into a silent bra ( elvie / mother ) .	-3.9513
Another commented : " Understandably traumatic for mother and baby .	-1.6289
But yes , why should we not advertise with them for a milk pump for mothers who can keep their babies ?	-3.1519
Someone else added : ' Such an outsider acquisition ' .	-3.6232
Others defended advertising , including a woman who confessed that she found the song “ original ” .	-3.4826
I think that is a great idea .	-1.4415
I would have received one if I had stayed there .	-4.1519
By pumping I felt just like a cow .	-3.6811
The ad is a bit crazy , but I took it as what it was .	-2.1180
This is a brilliant product , " wrote a person .	-2.6855
Another commented : ' This is a funny advertising for mothers who pump ( often in their workplaces or toilets ) and feel like ' cows ' .	-4.1005
This is not advertising that praises or judges the dairy industry ' .	-3.1675
At the end of the video , the group of women reveals that they all danced with the decent pumps in their bras .	-2.5976
The campaign ’ s concept is based on the realization that many women pumping milk say they feel like cows .	-2.7686
The Elvie Pump , however , is completely silent , has no wires or hoses and fits continuously into a silent bra , giving women the freedom to move , keep their babies and even go out of the pump .	-5.5777
Ana Balarin , partner and ECD at Mother commented : " The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that deserves a courageous and provocative launch .	-3.5401
By drawing a parallel between the expression of women and dairy cows , we wanted to focus on the breast pump and all its challenges , while at the same time demonstrating in an entertaining and comparable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring .	-4.4131
This is not the first time that the Elvie pump has entered the headlines .	-2.6318

Hundreds of immigrant children quietly moved to a camp on the Texan border .	-3.5884
The number of immigrant children in prison rose , though monthly border crossings remained relatively unchanged , partly because the Trump administration ’ s hard rhetoric and policies made it harder to find sponsors for children .	-4.2778
Traditionally , most sponsors themselves have been undocumented immigrants and fear that they risk being expelled from the country when they are campaigning for a child .	-4.2113
The risk increased in June , when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to fingerprint and that the data would be passed on to the immigration authorities .	-3.5790
Last week , Matthew Albence , a senior official within the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Authority , testified to Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to support unaccompanied minors .	-9.3667
The Agency later confirmed that 70 % of those arrested had no previous criminal records .	-2.8493
" Almost 80 percent of people who are sponsors or household members of sponsors are illegal here in the country , and a large proportion of them are criminal aliens .	-3.9078
" We are pursuing these people , " said Albence .	-3.5123
In an effort to process children 's applications more quickly , officials introduced new rules that some of them require to appear in court within a month of detention , and not after 60 days , which was the previous standard , the accommodation staff said .	-7.0031
Many will not appear personally , but via video telephone conferences to appeal to an immigration judge for legal status .	-4.4620
Those who are not eligible for discharge are quickly deported .	-2.9692
The longer children remain in prison , the more likely they are to be fearful or depressed , leading to violent outbreaks or escape attempts .	-3.8072
Advocates have said that these concerns are intensified in a larger body , such as Tornillo , where there are signs that a child is struggling because of their size .	-5.4271
They added that moving children to the tent city without enough time to prepare them emotionally or to leave friends could worsen a trauma that many are already struggling with .	-5.4437
Syria calls on US , French , and Turkish “ occupying forces ” to withdraw immediately .	-1.9488
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home before the UN General Assembly , even though the war in the country has been going on for eight years now .	-3.4469
Moualem , who is also Deputy Prime Minister , said that foreign forces are illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of combating terrorism , and “ they will deal with it accordingly . ”	-3.8058
“ They must immediately withdraw unconditionally , ” he said to the Assembly .	-2.8159
Moualem asserted that the “ war on terror is almost over in Syria , ” with more than 360,000 people dying in the country since 2011 , millions more being driven out of their homes .	-5.5067
He said that Damascus would continue to fight “ this sacred battle until we have all Syrian territories ” liberated from both terrorist groups and “ any illegal foreign presence . ”	-4.0245
The US has around 2,000 troops in Syria , mainly training and advising both Kurdish armed forces and Syrian Arabs , who are in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad .	-3.9547
France has more than 1,000 ground soldiers in the war-torn country .	-3.0155
On the question of refugees , Moualem said that the conditions for returning were right , and he accused “ some Western countries of stoking irrational fears , ” which led refugees to stay away .	-4.9132
“ We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate their return , ” says Moualem .	-2.8459
“ They politicize a purely humanitarian issue . ”	-1.7514
The US and the European Union drew attention to the fact that there could only be reconstruction aid for Syria when there was a political agreement between Assad and the opposition on an end to the war .	-4.2781
UN diplomats said that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last major Idlib rebellion created the opportunity to advance political talks .	-5.1257
The Russian-Turkish deal prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian troops on the province where three million people live .	-2.5689
Moualem , however , emphasized that the agreement provides for “ clear deadlines , ” hoping that military action will be directed against jihadists , including fighters from the Nusra Front , which is linked to al-Qaeda , “ erased . ”	-6.6672
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes soon to convene the first meetings of a new committee of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections .	-3.1840
Moualem called conditions for the Syrian government ’ s participation in the committee : he said that the committee ’ s work should be limited to “ reviewing the articles of the current constitution , ” and warned against interference .	-3.9156

It is not surprising that Pennsylvania ’ s 17 experience of a flood of cash , thanks to a reorientation of a congress district that two incumbents achieved in a race around the same seat .	-4.7093
For this new district in Pittsburg , the Democrat Conor Lamb – who won a special election last spring in another district .	-4.9997
Lamb opposes another incumbent , Republican Keith Rothfus , who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania , which clearly overlaps with the new 17th district .	-4.2070
The cards were re-mixed after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally manipulated according to the Republicans .	-3.9412
The race in the new seventeenth century triggered a campaign financing exchange between the major party finance groups , the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee ( DCCC ) and the National Republican Campaign Committee ( NRCC ) .	-4.2696
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after winning special elections in Pennsylvania in March for the 18th congress district in Pennsylvania with great victory .	-3.4390

But sanctions were only considered against El Salvador , which received an estimated $ 140 million in American aid in 2017 , including stunning controls , development , and economic support .	-3.6400

Paul Rowlett , analyst at the US Department of Justice , has spent several hours as an expert in the field of information evaluation .	-3.9638
He outlined for the jury how he compiled the movements of the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chamber on the night of their death using mobile phone records .	-4.0819
Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was on the evening of her death with Chambers , which contradicted his earlier claims , reported The Clarion Ledger .	-4.3023
The analysis of data on Chambers mobile phones revealed that he was in the company of his friend Michael Sanford , and Sanford was interrogated by the police .	-5.0749
Sanford said on Saturday that he was not in the city on that day .	-3.1940
When asked by prosecutors whether Tellis had spent the night in Sanford ’ s truck , he replied that he had lied because his truck was in Nashville at that time .	-4.5323
Another contradiction was that Tellis said he knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died .	-2.1113
According to mobile phone recordings , they only knew each other for a week .	-3.9609
Rowlett said that after Chambers ’ death Tellis deleted text messages , call and contact information from his phone .	-2.9301

New York Children 's Girls sue couples because they were terminated according to " racist " text .	-5.4050
A New Yorker girl sues a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a letter not intended to her from the mother complaining that she is " another black person " .	-5.5427
The couple denies that they are racist and considers the case to be ' blackmail ' .	-3.8183
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman , a mother of two children , was dismayed when she discovered that her new childcare , Giselle Maurice , was black when she took her first day in 2016 .	-3.9920
Ms. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a short announcement : " Neiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiin NOCH A SCHWARZH<unk>UTIGE PERSON " .	-4.0972
Instead of sending him to her husband , she sent him twice to Mrs Maurice .	-1.8771
After noticing her patzer , a " uncomfortable " plasco flaxman dismissed Mrs Maurice and declared that her outgoing child girl , who was Afro-American , had done a bad job and that she wanted to hire a filipino instead , according to the New York Post .	-6.4414
Mrs Maurice was paid for her work on one day and then sent home for one Uber .	-3.8048
Now Maurice sues the couple for compensation for the redundancy and demands compensation of $ 350 per day for the six-month full-time employment for which it was originally hired , albeit without a contract .	-5.0660
" I want to show them , look at them , what do you not do , " she said to the post on Friday and added : " I know that discrimination is discrimination . "	-5.4766
The couple oppose the allegations and said that the decision to end Maurice 's working relationship was reasonable and that they acted for fear because they could not trust her after she insulted her .	-6.4372
" My wife had sent her something she didn 't want to say .	-2.5075
It is not racist .	-0.5611
“ We are not racists , ” she told her husband Joel Plasco the post .	-2.6395
" Would you entrust your children to someone you have offended , if only by mistake ?	-9.2422
Your newborn baby ?	-1.3253
Hardly . ”	-1.5327
Plasco said that his wife was pregnant in the seventh month , not in the best constitution , and called the complaint “ blackmail . ”	-3.4922
'You want to attack someone ? '	-2.2020
This is not a very nice thing , the investment banker added .	-2.3637
While the litigation continues , the public quickly condemned the couple in the social media and attacked them for their behavior and mindset .	-3.8049
Paddington publishers feared that readers could not identify with a talking bear , revealing a new letter .	-2.1333
Bond ’ s daughter Karen Jankel , born shortly after the adoption of the book , said about the letter : It is difficult to get someone to read it for the first time before publication .	-3.6464
“ It ’ s very fun – now that we know about Paddington ’ s great success . ”	-8.7311
She said that her father , who had previously worked as a BBC cameraman , and then was inspired to write a children ’ s book by a small toy bear , would have remained optimistic if his work had been rejected , adding that the 60th anniversary of the book publication after his death last year was “ bittersweet . ”	-4.6151
As for Paddington , whom she calls a “ very important family member , ” she says that her father was still proud of his ultimate success .	-4.3916
" He was a pretty quiet man , and he was not a Bosch person , " she said .	-2.9875
" But because Paddington was so real for him , it was almost as if one had a child that achieved something : you are proud of the child , although it is not really your act .	-5.2275
I think he saw Paddington 's success a little like that .	-2.4315
Although it was his creation and imagination , he always paid tribute to Paddington himself . ”	-3.4971
My daughter died and I had to leave on the phone .	-1.8256
When she landed , her daughter was brought to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice , where doctors tried in vain to save her life .	-3.4615
" Nad called regularly to say that it was really bad that she probably did not manage , " said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse .	-4.1333
Then I got the call from Nad , in which she said she would die in the next two minutes , and I had to say goodbye to her .	-3.0944
And I did .	-0.8895
I said : " Tashi , I love you so much , treasure .	-1.4139
I will be with you soon .	-1.5072
I will be with you . ”	-0.7871
The medicine that the doctors had given her to keep pumping her heart slowly dropped and left her body .	-5.1497
She had died some time before and that brought everything to a standstill .	-3.9203
I just had to sit there and wait , knowing what happened .	-2.3094
I could not howl or cry because I was surrounded by families and other people .	-2.7052
I really had to tear myself together .	-1.8690
Finally , Mrs Ednan-Laperouse , saddened by the loss of her daughter , went on board the aircraft with the other passengers , who knew nothing of the torment she was experiencing .	-5.6097
“ Nobody knew anything , ” she said .	-1.6621
" I had lowered my head , and tears fell all the time .	-2.9384
It is difficult to explain , but during the flight I felt overwhelming pity for Nad .	-2.3551
He needed my love and understanding .	-1.3666
I knew how much he loved it . ”	-1.4989
Mourning Women Making Postcards to Prevent Suicide on Bridge	-3.3748
Two women who have lost a beloved person by suicide want to prevent others from taking their lives .	-3.0382
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys posted maps on a Welsh bridge with inspiring news and telephone numbers that people can call if you need support .	-10.0364
Mrs. Davis son Tyler was 13 years old when he suffered from depression , and at the age of 18 he surrendered .	-4.9530
“ I want no parent to feel as I do every day , ” she said .	-2.5953
Mrs. Davis , 45 years old and from Lydney , described her son as a promising cook with contagious smile .	-8.5671
" He was known for his smile .	-1.4613
Everyone always said that his smile illuminated every room . ”	-2.2440
But he had abandoned his job before his death because he was “ very bad psychically . ”	-4.6676
In 2014 , Tyler , who was then eleven years old , found his brother after taking his life .	-2.6748
Mrs Davis said , ‘ I am constantly worried that this could have a domino effect ’ .	-2.9222
Mrs Davis made the cards ‘ to let people know that there is someone they can talk to , even if it is only a friend ’ .	-4.4605
Sit not quietly around - you have to talk . '	-4.2982
Mrs Humphreys , who has been friends with Mrs Davies for years , has lost her partner , Mark , with whom she was 15 years old , a short time before that died .	-6.5289
“ He did not tell me that he feels bad or depressed or so , ” she said .	-7.1975
“ A few days before Christmas , we noticed a change with him .	-7.3826
He destroyed on Christmas day on the ground - when the children opened their gifts he had not made eye contact with them or anything else . '	-4.6375
She said that his death was a great trauma for her and that she had to do a mourning job now .	-6.2383
We are divided .	-3.2570

FBI investigations have begun , and Brett Kavanaugh ’ s future is at stake .	-2.1178
“ I thought that if we could actually get something like what he asked for - an inquiry that is limited in time and scope - we could perhaps reach some agreement , ” Mr Flake said on Saturday and added that he feared that the committee would “ disintegrate in the midst of a deep-rooted party political blockade . ”	-6.6837
Why did Mr Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to be determined ?	-2.2259
Their restraint is simply due to the timing .	-2.2563
Until the midterm elections , there are only five weeks , on 6 November – if Republicans do badly , as expected , they will be weakened in trying to move forward the man who wants to be elected to the country ’ s highest court .	-7.4014
George W. Bush called with senators to persuade them to support Mr Kavanaugh , who worked for Mr Bush in the White House and met his wife Ashley , who was the personal secretary of Mr Bush .	-9.8365
What happens after the release of the FBI report ?	-1.8581
The Senate , which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats , will vote .	-1.7665
It is still unclear whether Brett Kavanaugh can win at least 50 Senate votes , with Vice MiPenand Kavanaugh ’ s Supreme Court seat .	-5.2906
The Number of Republicans from North Korea Failed under Kim	-3.3430
The number of North Korean overrunners has fallen to South Korea since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago , a South Korean MEP said .	-3.4501
On the basis of data from the South Department of Construction , Park Byeong-seug stated that last year there were 1.127 of fiduciary breaks , compared to 2.706 in 2011 .	-6.4101
Park said that tighter border controls between North Korea and China and an increase in the prices of human traffickers play a major role in this .	-4.0692
Pyongyang did not speak in public .	-2.3246
After all , the majority of North Korea ’ s poultry will gain South Korean citizenship .	-4.4475
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953 .	-1.8373
Most flee over China , which has the longest border with North Korea , which is easier to cross than the strictly guarded demilitarized zone between North and South Korea .	-2.7163
China considers the excesses to be illegal migrants , not refugees , and often forcibly brings them back .	-4.4806
Relations between the North and the South , which are still formally at war , have improved significantly in recent months .	-3.3729
Earlier this month , the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the deadlocked negotiations on denuclearization .	-3.1594
This happened after the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June , when they largely agreed on the Korean Peninsula ’ s nuclear-free .	-3.3289
But on Saturday , North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the US for the lack of progress since then .	-2.3966
“ Without confidence in the US , our national security is at stake , and in these circumstances we cannot unilaterally disarm ourselves in the first step , ” said Ri in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York .	-4.8126
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh hysterical and says that he was unsuitable for the Supreme Court service .	-3.8225
The leader of the Democratic minority group , Nancy Pelosi , called Brett Kavanaugh , the candidate for a Supreme Court seat “ hysterically , ” saying that he was temporarily unfit to serve the Supreme Court .	-4.0163
Pelosi made the comments on an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin , Texas .	-1.4482
“ I could not but think that if a woman had ever behaved like this , she would have called it “ hysterical , ” Pelosi said about her response to Kavanaugh ’ s statement to the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday .	-4.5242
Kavanaugh denied the allegations that he had sexually attacked Dr. Christine Blasey Ford , when they were both teenagers .	-13.8042
During his opening speech , Kavanaugh was very emotional , sometimes he almost screamed and fought with the tears when he talked about his family and high school years .	-3.9656
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in committee , calling the accusations against him a “ grotesque and coordinated campaign of murder , ” organized by liberals angry that Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election .	-4.5721
Pelosi said that she believed that Kavanaugh ’ s claim that he could not serve before the Supreme Court , as he showed that he was biased against Democrats .	-3.9045
“ I believe that he himself disqualifies with such statements and the way he can be influenced by the Clintons and Democrats , ” she said .	-3.7248
When asked whether , if it were confirmed and a democratic majority in the House of Representatives , it would seek an office theft against Kavanaugh , Pelosi hesitated .	-4.8946
“ I want to say the following : if he says the truth neither to Congress nor the FBI , he is not only unsuitable for the Supreme Court service , but also for the service at the court where he is currently employed , ” Pelosi said .	-6.1807
Kavanaugh is currently District Judge in D.C. Court of Appeal .	-2.9635
Pelosi added that as a democrat she was concerned about possible Kavanaugh judgments against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade , because he stands for conservative justice .	-3.1625
In his confirmation hearings , Kavanaugh has avoided the question of whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions .	-4.3759
“ It is not time for a hysterical , biased person to go to court and expect us to say , “ Is that not wonderful , ” Pelosi said .	-3.7945
And women must withstand it .	-2.7648
It is a real rhetoric , months and years full of anger , and it cannot escape without crying .	-4.9308
" We cry when we become angry , " said Mrs Steinem 45 years later to me .	-2.4990
'I do not think this is unusual , or ? '	-2.4882
She continued : “ I once helped a woman , in the executive , who told me that she also wept when she was angry , but she developed a technique in which she began to cry every time she became angry and angry , to the person she spoke to , said : “ They like me to think I am sad because I cry .	-6.9980
I am angry . '	-1.5648
And then she just continued .	-2.5144
And I thought it was brilliant . ”	-1.5387
Tears are allowed as a valve for anger because they are basically misunderstood .	-3.2307
One of my strongest memories of an early job in an office dominated by men , where I once wept with indescribable anger , was that I was packed at my neck by an older woman , an eager manager before whom I was always somewhat scared - who dragged me into a staircase .	-5.4755
" Never let them see you cry , " she told me .	-2.9309
" They do not know that you are angry .	-1.9363
They think that you are sad and will rejoice because they have caught you . '	-3.2044
Patricia Schroeder , then a Democratic Colorado Congressman , supported Gary Hart in his presidential election campaigns .	-2.4234
In 1987 , when it became known that Mr. Hart had an extramarital affair on board a boat called “ Monkey Business , ” he was out of the race , and Ms. Schroeder , deeply frustrated , thought that there was no reason why she should not run as president .	-4.6178
“ It was not a well-thought-out decision , ” she told me with a laugh 30 years later .	-2.6824
" There were already seven more candidates in the race , and the last thing they needed was another .	-2.5010
Someone called it ' Snow White and the Seven Dwarves ' . . . . . . , , , , , , , , ,	-8.6477
Because the campaign was already underway for a long time , it was lagging behind in raising funds , and so she swore that she would not participate in the race unless she collected $ 2 million .	-6.1597
It was a lost battle .	-1.0909
She noted that some of her followers , who gave $ 1,000 to men , would give her only $ 250 .	-3.1882
“ Think that I get predators ? ” she wondered .	-4.5426
When she gave her speech and announced that she would not launch a formal campaign , she was so overwhelmed by emotions - gratitude for the people they had supported , frustration about the system that made it so difficult to collect money and address voters rather than delegates , and anger about sexism - that it was stifled .	-4.8775
“ One might think I have a nervous collapse , ” Schroeder recalls how the press responded to it .	-3.4682
" It was thought that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor .	-2.8040
I remember thinking about what they would write on my gravestone .	-1.7943

How the Trade War between China and the US could benefit Beijing	-3.3080
The opening salves of the US-China trade war were deafening , and an end to the disputes is not in sight . A gap between the two countries can be beneficial to Beijing in the long term , experts say .	-5.0871
US President Donald Trump launched the first warning earlier this year by taxing important Chinese exports , such as solar panels , steel , and aluminium .	-3.1528
The introduction of new tariffs on US-imported Chinese products worth $ 200 billion ( GBP 150 billion ) this week has led to a dramatic escalation of the situation .	-2.7413
Beijing has revanched itself every time in the form of factual services , most recently raising tariffs from five to ten percent to US goods worth $ 60 billion .	-6.0970
China responds to every US blow with a backlash , and it is unlikely that the world ’ s second largest economy will yield in the near future .	-3.6703
Putting Washington down means giving in to demands , but bowing publicly to the United States would be far too embarrassing for Xi Jinping , China ’ s president .	-5.4862
But if Beijing uses its opportunities properly , the trade war with the US can have a positive long-term impact on China by reducing the two economies ’ interdependence , experts say .	-4.4584
“ The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing can create the conditions for economic turbulence in one of the two countries is much more dangerous than observers previously assumed , ” said Abigail Grace , a scientific employee at the Center for New American Security , a think tank focusing on Asia .	-3.9553

Now all the conditions are in place for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that they had to rely on because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods .	-4.5045
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011 .	-2.0577
A further six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid .	-2.5977
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would welcome aid in rebuilding the devastated country .	-2.1893
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional support or assistance from countries that have financed the insurgency .	-3.0280
