Gutach : More safety for pedestrians	-2.5185
You are not 100 meters away from each other : on Tuesday the new B 33 pedestrian light at the village parking lot was put into operation in Gutach - within sight of the older town hall light .	-6.7360
Two installations so close to each other : intent or civil strike ?	-5.1747
The Mayor of Gutach answered this question clearly yesterday .	-3.3030
" The city hall pile was installed at the time because it secures the school path , " Eckert explained yesterday .	-4.8979
The Kluser traffic lights are safe for cyclists as well as bus passengers and mountain residents .	-4.4933
The facility that was officially operational yesterday was important for the intersection Sulzbachweg / Kirchstra<unk>e .	-8.6834
We have the museum , two churches , the spa park , the bus stop , a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area <unk> Grub <unk>. .	-9.2497
" With the high traffic and pedestrian volume , a further traffic light had to be provided for their safety , " says Eckert .	-6.1687
Peter Arnold of the Provincial Council of Offenburg confirms this .	-3.7716
" According to current measurements , approximately 12 000 vehicles pass through the municipality of Gutach on the B 33 daily , about 10 percent of which are heavy goods traffic , " says Arnold .	-5.9290
Therefore , building another traffic light is more than necessary : " Safety simply goes ahead " , says Arnold .	-5.2190
In total , four traffic shows had been carried out , a roundabout was also planned , but because of the narrowness in the Sulzbachweg / Kirchstra<unk>e intersection again rejected .	-7.3645
According to Arnold , everything was tested in the selection of traffic lights : " By means of a transporter loaded especially for us with particularly long trunks , we have tested whether these vehicles can leave the Sulzbach path to the B 33 without knitting the traffic lights " .	-9.0193
Arnold explains that the traffic light system itself costs around EUR 15 000 is " the the most modern on the " . the . , , , , the the . , the the , the , , the the .	-14.7515
The system is equipped with coloured LEDs that shine so strongly that the lights can be easily recognized by the drivers , for example , even when the sun is deep .	-7.7915
And economically it is also : the older lighting systems consume about 100 watts , the new barely eight watts .	-10.0076
There are three lighting systems per direction .	-2.1916
Arnold explained the technology of the new plant : it is equipped with two radar sensors .	-2.7122
If the pedestrian presses the traffic light button , the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation .	-3.5900
If the road is free , comes directly green for the pedestrian , if not , it takes about 15 seconds .	-2.9618
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase for the pedestrian can be terminated .	-3.0003
" If a group or handicapped people go out of the road , the green phase will be extended , so everyone will be safe on the road , " said Arnold .	-6.4899
Of course , the driver should think about this as a partner and observe the road .	-4.8673
This was not the case yesterday : hardly did the traffic lights show green for pedestrians , smoked a top class vehicle - with bright red .	-5.3194
Josef Winkler has been writing his childhood and youth from the soul for more than 30 years .	-3.1408
The Carinthian poet has often described the catastrophes of his Catholic childhood - the lack of language , the propensity to rough violence and blunt sexuality .	-6.4805
The Büchner Prize winner is known primarily as a prose author , theatre texts are rare in his work .	-5.3337
For his performance " Wetterluchten auf der Züngenspitze " ( Wetterluchten auf der Zungenspitze ) , which can now be seen in Garage X at Petersplatz , Collage is therefore composed of prose texts .	-6.6676
The theatre maker , for example , combines elements from the autobiographically influenced novel " Der Leibeigene " ( 1987 ) with prosaminiaturen from " Leichnam , seiner Familie beauernd " ( 2003 ) .	-5.9917
On the largely empty stage - an important requirement : a crushed sofa on which allegedly is copulated and masturbated - the eight-person ensemble hangs through the text material .	-5.7604
Director Fresacher seems to have little confidence in the text .	-2.4965
The 70-minute performance brightens the template with a wealth of directions , known from the repertoire of post-dramatic forms .	-5.9395
Especially the actresses get involved in the sometimes somewhat questionable scenic transpositi. the . the , , , , , , , , , , ,	-8.7659
They are tough attached , dipped with the head under water , with their evening drops caught to the wall .	-5.8317
Forced in cellophane or tenants , they stack on dangerously high sticks by the staging , either monologize them loudly or lie completely silent on the stage floor .	-5.7435
However , the text is hardly conceived in this exhaustive way .	-4.6936
The best moments are the evening when sung - the bandwidth ranges from Deep Purple to popular songs .	-4.7404
It is only by the end that the overturned performance comes to rest , and Winkler ’ s seemingly absurd humor blows up .	-6.4578
A Blackbox in the Car ?	-4.5835
American road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the declining highway system , and believe that they have found the solution in a small black box that can be found in the dashboard of each car .	-5.7321
The devices that record every kilometre drive and report the information to the authorities are at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and the state planning offices to revise the outdated system for financing US roads .	-11.3161
The normally rather boring area of road planning suddenly sparked an intense debate with colourful alliances .	-3.4997
Libertarians have allied themselves with environmental groups , arguing that the government can use the small boxes to record the kilometres – and possibly where they were driven – and then use the information to calculate tax modes .	-6.1077
The Tea Party is horrified .	-0.9798
The American Civil Rights Association ( ACLU ) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of data protection concerns .	-3.1798
But , while Congress cannot agree on a course of action , several states are no longer waiting .	-3.5832
They are currently examining how to switch over the next ten years to a system where drivers pay per mile .	-9.1271
Thousands of drivers have already tested the tachographs , some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring .	-2.2946
This really is a must for our country .	-2.1272
“ It ’ s nothing that we may only use , ” said Hasan Ikhrata , Managing Director of Southern California Assn. of Governments , who plans to record the miles spent on all California federal drivers from 2025 .	-5.5647
The way we pay these taxes will change .	-1.3709
The technology is there .	-1.0639
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund , financed from taxes paid to Americans at the pump , is broken .	-3.9990
But in America , there is no longer as much tank as before .	-5.6734
Cars consume less petrol .	-1.2315
The state oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon ( less than 4 cents per liter ) has not risen for 20 years .	-3.3228
Politicians , at high injection prices , do not dare to raise the tax even by a cent .	-4.2812
“ The petrol tax is simply not sustainable , ” says Lee Munnich , an expert in transport legislation at the University of Minnesota .	-3.3940
His state has recently equipped 500 cars with tachographs to test a milestone payment system .	-3.3741
“ This is the most sensible long-term alternative , ” he said .	-2.9828
bureaucrats call it a milestone user fee .	-2.9891
It is not surprising that the idea is coming up with urban liberals , because the tax could be used , for example , to influence driving behaviour in such a way as to reduce congestion and climate-damaging exhaust emissions .	-5.6413
California ’ s planners rely on the system to develop strategies to achieve the federal state ’ s ambitious , legally anchored goals on climate change .	-4.3969
But the Republican Bill Shuster from Pennsylvania , Chairman of the House Transportation Committee , has also said that he views it as the most viable long-term alternative .	-3.4716
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are also inspired by the idea of letting drivers pay after a distance left behind .	-6.0443
“ This is not a tax that disappears in a black hole , ” explains Adrian Moore , Vice President of Directives at Reason .	-2.6309
People pay directly for what they get .	-1.7711
The movement is also supported by two former US transport ministers who , in a report in 2011 , called on Congress to move toward milestone accounting .	-3.9288
Last year , the US Senate approved a $ 90 million pilot project , covering 10,000 cars .	-2.7665
But the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the move , responding to the concerns of rural parliamentarians representing people who often have to spend many miles on their daily journey to work or to the city .	-13.8332
Several states and large cities , however , are moving in this direction on their own .	-4.1294
The most committed is Oregon , which currently attracts 5,000 drivers for the country ’ s largest experiment .	-4.0639
These drivers will soon pay mileage fees to the state instead of the petroleum tax .	-3.9050
Nevada has already completed a pilot project .	-0.9010
New York City is also considering such a thing .	-1.6228
Illinois is testing it to a limited extent with lorries .	-2.5707
And the I-95 coalition , which includes the transport ministries of 17 states on the east coast ( including Maryland , Pennsylvania , Virginia , and Florida ) , is currently examining how to introduce the change .	-3.0106
The concept is not a universal hit .	-1.0356
In Nevada , where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with the equipment , drivers were sceptical about the idea that the government could follow any of its movements .	-3.7045
“ Concerns about Big Brother and such things were a major problem , ” explains Alauddin Khan , Head of Strategy and Results Management at the Ministry of Transport in Nevada .	-3.9547
People did not want it .	-1.3359
When the test started , Nevada ’ s ACLU warned , “ It would be relatively easy to turn the tachograph into full-fledged monitoring devices . ”	-3.9611
There is no need to build a gigantic , bulky technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals .	-2.9359
Nevada belongs to a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology to capture the driving kilometres , but not exactly when and where .	-4.4953
So , Khan said , the public would also be more reassured .	-4.1754
The hunt for this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California .	-2.5616
The company originally did not intervene to help states tax drivers .	-4.1591
Rather , their aim was to take root in an emerging market for car insurance , where drivers should pay on the basis of the miles they have taken .	-6.4241
However , the equipment it tests is also interesting for road planners , because they do not work with GPS and provide only limited information that is regularly uploaded via modem .	-5.4437
“ People are more willing to participate if their speed and locations are not recorded , ” said Ryan Morrison , Managing Director of True Mileage .	-3.0855
Some of these public pilot programmes have made great mistakes .	-2.4477
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways of doing this .	-2.4546
In Oregon , planners experiment with giving drivers a range of choices .	-3.1577
You can choose a device with or without GPS .	-1.9964
Or they do not choose any equipment at all and instead pay a flat rate based on the average miles travelled by all the inhabitants of the state .	-5.7846
Others hope to be able to sell the concept of a distrustful public by providing the equipment with more functions than minor ones .	-4.7511
In New York City , traffic officials want to develop a tax device that will also pay parking fees , pay insurance only for driving kilometres , and collect speed data from other vehicles in real time , allowing drivers to avoid congestion .	-6.4549
“ Drivers would be motivated to participate by the added value of the benefits offered by the system , ” a city ’ s planning document states . the the . the the . the the . the , the , the	-9.9757
Some transport planners , however , wonder whether all the talk about paying per mile is not just a huge diversion .	-4.5471
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay area , officials said that Congress could solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund simply by raising the fuel tax .	-3.9073
An additional one-off fee or annual levy could be imposed on drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume little petrol , so that they too pay a fair share .	-4.2857
“ There is no reason for an operation if an aspirin is sufficient , ” explains Randy Rentschler , the head of legislation and public affairs of the Commission .	-3.5692
If we do that , hundreds of millions of drivers worry about their privacy and many other things .	-2.5748
Königsfeld : Small team W	-8.1258
The volunteer fire brigade handled her autumn showdown despite lack of personnel with flair .	-5.6024
Only eleven men took part in the exercise .	-1.7421
The Department Commander Hans Kammerer had chosen the estate feather in the Burgberger Stra<unk>e in his training assumption .	-4.6874
A short circuit should have been created during sawing .	-5.5215
Two people were injured by the fire and the smoke development , but one of them could send an emergency call .	-5.0574
After the first review of the situation by Hans Kammerer , two military breathers agreed to enter the building .	-5.3057
After a short time it was possible to find the first person and lead to the outside .	-5.0702
The second person had to be worn .	-1.1068
This was not so easy , as a narrow staircase was also to be overcome .	-4.7769
The building , a workshop with integrated stables for two horses , was not easy to secure .	-2.0077
It stored a lot of wood and also straw balls in it .	-3.9223
There were also electric machines for woodworking .	-3.2475
The first extinguishing operation took place via the tank in the vehicle .	-2.5094
Another line took place via a flood hydrant at about 100 meters distance .	-5.9003
Now three extinguishing operations could be designed .	-3.5791
A hollow beam tube was also used in the building .	-2.3228
Hans Kammerer was also interested in showing what to do with less available staff .	-5.2170
In the event of an emergency , support is provided by the Königsfeld day-to-day operational group .	-4.4635
The commander was satisfied with the course of the exercise .	-2.3847
Networking of universities and companies Important	-2.6630
On his visit to the district of Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald , Landtag President Guido Wolf was also informed in Titisee-Neustadt about where the workers of tomorrow come from .	-5.6331
At the Hochschwarzwald Förderzentrum , he worked with the Heads of Professional Schools , as well as the Head of Circle Gymnasium and the Chairman of the Parental Advisory Committee on this important issue .	-7.6052
" Education is an important location factor " , stressed Claudia Stehle , director of the Hans-Thomas School , who presented the networked school project Education Centre Hochschwarzwald .	-4.3668
Wolf was impressed by the model projects for training .	-2.5128
Since 2011 , there has been a successful cooperation between the Förderzentrum , Kreisgymnasium and the Vocational School Centre in the forest town .	-5.0304
He also praised the family friendliness in the district .	-2.8893
" It is important not only to have a look at the family phase , but also because of demographic change the period to care for relatives , " explained Wolf .	-5.4492
He also said that more and more employees took care of the care and care of their .	-4.2068
" Without the support of employers , the resulting burden on employees can lead to an end to the employment relationship , " said Wolf .	-4.3151
But no one can afford to lose skilled workers , he said .	-2.2943
Another particularly important factor is the networking of universities and companies .	-3.0192
" For those who have already experienced the benefits of the region during their studies , with their acquired knowledge and skills , are often preserved to the regional economy , contributing to the strengthening of the region , " the president of the country was convinced .	-7.1504
Only if sufficient training places were offered can the need for skilled workers be met .	-4.2594
In his opinion , the district ’ s location advantage is its favourable location in the southwest of Germany , close to France and Switzerland .	-4.2120
In addition , on his train journey from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg , he experienced the efforts already made to expand public transport .	-5.6504
" Stay stubborn and make public transport better , " he said to the local politicians present .	-4.4802
A Fun afternoon with Music	-4.7953
For 15 years the Kaul family has been inviting the Dietingen seniors to coffee , cake and then to a vesper .	-4.8776
In the past , the elderly were served in the resting place .	-4.5648
Meanwhile , this afternoon takes place at the St. Josef nursing home .	-3.9074
The home dwellers enjoyed the delicious cakes and cakes .	-3.9313
Later there was a sausage salad .	-3.1282
Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich entertained with common melodies .	-4.1346
The 100-year-old natural stone wall as the frontline of the old school courtyard to the Kirchstra<unk>e is to be added to the rehabilitation plan of the city of Bräunlingen .	-7.1250
In the days before the Kilbig a small corner wall was built in the first work of the rehabilitation of the front school , to stabilise and relieve static relief of the stone wall over a hundred years old with balustrade .	-7.1230
According to Alexander Misok of the Bräunlinger Stadtbauamt , this further course of action provides for the incorporation of the national monument into the planning and the construction of a reconstruction plan for the old wall .	-8.4065
After that , a calculation of costs will be carried out by experts , which will then be put on the table to the Council of Ministers for the decision and the definition of the further action .	-9.3829
A decision on this is expected to be taken next year .	-3.2571
After the rehabilitation , pavement and tree planting of the old school ’ s inner courtyard within the two wings of the school built in 1912 , in the foreseeable future it will be necessary to rehabilitate the walls in need of renovation from the ground up and put them on new .	-8.4603
The historic , 100-year-old boundary wall of the old school courtyard to the Kirchstra<unk>e is mainly due to water and frost damage , since there is no drainage , needs renovation and has an archery inclination forward .	-6.7855
Deep cracks in individual stones testify to weather damage , but the wall is not currently in danger of collapse .	-4.1100
A steady wall is a prerequisite for a school yard used by pupils , which has been done by the current fortifications .	-5.5839
Originally , the school rehabilitation was even planned in 2008 / 2009 , but high unscheduled expenditure brought a shift .	-5.2656
An important word in the historic rehabilitation of the school walls , which has even been used for film shots , will be spoken by the National Monument Office .	-7.2057
The city of Bräunlingen hopes for grants from the monuments .	-11.2253
The students of the Bräunlinger elementary school , who are now being taught again in a well-renovated old school building with new auditorium , can soon use the old school yard .	-6.6833
<unk>zdemir wants to receive Jazz Education in Stuttgart	-2.9247
Cem <unk>zdemir , Chairman of the Greens , has now taken part in the ongoing discussions on the future of the music schools in Baden-Württemberg .	-4.6663
" I think it is wrong to abandon holistic education at the University of Music Stuttgart , " said <unk>zdemir the " Stuttgart News " .	-4.2472
Jazz and classical music belong together at the jazz location Stuttgart .	-3.9583
In doing so , <unk>zdemir , who in Stuttgart is regarded as a favorite for a direct mandate in the federal election on 22 September , contradicts the Green Red Government .	-5.3125
On the basis of an expert study , this will force a reorganization of the five music colleges in Baden-Württemberg .	-9.4864
After that , the course of jazz and pop will be transferred from the Musikhochschule Stuttgart to the Musikhochschule Mannheim .	-5.1015
US Border : " Super Tunnel " to Drug smuggling	-3.3717
On the border between Mexico and the US , investigators discovered and decommissioned a " super tunnel " to drug smuggling .	-3.2542
As the US customs authorities announced , the more than 500 meter long tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity , railways , and an ventilation system .	-4.4399
Three suspects were therefore arrested , eight tonnes of marijuana and almost 150 kilograms of cocaine seized .	-2.2798
The tunnel has not yet been used , according to the .	-3.0694
" These cartels are stupid when they think they could go through the radar , " said the prosecutor of the United States Southern California District , Laura Duffy , at a press conference in front of a warehouse in San Diego , where an end of the tunnel had been discovered .	-5.3186
Duffy said to the drug gangs : " If you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them , we are determined to make this a huge waste of your dirty money " .	-4.4186
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in permanent combat against the drug cartels .	-2.8855
Since 2006 , more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug crime .	-2.2098
Constructed by Experts	-1.1501
Due to the complex equipment of the tunnel , the investigators assume that it was constructed by architects and engineers and that the construction took about a year .	-4.8548
The track system was equipped in such a way that electrically operated cars could be used .	-9.2832
On the Mexican side , access is in a building 80 meters from the border .	-2.9060
According to the authorities , a ladder leads 20 meters into the depth to the actual tunnel entrance .	-3.6462
The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 meters high and 90 centimetres wide .	-3.3043
He would also have been able to promote illegal immigration towards the United States .	-3.7401
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine fund .	-1.6673
The third , a Mexican , was captured for the confiscated marijuana .	-2.4540
All three are at risk of lifelong deprivation , as officials have said .	-3.8343
Since 2006 , eight such tunnels have been discovered , and the press conference in San Diego continued .	-3.6146
However , it is the first time that cocaine has been found in such a tunnel .	-2.8263
Normally , cocaine is smuggled in smaller quantities , not by tunnels .	-2.9510
This shows the " despair " of the drug gangs , whose traditional routes have now been cut off , Bill Sherman said of the drug addiction DEA in San Diego .	-4.2451
They would do everything to get to the US .	-2.6957
The detainees were not given any details , at least one was Mexicans .	-4.5313
They must expect prison sentences of up to ten years .	-2.9453
In 2014 , Geisinger ’ s Fiest	-3.7615
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250 .	-3.0488
The return of the first documentary mention is approaching .	-3.7685
If the year ends in just eight weeks , the anniversary year is approaching .	-5.0312
Geisingen und Kirchen-Hausen wurde 794 erstmals urkmals zurücklich gestimmt .	-5.8710
A document was produced in churches where both places are mentioned .	-4.6517
On 15 March , there will be an official start to the anniversary year , and since Geisingen currently has no hall , this opening event will take place in the place where both were first mentioned 1250 years ago , in church houses .	-6.0080
A number of events are planned in Geisingen as well as in church houses .	-5.3871
In July , the church houses will be held on a festive weekend from July 18th to July 20th the 1250 .	-6.2012
Celebrate Return . . . . . . . . . . . . .	-8.8375
On Friday with a festive act , on Saturday and Sunday with a festival around the Kirchtalhalle .	-3.4478
On this festive weekend there is also the Church Hausener Kirchenfest .	-6.0484
City Music Director Rudolf Barth wrote an order composition for the city on the occasion of the anniversary , which will be performed at three dates .	-10.2841
On the 21st of June , together with the Sunday celebration of the Black Forest Association , on the 12th of July in the Arena with fireworks and on the 13th of December as the first concert of city music in the new Festhalle .	-5.1597
It will be ready and inaugurated in the anniversary year , the official date is the last weekend of September , 27 and 28 September .	-5.6128
On the occasion of the Geisinger city jubilee a new chronicle will be released .	-4.0553
" But it should be a chronicle not only of Geisingen himself , but also a printed work about the Geisingen of today , which consists of ghisings , church houses , corpses , Aulfingen and Gutmadingen , " said Mayor Walter Hengstler .	-6.5714
And today ’ s ghosting is celebrating its birthday in 2014 , and today ’ s spatial spatial spatial spatiality was carried out in 1974 .	-7.8786
The new chronicle will be presented on 21 or 22 November at the new Festhalle in Geisingen .	-2.9723
2014 is also a year with many jubilees .	-3.9361
The Strohglonki Narrenzunft begins on 8 February with a custom evening on the occasion of its 60-year existence , the harmony of Gutmadingen becomes 90 years and has the banquet on 29 March and then celebrates the District Music Festival from 1 to 4 May .	-6.6451
The Altenwerk Leipferdingen is 40 years old , the Geisinger School has been at the new location for 50 years and celebrates this on 10 May , the Musikverein Polyhymnia Leipferdingen is 150 years old and celebrates this during the Fountain Festival from 4 to 7 July .	-5.8579
The town of Geisingen was first mentioned in 764 in a donation document owned by the St. Gallen Monastery .	-3.9674
The document was produced in churches ( houses ) , which was then a court .	-5.6975
Both communities are therefore mentioned in the same document .	-2.6036
This 1250-year-old will celebrate in 2014 , and the municipal reform is also 40 years ago .	-7.7949
Council Targets Gliding Equipment	-2.8411
Should the railway crossing " Am Hirschen " be thoroughly rebuilt to improve road safety ?	-5.1565
Yes , the municipal councils have decided .	-2.1845
Schiltach must have EUR 220 000 in his hand .	-4.3786
Deutsche Bahn intends to improve the Kinzigtal railway line next year .	-2.8881
Especially the safety of railway crossings is to be increased - there are regular collisions of trains across Germany with other vehicles .	-5.5068
If the municipalities agree to the reconstruction measures , they will have to pay one-third of the costs , the rest will be shared by the railways and the federal government .	-6.7446
Schiltach 's city builder Roland Grie<unk>haber explained to the municipal council the peculiarities of the Bahübergang " Am Hirschen " .	-3.8636
There , the city plans to build a rehabilitation at the height of the tunnel mouth to the west of the railway tracks .	-6.3774
There , too , larger vehicles , such as those transporting longwood , could stand in the case of counter-traffic without having to block the tracks .	-11.6338
Grie<unk>haber therefore proposed to construct a necessary support wall in such a way that the city could broaden the subsequent road in due course to ensure a smooth flow of traffic .	-5.3697
This was controversially discussed in the municipal council , as some councils questioned the need for road proliferation : Thomas Kipp put the critics ' mood to the point : ' Do we have to take so much money in our hands because of so few vehicles ? '	-6.7238
Mayor Thomas Haas disagreed : The railway crossing " Hirschen " is regularly used for long-wood transport .	-4.3254
Even wood from the Kuhbach area is partly transported over this route , because the vehicles up to 20 metres long could not use the route along the Häberlesbrücke because they could not turn into the main road .	-6.2648
In addition , the route served as a redirection for those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is closed , Haas argued .	-4.5545
It should be noted that Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnels need to be rebuilt and rebuilt , as is currently the case in Wolfach , that the railway crossing " Am " Hirschen " could also have an important traffic significance for a longer period of time .	-6.4985
The councils agreed to investigate the costs of the intended broadening of the road .	-4.9125
Notwithstanding this , the majority agreed to the rebuilding of the railway crossing , with the requirement that the necessary support wall be built in such a way that the city could extend the subsequent road towards " Bahnhofstra<unk>e " to about 5.5 metres for meetings .	-8.4412
On the other hand , the transformation of the railway crossing at the Trautwein tannery could lead to a very different problem , which concerns access to the rapidly increasing " Geroltzhäuser Weg " .	-7.7405
The administration had investigated the reconstruction plans of the railway by the Breinlinger engineering office , because it had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhäuser Weg was still possible .	-6.8629
The investigation concluded that it was not possible to exclude the possibility that the inclination of the road could lead to longer vehicles being seated .	-6.4511
The city , in turn , is responsible for this .	-4.0993
Consequently , the reconstruction could lead to liability disputes .	-4.6530
As both the logging and the bending worked in the current state of expansion , one should not agree to the transformation of the railway crossing , Haas argued .	-7.3192
Also , at this point , the risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle on the transition is much lower than on the other railway crossings , because there is the middle stop right next to it , to which there is a good view connection .	-9.4690
Even trains from the main railway station would have to be slowed down to the point where no collision threatens .	-5.5270
The majority refused to approve the transformation of this railway crossing because the town of Schiltach had to " take the problem out " with up-and-coming vehicles , according to the councils , since the railways could withdraw from responsibility once the construction work has been completed .	-10.6297
The committee considers the conversions to the " Vor Heubach " and " Vor Kuhbach " railways , for which crossing agreements have already been made with .	-6.8577
Esa Decisions Big Space Missions	-2.3550
Far planets , gravitational waves or black holes - European Space Agency experts must now agree on two major projects that they want to launch in the coming years .	-3.7852
30 proposals were available , five are still in the race .	-3.4153
Far worlds .	-1.3360
More than 1000 planets in other stars have already found astronomers .	-2.3036
No one knows whether there are at least some lives .	-3.6489
The choice is difficult : should you look for gravitational waves ?	-3.4893
Or rather explore the origin of the cosmos ?	-2.2827
Or are you looking for a memorable planet and perhaps discovering alien life ?	-6.4708
These questions are being asked by the European Space Agency Esa .	-3.9399
For their " Cosmic Vision " programme , they are looking for ideas for two major space projects , which are intended to significantly advance research .	-5.5774
The budget for such ' L-missions ' is approximately EUR 1 billion each .	-3.2282
The start is expected to be in 2028 and 2034 .	-1.9454
In early September , the elite of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions .	-2.0338
30 ideas were under discussion , five of which have now come to the closer election .	-5.2194
Numerous bodies are examining the proposals , and the researchers are reviewing them .	-5.4319
In the next few days , a final decision will be taken by the scientific programme committee .	-7.7397
The Esa has selected four major questions to which the missions of the 2007 initiated Cosmic Vision programme will find answers .	-5.3124
What are the conditions for the emergence of planets and lives ?	-2.4948
The exact occurrences of stars originating from large gas clouds - and thus the emergence of planets that circle these stars - are still in proverbial darkness .	-5.9235
A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this dark .	-2.2961
And if a star has a planet , under what circumstances can life arise there ?	-2.9807
To address this question , the space telescope " Cheops " is scheduled to start in 2017 , with a more detailed study of 500 already known planetary systems in our vicinity .	-6.4678
But the possibilities are limited , Cheops is a small mission with a budget of EUR 150 million .	-2.8352
With larger instruments , astronomers could depict fateful planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres , searching for " biomarkers " : gases that are considered an indication of biological activity .	-5.0671
How does the solar system work ?	-1.1989
This question , too , is ultimately intended to shed light on the conditions for the creation of life .	-6.1495
The magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field as well as the particle radiation that it emits with the planet system play an important role .	-10.7275
In our solar system these processes can be examined exemplary .	-2.5671
With the " Solar Orbiter " the Esa has already approved a M-class mission ( where the budget is around half a billion euros ) for this question .	-4.8551
The probe is scheduled to start in 2017 and observe the surface and activity of the sun closely .	-3.8635
Jupiter and his moons are also of great interest to the researchers .	-7.7782
They want to find out what role the giant planet played in the development of the solar system .	-3.0664
This is the first of the three L-missions of the Cosmic Vision program .	-3.4323
The probe " Juice " ( Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer ) is expected to begin its journey in 2022 .	-2.3127
Eight years later , she reached Jupiter to investigate the atmosphere of the planet and the icy moons of Europe , Kallisto and Ganymed .	-4.2495
What are the basic physical laws of the universe ?	-1.0947
The space offers many possibilities to study matter under extreme conditions and to examine whether the laws of nature we know are still valid there .	-5.4182
Perhaps deviations can also be found that could lead physicists to a new theory under which all known laws of nature can be combined .	-5.7963
How did the universe emerge and what is it ?	-3.3058
Our cosmos was created by the Big Bang 13.7 billion years ago .	-2.9510
In addition to the usual matter , consisting of stars , planets and creatures like us , there is dark matter whose gravity holds galaxies and galaxies together , and dark energy , through which the expansion of space accelerates .	-6.1320
So far , researchers have not known which physical laws were valid in the first fractions of the Big Bang , nor what dark matter and dark energy consist of .	-4.2888
With " Euclid " , the Esa has already approved an M mission , the launch of which is scheduled for 2020 .	-4.5288
With a special telescope , the probe is intended to investigate the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time in the entire sky , thus enabling conclusions on the nature of dark matter and dark energy .	-5.5489
Who Would Go the Race	-4.4234
Of the 30 proposals , only two will remain at the end of the selection process .	-1.8958
In the opinion of many experts , the best chances of an L-mission is " E-Lisa " , a sophisticated concept for detecting gravitational waves .	-5.1390
Physicists understand changes in the structure of space time that Albert Einstein predicted almost 100 years ago .	-3.8557
They have not yet been proven .	-2.6570
Elisa could do that , hoping the scientists behind the project .	-2.4342
The mission provides for a detector made up of two or three probes , stationed in space .	-4.1119
In contrast to plants on Earth , it could also prove gravitational waves created during the Big Bang , providing new insights into the emergence of the cosmos .	-5.7221
Four other proposals compete for the second L-mission : a large X-ray telescope called " Athena " , which is to explore black holes , " Icy Planets " , another mission on the outer planets of the solar system , " Prism " , a mission to measure the cosmic background radiation , and the " Exoplanet Finder " , which is supposed to detect and investigate fanciful planets .	-6.0022
There are already proposals for sample return transport from Mars , for research into the moon , venus and asteroids , and for solar physics .	-5.8704
Snowden ready to “ cooperate ” with Germany on US surveillance .	-2.1999
Edward Snowden , the Whistleblower of the US Intelligence Service , has declared that he is willing to travel to Berlin and say before the German Bundestag if the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander do not provide answers to their activities .	-4.7526
The German MEP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden on Thursday in Russia , where this asylum was received to discuss with him the statement in Germany .	-3.8886
In a letter from Snowden , which was presented to the media in Berlin on Friday of Ströbele , he writes : “ Even though the result of my efforts was demonstrably positive , my government continues to treat a divergent opinion as a fiduciary and tries to criminalize political expression with a threat of punishment , in which no defense is possible . ”	-6.8592
But telling the truth is not a crime .	-2.0241
In the letter Snowden writes that he is convinced that the support of the international community can convince the American government to drop the charge against him .	-4.2229
The indictment issued by the US Department of Justice includes espionage and theft of state property .	-3.5796
Germany ’ s Interior Minister , Hans-Peter Friedrich , said Online to Time : “ If Mr Snowden is willing to talk to German representatives , then we will find ways to make this possible . ”	-5.0887
Relations between the US and Germany are burdened by claims that the NSA has listened to Chancellor Angela Merkel ’ s mobile phone .	-3.4757
Thomas Oppermann , the MEP who chairs the parliamentary committee responsible for the secret service , said that we should seize the opportunity to listen to Snowden as a witness , if possible , ‘ without jeopardising it and completely ruining relations with the US ’ .	-6.3253
Ströbele , an MEP of the Greens , published a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed .	-2.5635
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia .	-1.9601
Ströbele explained that , according to the lawyer of the former NSA employee , Snowden cannot return to Russia if he leaves the country .	-3.4005
If Snowden says in Germany , he needs an assurance that he is “ safe ” there , he says .	-3.6409
Snowden explains in his letter that he is facing a “ serious and ongoing ” campaign of persecution that has driven him out of his homeland .	-4.2225
But he is touched by the global response to “ my act of political expression . ”	-2.6808
Citizens around the world , as well as senior politicians – including in the United States – have described revelations through an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance as a merit of the general public .	-4.4136
In his letter , Snowden makes an offer of cooperation to the German authorities , “ when the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation have been resolved . ”	-3.7644
Frontier Airlines charges for hand baggage	-1.2726
Frontier Airlines plans to require up to $ 100 from passengers who wish to baggage on their flight .	-3.6682
Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to $ 100 for one piece of hand baggage and $ 2 for coffee or lemonade , even if it was read in Wednesday ’ s announcement that passengers should keep the whole dose .	-4.6493
The new fee applies to hand baggage in the baggage compartment above the seat , small bags under the seat are still free .	-3.1902
Frontier explained that if the fee is paid in advance , it will be charged USD 25 , and USD 100 for travellers who only paid at the gate .	-6.2575
Frontier spokesman Kate O 'Malley said that the fee of $ 100 is intended to encourage travellers to pay in advance .	-3.5902
“ We don ’ t want to calculate this sum , ” she said .	-7.3379
Airlines began to charge for the first and second items of checked baggage in 2008 .	-3.5912
Passengers who tried to circumvent them have therefore put as much in their hand baggage as possible , which means that baggage compartments above the seat are often overcrowded .	-5.8669
Charges are one way of getting passengers to take less on board .	-3.0361
O 'Malley said that the new fee is not really about making money .	-2.0294
It is about the most loyal customers of Frontier , who would have made it clear that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find a place in the compartment above the seat .	-6.1688
Passengers who buy your tickets on the airline 's website do not have to pay .	-2.8298
This means that a passenger may take one piece of baggage at Frontier 's gate free of charge , but the next person may have to pay $ 100 for a comparable piece of baggage .	-5.1499
O 'Malley stated that the Frontier website and the check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers were informed of the fee before they arrived at the gate .	-4.9432
Frontier ’ s new hand baggage allowance will only come into force in summer , and there is no exact date yet .	-4.9013
Passengers often complain about baggage charges and other charges , but airlines like to resort to them .	-4.5248
They argue that baggage transport costs money and passengers should pay for it if they wanted it .	-4.2491
Many on Wall Street see the new baggage charges as a sign that airlines are taking enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of loss .	-4.4046
However , most have so far left the fingers of charges for hand baggage .	-4.2355
Spirit Airlines Inc. demanded first hand baggage charges three years ago , followed by Allegiant Air , also a low-cost airline .	-4.3151
The only other airline with such a charge was the Hungarian Wizz Air , explained by the airline advisor Jay Sorensen , who closely monitors the additional charges .	-11.2938
He estimated in a December 2011 report that the hand baggage allowance Spirit earns $ 50 million annually .	-3.7588
Sorensen , who previously held a leading position at Midwest Airlines , recently flown with Spirit and was curious about what he would expect at the gate if passengers were faced with the company ’ s unusual hand baggage charge .	-5.5334
“ The boarding process was one of the most smooth I experienced in my career in aviation , ” he said .	-3.0777
I expected to see teeth knitting and hands-on discussions at the gate .	-3.6308
“ The plane was full , ” he said , “ and boarding was as lubricated . ”	-2.8153
Frontier also follows Spirit with the 2 dollars required for coffee , tea , limonade or juice .	-3.8827
The company explained that passengers who bought limonade or juice would be allowed to keep the whole dose and to fill coffee free of charge .	-5.7982
Water is still free .	-1.3060
In 2008 , US Airways had temporarily tried to demand money for refreshment drinks , but it reversed it seven months later , after passengers complained and no other large company followed .	-6.3822
Frontier ’ s move to levy charges on hand baggage if passengers do not buy directly from the airline is the latest initiative to direct customers to their own website .	-5.1201
Airlines pay online travel agencies like Orbitz 10 to 25 USD per ticket sold .	-2.6962
This gives all companies an incentive to get passengers to buy directly with them rather than through an online travel agency .	-4.6391
Frontier , however , has gone the farthest in this area .	-3.0298
In September , the company began to award only half as many frequent flyer miles when booking through an online travel agency .	-3.3567
On Wednesday , miles were again reduced to 25 % of the route .	-3.4493
For this reason , a flight with a Frontier over 1000 miles booked with a third party carrier brings only 250 miles to customers .	-6.3368
Passengers can also reserve seats only when purchasing directly from Frontier 's website .	-3.5355
Frontier has a loyal client base in Denver , but the business is shrinking and the company loses money .	-3.5460
Revenue decreased by 9 % and flight capacity decreased by just under 13 % in the first quarter , as can be read in the financial report published on Wednesday by the parent company , Republic Airways Holdings Inc . .	-14.8250
Republic has tried to control Frontier ’ s finances as part of the company ’ s sales .	-4.9008
Says Come from the Bible	-2.1761
Good 40 women visited the last female breakfast this year in the Protestant parish Bisingen .	-9.4211
The theme of the day in the municipality was " Bible Says " and " Middle Ages Speeches " .	-5.2416
After breakfast , Zita Köhler , the chairman of the parish council , addressed the biblical proverbs in a talk .	-5.2355
" Says contain life wisdom , regulations or warnings , " she explained .	-3.4680
She compared several words with the corresponding biblical places and explained the meaning .	-4.9217
She called proverbs like : wooden eyes are watchful , as scales fall from the eyes , throw an eye on someone who gives His Lord in sleep , wash his hands in innocence .	-5.8005
On several occasions , the speaker also advised her listeners what the saying was .	-4.7292
The words of the Middle Ages were taken up by the parish of Christel Dehner : all good things are three , make blue , breathe something .	-6.9535
She explained the importance and origin of the speeches she called ' bridges to the past ' .	-2.9283
A raffle was finally given .	-7.6836
Prices were covered on a table and were described humorously before being handed over to the winners .	-3.8563
Among the visitors of the breakfast round , mayor candidate Roman Waizenegger also mixed up .	-5.2437
Learning instead of unemployed : pilot project for the unskilled in tourism	-3.3995
A pilot project for the tourism industry started at the Mecklenburg Lakes Platte .	-3.1185
Under the leadership of the Federal Labour Agency , 49 women and men who are already working as unskilled in the industry are to be qualified for hotel and restaurant specialists over three winters .	-5.8842
" What is new is that the six-month courses end with qualifications , " said Carmen Wiechert of the Employment Agency Neubrandenburg .	-4.3814
The benefits are manifold : the participants would not be unemployed , companies would receive trained professionals , who were increasingly lacking in hotels and restaurants , and the agency would not have to finance unemployment .	-5.3322
The project also includes the Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Neubrandenburg as well as the German Hotel and Restaurant Association ( Dehoga ) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern .	-3.5024
NSA says that an “ internal error ” and not hackers are to blame for the crash of the site .	-3.6930
The shadowy National Security Agency declared late Friday that a bug has paralysed its public website for hours , not hackers , as was claimed online .	-5.4601
“ NSA.gov was not available for a few hours tonight because an internal error occurred during a planned update , ” explained the Spy Agency in a message sent by e-mail .	-5.1543
The problem will be fixed this evening .	-1.8736
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed denial of service attack ( DDoS ) is not true .	-2.4211
In the early evening hours , online server trackers noticed that the NSA website was unreachable for at least six hours and that this is still not for some users .	-4.8452
Previously , a NSA spokesman told ABC News that the agency ’ s sensitive internal network was “ in no way ” compromised .	-3.3441
Secret information is not in danger , according to the speaker .	-2.9350
At least a group of hacktivists claimed to have paralysed the NSA website with a DDoS attack .	-2.4506
In the event of such attacks , the target website is flooded with page calls until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses .	-4.4109
Cybertactics are relatively simple and the attacks are not used to penetrate the internal network of the target system .	-3.2529
The former super-secret NSA , whose nickname was No Search Agency ( no such authority ) , is now in the bright light of the public , and is exposed to sharp criticism after the revelations that have become known in recent months about its extensive surveillance program at home and abroad – a result of the secret NSA data stolen and published by the disillusioned former NSA employee Edward Snowden .	-6.7023
The growing controversy over the secret service fueled initial speculation that the incident today was the result of a targeted cyperoperation .	-3.1894
The number of people without jobs fell slightly in October by 22 to 1,307 .	-3.6977
Although the 3.1 percent quota was better than last year and also better than in September , " we would have hoped for more , " says Monika Felder-Bauer , Deputy Managing Director of the Agency for Employment in Sonthofen .	-4.4413
Many companies have reacted to attitudes so far .	-4.2532
According to Felder-Bauer , one reason for this is : " We have hardly any skilled craftsmen , healthcare and care for the elderly " .	-5.0172
Several seasonal vacancies for staff in the hotel and catering industry have been opened since September .	-7.5794
The winter season begins in mid-December .	-2.8025

Loss in Bombardier ’ s Loss in Delivery and Orders	-4.2611
Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15 % decline in net profit on Thursday , after being under pressure from declining orders and deliveries on aircraft in the third quarter and contract problems in the railway sector .	-5.3622
Bombardier , based in Montreal , did not publish flight test data for his brand new CSeries aircraft , and did not give any new information as to whether the aircraft could go to commercial use in accordance with the ambitious schedule next September .	-5.6337
Up to now , the jungle flight of the test aircraft a month and a half followed only three more launches , which makes it questionable whether the test phase will run as planned .	-6.9361
The results remained behind forecasts and resulted in a price fall of more than eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange .	-4.6639
Cameron Doerksen , analyst at National Bank Financial , lowered its rating from “ outperforming ” to “ sector performance ” on Thursday with a limited price potential in the next one to two quarters .	-5.7663
“ While weaker delivery figures for aircraft were widely expected , we are clearly disappointed by margin development in the transport sector , ” said Doerksen in a customer letter .	-10.9601
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries when the test program for the aircraft moves forward .	-10.4344
However , if no new orders are announced in the coming months , we expect the market to become more sceptical about the program .	-9.6440
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft series can catapult the company into the lower market segment currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus .	-2.6769
The first test aircraft was presented to the public in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delays .	-2.4734
But , to date , binding orders for CSeries with 177 are moderate , as potential buyers would like to wait for the results of the flight tests and see whether the company ’ s claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost savings potential of the new jet transport aircraft are true .	-5.6514
There are currently a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies .	-2.1590
Chief Executive Officer Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will reach his target of 300 binding orders at the beginning of commercial use of the jet .	-3.2548
On Thursday , the management also assured analysts and the media that the programme would be on the schedule .	-4.6029
“ The test aircraft was no longer on the ground than expected , ” Beaudoin said at a telephone conference and added that ground tests and software updates were scheduled during the aircraft ’ s life .	-5.2138
Each manufacturer plans differently .	-1.7915
We have decided to make a first flight and then to add a revision period , which we have also done .	-10.7981
This is happening throughout the programme .	-3.0122
The second of five aircraft is expected to start in the next few weeks , the remaining one shortly thereafter , it was said by the company side .	-5.2591
However , analysts remain skeptical about whether the first customer can launch an aircraft from the CSeries twelve months after the jungle flight .	-4.8059
Bombardier explained that it is checking the planning for commissioning ( EIS ) and will update it in the coming months .	-3.6608
“ The slow progress of the flight test – although it seems to be in line with bombardment ’ s internal planning – reinforces our view that commissioning will be postponed until the first quarter of 2015 , ” said Doerksen .	-5.2178
In the third quarter , at the end of September 30 , Bombardier ’ s net income fell to $ 147 million , or $ 8 cents per share of $ 172 million , respectively $ 9 cents per share a year earlier .	-4.0582
The adjusted profit per share is unchanged 9 cents .	-2.9412
Sales dropped slightly and dropped from 4.2 billion dollars to 4.1 billion .	-2.5783
Analysts expected a profit of 10 cents per share and a turnover of 4.56 billion dollars , according to Thomson Reuters I / B / E / S.	-2.4589
The world ’ s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer claims that he delivered 45 aircraft this quarter , a decline of 57 last year .	-3.1252
Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26 .	-1.2683
The order book in the aerospace card was $ 32.9 billion on September 30 , unchanged from December 31 .	-5.0838
“ In the field of aerospace , the results were within our specifications , but low order intake and overall market conditions were disappointing , ” said Beaudoin .	-4.3355
Aerospace sales fell 13 percent to $ 2 billion .	-6.9612
Bombardier , the world ’ s largest railway manufacturer , announced that sales in this sector had risen by almost 11 % to $ 2.1 billion .	-3.5837
The order book in the transport sector was $ 32.6 billion on September 30 , slightly increased compared to December 31 .	-4.4525
The profit margin in the transport sector was affected by settlement problems in some major contracts .	-3.9554
According to the management of the company , there will be new requirements for the fourth quarter .	-3.9413
In the afternoon trading on Thursday , the bombing share fell by 8.5 % and stood at 4.83 Canadian dollars after it was also announced that Google ’ s financial board , Patrick Pichette , will join the board .	-6.2766
Brazilian Embraer SA , the world ’ s third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and bombardment company , reported a ten-percent decline in quarterly profit on Thursday .	-4.0987
US Shooting at Los Angeles Airport	-2.8723
An unknown fired shots at LAX airport on Friday morning ( local time ) .	-3.8823
While the airport management told Twitter that the shooter was in custody , the " Los Angeles Times " reported that the man was dead .	-4.1353
A security man has also been killed .	-2.0362
The media also reported several injured .	-2.3681
US President Barack Obama is constantly being informed of the situation , said the White House spokesman , Jay Carney .	-2.7019
The incident occurred in Terminal 3 , eyewitnesses indicated that they had seen a shooter with a gun in one of the departure halls , as several media reported .	-5.1815

Cocain-dependent lawyer who warned the drug boss against police investigation must be jailed .	-4.1612
Basharat Ditta , 42 , passed on information to Neil Scarborough , the world ’ s underworld .	-4.8899
The lawyer feared that his secret drug addiction might come to light .	-2.7557
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Crown Court .	-1.5914
A well-known criminal defender who warned a drug baron of a major police investigation because he was afraid that his secret drug addiction could be exposed was sentenced to three years in prison .	-4.0552
Basharat Ditta , 42 , provided Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about investigations into his drug trafficking activities after being compromised by his own cocaine search .	-3.9174
The “ first-class ” lawyer , acclaimed by criminalists , with the nickname “ Bash , ” was arrested in his house in 2011 after the police had monitored Scarborough , which he had represented in an earlier drug trial .	-5.8649
Officials watched Scarborough ( 32 ) deliver three bags of cocaine at the home of the lawyer in Blackburn , Lancashire , while he was with colleagues at a bar meal .	-3.9727
The investigation revealed that Ditta regularly consumed Class A drugs after tests found traces of cocaine in his hair , on his wallet and on credit cards .	-3.5029
For a period of eight months between January and August 2011 , he tried to obtain unauthorized information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners .	-3.4163
All four suspects were then monitored by the police in a major investigation into the heroin and cocaine trade in Lancashire , Cumbria , Merseyside , Berkshire and West Yorkshire .	-2.6218
Together with 32 other people , they were later arrested after the police secured heroin and cocaine worth <unk> 1.5 million and <unk> 200,000 in cash in a series of house searches .	-4.3213
Ditta , 42 , gave information to the criminals because he feared that his drug addiction could become public .	-3.4454
Today , Ditta , who is working for Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn , was found guilty and sentenced in two indictments for obstructing the judiciary , following a three-week trial .	-6.0273
He admitted cocaine ownership in an earlier survey .	-3.3360
The lawyer was transferred after the police found out in their investigation against Scarborough that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011 .	-3.6577
Two investigators followed the suspect and saw him go to Ditta ’ s house and put drugs under the lawyer ’ s garbage tonne with a purity of 60 % in a black golf glove .	-4.3919
Shortly after he delivered the drugs , Scarborough regularly called Ditta , who was in the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park at dinner .	-4.3191
The lawyer returned home , picked up the drugs , and then nine communications were exchanged between the two .	-3.5922
It was announced in court that Ditta was a “ regular consumer ” of cocaine after tests had discovered Class A drugs in his hair , wallet , and credit cards .	-5.0718
Ditta was later arrested , but refused to take cocaine and said he spoke to the suspected dealer because he was his client , claiming that their discussion was subject to “ legal secrecy . ”	-5.0631
During his arrest , Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards , but they were safeguarded and he was taken from a haircut .	-10.8563
At the police interrogation he said that he would operate an office under his private address as well as in the workplace , and clients would call him at home for legal matters .	-5.7878
It was announced in court that he had called for significant arrests and informed important drug trafficking actors , some of whom he had previously represented , about what the investigators knew about them .	-6.2173
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said , “ A criminal prosecutor should know better than anyone else that the law is not broken . ”	-3.5161
Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal defender because he has become too involved with certain clients .	-4.3227
The relationship in question is not simply that of a drug dealer , but of a drug dealer who supplies his lawyer with drugs .	-3.0092
Part of his communications was undoubtedly legitimate because he was the lawyer of those people .	-3.4824
But that went far beyond the boundaries of a normal relationship between lawyer and client .	-2.6408
He acted as far as possible against police investigations so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities .	-3.9217
In doing so , Mr Ditta brought his profession into disrepute .	-3.2132
He was too close to certain clients , especially Scarborough , and he allowed his independence to be compromised .	-2.3183
Ditta pointed out every misconduct and claimed : “ If I were a corrupt lawyer , which I am not , and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough , I would not wait 15 hours , but would do so immediately . ”	-5.8623
But after the hearing , superintendent Lee Halstead of the police in Lancashire said : “ Mr Ditta took the step from a criminal defender to a criminal at the moment he started to buy drugs from organized criminals . ”	-4.5066
His cocaine dependence resulted in a hopeless compromise and made him susceptible to the motives of leading members of organised crime who instructed him to obtain valuable information on police investigations .	-4.4930
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure public confidence and confidence .	-2.9037
Ditta has lost that trust and tried to hide behind the facade of his profession .	-4.2049
The Serious and Organised Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigation against Ditta , which also led to a conviction in three cases for the possession of cocaine and judicial obstruction , which underlines our determination to bring criminals to justice .	-4.7961
This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that no one can escape the arm of the law .	-2.5766
We will find you and bring you to court .	-1.7533
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after declaring himself guilty of the conspiracy of heroin , cocaine , and cannabis .	-2.7072
Thirty-five others involved in drug trafficking — people were sentenced to total penalties of 153 years for drug offences .	-3.8444
On his website , Ditta published an area with questions and answers about himself , in which he stated that his dream job was to represent clients on death row in America as a lawyer , that his ultimate guest at dinner was Mohammed Ali and equal opportunities was the motivation for his work .	-5.9950
Revolutionary Work of Church Music	-1.9433
At the end of the celebrations on the occasion of its 160-year-old existence , the Liederkranz Dunningen will frame two services of worship with Franz Schubert 's " Deutsche Messe " .	-4.8353
After the great success of the musical " Rock my Life " , which attracted spectators in the spring of this year , the Liederkranz will enrich two worship services at the end of the jubilee year with the performance of the Deutsche Messe von Franz Schubert .	-5.6429
On Saturday , October 26th , this extraordinary exhibition will be heard from 19 during the evening exhibition in the St. Martinus Church Dunningen and on Sunday , October 27th at the church service in the St. Johannes Baptist Church in Lackendorf .	-6.1402
The so-called Deutsche Messe with the original title " Songs to celebrate the sacred sacrifice of the fair " , D 872 , is a spiritual music work by the composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was considered almost revolutionary at the time of its creation .	-6.3414
The exhibition is performed within the framework of the services of God , as the client Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind .	-4.8370
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider , the choir is accompanied by the brass group of the Musikverein Merry Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi at the organ .	-3.3413
Haslach ’ s Skepticism Goes Confidence	-4.2413
The 2015 elections to the parish council , for example , will change fundamentals in the Haslach ( SE ) care unit .	-5.5117
There is then only one common parish council for all six parishes .	-8.0823
At a joint meeting on Saturday the bodies from Haslach , Hofstetten , Mühlenbach , Fischerbach , Steinach and Welschensteinach prepared for the changes .	-3.7092
The fundamental decisions of the dioceses must no longer be changed and it is up to the parish communities to implement them as satisfactorily as possible .	-5.3725
Over the course of the day , it became particularly clear that skepticism about the new is hesitant , but growing confidence .	-7.0793
From the ideas and expectations of the innovations in 2015 to concrete proposals on the future composition and the size of the parish council , the extremely constructive discussions between the six bodies with the shareholders of the Seelsorgeam took place .	-6.1301
Regionaldekan Georg Schmitt explained on the basis of a presentation the new guidelines for care units in the Archdiocese of Freiburg .	-4.5020
After that , the SE Haslach , as a parish of churches , will form a body of public law that enters into the rights and obligations of the six individual parishes so far .	-6.6237
There will only be a joint parish council and a board of foundations in which the parish priest Kraft is represented .	-10.2798
At least two elected members are to be represented from each parish ; in the six parish parishes , so-called community teams are formed locally .	-5.3281
Your task will be to promote church life in the village in future .	-4.6716
On the question of the finances of the individual parish there was then a considerable need for discussion .	-5.3201
The innovations provide that accumulated credits in the parish are kept in the appropriate manner .	-8.0431
The liabilities , on the other hand , are transferred to the community as a whole .	-4.0706
There were serious concerns about the major planned investments , the obligation of which then affects all parishes .	-6.4270
" Even in the past , only investments were made in projects that could be managed by the individual parishes alone , " relativised Hassalch 's parish chairman , Bruno Prinzbach .	-5.9559
Practical experience with a common body for five parishes described Barbar Knight , the chairman of the body in the Schutterwald-Neuried Seelsorgung Unit .	-6.2424
They set themselves the task of " becoming one , remaining five " in 2006 and found that this is not so easy .	-5.7056
The bodies of the Haslach Spirit Unit then asked questions about the future composition and size of the common parish council and the practical work of the community teams .	-5.5598
The preparations will be concrete at further meetings and will be decided at a further joint meeting of all six bodies next spring .	-5.4659
In the end Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the Seelsorge Unit , which was approved by a clear majority .	-4.5616
In Ppullendorf , electricity becomes more expensive .	-3.0929
The citizens of Ppullendorf must adapt to higher electricity costs .	-3.5679
As the Managing Director of the Stadtwerke , Jörg-Arne Bias , confirmed to the S<unk>DKURIER , a four-headed Ppullendorf family will cost between 70 and 90 euros per year .	-6.1301
The main reason for the upcoming price increase is the increase in the so-called EEC levy from 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt hour .	-3.3039
This levy is redefined every year in October by the four operators of the large electricity lines .	-5.3853
These quantify the additional costs incurred by the energy transformation , which they can levy by levying the electricity price .	-7.0519
The Ppullendorf townworks form the last link in this chain .	-3.7275
In its forecasts , the Supervisory Board of the energy company even assumed a higher levy , as Jörg-Arne Bias reports .	-3.5921
Now the actual figures would have to be calculated before the city works could inform their customers about the exact price increase next week .	-4.7808
" We expect an increase of 1 cent plus x , " says Bias , where the number will be closer to 2 cents .	-4.7639
Permanent red traffic lights : Watch for the	-9.2305
Sometimes a traffic light simply does not get green .	-2.7817
The contact loop in the street does not react , or the light sign is broken .	-2.5084
What should we do then - on red driving ?	-5.2720
If a person has waited long enough at a red light and the intersection is free , he can continue , explains the Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine " Motorrad " .	-4.1392
However , the waiting time must be ' appropriate ' , which can be interpreted differently from case to case .	-4.4590
Becker advises you to stay for at least five minutes before starting to interfere with the traffic light .	-4.1355
Anyone who continues the journey despite red light must be aware that he is fully responsible for an accident caused by it .	-6.8275
Anyone who tolerates less than five minutes may not wait long enough , warns Becker and refers to a decision by the Oberlandesgericht Hamm .	-3.6476
In the negotiated case , a driver had ignored the traffic light after about three minutes and had to be responsible for a negligent red light violation .	-4.7883
After all , the traffic light was not broken , but switched to green a little later .	-5.0420
He was spared a driving ban because of the special situation - but not the fine .	-4.6135
The Council of Municipalities is pleased with a solid budget	-8.5783
Whenever municipal councils deal with the budget , mayor Ralph Gerster laughs well .	-3.6902
The municipal backdrop in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled , and debt has not known the administration since 2005 .	-4.8659
The 2012 financial year can also be seen as a complete success in this regard .	-3.9161
This was apparent in the 2012 annual accounts .	-8.0991
As Andrea Rothmund explained , the administrative budget had been more than EUR 7.6 million than planned .	-3.7441
The surplus of the administrative budget , too , is about EUR 1.8 million above the approach .	-4.8552
The surplus is mainly due to higher commercial tax revenues and the municipal share of income tax .	-4.4902
The asset budget was also well above the planned values .	-4.1346
Instead of the EUR 1.5 million envisaged , it was EUR 2.5 million last year .	-2.7322
" This is mainly due to the increased contribution from the administrative budget , " says Rothmund .	-4.3380
As less investment was made in the 2012 financial year than planned , the return allocation was also higher .	-5.0659
In total , the overall reserve was increased by around EUR 2.1 million to a total of EUR 4.9 million .	-3.6898
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for their good work .	-1.6912
" Such a work is not simply shaken out of the sleeves , " Gerster praised with a view to the accounts .	-10.6469
He and the municipal councils clearly enjoyed the good figures .	-3.7171
It may sound paradoxical , but it is precisely these good figures that could soon cost citizens dear .	-3.8560
Due to the good financial situation , the municipality was able to avoid high leverage rates in the past .	-6.2910
In turn , according to Gerster , subsidies have already been cut from the country .	-5.2697
There are conditions for these subsidies from various compensation levels .	-4.0667
Among other things , the cities and communities that apply for grants must have certain levies .	-4.6292
" We need to look at the issue of lifting measures , as there will be investments in the coming years for which we would like to have subsidies , " Gerster announced in this connection .	-6.7934
Nagold : Hugo Wermter in the Choir for 60 years	-2.1195
With 60 years of singing , Hubert Wermter ’ s history at the male singing club Cecilia is almost twice as long as that of the autumn festival in which he was solemnly honored .	-5.4192
As usual , Hubert Wermter stood on stage in the colours of his men ’ s singing club .	-4.0470
After 60 years , he still enjoys singing with the choir that has become more than loved .	-6.9586
Wermter was also active in the association , including 28 years as a member of the committee .	-3.5494
He received several awards for his engagement and club loyalty : Jörg Kohr , Pastoral Representative on behalf of the Cecilian Association Rottenburg-Stuttgart , handed over a certificate from the Association and an honorary letter signed by Bishop Gebhard Fürst , as the choir is also a church choir .	-7.1284
His singer colleagues handed over to him the certificate of the German choir association and a grave tin plate .	-6.0671
In addition to the award , the 31st Autumn Festival was held in the usual stages : with the MGV amount , the Liederkranz Salzstetten , the singer department Baisingen and the local music association , the Vollmaringer had loaded a colourful mixture of different choirs and singing styles which the around 400 visitors entertained .	-8.4757
The MGV Vollmaringen opened with atmospheric songs such as " In the Wine Paradise " and " Lustig , her brothers " .	-4.5333
Their honorary singer Hubert Wermter made a small stand in honour - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart 's " Bundeslied " .	-3.9340
The men ’ s singer , Ana , also sang classical choral songs such as " Jägerwerben " by Julius Wengert , " Weit , weit , weg " by Hubert Goisern and the folk song " When you go through the valley " .	-5.7489
The Salzstetten Liederkranz ( Liederkranz Salzstetten ) , with his mixed choir and his group of women - the " Impulschor " - created the women 's quota of the festival .	-7.2377
The mixed choir kidnapped from Antos Gus to foreign countries with the Neapolitan folk " Santa Lucia " and " Eviva Espana " , while the " Impulchor " also resorted to foreign languages : " Liberatio " and " Hey Jude " belonged to their program .	-5.3576
The vocal department of the Baisinger Sportverein came back to home with " What is the Schwob ? " by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Pappert 's " Bierlied " , where the Vollmaringer Musikverein offered the crowning musical conclusion .	-5.9341
For the children there was a small side programme - " Grandma Hanne " alias Hannelore Stollsteimer performed a Kasperl Theatre and read a few stories about which the children had a good lunch .	-6.1309

Kenyan press outraged by controversial media law	-2.4136
“ We are in a frightening situation , and one can ask : what does Parliament think of simply abolishing judicial independence tomorrow ? ” was read in the newspaper , which considers the draft law not constitutional ?	-12.9122
“ The law is draconian and very punishable and we reject it , ” said Cyrus Kamau , Managing Director of the Capital Group , including CapitalFM , one of Kenya ’ s most prestigious independent radio stations and news websites .	-3.7281
He said that the new media tribunal “ will always be biased , because it is an extended arm of the government , ” and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya ’ s position in the global economy .	-2.7498
“ I hope the President listens to us and we appeal to him to reject this draft law and send it back to Parliament , ” he said .	-3.2624
According to The Star , the government , through the new law , “ takes the media effectively into a stranglehold , ” whereas The Standard , Democracy , and Freedom of Speech in Kenya , writes , had “ suffered a severe blow , ” and called the draft “ draconian . ”	-5.9762
The adoption of the law is part of a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the aftermath of the attacks by armed Islamists on the Westgate shopping centre in in in in in in .	-4.3737
The Kenyan media attracted the authorities ’ anger because they published shots of security cameras showing how the units sent to the location supposedly robbed the luxury shopping centre .	-6.9013
Police chief David Kimaiyo responded with the appointment of two journalists and a leading media representative to interrogation , even though the submission was withdrawn after a media outcry .	-4.4773
According to the new law , media houses can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings , and individual journalists with up to one million and the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation .	-4.9766
The tribunal also has the right to seize the possession of those affected if a penalty is not paid .	-3.1241
According to the Daily Nation , “ even one penalty can push most radio stations into bankruptcy . ”	-9.3885
Moreover , the newspaper believes that these measures could have a devastating impact on Kenya ’ s “ lively blogosphere . ”	-3.3863
If they silenced the media , politicians could do whatever they want with impunity .	-2.1263
“ Nobody will ever know , ” wrote Mutuma Mathiu , a journalist at the nation , who calls Kenyan media a decisive factor in public life .	-4.9386
“ Leave politicians to themselves , lead them into bankruptcy , and return to the time of hunters and collectors , ” he commented .	-4.1694
Kenyan legislators have already been causing public anger in the past .	-4.0754

Mayor Klumpp reminded us that recurring weather-related influences in the spring and autumn set the original lawn in such a way that it could not be played .	-5.7115
Fifteen years ago , we had the first reflections on solving the problem when we thought about building a third place at the football club or at the Realschule am Salinensee .	-6.4135
Both were rejected .	-2.1231
Six years ago , thoughts came up for the installation of an artificial grass sports field , which was generally regarded as the ultimate solution .	-5.7781
Specific plans were taken up two years ago , when the FC took over the Schabelstube in inheritance , promised a cost share of EUR 100 000 for the construction of the square , and the country approved grants of EUR 104 000 .	-5.7313
In October 2012 , the municipal council decided to take over the remaining EUR 356 000 at the total cost of EUR 560 000 , summarised Klumpp .	-3.9749
The construction of the 68 x 108 m artificial grass pitch took place on 4 June .	-4.7589

Vienna Airport abolishes passenger calls	-2.6262
Mr Max Maier , please come to Gate 24 .	-3.4367
Browsing like this will no longer exist at Vienna Schwechat Airport .	-5.6924
Much of the loudspeaker breaks away - the noise level is to be significantly reduced .	-5.7100
To create a more relaxed atmosphere is the goal of this innovation .	-3.0220
As Airport spokesman Peter Kleemann announced to Radio Wien , Vienna Airport is following an international trend with the cessation of passages affecting individuals .	-4.8963
For example , the airports in Copenhagen , Frankfurt or Dubai , among others , are already renouncing the noisy calls .	-4.4131
By eliminating these divergences - on average , around 200 personal calls from the loudspeakers in one day - it is expected to be more calm at the airport in future .	-8.4782
" It has also been shown in the experience that these individual breakthroughs have been perceived relatively little , but at the same time all other information on changed flights or departure times has fallen a bit here " , says Kleemann in conversation with the radio station .	-7.9116

One that wants to make the name of the programme .	-8.3728
According to the Lexicon , déjà vu is a psychological phenomenon that is expressed in the sense of having experienced or seen a new situation .	-5.4274
In the case of visiting the café at the Opschlag in the district town of Kleve in sight of the Rhine-Waal College , it does not have to stay with the pure Déjà Vu feeling .	-7.4693
After all , the Café with its beautiful name has the aim of making a real stay not only thoughtful , but always enjoyable .	-7.9267
Because it is fun and simply beautiful .	-3.2461
A look into the inner life at the optical 8 gives the viewer a good feeling .	-5.3748

The owners , both 33 years old , have already made a name for themselves as gastronomers before the opening of the pretty café at the Opschlag : in Kranenburg they led the " Art Lounge " .	-5.9212
From the move to Kleve to the Opschlag the pleasant café lovers hope for more audience .	-6.4119
Not least the university .	-3.3732
" Where we do not have a specific target group , " says Daniel Büttner .	-3.1624
Rather , the two students here want to address just as much as seniors and all age groups in between .	-4.7403

Two events were already there in the bright café .	-4.1833
Better said , one thing .	-1.9040
The harbour festival was rather outside - Café Déjà Vu did not benefit from it .	-4.3120
But there was also the ring-knevening .	-3.9513
" Beautiful , successful and funny , " the two 33-year-olds found .	-3.3357
But not everyone 's cause .	-2.5912
Maybe Daniel Büttner is not a big fan of events evenings either : " You can 't do it all right " .	-6.5892
And with an event I always speak only to those who are also interested in the special event .	-7.3482
For this reason , events will be the exception .	-9.2938
" We want to disrupt the normal operation as little as possible " .	-2.4290

UN proclaims New Poverty Targets	-2.8756
The United Nations is now beginning to draw up a series of new targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals announced twelve years ago to combat poverty .	-4.0547
In the run-up to the UN Sustainable Development Summit , which began in Rio de Janeiro in the evening , Australian diplomats played a key role in pushing for “ Sustainable Development Goals ” to replace the Millennium Goals that expire in 2015 .	-3.1822
They were included in the final draft of the document , which will be adopted by world leaders , including Mrs Gillard , at the summit .	-2.8435
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at the summit in the evening that the time had come to “ think beyond national interests . ”	-3.5606
“ I am pleased that member states have agreed to undertake a process to agree on universal , sustainable development goals , ” he said .	-3.9156
“ These goals will build on our progress on the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the post-2015 development framework .	-2.9686
I will spare no effort to implement this mandate given to me by the member states to realize our vision of the SDGs built on the success of the Millennium Goals . ”	-3.8612
Even though the SG Achim / Baden has been without victory for four days , the Handball Oberligist still has a good mood .	-10.4046
Trainer Tomasz Malmon leaves no doubt about this .	-2.7163
Everyone remains fully motivated .	-2.9782
However , I hope that we will finally win again .	-2.8116
" Because I don 't even know how such a victory tastes " , Malmon expects a success experience from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II .	-4.3203
Although the Third League Reserve from Fredenbeck has not yet cleared trees , Malmon warns the pointer in advance .	-5.8030
Many players have been trained in A-Youth .	-5.1420
Therefore , they will certainly be particularly motivated against their ex-coach .	-3.3300
" In addition , it is important to wait and see if there is a reinforcement from the first , " explains the SG Coach .	-6.3818
In order to finally return to the track of success , the Malmon team must definitely increase compared to the previous performances .	-4.9281
Most importantly in the coverage work and in the switching game , it was really big .	-9.0554
The exploitation of opportunities must also definitely be improved .	-4.1017
So I hope that my players have finally got their heads free during the short break .	-4.3120
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing in the face of clashes between influential personalities .	-2.3365
Thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo under the watchful eyes of the statue of Samora Machel , the founder of the state and the first president of Mozambique to join in a rare public demonstration .	-5.0274
“ We want peace again , we want stability , ” said Vanessa de Sousa , Managing Director of an investment company .	-2.3057
For fear of the country ’ s future , she has exchanged her business clothing for a t-shirt with the label “ We demand security ” in Portuguese and joined the crowd on Thursday in the capital ’ s independence square .	-6.2426
For two weeks , there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo , which are among the worst battles since the peace agreement over 20 years ago .	-4.8890
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement , initially supported by the White Rhodesia , and later by South Africa ’ s apartheid government , in an effort to destabilize the country ’ s independent government .	-4.1450
After the 1992 peace treaty , it became an opposition party .	-1.8632
Analysts find it unlikely that the country will return to a full-fledged conflict , but recent events have worried foreign investors and locals .	-3.6634
The fast-growing economy is at stake , because the discovery of huge gas reserves off the coast and coal deposits in the northwest could attract more than $ 50 billion of investment from companies like Rio Tinto , Vale from Brazil , Eni from Italy , and Anadarko from the US in the next few years .	-5.7650
The ruling Frelimo Party , the dominant force since 1975 , and Renamo blame each other for the tensions .	-2.0733
Renamo claims that the government provoked recent clashes by attacking its members in the province of Sofala , a traditional Renamo stronghold on 17 October .	-3.6334
The attacks on the former rebels escalated when government troops attacked Renamo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama , the group ’ s leader , Renamos declared spokesperson to the Financial Times .	-4.0268
The government blames Renamo for the clashes and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers .	-2.3500
President Armando Guebuza has tried to downplay concerns about instability .	-1.7983
On Wednesday , he told AFP , the French news agency , that Dhlakama regards himself as a “ loser , ” who “ wants to use all his remaining forces to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government . ”	-4.4813
Both Frelimo and Renamo emphasize that they want to avoid war .	-1.9772
But concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted as saying that Renamo gave up the 1992 peace agreement .	-3.2637
He said to the FT that he meant that Frelimo would no longer respect the agreement .	-3.8983
“ Our vision is to resume negotiations and to do so seriously , ” said Mazanga .	-3.3622
Earlier discussions between the parties have done little to resolve the tensions that have been fueled by a series of clashes this year .	-4.0732
“ We have here two adult men ( Guebuza and Dhlakama ) who collide the heads , ” says Joseph Hanlon , lecturer at the Open University and Mozambique expert .	-3.4809
None of them are well negotiated and nobody is prepared to make the necessary concessions .	-3.3895
Renamo , who is pushing for electoral reforms , has already said that she will boycott the local elections in November .	-3.3853
Presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for next year .	-1.4757
Some commentators have interpreted the use of force as an attempt by a disgraceful movement to obtain concessions and financial benefits from the government .	-3.0911
Renamo ’ s electoral successes have shrunk since 1992 , while a newer party , the Movimento Democrático de Mo<unk>ambique ( MDM ) , founded by a former Renamo member , is likely to improve in the elections .	-3.6067
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – whose resignation is due when his second term ends next year – wants to destroy the country ’ s democracy .	-2.5204
“ He does not want multi-party democracy , he does not want transparent elections , he does not want peace because he does not want to give up the presidency , ” says Mazanga .	-3.2232
It is unclear what capacity Renamo has , but it has made unrest attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important north-south route .	-10.5528
Most of the battles took place in the province of Sofala , which lies a few hundred kilometres north of Maputo , but is located in Beira , the port that mining companies like Rio Tinto and Vale use to export coal .	-5.2245
In June , Rio interrupted the use of the railways for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the track .	-3.4368
Mazanga responded cautiously to the question of whether Renamo would repeat this threat .	-3.0970
Renamo wanted to “ warn the international community that things are not good in Mozambique , ” said Mazanga .	-2.4817
Instability has increased frustration with the government , says Fernando Lima , head of Mediacoop , an independent media company , because many people have already worried about corruption , slow progress in development , and a recent wave of abduction .	-3.9495
“ People think that the government and the president are responsible for the country ’ s future and should be the one who finds solutions to the problems , ” he explains .	-3.0479
Omar Sultane , a demonstrator , said that people simply wanted stability .	-1.7421
“ No one is interested in Renamo and Frelimo , they just want peace and usable roads again , ” he said .	-3.4842
Children should be taught myths and legends as “ models of life , ” says an author .	-3.0542
Thor ’ s stories showed that “ brutal force has no chance against clever tricks , ” and the Artus legend demonstrates how important it is to have a dream .	-2.7304
But many of the myths are “ far too wild , too offensive , and in some cases too dirty to be taught at schools , ” which was why Crossley-Holland advocated a “ careful selection ” of age-oriented works .	-4.6308
“ I find it wonderful that myths and folklore are already part of education in America , ” he said .	-2.2614
I have been proposing this as a plan for twenty years .	-2.2578
He added that for authors and teachers who are “ excessively didactic , ” children would “ completely shut down ” , because in entertaining stories , the messages would be “ subdued . ”	-5.0869
Crossley-Holland , who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon , and who is the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales , said : “ You can pursue certain intentions , but you should keep them in the background as as much as possible . ”	-4.0313
Perhaps the greatest difference between an adult author who writes for adults and an author who writes for children is the need to convey hope .	-2.7507
Not everything needs to be simplified or lead to the happy end , but there is an immanent sense of good and evil .	-2.4400
It must be subliminal , through history revealed and not explained .	-4.6812
This is the old story of showing instead of telling .	-2.3065
Hansyakob Goes to Freihof	-2.8920
100 years ago , Heinrich Hansjakob took his retirement residence in Haslach , and on Sunday his last years became alive in the " Freihof " .	-4.3732
The many spectators were thrilled by the very short-lived scene game .	-5.1385

And then began the scene game , in which Alois Krafczyk once again glittered in his parade role as the great son of the city .	-4.7741
He was stylized by Erich Becherer from Mühlenbach with his twand " Black Forest Füchsen " .	-5.6854
He was not only received with much applause by the audience , but his sister Philippine also welcomed him .	-3.4490
Billy Sum-Hermann understood it incredibly well to put himself in the role of the sister and gave her immense life in mimics and gestures .	-4.8033
Between the different scenes , the Mühlenbach Farmer 's Chapel played carefully selected pieces of music and thus rounded off the performance .	-5.7698
Hassalch ’ s mayor , Heinz Winkler , was honored to award honorary citizenship to Hassalch , who , representing the former Hättich , together with a part of the city council , made his appearance .	-8.5435
Her upkeep subsequently made the three-royal singers , which led Hansjakob to declare : " Oh how beautiful , there are again youth memories of my own three-royal age alive " .	-7.4621
With their song " O Jesulein " they enjoyed the audience at the Freihof as well as the Storchentagskinder with their loud " Reise , Ed " .	-5.6658
Hansyakob expressed his criticism of the Church at the time , as well as his concerns about the excesses in agriculture , the consequences of industrialization , or the effects of war .	-5.6722
In his homeland , behind his tomb chapel on the fire near Hofstetten , he found his resting place .	-4.3927
" An unsettled mind had finally found its tranquillity and had gone home forever " , it was said at the end of the scene .	-5.2755
Much applause and many commendable words were received by the audience for the performance .	-3.7321

The Basketball project Hamburg Towers refrains from applying for a possible post office .	-4.0586
" We are not going to participate in the wildcard procedure , " said former national player Pascal Roller , who has been developing the concept for a professional club in the Hanseatic City since 2012 .	-4.4317
A first breathing was not heard from Ludwigsburg .	-3.9127
" We did not deal with the Wildcard procedure until Düsseldorf did not get a license , " said Neckar-Giesen-Boss Alexander Reil of our newspaper .	-4.6977
Up to 23 May , the beginner of Düsseldorf Basket can submit documents to the Arbitration Court and prove his suitability for the Bundesliga .	-6.5023
So far , the Rhine countries have been denied the license twice .	-3.4838
The arbitration court is the last instance .	-1.5859

In addition to the Eon power plant on site , the imported carbon goes to power plants in the inland region .	-9.1787
If the GDF-Suez power station is still on the grid , a good 5 million tonnes of coal imports per year are realistic .	-5.0446

Bavaria ’ s Basketballer Optimistic Despite First Defeat	-3.3607
Even the first defeat in the Euroleague could not diminish the enormous optimism of the basketballers of the FC Bavaria Munich .	-3.9601
" Nobody can forbid us to believe in winning against the best team in Europe over the past two years , " said Bavaria Coach Svetislav Pesic after the unfortunate 83 : 88 ( 39 : 47 ) on Thursday evening with the title defender Olympiakos Piraeus .	-4.7216
We sent the message : Basketball also exists in Munich !	-2.4751
In the third appearance in the European premier class the Munich people sold themselves very well for a long time , but were simply not sufficiently clear during the decisive stages .	-13.4890
The guests first managed to convert a 15-point backlog 13 minutes before the end into a guided tour before Piraeus gave the game a turn again .	-5.9079
" We have fought incredibly back against the two-time Euroleague Champion , but then made reckless mistakes , " said Bayern-Profi Yassin Idbihi .	-4.7889
We are proud of our performance , but we want to win every game .	-2.0911

Ben Greenman : Ten Years New York Comedy Festival : The New Yorker	-1.6185
One might say that New York City is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America : nearly a hundred years ago , the variety-artist Frank Fay , who worked as a Conférencier at the Palace Theatre on Broadway , began to tell the crowd directly jokes in the form of a conversation .	-4.6622
Over the years , Fay ’ s innovation has been expanded , as was the latest at the New York Comedy Festival .	-4.5495
Founded and managed by Caroline Hirsch , the founder of the stand-up institution Carolines , this year the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary with over sixty shows in small clubs and large theatres .	-4.2499
“ Most of these headliners began with Carolines and then became more and more successful until they were known to play in a club , ” said Hirsch .	-4.9182
We have designed this festival so that we can continue working with them .	-2.7962
At this year ’ s event , there are performances by Wanda Sykes , Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher , as well as by “ Stand Up for Heroes ” , an annual music and comedy benefit event for army operators at Madison Square Garden , where Bruce Springsteen , Jon Stewart , Roger Waters and Bill Cosby are performing .	-5.1369
With the festival the world of comedy has grown .	-2.9081
A number of comedians participating in the festival this year have become known through rather unconventional ways , such as broadcasts on smaller television channels such as Comedy Central , FX and Spike .	-4.5468
Nick Kroll became known with a sitcom on cable television ( the ironic and slippery fantasy football series " The League " on FXX ) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central .	-4.7998
Jenny Slate was part of the occupation at “ Saturday Night Live ” and “ Parks and Recreation ” , although she is best known for her viral video series “ Marcel the Shell with Shoes On ” .	-4.3790
Both Kroll and Slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices ( the surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik , the ironic , race-focused W. Kaumau Bell ) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy .	-3.2517
One of the greatest magnets of the festival is an interview : David Steinberg talks to Larry David .	-3.4516
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian , but has developed into a prestigious television and film director and an unofficial comedy historian .	-3.5649
From 2005 to 2007 he hosted a TV show entitled " Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg " at TV Land .	-3.3332
The meeting takes place in the Town Hall in the middle of Manhattan .	-7.7531
“ The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry ’ s entire work , ” Steinberg said .	-2.6611
He told me when he is here , he sometimes walks through the streets between two buildings and thinks : Hey , if I lose all my money , then perhaps I live here .	-4.3555

Drama in Uruguay : Young Killing Football DeMach	-6.4746
Two children admitted in Uruguay the murder of a 11-year-old .	-2.1519
The two 14 and 12 year-old boys had invited their sacrifice to go bird hunting with them .	-8.3960
Armed with machetes and knives on Tuesday , they accumulate the 11-year-old and threw the corpse into a fountain , reported the newspaper " El País " on Thursday .	-4.6065
Afterwards , they would have played football in front of their homes in a working-class district .	-8.1119
The corpse was found the following night in the village of Cerro Pelado , 15 kilometres north of the exclusive Punta del Este beach .	-3.6458
As an alibi , a five-year-old half-sister of the younger who took her with him should say that she had been sexually attacked by the boy .	-5.1807
But when the girl described the action before the police without mentioning an attack against them , the two boys admitted the deliberate killing of the 11-year-old .	-4.0081
As a reason , the elderly called , among other things , a rivalry in the football game .	-4.3604
It was provisionally incorporated into a psychiatric youth institution .	-3.6049
Hunters in prison	-4.4953
Due to exploitative human trafficking , pimping , threat , insult and dangerous physical injury , the Constance District has sentenced a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen to three and a half years in prison .	-4.9330
The former German army soldier , who worked as a gatekeeper after two missions in Afghanistan , made a confession as part of a process agreement .	-5.1508
Thus , in five cases , he met women through Internet or telephone contacts , which he sent to the bottom of the line after a few weeks against their will .	-6.6966
He fought resistance to break with violence and threats .	-3.0575
He retained the revenue of women , some of whom acquired it for years .	-5.0688
By confiscating mobile phones and SIM cards , he subverted women ’ s contacts to the outside world .	-3.4262
Together with a colleague who mediated women , he brought them to different brothels in the southwest .	-3.8384
There , he left them partly supervised to control their revenues .	-8.4345
In court , the defendant first claimed that he was suffering from a serious trauma after his colleagues in Afghanistan had died alongside him in an explosion .	-4.8358
After a psychiatric expert indicated great doubts about mental constraints and thus limited guilt , the 33-year-old made a comprehensive confession .	-5.8909
The court no longer had to hear any of the damaged women .	-3.1409
As one Kripo officer reported , at least four more cases of exploitative human trafficking could be identified after a first ad through telephone surveillance measures .	-4.9835
The intercepted talks had been characterised by high aggression .	-3.0876
In later interrogations , the injured would have confirmed their martyrdom .	-2.8506
Another witness , in which one of the women had discovered blue spots on the whole body , has not yet made any statement .	-5.7127

Oil Price Continues Up to $ 96 per Bar	-3.2746
The price of oil continued to fall on Friday , after worries about a high supply overshadowed a report that the energy-hungry manufacturing sector of China is growing .	-4.5547
The reference type for deliveries in December fell by 14 cents in electronic commerce at the New York Mercantile Exchange in Europe at the late morning to USD 96.24 per barrel .	-4.7971
The contract fell by 39 cents on Thursday , which meant a 5.8 percent drop in October .	-3.2444
The large crude oil supply has burdened prices in recent weeks .	-3.8545
On Wednesday , the US Department of Energy declared that the US supply increased by 4.1 million barrels last week .	-2.7293
Over five weeks , supply had risen by 25 million barrels .	-2.3752
But on Friday , there were indications of stronger demand through two reports of an increase in Chinese manufacturing activity .	-4.1112
This suggests a continued recovery in China ’ s economy , which grew to 7.8 % in the third quarter , after reaching its lowest level in the previous quarter for two decades .	-4.0541
Brent crude oil , a reference value for international crude oil , also used by US refineries , fell by 26 cents at the ICE Exchange in London to USD 108.58 per barrel .	-3.2057
Court blocks Decision on the NYPD Stop and Frisk Directive	-2.9072
On Thursday , a federal court in the US blocked the order of a judge calling for changes to the New York Police Department ’ s Stop and Frisk Programme ( “ Stop and Browse ” ) , and dismissed the judge from the case .	-6.2152
The 2nd US Court of Appeal declared that Judge Shira Scheindlin ’ s decisions would be suspended until the city ’ s appeal was decided .	-4.3828
The judge had judged in August that the city violated the Constitution by the way in which the programme for recruitment and inquiries was implemented .	-6.0653
The city appealed against its assessment and remedies , including the decision to set up a surveillance body to assist the police in amending their directive and the relevant training programme .	-5.3092
The Court of Appeal heard on Tuesday the arguments for the suspension requested .	-3.4994
The appeal report stated that the judge should be exempted from the case because she violated the code of conduct for US judges by stipulating that a judge should avoid the appearance of partiality ; this was partly justified by a series of media interviews and public statements in which she publicly responded to the Court ’ s criticism .	-5.8015
The judge had judged that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people because they unreasonably targeted black and Latin American men with the Stop and Frisk Programme .	-3.6339
She appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of essential changes , including reforms in directives , training , and service vision , and ordered a pilot program with body-borne cameras in districts where most checks were carried out .	-13.4179
In August , the city of New York agreed to put an end to the practice of storing names and addresses of people who were dismissed after police checks .	-11.0571
An oral negotiation on the city-appeal is planned after 14 March 2014 .	-4.6615
The Stop and Frisk tactics were criticized by a number of civil rights advocates .	-3.7672
Controls of this kind have existed in various forms for decades , but the number of checks recorded during the term of the partisan mayor Michael Bloomberg increased to an all-time high of 684.330 in 2011 , most of them black and Latin American men .	-4.7489
In 2004 , four men belonging to all minorities filed a complaint that became a collective action .	-5.5009
Advocates of changes to the NYPD ’ s Stop and Frisk Programme say that the changes will put an end to unfair practices , create a more trustworthy and effective police force , and influence the way other police presidents use the regulation .	-5.1096
Opponents believe that the changes would dampen the morality of the police , but not crime ; money would also be wasted and the broader problem of a police force that has been under pressure since thousands of jobs have been lost in the last decade .	-6.7366
The judge pointed out that it did not end the stop and haircut practice , which was constitutional , but only reform the nature of the NYPD ’ s implementation of the controls .	-4.8889

With this wisdom of Bedouin , the first chairman Wolfgang Henne described the history and fascination of the association " Helping Hands " .	-3.4813
On Saturday afternoon the tenth birthday of the association was celebrated , which can already have considerable success .	-4.4114
The first chairman Henne reported in detail about the work of the association .	-3.0224
In 2004 , he was the first time in Mauritania at the Cheijk Zajed hospital in Nouakchott .	-3.3973
As a result , further cooperation developed , and the gynaecologist Henne performed numerous operations on the site during several trips .	-6.1950
During the speeches , pictures of the stakes were shown on a large screen , so that the guests of the anniversary event could take a look at the aforementioned actions .	-5.8403
The desert vehicle of the association was also shown .	-3.1921
It is a former federal border protection vehicle .	-2.1375
Rainer Prewo , the former OB of Nagold , had proposed to equip this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and is now planning , according to Henne , to work with the association in an advisory role .	-5.0796
In 2008 Zimmerei Schleeh from Baiersbronn created a hospital in Socogim , a misery district on the outskirts of the capital - voluntarily .	-4.6298
Henne also mentioned a new Mother Child Hospital in Nouakchott .	-2.6666
Especially interesting in times when the birth clinic is to be rationalized in Nagold .	-3.3984
Much is learned in Africa as a medical doctor , according to Henne , for example , disinfection against burn-out .	-4.6616
Due to political unrest in the country , it was not possible to make as many trips as planned , but many medical professionals came to Germany to hospitate here in various areas .	-6.7074
In addition , containers are regularly sent to Africa with material , in March this year medical equipment , medicines , association material , hospital beds and glasses .	-4.7985
Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself provided ample local colony by telling Mauritania about Mercedes vehicles converted to the mobile goat-stall and describing the experiences of the Stammheim musicians who traditionally support the association during their Mauritanian journey .	-7.7148
As his personal motives , he called his work on auditing as a young Member .	-3.3450
When he realized how much money was lost on the road , he decided to help Africans control a budget by the people . the the .	-13.1011
Moreover , Fuchtel stressed that global economies also demand global human love .	-4.4394
Nor should it be forgotten that Africa is closer than some think .	-2.1880

Coulson put in phone hacking to review a tip .	-8.1709
Former News of the Word editor Andy Coulson allegedly used “ telephone hacking , surveillance , and confrontation ” to try to confirm a false tip about an affair of then-interior minister Charles Clarke .	-4.9856
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC explained to the Old Bailey Court that News of the World heard a false rumour in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with his “ attractive Special Advisor ” Hannah Pawlby .	-3.7551
The newspaper commissioned the private detective Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlby ’ s voicemails , and persecuted them , but Coulson also called them and left news as the court learned .	-4.1901
“ According to the prosecutor , Coulson , who is now the editor of the NotW , is no one who is standing in front of people ’ s homes and hopes to catch them on fresh action , but one who likes to confront people with a story to see their reaction , ” Edis said .	-7.1821
He said that NotW uses three methods to investigate stories : telephone hacking , surveillance and confrontation .	-2.6405
The publisher is personally involved in the third method .	-1.2086
Obviously he knows of the second , the surveillance , otherwise it cannot be .	-3.1199
What about the first ?	-1.1934
Does he know about telephone hacking ?	-1.8034
He denies that , but we say , “ And whether he knew of it . ”	-3.8229
Rumours about an affair of Clarkes were first taken up by NotW ’ s feature editorial , when a source of sexual interest to Pawlby was said : “ Don ’ t waste your time , it is associated with Charles . ”	-4.9769
A band with voicemails from their phone of at least three occasions was ensured in August 2006 in Mulcaires apartment .	-8.9055
The investigators also found entries on the detective ’ s computer , where Pawlby and her sister were stored as “ projects ” .	-3.4508
In the time the research went , the grandparents of Pawlby received anonymous calls asking them for information about them , Edis explained .	-4.8116
Meanwhile , former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup supervised the monitoring of Pawlby 's movements .	-2.6614
On 18 June 2005 , Coulson left her a voicemail with the following content : “ I have a story that we want to publish tomorrow , about which I would like to talk to Charles . ”	-3.7663
Edis explained that Coulson ’ s activities in this story followed the same pattern as other important personalities , such as former interior minister David Blunkett .	-3.6573
The juries heard on Thursday that Coulson Blunkett faced a married woman because of an affair when he himself was lied to the defendant Rebekah Brooks , who was married at that time .	-15.1320
Coulson and Brooks argue that they have conspired with others to hack phones between October 3 , 2000 and August 9 , 2006 .	-3.5560
Mulcaire , Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted telephone hacking .	-1.8601
In protest against the planned Reichenstadt , French soccer is actually going to go through the first strike since 1972 .	-5.3190
A conciliation meeting is coming to an end without results .	-3.5089
In the dispute over the Realm Tax , the French government and professional football have become a dead end after a failed conciliation meeting .	-6.5462
President Fran<unk>ois Hollande received representatives of associations and associations in Paris on Thursday and listened to their complaints .	-4.7113
But he refused to spare football from the planned 75 % levy on incomes of more than EUR 1 million per year , which all companies in the country are to pay for two years from 2014 .	-5.4723
The other side also remained tough .	-2.7826
The strike announced at the end of November will now be passed through , announced by the Chief Association of Profiklubs ( UCPF ) , Jean-Pierre Louvel .	-5.2260

No Absolute Protection	-3.3518
" We want to involve the inhabitants in planning at an early stage " , Mayor Jens Häu<unk>ler opened the Civil Information Event on the flood protection concept in Gechingen .	-5.2353
Around 80 participants had come to the municipal hall to explain the planned measures , ask questions , express concerns and bring ideas .	-5.2379
Häu<unk>ler made it clear : " The final decisions take the members of the council " .	-3.7944
The flood that caught on 15 May 2009 , unprepared , was a major event that raised the question of safeguards for the future , according to Häu<unk>ler .	-5.4055
A river area survey was commissioned with the neighbouring municipality of Aidlingen , which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen .	-5.9217
" The protection of as many plots as possible is the goal " , says Häu<unk>ler .	-4.3832
The planning of the protection against a flood , according to the German Weather Service , is based on statistics every 100 years to be expected .	-5.8528
Climate change is taken into account by a 15 % surcharge .	-2.3720
In specialist circles this is called " HQ 100aKlima " .	-3.9039
The water masses , which had caused considerable damage in Gechingen in 2009 , corresponded to a 1000-year flood .	-4.6642
" There is no absolute protection , but we can achieve a relative improvement " , says Häu<unk>ler .	-3.2189
In order to achieve the HQ 100a climate protection , around EUR 4 million must be invested in Gechingen , with the municipality expecting some 70 % of state subsidies .	-6.7840
But Häu<unk>ler pointed out that funding only exists if an overall concept is implemented .	-4.2265
To this end , the community needs the participation of the citizens .	-4.3450
A complex planning and approval procedure must be completed .	-3.4218
At best , implementation could begin in 2016 .	-2.4787
Among other things , the protection concept , which was presented in the municipal council last week ( we reported ) , provides for local measures in the flow of the River Irm from the Stammheimer Valley .	-5.0069
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept , participants took advantage of the opportunity to raise their concerns .	-3.6356
Among other things , it was questioned why no more dams and restraint basins were planned to protect the place .	-4.3623
Gregor Kühn , expert planner of the commissioned engineering office Forest and Corbe from Hillsheim , who presented the concept , stressed that it needed the interaction of all the measures presented to achieve the desired goal in the sum .	-5.2532
In addition , one should find the most economical solution , according to Joachim Forest of Forest and Corbe .	-3.5098
Discours reigned in those of the old town who , even in normal thunderstorms , have repeatedly suffered congestion from the channel network .	-8.2756
The problem is well known in the administration and the first measures have already been taken .	-3.9080
However , Häu<unk>ler pointed out that the directives on channel systems are different from those for flood protection and should not be mixed up .	-5.1423
The municipality is obliged to interpret the channel network in such a way that two to three years of rain could be coped with .	-4.7624
Making the sewage channels larger would devour millions .	-4.2114
After Crisis	-3.9581
In the early Friday afternoon two drivers were seriously injured on the state road 44 near Revensdorf .	-4.2530
The police immediately blocked the road completely , but could say little about the accident .	-3.9423
However , there are several testimony statements that should be evaluated .	-8.9011
What is certain is that the 19-year-old Lenkerin of a VW Golf went towards Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf met her with his Hyundai .	-4.5461
Both vehicles clashed , and the woman was so heavily clamped that the fire brigade needed just under half an hour to get them out of the vehicle wreck .	-14.0470
The real cause of the accident was initially unresolved .	-3.7919
Both accidents came to nearby hospitals .	-3.1539
The track remained closed for about two hours .	-3.1997
It could be called the Dostoevsky of the United States .	-3.0461
Philip K. Dick was a god searcher , a metaphysicist , his novels and narratives also have something serial .	-3.0067
Amazing the exterior kinship : the stinging eyes , the beard , the high forehead .	-4.6643
And just as Fjodor M. Dostoyevski , with his massive oeuvre , is understood as the founder and apologist of the Russian soul , Philip K. Dick is read as an American prophet who is true in his own country .	-5.4642
Some titles have been published in the Heyne publishing house , the Haffmans cassette with the 118 stories sells two-thousand one .	-5.2150
Dick explains America - the realm of breathtaking technical progress , coupled with paranoia , security madness , and the belief to be chosen .	-4.4252
Dick had divine experiences , his late books read like a mixture of the revelation of John and a computer manual .	-3.6737
Perhaps he was crazy , had drugs added to his brain .	-2.7151
He has already captured early that the computers are divinities .	-5.4376
He wrote a theology of the computer and asked what distinguishes a person from a machine , the creator from his creature .	-3.0287

" We collect individuals who have not violated any law , " says the head of the authority .	-3.5573
" We grab them before they can commit a violent crime " .	-2.9264
" In our society there are no serious criminals , for which we have a criminal camp full of pesudo criminals , " they read time flows .	-5.2888
They assume that bad things happen and prevent the criminal idea from being put into practice .	-3.9116
Dick ’ s narrative looks like the blueprint for the anti-terrorism laws and the NSA ’ s interception noise .	-4.5479
Anticipation of the attack : Obama ’ s drone philosophy and practice also works .	-2.9735
But Dick ’ s story is not over .	-2.2580
The police chief complains that there is no longer a separation of powers , the military controls everyday life - and what is left of the state .	-3.6733

Showing Merkel in Russia	-4.9992
Former US intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum in the US sphere of Chancellor Angela Merkel .	-3.7547
Representatives of the German Bundesanwaltschaft could either ask questions in writing or personally meet the 30-year-old in Russia , reported the agency Interfax .	-4.3829
Previously , Hans-Christian Ströbele , the Greens ’ Bundestag member , met Snowden in Moscow yesterday as the first German politician to talk to him about the affair .	-5.1294
NSA revelations reinforce corporate paranoia for state surveillance	-2.8904
On a mild day at the end of August , a German police helicopter flew deep across the US Consulate in Frankfurt am Main , Germany ’ s financial capital .	-3.3836
On the instruction of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection and Terrorism Control ( BVT ) , the German Interior Security Service , he should photograph the roof of the US outpost , which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank .	-5.1132
According to German media , the BVT wanted to prove the presence of surveillance antennas and the action led to a change of words between the US and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin .	-4.1081
In September , James Clapper , US Director of National Intelligence , once again insisted that the US did not use foreign espionage to “ steal foreign companies ’ business secrets on behalf of US firms , so that they could increase their international competitiveness or profits . ”	-5.4873
But since Edward Snowden , the former Whistleblower employee , began publishing his fullhorn to US surveillance secrets , European governments and corporate leaders have become unsure whether they can take the director at his word .	-5.1911
Reports that the US National Security Agency spilled Petrobas , Brazil ’ s oil company , and acquired data from American cloud providers , including Google and Yahoo , have brought corporate paranoia to a new peak for state surveillance .	-5.9401
The barrel to overflow revealed that Chancellor Angela Merkel ’ s phone was wounded , perhaps for ten years .	-4.1127
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted , then corporate leaders are certainly potential targets .	-4.1681
Snowden has made the intensive cooperation between US intelligence services and companies transparent .	-2.8070
I believe that it is conceivable that these data will be used for , .	-3.9288
“ Germany has to wake up , ” explains Oliver Grün , President of BITMi , who represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany .	-2.6625
German companies believe that the US now represents almost as much a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft , a survey published by the EY consultancy in July .	-12.0412
However , in Snowden ’ s leaked documents , there has been no evidence that the US has passed on foreign companies ’ business secrets to its own companies .	-5.3420
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacked certain IT and Internet opportunities and should reduce its dependence on the US .	-3.2967
Companies are sceptical about this .	-1.4846
In the Bundestag it was proposed that we should build a German Google .	-2.7577

The fact that economic espionage is taking place is no surprise .	-2.1708
That has always been the case .	-1.2839

The parents of the teenager , whose corpse was found in a rolled ring mat in the gym of his High School , are convinced that their son was murdered , explained the family lawyer on Thursday .	-4.3178
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta in the US state of Georgia was found on January 11 in an upright mat behind the grandstand in the school gymnasium .	-4.8403
The Sheriff of Lowndes County investigators concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident , but this doubts the 17-year-old family .	-3.7915
“ They are convinced that their son was murdered , ” explained Benjamin Crump , the lawyer of Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson , to FoxNews.com.	-2.8663
They would never have believed that he died as the Sheriff concluded .	-3.1059
“ They believe that it lacks any logic to violate the laws of physics as well as common sense , ” Crump says .	-4.3459
Instead , they are convinced that the truth is hidden to protect the person or person responsible for the death of their son .	-3.3226
“ Your son went to school to learn and came back in the body bag , ” he commented .	-3.7291
US Public Prosecutor Michael Moore said on Thursday that there will be a formal investigation into the death of Johnson , as a number of important issues remain unresolved .	-3.6326
What was the cause of death ?	-0.6718
Is his death due to a crime ?	-1.4541
Moore said at a press conference on Thursday afternoon .	-3.2734
I follow the facts in which direction they lead .	-2.8005
My aim is to find out the truth .	-1.6979
“ I believe there is a sufficient basis for formal investigation , ” he said .	-3.0942
Moore explained to reporters that the initial autopsy suggests that Johnson died of the consequences of a “ position-related incitement . ”	-3.9433
A second autopsy , however , caused another cause of death , according to Moore .	-3.0899
“ There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed , ” he said .	-1.9515
Moore added that if there is sufficient evidence for a criminal or civil investigation into the death of Johnson , he will instruct the FBI to carry out the investigation .	-4.0322

CDC Publish Allergy Guidelines for schools	-3.1034
On Wednesday , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) published a series of guidelines for dealing with food allergies of children in schools .	-3.0780
These are the first such directives that the US government has issued , as the number of children with food allergies with a compulsory education rises .	-5.1344
One in 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy .	-1.9894
According to CDC , the spread of food allergies among children has increased by 18 % between 1997 and 2007 .	-8.4080
The guidelines contain information for schools to raise awareness of food allergies in the teaching body and staff and how to deal with children who show allergic reactions .	-5.0508
It is also recommended that schools have epinephrin in stock – the auto-injection of the EpiPen brand is most commonly used – to counter a potentially deadly hypersensitivity reaction .	-4.4221
Legislators in the states have recently changed the rules to make it easier for schools to keep epinephrine in stock .	-4.2691
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms mentioned by children who have an allergic reaction .	-3.0433
Children may say , “ It feels like something is pressed on my tongue , ” “ My tongue feels like a hair is on it , ” or “ My tongue cribbles ” .	-4.8351
Parents of intersex children can choose “ gender indefinite . ”	-3.2241
Germany is the first European nation to recognise a third gender for children born with ambiguous genitals .	-2.5150
Newborns are no longer assigned rigid male or female .	-3.7557
According to the new law , parents no longer have to declare sex for such children , but can specify “ indeterminate ” or “ unspecified ” at birth certificate .	-5.2489
The aim of the law is to take the pressure of parents so that they do not have to take hasty decisions on operations for gender allocation in newborns and to combat discrimination against intersex people .	-5.5313
According to the BBC , an intersexual person said , “ I am neither man nor woman . ”	-2.8283
I remain mutilated and full of scars the patchwork created by doctors .	-2.9270
It is estimated that one in 2,000 children are not born as boys or girls every year .	-4.1869
They are among the intersexuals , a group that is diagnosed with “ sex differentiation disorder ” ( DSD ) , a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes , germ glands ( ovaries or testicles ) or unusually developed genitals .	-7.6632
Wallis Simpson may have been intersexual .	-2.2776
The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed , but most experts in the US suggest using the best available information on gender allocation if a provision is not possible , rather than waiting for the child ’ s psychological and physical development before choosing – if any – an operation .	-6.4374
The New York psychiatrist , Dr. Jack Drescher , who specializes in the problem of gender identification , said that the new German law “ sounds good after a good thing . ”	-3.7856
Intersexual children are an ethical dilemma .	-1.4389
“ Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgical intervention , but most children do not . ” he said .	-3.3971
You can assign gender without surgery and then wait for identity to develop .	-4.2416
The scientific data on how a child develops its gender identity is not very accurate .	-3.2113
No one knows why it is happening .	-1.8979
It is like the secret why people are gay .	-1.6526
A report to the European Commission in 2011 states that intersex people should be distinguished from transsexuals or transgender persons , because their status is not gender-based , but is based on their biological constitution , which is neither exclusively male nor female , but typically defines both simultaneously or not clearly as one of them .	-5.5262
These characteristics were reflected in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle mass , hair , breasts and stature , priority sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals , chromosomal structures and hormones .	-4.4876
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination that intersex and transgender persons face in professional life and the extent of harassment , violence and prejudice .	-4.2437
Boys who do not match the gender picture now have a special camp .	-3.6179
In the meantime , in Australia and Nepal , it is possible for adults to specify male , female , or “ third sex ” on official documents .	-10.0896
In June , Australia ’ s Norrie May-Welby ( 52 ) was recognized as the world ’ s first “ sexeless ” person after a court granted a lifelong “ unspecified ” gender status .	-5.1277
In addition to M and W , German cards will have a third allocation , X for intersexually , according to the Ministry of the Interior .	-4.4058
In neighboring France , gender issues are still controversial , according to a news message on France 24 .	-3.9788
In 2011 , dozens of French members of the strictly Catholic country signed a petition that “ gender theory ” should be removed from school books .	-2.2708
The US website , Catholic Online , has also spoken out against German law on the grounds that “ if the world is dragged into a new state , where gender is a choice , but sexual activity is not , we are twisting two more pillars of civilization . ”	-5.4108
The mother of a newborn Maryland told Baby Zone that she would be better if babies were assigned a gender at birth .	-4.5955
“ Parenthood is stressful enough , even without further restrictions , especially if you don ’ t know the sex of your child , ” she said .	-5.7470
Children need stability and security .	-0.6225
Historically , children born with both male and female genders were called hermaphrodites , according to the attractive Greek god who had both sexes .	-4.0756
Ten years ago , medicine viewed gender as something that could be erased and rebuilt .	-3.7144
But the ethical foundations of an operation are now being questioned , now that we know how complex the gender identity is , and that doctors can be wrong because they do not know how the child feels with the sex assigned to it when it grows up .	-6.0980
“ In the middle of the 20th century , one called it a psychiatric emergency , ” Drescher said .	-4.0681
When such a child was born , it was not the psychiatrist , but the surgeon .	-3.1921
The dominant theory about the treatment of children with ambiguous genitals stems from John Money from John Hopkins University , who believed that gender was formable .	-5.0642
He coined the term “ gender identity , ” and argued that social and environmental impulses – like parents educate a child – interacted with a child ’ s genes and hormones , so as to determine whether a person considers himself male or female .	-5.8118
But in a case known as “ John / Joan ” in 1966 , his theories became controversial .	-2.8661
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been separated from the boy in the event of a boiled circumcision , to castraze the child completely and also to remove his testicles and then raise him as a girl .	-7.7686
“ Money presented this case as a successful example of a conversion , but it was not , ” Drescher said .	-3.5915
When the boy was about 15 , he moved back to the male sex and married a woman .	-2.5252
With 38 but he committed suicide .	-2.1590
According to Drescher , there are still doctors who would practice this model .	-1.9056
But , in the 1990 ’ s , with the Internet ’ s entry , survivors of these sex operations came to the public , “ unhappy with the result . ”	-5.2382
For example , Jim Bruce , a 36 year-old Montana author born with XY-male chromosomes , but ambiguous genitals .	-2.7006
The doctors were not clear whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a “ satisfying life ” as a man .	-4.7280
So his external organ and the testicles were surgically removed shortly after birth in 1976 , and he was raised as a girl .	-4.1830
At the age of 12 he received female hormones .	-1.9411
“ I knew I was not a girl , ” he told ABCNews.com .	-2.4993
I was unhappy , but it was really difficult to ask questions .	-1.9143
At the age of 18 he should receive a vaginal plastic .	-2.5950
But , because he was depressive and knew that something was wrong , he demanded his medical files .	-3.3663
What he found was shocking .	-0.8650
I was sterilized at my birth – and no one ever told me that .	-8.4759
Bruce was born with a DSD through which his body could not produce enough testosterone to develop the genitals .	-2.5153
After learning the truth , he switched back to male identity , received testosteron injections and removed his breasts .	-4.6270
The surgery has made it infertile .	-2.6761
Today , he fights for others in an organization called Interface Project for perceiving intersexual people as normal .	-3.5168
But Anne Tamar-Mattis , Managing Director of the California Advocates for Informed Choice legal group , worries that German law can “ encourage stamping and stigmatizing . ”	-3.2002
“ Many activists are worried that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick choices and to assign a “ not fixed ” to the child , ” she said .	-6.0385
We are afraid that this will encourage intervention .	-4.3718
We think it would be better to assign male or female sex and then wait .	-9.4919
But we do not yet know how the law will affect , so we can only speculate .	-3.2516
Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports Australian law , because “ it allows adults to recognize as a third sex . ”	-4.1659
“ Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal gender , ” she explained .	-3.0786
The German law is about the allocation of birth .	-8.0110
This is not a fight to which small children should be forced at this time .	-3.5596
When they are adult , they can decide their own body .	-3.4973
But Dr Arlene Baratz , a pittsburg brustadiologist who has a daughter with a sexual disorder and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group , says that German law “ empowered ” both parents and children .	-4.5547
Katie , the daughter of Baratz , was born with male chromosomes , but has a DSD named complete androgen resistance .	-3.0143
Due to the recipe defect of the target cells for testosterone , catie developed female characteristics .	-4.0210
It has a vagina , but no uterus and no ovaries .	-2.1475
Today , Katie 29 is married ; she is working at the University of Pennsylvania as a child psychiatry employee .	-8.0052
Although it is infertile , it hopes to be able to get a child through adoption or surrogacy .	-3.9708
“ The law gives parents room , so they don ’ t have to make hasty decisions , ” Baratz said .	-4.1312
It gives them time to make different tests and clarify things , giving them time before writing “ male ” or “ female ” .	-4.1237
In this way , everything is fine – you pull the child large and love it .	-5.0568
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy parental happiness .	-2.6249
And you don ’ t need to hurry up an operation that can ’ t be undone .	-5.3140
“ This includes the children in the decision and eliminates the fear that parents are driving because they think they are not doing the right thing , ” she explained .	-5.7620
Ultimately , the child decides on the sex that fits better with him – and that is wonderful .	-4.1086
This will enable children to make their own decisions .	-2.7960
Unknown injures Girls by Car Shot	-3.5857
Unknown people have injured a twelve-year-old in Saxony-Anhalt when shooting from a .	-4.0372
On Thursday evening in Genthin , the perpetrators probably fired an air pressure weapon on a group of children .	-3.6448
This was communicated by the police in Burg .	-3.5823
The girl was easily injured on the left side .	-2.8681
Rescue forces brought the girl to hospital .	-2.2359
The shot came from a small car that had passed a group of six children and suddenly stopped .	-10.0377
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car .	-1.8777
The perpetrators also shot at a bus stop .	-1.9365
A disc broke down .	-2.0198
They then drove away .	-2.3712
The police investigated it on Friday .	-2.8224
Until now , the Kempten police inspection can look back on a quiet Halloween night .	-3.0574
Officials were only called twice to protest children , who threw them against house facades .	-5.6581
Since the owners detected this in time and removed the ovaries immediately , no material damage should have occurred .	-7.0638
In addition , some New Year 's Eve pilots were lit in the city area , but there was no material damage .	-7.4424
A resident in the Bischof Friunddorfer Way reported that his car was wrapped in clopapier and his wheel blinds were removed .	-7.2582
Until the police arrived , however , the man found all of his blinds in the immediate vicinity , so the police did not have to continue working .	-7.4546
Housing with a Future Perspective	-2.2140
In fact , Waltraud Ries lives dreamfully .	-3.0587
Your house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with lots of green , old trees , nice neighbours and not too much traffic .	-3.5139
The city is only a few minutes away by public transport .	-3.1486
" Hopefully you are not afraid of spiders ? " asks Waltraud Ries and points to a fat spider on the door frame .	-3.4169
I have been looking for a new apartment for my husband and myself for some time .	-2.5100
But you know how difficult it is in Stuttgart .	-2.0921
The reason , however , is not a spider phobia , but the concern that at age the many stairs to the house and the apartment can no longer be copied explains it .	-7.3571
In addition , since a meniskus operation , the mid-fifties have had to learn on their own body what it means to move from floor to floor with handicap .	-5.8915
Recently , a book by her appeared on the subject of ' Happy Living in Age - Which way of living is the best for me ? ' .	-6.1166
'Our apartment is the best example of what doesn 't work in old age ' , she begins to tell .	-4.8421
When she moved with her husband to the maisonette apartment more than 20 years ago , it was simply a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green .	-4.4091
Today , with the middle of fifty , Waltraud Ries thinks differently about it . the .	-7.9434
However , she also knows that she is one of the few people dealing with the issue of ' living in old age ' .	-4.7000
Most of them displace as long as it goes .	-4.9574
Old are always only the others ' , she says smiling .	-5.0531
Only when the pressure of suffering is really great do you worry .	-4.5467
'Then it can be too late ' , says Ries .	-3.5405
In her book , the interior designer presents 17 living models for a self-determined living at age .	-4.3545
'Which form of living you choose is always an individual decision ' , she explains .	-4.3230
D i e solution there is not for age .	-1.6144
Even those who can afford retirement in Tuscany or Brittany should always think that they can become ill .	-4.4561
And : ' Without good knowledge of the local language , you can also unite in the Dolce Vita , ' the specialist book writer will consider willing to leave .	-8.5842
Among their models are classical care models , alternative forms of living or the often cited pensioners ' WG .	-10.2758
At Age , everyone has their ticks and macks .	-5.6255
" For me , such a community would be nothing , " she says with an eye twinking .	-5.5732
Not at all as in a student WG with a shared bathroom and a kitchen .	-4.1046
" At the age you just need your retreat rooms " , says Ries .	-5.8510
However , the author does not want to rule out the fact that a senior residential community can still work .	-4.7560
However , this must be done differently than in the classic Studenten-WG .	-5.4319
And sometimes you just want to rest , ' she believes .	-4.1027
With this view , it is not alone , at least in the state capital .	-4.2445
'Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own home for as long as possible ' , is also the experience of Theresa Rütten , the Head of Citizens ' Services Life at the age of the provincial capital .	-5.4095
Your office advises people on the subject of ' becoming older ' .	-5.0256
That is why it is precisely the elderly who would often accept inconveniences and restrictions , only to be able to stay in their familiar surroundings , is also the experience of the Warentest Foundation .	-7.4143
Today , there are many ways to make the house or apartment accessible .	-3.9237
Ries recommends that all those who are concerned with the reconstruction of their house or apartment should first inform themselves thoroughly and not hire the first craftsman .	-8.0700
Today there are also specialists for the reconstruction according to age .	-4.2425
Even in the rental apartment one or more can be realized , and if it is only the height of the toilet , the interior designer clarifies .	-6.2457
But it is not always possible to change the existing apartment according to age and thus to make it accessible , even if it is so beautiful . .	-10.8491
This experience had to be made by Waltraud Ries .	-2.0955
It is possible to install a stairlift inside the apartment , which is also paved with stairs up to the apartment door , but that would be a much bigger obstacle .	-7.6977
She will continue her search until she has found the ideal object for herself and her husband .	-2.9863
Before moving , she gray more than before the spider on her home door .	-5.5382
US Want to continue prosecuting Snowden	-3.1651
The US has not changed its position as former US intelligence officer Edward Snowden .	-2.0994
He is still accused of illegally passing on secret information .	-14.0091
As a result , he has to face a criminal trial in the US , said US State Department spokesman Jennifer Psaki in Washington .	-4.6077
The recent statements by Snowden would not change this either .	-3.6650
Previously , after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow , German Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele had called on the US not to continue to threaten him with punishment .	-4.1180
Psaki stressed that Ströbele ’ s remarks were those of a parliamentarian , not that of a German member of government .	-4.7303
Edward Snowden , the intelligence officer , is always ready to talk to German authorities .	-5.7726
First of all , however , he wants to clarify his situation .	-3.0294
This was made clear by the US-sought former NSA staff in an unaddressed letter published by the Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwarded to the Federal Government , the Bundestag and the Advocate General .	-5.9262
Following a translation spread by ströbele , the following wording is as follows : : : , , , , , , . . . . .	-9.4889
The Companies	-2.7812
I was asked to write to you about your investigation into mass surveillance .	-2.5622
I am the name of Edward Joseph Snowden and I used to be contractual or directly employed as a technical expert at the National Security Agency ( NSA ) , the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) and the Defense Intelligence Agency ( DIA ) of the United States .	-4.1491
In the course of my work in these institutions , I witnessed systematic violations of the law of my government , which led me to act on a moral basis .	-4.9808
As a result of the publication of these concerns , I was faced with a serious and persistent hate that forced me to leave my family and my home .	-4.5437
I live in exile and enjoy temporary asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation under international law .	-2.2967
I am encouraged by the response to my political action , both in the United States and elsewhere .	-2.3873
Citizens around the world and also senior officials - including the United States - have judged the revelations of a system of all-embracing surveillance that is not accountable to anyone as a service to the public .	-4.1411
These espionage revelations resulted in many proposals for new laws and directives aimed at the previously concealed abuse of public confidence .	-13.5389
The benefits for society from these findings are becoming clearer and , at the same time , the risks incurred have been significantly reduced .	-5.3710
Although the result of my efforts has been demonstrably positive , my government continues to treat dissent as a fiduciary and strives to criminalise and prosecute political expression .	-4.8540
Still , speaking the truth is not a crime .	-1.8358
I am confident that the United States Government , with the support of the international community , will take this damaging stance .	-3.9382
I hope that , when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved , I will be able to participate adequately and legally in the responsible clarification of the facts relating to the statements made in the media , particularly with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports .	-5.7382
I look forward to meeting you in your country as soon as the situation is resolved and thank you for your efforts to uphold international law that protects us all .	-3.9647

Kindergarten found a Private Buyer	-2.3664
" The building is in good hands " , says Winterlingen Mayor Michael Maier .	-1.7450
The former kindergarten in the Garden Road has been sold to a private person .	-3.6177
The local council agreed to the sale in its recent meeting in the non-public part .	-4.3819
The building changed its owner at a " reasonable " price .	-2.6717
" The community is satisfied " , emphasises Maier .	-3.0535

Report : Obama ’ s campaign considered replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton	-9.3101
President Barack Obama ’ s closest advisers secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton in the 2012 election campaign , the New York Times argued .	-2.9016
The revelation is the most remarkable surprise of the long-awaited work by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann on the 2012 election campaign , “ Double Down : Game Change 2012 . ”	-3.2845
The Times has a copy of the book that will be published soon , and it reported on Thursday evening that the president ’ s top advisers had “ held extensive group meetings and polls at the end of 2011 ” to see if it looks better for Obama ’ s declining hope of re-election if he drops bids .	-7.0850
According to Jonathan Martin , the Times ’ national political correspondent , the book thoroughly traces the history of the efforts of leading Campaign and White House officials , notably the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley , to measure the effect on the polls that former Secretary of State Clinton has on exchanging the vice-president .	-5.9734
Potential change was a strictly guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office .	-3.1786
Only half a dozen of the president ’ s closest advisers – including Daley , Obama ’ s former campaign leader , Jim Messina , and former White House senior advisers , David Axelrod , and David Plouffe – knew about the planned change .	-3.8020
“ Double Down ” claims that Daley has been at the forefront of efforts to exchange Biden despite her “ close personal relationship , ” before deciding against such a move after the data showed that Clinton ’ s candidacy would “ not significantly improve Obama ’ s chances . ”	-5.5253
In an interview with Martin , Daley confirmed that the government had actually considered replacing Biden with Clinton .	-2.2241
“ I said a whole series of things to consider , and that was one of them , ” Daley explained to the magazine .	-4.0687
It must be remembered that the President had terrible polls at the time , so we thought , “ For God ’ s sake , what do we do ? ”	-4.5445
While Daley described the investigation as “ due diligence , ” Martin told CNN ’ s Anderson Cooper that during the campaign for re-election , considerable effort was required to find out whether such a move would pay off in terms of the ballot box .	-6.1027
“ In campaigns , not so much money is spent on surveys and focus groups if you don ’ t think seriously about something , ” Martin said on AC360 .	-4.3836
But it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team thought about exchange .	-2.7333
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley whether his boss at the time knew about the potential change .	-3.0865
Although Daley stated that he did not believe that the president was “ aware of the possible change , ” the former chief of staff admitted that it was “ possible ” that Obama knew about it .	-4.2168
Martin added that “ Double Down ” does not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether Obama ’ s political explorations had reached his desk .	-4.0088
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama did not know about whether to drop Biden in the election .	-4.5888
“ Possible , ” Martin replied .	-1.8922
What happens on the road with my email ?	-2.4533
E-mail actually means an electronic letter .	-3.0874
Was e-mail technically implemented in the design of the Internet service similar to conventional mail ?	-6.2944
In the conception of early Internet services , the focus was on making communication possible .	-3.8495
Therefore , the basic technical protocols have not taken care to establish a stable foundation for a hearing safe correspondence .	-6.1013
Therefore , a conventional email is more like an open postcard than a sealed letter .	-3.4487
If the user " Anna " sends an email to " Benni " , are the computers of the two connected directly ?	-3.3291
In the first step , the email program or browser from Anna sends the mail to the mail server of its . the the . the the the . the the . the . the	-10.8771
For example , if it has a GMail account , it would be Google .	-2.9938
This mail server sends the content to the provider Benni uses .	-1.9555
On the track , the mail can run over many other servers on the Internet .	-4.5365
Bennie can then call the content from his provider .	-2.5660
Will conventional e-mails be read through the network ?	-4.1832
Most mails are read by software robots on the road .	-3.3948
The sender 's provider usually checks whether the mail contains a malicious program as an attachment .	-4.7607
A virus check is also carried out on the receiver systems .	-2.6379
In addition , the providers check whether this is an annoying and undesirable spam mail that is immediately deleted or sorted out into a spam folder .	-5.9290
Do the robots have another task ?	-1.9508
For systems like GMail , the robot also determines the information Google needs to place context advertising .	-3.0908
If Anna and Benni communicate via GMail about their next holiday trip , Google may provide links to holiday offers .	-4.9063
Do unknown people also read the emails ?	-3.2429
The likelihood of unauthorized people reading a mail is very low .	-3.7884
In theory , however , this is possible .	-2.6536
In companies , administrators often have the opportunity to read electronic mail .	-3.1619
The law enforcement authorities and secret services also have legal means of intercepting or notifying e-mails .	-4.1888
Possible illegal outbreaks are also added .	-5.9824
Is it possible to protect e-mails against reading ?	-3.2307
With an encryption according to the OpenPGP standard , an e-mail can be encrypted effectively against read .	-4.1657
It is also possible to hide the metadata of an email communication with a high degree of technical effort , so that it is not even possible to detect who has communicated with whom .	-6.5255
How important are Yahoo and Google on the email market in Germany ?	-1.9000
Yahoo and Google , according to a study by Convios Consulting from August 2013 , play only a minor role in the mailboxes mainly used privately .	-5.4463
While the shares of Yahoo-Mail have recently fallen , GMail has increased significantly .	-4.8568
Sharing Mother in the Forest and Capturing Pension	-4.6246
When his betrayed mother died , a man from Wolfsburg forged a plan .	-2.8783
He buried the dead in a forest - and continued to collect their pensions and carers .	-4.8953
A 67-year-old Wolfsburg buried his dead mother after investigations by the police in the forest in order to be able to keep the pension and caregiver .	-7.1836
First of all , he hidden the death of the 89 year-olds , then he cut the money for more than a year and a half .	-5.7311
Now the 67-year-old must be responsible for fraud , as a speaker said on Friday .	-3.1694
So the man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt .	-2.5533
The man was suspected back in May : at that time , it was noticed that no medication was needed for the nursing mother .	-6.2448
He told the pensioner that his mother had travelled to Spain .	-3.1541
Because officials found this strange , they continued to investigate .	-4.2188
It came to pass that the two had lived in a common flat for more than 15 years and had last cared for it .	-5.7608
The 67-year-old finally admitted the death of his mother .	-2.6122
According to the police , an obduction found no evidence of a capital crime .	-3.2801
Want to see ice cream shining in the dark ?	-2.9907
A British entrepreneur has developed the first shining ice in the dark – with the help of jellyfish .	-4.0153
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent characteristics of marine animals and created a bright delicacy .	-4.3285
The idea came after reading a research on jellyfish and convincing Chinese scientists to artificially produce the shining protein .	-5.1788
The ice cream reacts with the tongue when consumed , increasing the pH value in the protein and triggering the luminaire .	-3.7690
Chris explains that the meal ice reacts to the warmth in his mouth and shines – so the more one licks , the brighter it becomes .	-4.5919
Charlie , the founder of the ice cream company Lick Me I 'm Delicious , says : “ The product is incredible , but it is still in a very early production phase , and so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds . ”	-4.8853
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH value .	-2.1242
When the mouth warms the protein , the pH value rises and the ice shines .	-7.7402
We have tested it in recent months and it seemed ideal to bring it onto the market at Halloween because it has this wonderful lighting effect .	-4.8991
It is probably the most expensive ice cream I have ever made , because the jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold .	-2.7577
Each ball costs me about <unk> 140 .	-2.4601
But for that it tastes delicious .	-2.5882
Charlies experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual flavours , including beer , cheese , beef and leaf gold .	-2.8434
But his latest creation is to become even more ambitious .	-2.9693
He says , “ I would like to develop an invisible ice cream . ”	-2.3302
This is impossible in itself because of the breakdown of light caused by the ice crystals that make up ice cream ; but I suspect we will find a way to make it .	-5.9667
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a jelly artificially produced by Chinese scientists .	-2.9564
After six days of playing , the TSV Morsum is still without any point in the Handball Association League .	-4.1381
Just now , the Ingo Ehlers team will face the Derby against the TSV Daverden , who celebrated his first victory last weekend .	-4.8404
With this game the season begins again for us .	-2.6892
" I hope that we finally have our heads free " , Ehlers behaves optimistically .	-9.8848
He finally has his full cadre available , except for the permanently injured Hendrik Blohme .	-5.2607
Also Daverden , like us , relies on tempo games .	-4.8084
We must therefore keep our error rate low .	-2.3597
Above all , however , we need to increase the coverage , which has left anything but a safe impression .	-6.1086
Daverden ’ s coach Thomas Panitz is much more relaxed after the first season victory against Northhorn .	-4.3753
The game was of course a house number .	-1.6997
But that is why we are far from the favorite , because everything can always happen in the Derby .	-4.9708
However , Panitz now wants to set up in Morsum to start a series .	-4.2748
Jan-Malte Jodat is missing .	-2.1128
The A-Jugendliche Joost Wind<unk>u<unk> , who is active with double play at the A-Jugend-Bundesligiste HC Bremen , is celebrating his season debut .	-6.3212
Those who are not hot in such a game should stay at home .	-3.1146
Halloween 2013 : In Numbers	-1.4405
When I was small , Halloween had something magical .	-2.2349
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets , stay late and wear us for the neighbourhood .	-3.2803
Today I have become a Halloween muffle .	-3.2462
Over the last two years , I have not agreed to distribute sweets from my home , and I do not think I will do so this year .	-10.1259
But according to statistics , I am a black sheep in Halloween .	-2.5496
The majority of Americans – 158 million to be precise – are celebrating Halloween this year , spending a total of $ 6.9 billion on sweets , costumes , and decorations , according to the US Retailers ’ Association ( NRF ) .	-3.7405
One thing I look forward to every Halloween is the trend .	-3.4008
The costumes will be about 1.2 billion of the $ 6.9 billion spent , according to the NRF .	-3.1394
This year , awesome unlived items are the last cry .	-4.7193
Women no longer need to wear sexy clothes , they can now embody seductive food such as pizza , hamburgers or carrots .	-3.3641
As far as men are concerned , I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead , and I bet the Daft-Punk space men will make it this year in the Instagram feeds .	-10.3575
According to Google , the most sought for costumes are zombies , batman , pirates and witches .	-2.0439
I suspect there is nothing wrong with tradition .	-1.9455
We dressed our dogs last year and were not alone to my surprise .	-3.1312
Indeed , Americans spend $ 330 million this year on costumes of their pets , according to the NRF .	-2.3323
These are a lot of hot dogs .	-1.6089
As far as sweets are concerned , we are not tiny .	-3.8576
Americans will spend $ 1.9 billion this year , according to The Nielsen Company .	-2.1847
This is about 270 million kilograms of chocolate , suckers , bones and rubber bears .	-4.8103
So good news for the US Department of Commerce , 41 million people traveling through the neighborhoods by saying “ sweet or saure . ”	-5.5456
In fact , we will buy over 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and – let us not delude ourselves – eat .	-3.0089
The only thing we do not want to consume is the sugar sweet Candy Corn , but 15 million kilograms of it are sold around Halloween , according to the National Association of confectionery manufacturers .	-3.6101
These are about nine billion corn grains .	-2.4712
It is a puzzle that I have not been able to solve yet .	-2.9720
Nothing more belongs to Halloween than houses where it sparkles .	-8.8356
They have great names like “ Terror Behind the Walls ” , “ Howl-O Scream ” and “ The House of Shock ” .	-3.3784
There are , in fact , 1,200 officially recognized sportsmen in the United States , who earn $ 500 million in revenue , America Haunts says , including the wonderful photos on which you are just spinning into the pants and then putting your friends on Facebook , where you will not get rid of them , and then leave a comment on the type you are standing on like “ nice facial expression . ”	-9.5452
But let us finally get to the pumpkins .	-2.2238
Charlie Brown familiarized us with the Great Pumpkin when we were children , and the carving of a pumpkin lamp is like decorating the Christmas tree – something we made from small .	-4.5085
Fortunately , the “ baby in the pumpkin ” trend began only last year thanks to Pinterest , so most of us grew up with cutting the pumpkin and not sitting in it .	-4.2176
This year , Americans will spend about $ 106 million on pumpkins , according to the US Census Bureau .	-2.1772
The pumpkin lamps , slowly rotting in the front garden , are probably from Illinois , where this year 245 million kilograms of pumpkin were harvested .	-3.6456
If you want to score the right points , call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa , California and cut some nice things from their 921 kilo pumpkin .	-4.6938
Housing Fire in Helmbright : Rescue Forces Mount Co	-5.0719
The fire brigade had to leave in Helmbrecht at the late Thursday evening .	-3.5750
A three-family house in the district of Hof catches fire on Friday night .	-3.2129
The rescue forces bear a cooled corpse from the house .	-3.8235
Rescue forces found a cooled corpse in a three-family house during a fire in Helmbrecht .	-4.8907
Whether it is a resident is still unclear , as a police spokesman said in Bayreuth .	-3.2508
On the late Thursday evening it had burned on the ground floor of the house .	-3.5382
When the fire brigade arrived , the flames struck out of a window .	-3.2262
The staff went into the apartment and found the corpse in a room .	-3.3897
This and another room burned out completely .	-3.4229
The entire ground floor was damaged .	-1.9640
All other residents had not been at home during the fire , the police spokesman explained further .	-3.9840
The building is no longer inhabitable for the time being .	-4.0809
The exact cause of the fire was initially not clear .	-2.5396
Germany ’ s largest church has launched an offensive to promote the profession of the pastor .	-3.1204
Background is a possible shortage of pastors : the Evangelical Lutheran Landeskirche Hannover expects the number of its currently roughly 1,800 pastors to halve by 2030 .	-5.8946
For young people today , the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects for the future , said Pastor Mathis Burfien ( 43 ) in conversation with the Evangelical Press Service .	-4.0123
It is attractive to be able to determine the working and daily routine yourself .	-5.5040
With Burfien , the Landeskirche commissioned for the first time a pastor at a full place to inspire young people to study theology .	-5.1046
Currently , fewer and fewer young people choose to study theology after graduation .	-3.3286
Burfien attributes this to the process of deconstruction : " God 's voice is quiet , the world is loud " .	-4.2790
The profession is characterised by great freedom and diversity .	-2.5106
I am the master of my calendar and can set my priorities where it is important to me .	-4.0503
Pastors could be very close to the people as a caretaker .	-4.9362
They earned as much as teachers and could live well .	-2.5197
To be sure , more is paid in the free economy , but theologians would have a safe employer .	-3.3393
This is something that meets today ’ s young people , who are not just about careers , but about meaningful work .	-8.7362
According to the State Church , which comprises three quarters of Lower Saxony , some 60 pastors are currently retiring each year .	-3.8110
At the same time , about 40 graduates of a theology study begin their vicariate .	-4.7543
In the future , in sparsely populated peripheral areas such as the resin , the Emsland or the Wendland , it could be difficult to occupy jobs .	-4.5499
Among other things , Burfien wants to organize study days for young people and invite celebrities who have studied theology .	-4.9177
Theology studies offer a broad education .	-4.0253
It can even become the President of the Federal Republic .	-9.3321
Land Rover Rally Series announced	-1.1265
The interior features racing seats and six-point belts as well as an intercom .	-4.1775
The options range from reinforced brakes , a service package with bowler work-mechanics and logistic support to vehicle storage between events .	-10.8911
Drew Bowler , Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport , says , “ The rally customers who come to Bowler have changed . ”	-2.6446
They are not all experienced racers , but people who are looking for excitement and adventure as well as for an achievable way to world class events .	-4.5973
We are pleased to open this path in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format opens up new possibilities to experience the various rally disciplines in the UK and abroad and to prepare newcomers for the stresses and reality of Rally Raid .	-5.7296
We really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge car – this will be an entertaining championship .	-3.4847
In addition , the Defender Challenge has a training and test day in February and an option to participate in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East .	-3.4002
Fire brigade called to rescue a bitch that was attacked 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rock lead in a quarry .	-6.3279
After a minor traffic accident , Ruby ’ s Cockerspaniel bitch was gone .	-7.0154
Three days later , a stroller in quarry discovered it in its miserable location .	-4.3477
Firemen roiled on rock wall and saved the dog from safe death .	-4.4725
The fire brigade was able to bring a bitch to safety , which was stuck in a rock wall on a 15-metre high edge .	-7.4384
The nine months old Cockerspaniel bitch Ruby had gone off after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before it was saved from a quarry on Wednesday .	-4.0156
Scott Alderson , 25 , and his girlfriend Becky Hall , 20 , to whom the dog belongs , came to the quarry Flappit in Denholme , West Yorkshire to welcome Ruby again and thank the firemen of West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service .	-3.5964
They desperately sought their missing bitch and published calls for help in social networks when she escaped into quarry after the small traffic accident .	-4.7969
About 14.15 p.m. on Wednesday a walker who executed his dog saw the stranded Ruby on the 15-metre high paragraph in the quarry .	-5.2939
The Cleckheaton Fire Station 's technical rescue team rushed to rescue Ruby , which was then transported upwards in a dog box .	-4.3063
Andy Clayton , the technical rescue team specialist , said : “ She was in a dangerous situation .	-3.0637
It was located in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and the ground .	-3.4192
She did not move a muscle during her rescue – she was like stiff-frozen .	-3.3132
But now it is doing well .	-2.0915
She then eaten a few dog cakes .	-1.7649
That was a rather unusual effort .	-2.6704
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible .	-1.5308
Peter Lau , the technical rescue team specialist , said , “ Ruby had a giant coat . ”	-3.8706
It was possible that she was very seriously injured or worse .	-2.6335
Ruby was brought to the veterinarian for examination , but he found nothing except exhaustion and dehydration .	-4.5036
Becky Hall of Halifax , West Yorkshire , said , “ watching the bailout was frightening . ”	-2.9860
I couldn 't believe that she was really up there .	-2.6137
It was wonderful to keep them back in the poor .	-2.1523
The veterinarian explained that if exhaustion had become too great and collapsed , it would probably have collapsed .	-3.9982
The firefighters have done great things .	-6.8622
What they did was really courageous .	-2.5237
We are just so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible .	-2.4529
Scott Alderson from Keyley added , “ We were afraid that it would fall down , but it stayed up . ”	-3.2873
The firefighters were great .	-6.7948
I can hardly believe where it was .	-1.5204
Mick Jagger explained that he never cared Katy Perry when she was 18 .	-3.4575
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week , the pop star said she worked as a background singer on Jagger ’ s song “ Old Habits Die Hard ” from 2004 .	-3.7806
Perry explained that she had eaten evening with the altrocker , and that “ he offered me when I was 18 ” .	-5.8559
She added : “ This has been a long time ago and he was very nice to me . ”	-3.8806
In a statement , a representative of Jaggers , 70 , said on Thursday that he “ categorically denies that he has ever attempted to approach Katy Perry . ”	-4.1227
The representative added , “ Perhaps she confused him with someone else . ”	-2.4283
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest appearance during the Rolling Stones Tour this year .	-9.3815
Her new album “ Prism ” ranked 1 this week .	-4.0815
George Kerevan : European unbundling gives Scots the election	-2.4430
A new day , a new horror of independence .	-8.3996
This time , we are warned that an independent Scotland is needed to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership .	-2.5124
This is the key word for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a barbed wire border along the Hadrian Wall .	-3.3901
Indeed , the Strathclyde proposal highlighted the potential economic benefits that would bring greater freedom of travel in the rest of Europe , but this did not – as expected – play a role in the headlines .	-6.0867
Nor has anyone mentioned that EU member states often abide by their strict rules when it is cheaper for them .	-4.3966
Since Scotland is not currently part of the Schengen area , continued ignorance for Brussels would be only a small concession in exchange for what we really want from the Scots .	-4.7817
So no story .	-3.0379
And one that has come so far in the years that it already resembles a fossil : for the first time I heard the “ independence means passport controls ” duck at least 40 years ago .	-4.8772
An interesting point is lost in the constant repetition of this ancient history .	-3.8974
Why expect an independent Scotland to dance according to the European pipe ?	-2.6024
Why trade the London yoke against that of Brussels , especially now ?	-2.4899
These are the real European news : the great post-war plan to unite Europe has stalled .	-3.0464
With the euro crisis , the European project has officially died .	-1.9080
Throughout the EU , parties that are hostile to the EU or wish to override the euro as a common currency are gaining ground .	-4.1908
Even in Germany , the Euroskeptic Alternative for Germany – only this year – won nearly five million votes in the federal election in September , effectively expelling the Free Democrats ( the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrat ) from the Bundestag .	-5.2478
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federalist Europe .	-1.7753
But the current economic crisis is turning out to be a turning point .	-1.9557
Because of the stringent austerity policy imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank in connection with the straitjacket to which the national economy is forced by the adherence to the single currency , many people believe that the European project has gone too far .	-4.8217
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments causing excessive fiscal deficits – only in Greece .	-2.5625
Instead , the Eurosystem has set its members at exchange rates that are beneficial to German exporters – and German politicians like that .	-3.8803
Without the possibility of devaluing the local currency , southern Europe will find itself with a built-in productivity disadvantage over Germany .	-3.8017
The only way is to cut wages and public spending – spurred by Berlin .	-2.3211
Behind the current fiscal and monetary problems lies a deeper European productivity problem .	-2.2434
As a result of the “ green ” energy directives prescribed by Brussels – a code for subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – European industry pays twice for electricity and four times for gas compared to the United States .	-3.6888
This is a crippling cost disadvantage , as we saw in Grangemouth .	-2.9207
All world wage festivals do not protect the European petrochemical industry from being pushed into the corner by cheap American shale gas .	-3.3369
As a result , a revolt is emerging , especially in France , the EU ’ s former cheerleader .	-2.8436
After the war , France ’ s political elite saw the EU as a vehicle for keeping Germany in check and raising Paris on equal terms with Washington .	-3.3668
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy , and has imposed its own economic policies on Europe , which is what the troubled French economy is struggling with .	-5.0739
The result : Marine Le Pen ’ s right-wing , anti-EU National Front has just won a decisive re-election , pointing the ruling socialists to place three .	-4.5713
The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 % of the vote – a timely warning to the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a right-wing divide would automatically benefit the left .	-4.1626
What is Le Pen doing with her newly won popularity among the white French of the working class ?	-3.7327
It wants to use the EU elections next year to forge an anti-EU , anti-common currency block in the European Parliament .	-3.1492
If the anti-EU parties do well in these elections – and that is very possible – then for the first time such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament .	-4.1802
That is the point I want to make : in the not too distant future , the growing resentment against the EU and the single currency will come together to abolish the euro .	-3.6779
The EU will not disappear , but it will become more like the “ Europe of the ( sovereign ) nations ” favored by General de Gaulle .	-2.5797
Germany and a few of its satellite economies may be sticking to the euro , but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies .	-3.1004
I expect Britain to distance itself from this project in the hope of flattering with the United States .	-7.7400
But Washington ’ s growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be alone in the Atlantic rain .	-2.3902
Where is Scotland in all this ?	-2.4403
We can decide to be a region of ( lastly ) small England .	-2.7537
Or we can defend our own economic interests – and this includes telling Berlin and Brussels what they can hide where .	-3.7702
I suspect that Scotland could go quite well in a looser European alliance if we retain our own currency .	-4.1612
Cooperation with other similar countries is easier in a non-federated Europe of nations .	-2.3651
Otherwise , we should consider equating it with Norway and maintaining our economic independence .	-3.2672
The SNP government in Scotland is – remarkably – the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe , and won a spectacular majority in 2011 because of the rejection of the proposed ( and made ) cuts that Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem coalition had to blame .	-4.7441
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to choose independence now , only to be imposed on austerity by Berlin and Brussels .	-3.7320
Early Puberty : Growing up faster	-3.2185
Afro-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white peers , as studies show .	-3.7390
Physical Change Not Immediately Puberty	-3.7975
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible .	-1.4217
Experts believe that epidemic obesity is a trigger of early puberty .	-1.6478
The Early Puberty Trend is less pronounced among Boys	-3.5268
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specialising in child health and family issues .	-2.2133
Should a mother be worried if her daughter grows breasts and shame hair at the age of seven or eight ?	-3.7619
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics in Orlando , Florida this week , the paediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz declared that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and were a new standard .	-4.3301
“ I spend a lot of time reassuring parents – normally this is no sign that puberty is entering quickly , ” explains Kaplowitz .	-5.4922
Evidence of development , such as growing breasts , shame and axle hairs , as well as body odour , is shown earlier in girls .	-6.0928
However , there has been only a slight shift in the age of the menarchs ( occurrence of the first rule-blood ) in the last 40 years .	-5.0826
In the United States , the average age is 12.5 years , slightly less than 12.75 in 1970 .	-1.8106
“ When the development of breasts begins , it lasts at least two to three years until the menarch , ” Kaplowitz said , also author of the book “ Early puberty in girls : the essential guide to dealing with this common problem . ”	-6.1392
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty progresses .	-1.7455
It is controversial what is actually the beginning of puberty , but it is “ premature ” if the breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth spur of eight years ago .	-5.3180
In most cases , the process slows or stagnates – something that a paediatrician can monitor closely .	-2.7650
In the event of faster progress , tests may be displayed by an endicronologist to prevent serious problems such as tumors or cysts .	-6.0037
There are treatment methods for delaying an early menstruation and preventing another consequence : the premature aging of bones , which can ultimately lead to inhibition of growth and hence small body growth in adults .	-13.4168
The recommendations for drug or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child , the speed of development , the rate of growth and emotional maturity .	-3.4966
Psychosocial aspects are also important .	-1.5613
Kaplowitz is cautious about drugs , but he admits : “ Puberty suppression can mitigate behavioral problems and girls ’ feelings , unlike their peers . ”	-4.7909
The other major problem is understandable : parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have the period .	-1.9501
“ They worry about the risk of pregnancy or how to handle the hygienic side , ” Kaplowitz said .	-3.2682
“ It was a shock , ” recalls a woman whose daughter got her days with ten .	-3.3113
Although there were first signs and we talked about menstruation , it was not emotionally prepared .	-2.8368
She came home frightened and excited from school because she was the first in her circle of friends .	-3.3225
There are many widely published theories about the causes of early puberty .	-1.7237
But there is no conclusive evidence that hormones are caused by milk or other food , chemicals in the environment , or sexual messages in the media .	-8.7602
Young people come to puberty similar to girls in the past . the .	-9.3424
Kaplowitz believes that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of obesity .	-1.4433
He supported the implementation of a study in 2001 on girls aged six to nine who establish a connection between bodily fat and admission to puberty .	-4.6938
Other studies support this conclusion , but there are many other factors that played a role .	-2.4816
In that country , African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white agents .	-3.7718
There are different explanations for this .	-1.8316
Globally , early puberty seems to be influenced by all sorts of things , from economic conditions to climate to genes .	-2.8921
Another puzzle : although boys grow face and shame hair earlier , the trend toward full-scale earlier puberty is not as strong as girls .	-5.7241
Other doctors at the AAP conference underlined the complexity of the issue .	-2.4614
The appearance of acne and shame hair is common even in babies and infants .	-4.2833
“ We need to be careful as we identify the true beginning of puberty , ” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman , a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children 's Hospital in Morristown , New Jersey .	-10.5121
Parents should not hesitate to get advice from their paediatrician on how to talk to their child .	-3.0223
“ This can mean that you have to talk earlier than expected , ” says Kaplowitz .	-4.7679
If you stay calm , the child usually reacts well .	-3.0642
Girls who flourish early need the insurance that the process is a normal part of life , even if it sooner than thought .	-4.2727
Jumbo manufacturers argue over seat width in the face of large orders .	-3.6227
Between leading aircraft manufacturers there has been a debate about the width of tourist seats on long-haul flights , which indicates the tone of a bitter collision at the Dubai Airshow this month .	-5.3699
The dispute revolves around the width of seats offered to passengers on long flights in the tourist class – not always those that airlines are most striving for , but this designated space represents the key to the efficiency claims of the latest aircraft from Airbus SAS and Boeing Co .	-11.9134
This week , Airbus called for an industry standard requiring a seating width of at least 46 cm ( 18 inches ) in the tourist class , but the US Archrival Boeing says that the airlines should decide .	-4.9417
The debate comes at a time when aircraft manufacturers are competing to sell even larger versions of their long-haul two-engine aircraft , and record orders are expected at the event from 17 to 21 November .	-13.3184
How the rear part of the aircraft is designed – especially whether there are nine or ten seats – is crucial for the economic results indicated by the new “ mini jumbo ” design .	-5.1260
Boeing claims that his modernized “ 77X ” comprises 406 people with seats in the tourist class , which are over 17 inches wide , allowing ten per row .	-6.1469
Airbus declares that the competing version of the A350 carries 350 people in 18 inch seats in the tourist class , with nine per row .	-3.9149
Aeronautical giants often report technical details by advertising in the specialist press .	-6.0424
Airbus is now calling directly to the public in front of the Dubai Airshow , where the 777X with more than 100 orders is expected to take place .	-4.8163
Recently , the company presented an ad that could be the beginning of a new ad war , showing donors a picture where three people are squeezed together in a restaurant , with the title : “ Would you accept that ? ”	-5.7484
“ Boeing proposes long-haul flights in seats that are closer than regional turbo props , ” says Airbus head of sales John Leahy .	-3.6589
With dietary habits changing , people become thicker , but aircraft seats have not changed radically .	-4.1111
Between the early 1970 ’ s , when the Boeing 747 defined modern long-distance travel , and at the end of the century , the weight of the male average American between 40 and 49 years has increased by 10 % , according to the US Ministry of Health .	-4.0690
According to US health statistics , the waist range of the male average American in the 21st century is 100,8 cm .	-3.3896
Airbus says that its rival adheres to a seat concept from the 1950s , when the average body size of the freshly caught Jet Set was narrower .	-5.2262
According to Airbus , studies have been carried out that an additional customs ( 2.54 cm ) per seat increases sleep quality by 53 percent .	-4.2868
Boeing disputes the Airbus figures on the seats and says that it is not at the discretion of manufacturers to decide how airlines balance the airlines between fares and equipment .	-6.2233
The company also explains that , according to studies , the experience in the aircraft depends on more than the seating width .	-4.8070
“ It really means giving airlines flexibility so that they can do what they think they need to succeed , ” explains Boeing ’ s cabin expert Kent Craver .	-4.1648
They do not want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable .	-0.9280
They know their business better than anyone else .	-1.5472
Passengers are talking about more elbow freedom , but for manufacturers it is becoming increasingly an issue that can affect sales .	-5.2748
Behind the debate is a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least $ 700 billion after list prices in the coming decades , which could have a lasting impact on the US or European export balance .	-4.8235
As Reuters first reported in July , the seating layout is the driving force behind the battle for the new jets .	-3.2010
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest two-engine long-range designs than the market leader in this segment , the 365 seat Boeing 77-300ER .	-3.6640
Boeing 's findings depend in part on comparing the 777X with its ten seats per row to the original design of nine seats in the 777 .	-4.0697
The increased cost per unit is still lower than for currently used machines with ten seats per line .	-3.8856
“ Boeing therefore squeezes more seats in its aircraft to make it more competitive to our products , ” says Kevin Keniston , head of passenger comfort at European Airbus .	-4.1915
On the other hand , analysts say that full cabins with ten seats per row in existing 77s indicated that many passengers opted for a tighter arrangement , which could be accompanied by cheaper fares .	-5.3129
“ Eighteen inch seat width would be great for passengers , but the reality is : from an economic point of view , the Airbus offer is controlled by the 777 threat , ” says Mary Kirby , an expert in cabin equipment , founder and editor of Runway Girl Network .	-4.6621
Airbus and Boeing offer no seats , but a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose .	-3.5867
The world-traveling jet sellers even carry a measure of their own to measure the equipment in the competition .	-6.4780
Even if they offer comfort , all manufacturers also offer high-density jets for low-cost airlines and regional flights .	-4.4152
Airbus offers a ten-seater A350 , but has not yet sold it .	-4.9737
Until recently , Airbus stressed the importance of more cabin adaptability and offered broad seats on the corridors for some jets .	-4.8797
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets , experts say that the call for a new industry standard is likely to be puffed out , but could distract from the wave of 777X sales .	-4.7159
New anti-nicotine vaccine could put a stop to smoking pleasure .	-3.3403
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could spoil the fun of smoking .	-1.8776
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for a lifetime .	-2.3750
Before human testing , more experiments are needed , which may take a few years , but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said that the first results are good .	-4.6096
“ We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to stop and tried all the methods available on the market , but have had to experience that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches , ” Cornell said .	-4.8206
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to contain genetic information for the production of nicotine antibodies .	-3.3231
The virus selectively infects liver cells , which then produce a constant flow of antibodies .	-2.4650
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain , which means that a smoker does not experience a nicotine high .	-3.7575
In experiments , vaccinated mice administered to nicotine maintained its normal level of activity .	-3.8304
Mice without vaccination , on the other hand , had taken a “ time off , ” researchers said , a sign that nicotine had reached its brain .	-4.7136
The experiments are described in the Fachblatt Science Translational Medicine .	-2.1019
Earlier tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies .	-1.8445
Vaccines had to be given so often to maintain antibody level that they were expensive and impractical .	-3.4735
But the cost of the new vaccine is probably much lower , because it transforms liver cells into antibody factories .	-2.4403
As Professor Crystal said , a future human vaccine , if safe , could be administered to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette , thereby preventing nicotine addiction .	-3.7583
More likely , smokers would use it to stop .	-2.0115
“ They then know that when they start smoking again , they no longer enjoy it because of the nicotine vaccine , and that helps them to keep the habit , ” he explains .	-6.3813
British scientists said that the results were interesting , but warned that further research was needed .	-3.0304
Tripodi denied having been influenced by Obeid .	-7.8176
The former Laboratory Minister Joe Tripodi of New South Wales is being investigated by the government ’ s corruption supervisor . the the . the the the . the the . the . the the .	-10.7408
The former NSW minister denies that he has amended the rules on maritime leasing at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid , who had hidden holdings in three properties on state-controlled land .	-6.1053
On Friday , the Independent Commission Against Corruption ( ICAC <unk> Independent Commission Against Corruption ) expanded its investigations into whether Obeid has influenced various government ministers to lend to the Circular Quay , where the Obeids operated two restaurants and a café without extending the tender after it expired in August 2005 .	-6.4588
Now , due to the accusation , Tripodi knew of Obeid ’ s hidden interest in the land after Tripodi ’ s former deputy chief of staff , Lynne Ashpole , had announced on Thursday .	-6.0706
In years of talks that began in 2005 , the government had pushed for public tenders for leasing contracts .	-4.0941
The plotters opposed it and also wanted longer maturities .	-9.8968
In 2009 , leasing contracts for Circular Quay companies , which contributed $ 2.5 million annually to the obeids , were extended without a public tender .	-4.7194
Tripodi , who was Minister of Port from February 2006 to November 2009 , originally advocated public tenders .	-4.0119
But he argued that he had made the changes to Obeid ’ s request , which , as Tripodi confirmed , had pushed for a change in government leasing arrangements .	-5.5020
One of the ICAC ’ s telephone records showed talks from August to September 2007 between Obeid , Tripodi and Steve Dunn , a senior officer who had moved to the port ministry after working under Obeid in the Fisheries Authority .	-5.1913
“ Was the subject discussed in these telephone talks the drafting of commercial leasing arrangements ? ” , Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi asked .	-5.3629
“ No , ” Tripodi replied .	-1.9083
I cannot remember what was discussed , but that was definitely not .	-2.2169
Definitely not between me and Mr Obeid .	-2.2671
Israeli fighter aircraft attack targets in Syria , Official Sources	-3.4170
Israeli hunting aircraft would have attacked a target in the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday night , a senior government officer confirmed Fox News .	-11.1958
The official did not explain what the aim was , but said that it was at least one .	-2.9259
According to Associated Press , the target was Russian SA-125 missiles .	-2.0163
At least twice this year , Israel has already carried out air strikes on missile supplies in Syria .	-7.0305
Foreign workers with 457 visas could be subjected to “ authenticity test . ”	-3.2600
The government is considering an “ authenticity test ” for foreign workers with a 457 visa in the context of extended measures .	-5.2037
If the test were to be introduced , it would be used by a criterion to prevent the 457 being used to fill unqualified jobs or as a backdoor for family and friends in Australia .	-5.6255
Today , a government discussion proposal was published after former Laboratory MEPs , Maxine McKew , had condemned the government ’ s comments on foreign workers , because they could be seen as insulting by Australia ’ s neighbors .	-5.8062
“ Loud declarations like that foreigners should stand backwards – and , Australians first hire – are a very unpleasant reversal in times when trade unions called for a protected labor market , ” she said to the Australia India Institute today .	-7.3351
Historically , this meant that white labor should be protected – and if some in the region were to emulate an echo of this historic artifact , I would not be surprised .	-4.9143
The proposal for a debate comprises twelve measures once considered by former immigration minister Chris Bowen .	-4.5626
Immigration Minister Brendan O 'Connor , who spoke yesterday about human smuggling in Sri Lanka , has implemented five of the recommended changes , the others are still being considered .	-4.9498
If the ‘ authenticity criterion ’ is adopted , someone applying for a visa could be checked to see whether ‘ the application is genuine in cases where the applicant is related to the holder or a relevant person of the supporting company . ’	-5.4327
Companies could also be required to account for the number of 457 visa holders , after in the past , companies that initially wanted to support only a small number of workers finally hired hundreds .	-4.6393
Meanwhile , a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker probably died of a heart attack after arriving this week with a refugee boat on the Christmas Island .	-3.5643
The disturbed nine-year-old son of the man who came with him to Australia has been cared for by an adult cousin who was also on the boat since his father 's death on Wednesday .	-4.3121
Australian authorities brought the man to the Christmas Island Hospital where he died .	-1.6076
The British Government has announced a study to increase the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland .	-2.7026
In the work of HS2 Ltd , it is proposed to establish high-speed links between Scotland and the North of England as early as the beginning of phase 1 in 2026 .	-4.7206
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said that the project “ will bring Britain closer together ” .	-2.5502
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said that he was very pleased to work with the British Government on this plan .	-2.8289
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed train connection between London and the West Midlands .	-8.2026
After phase 2 has been completed , there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds .	-2.6367
In June , the government corrected the estimated cost of building the high-speed road between London and North England from <unk> 32.7 billion to <unk> 42.6 billion .	-2.6567
The British Government , which is in talks with Transport Scotland , has asked HS2 Ltd to look for further route capacity and travel time improvements for North England and Scotland .	-4.8934
This includes the possibility of a travel time of three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London .	-3.0080
Baroness Kramer said , “ Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network that brings Britain and its cities closer together . ”	-2.1745
We are moving forward with HS2 because it brings enormous benefits .	-3.3955
Without it , we are facing a capacity crisis in our rail network .	-2.6688
But it is also about the connection between 18 British cities , including Glasgow and Edinburgh , which is improved thanks to HS2 .	-3.1209
Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael commented : “ Today ’ s announcement is good news for Scotland . ”	-1.8263
On behalf of the Scottish government , Keith Brown Carmichael called for a “ unambiguous ” commitment to Scottish integration into the HS2 network .	-3.1334
Brown said : “ The high-speed rail network has the potential for huge economic benefits for Scotland , but at the same time Scotland ’ s economic power also provides an argument for fast rail connections across the UK . ”	-5.3943
That is why we are pleased to work as a partner of the British Government and to examine the options for a high-speed rail link in Scotland , which provides benefits for all and complements the Glasgow-Edinburgh link that the Scottish Government is already planning .	-5.3392
I look forward to examining the report with the British ministers next year and taking the next steps together .	-3.9190
Regulations on electronic equipment in aircraft are provisionally in force in Australia .	-3.3337
Australian air passengers must continue to shut down tablets and smartphones at take-off and landing , despite efforts in the US to ease the rules for such devices .	-4.5671
The US Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) allows US airlines to change their requirements so that passengers can read e-books , watch or play videos on their devices during critical flight phases , provided they are in “ flight mode . ”	-4.6410
During most of the flight , passengers are already allowed to do so , but many people find it annoying that they are not allowed to read their e-Books when they start and land.	-4.9798
Australian companies are observing the decision to implement which US airlines have to do a great deal of work , but do not have immediate plans to change their rules .	-5.7280
The Aviation Safety Authority , CASA , also stated that the announcement would be considered , but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic equipment in critical flight phases in Australia still apply .	-5.5513
“ CASA currently has no specific regulations regarding the use of electronic equipment in the aircraft , ” has been reported .	-4.0597
The issue is subject to provisions whereby airlines must maintain safety at all times and passengers must follow the safety instructions given by cabin crew .	-4.7987
Virgin has already had talks with CASA about extending its Wi-Fi entertainment system on flights and declaring that it is open to change , but it should be initiated by the legislator .	-5.2990
“ We would welcome a review of CASA ’ s approval of electronic devices , because we are convinced that this would improve customer experience after we offer ( wireless entertainment ) during the flight , ” said a speaker .	-5.0086
Qantas said that it will remain with the current rules until further notice .	-4.7202
“ Our current policy stipulates that electronic equipment must not be used at startup and landing , and we currently have no plans to change that , ” said the company .	-5.4421
The FAA regulations apply to US airlines .	-2.2474
However , we are always interested in developments in regulations that can benefit passengers , and we will certainly look closely at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it .	-4.5060
The decision differs between US companies depending on the age of the fleet .	-3.6767
They must prove that their aircraft can tolerate radio disturbances through mobile devices , and change manuals , training materials , hand baggage programs , and customer instruction .	-4.2897
“ After an airline has confirmed its fleet ’ s tolerance , it can allow passengers to use portable , lightweight electronic devices such as tablets , e-book readers , and smartphones at all levels , ” the FAA announced .	-4.5767
In rare cases , in poor visibility , the crew will instruct passengers to disable the equipment while landing .	-4.9481
The group also recommended to store heavier equipment safely under the seat or in the subjects above the seats at the start and landing .	-5.6782
In front of the Schalke Revierderby , BVB supporters with lighting rockets had provided ugly scenes in the Veltins Arena .	-5.5893
Borussia Dortmund then announced hard consequences .	-2.7120
Before the Friday match of the Football Bundesliga against the VfB Stuttgart , the ultras reacted with a silence - first .	-3.7107
It was an unusual , almost ghostly acoustic that offered the viewer the signal Iduna Park just before the start of the Bundesliga game between the German Vice Champion Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart .	-5.7668
Most of them were the guest fans with their songs .	-5.3745
The southern gallery , on the other hand , where the faithful - and loudest - BVB fans stand , was initially silent : no sings , no battles .	-6.3465
The podium of the Capo , which otherwise coordinates the joint fire , remained empty .	-5.2324
And at the very front of the gallery a big flag blew loudly with the label " Section Stadium Ban " .	-6.1188
Only as a goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller , as always , became the first BVB player to take the place , unleashed short-term cheers .	-7.0042
When his team mates followed , there were vocals and blowing scarves - but not everywhere .	-4.5043
In the central blocks 12 and 13 of the southern gallery nothing was excited .	-4.8825
Norbert Dickel , the stadium spokesman , once again listed the positive experiences of the last few days - Derbysieg , victory over Arsenal , extension of contract by coach Jürgen Klopp - did not cause celebrations .	-6.1817
Only five minutes before the attachment , the capo exploded his podium - and the tension that was tangible until then was unleashed in a loud cry when thicket , as usual , asked the mood on the ranks in the stadium .	-9.0726
As always , the southern gallery was the turn - and finally here again , as usual , was the loudest place in the stadium .	-5.6283
And at the latest , when the soundproofing " Derbysieger is up " came with the soundproofing from the South Grandstand , everything was as always .	-8.2369
The silence before was probably a reaction to what happened in recent days .	-3.2171
Immediately before Revierderby at the FC Schalke 04 , some of the BVB trailers had fired lighting rockets into the audience ranges and into the square - and met almost goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller .	-6.1594
The game was delayed due to the chaotic scenes .	-3.1748
BVB-Boss Hans-Joachim Watzke received the tips of the Dortmund Ultras in his office - and if you think Watzke 's words , this was a rather untiring appointment for the fans .	-12.9218
" There will be massive cuts for the entire Ultra-Movement , " the BVB boss announced on Thursday evening at a panel discussion in Frankfurt .	-3.7153
As an emergency measure , Watzke prohibited the Ultras from choreographing the home match against the VfB Stuttgart .	-10.2400
" I prohibited that , " he said .	-3.0578
We cannot give up the zero tolerance policy on pyrotechnics .	-1.9638
In addition , the ultras have been shown various possibilities of punishment - until Tuesday they now have time to choose one .	-5.5408
Otherwise , according to Watzke , the BVB will set a sanction by the end of next week .	-3.2157
" This will be decisive " , insured watzke .	-4.5491
We can look forward to hearing what the reactions in the southern gallery will be .	-5.4417
Pfandals Booming in Singapore , as the middle-class crisis has arrived .	-4.4927
Janani Amirthalinga exchanges a golden arm ripen , a ring and a pair of earrings at the Bendemeer Shopping Centre in Singapore , to pay the school fees of her dau. the . the , , , , , , , , and , .	-8.2043
“ My husband and I have just bought a house because my money is in it , ” says Amirthalinga .	-3.3771
Although she earns 3,000 Singapore dollars every month ( about 1,730 euros ) as an administrative worker and her husband also works , the monthly family income is not enough , she explains .	-5.4822
Indeed , demand in parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt is growing – is so great that , this week , ValueMax , where it has exchanged , became the third Pfandhouse listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange .	-10.8997
Planning jewellery is not only a quick way to get money – $ 1,300 in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan .	-3.5325
Typically , Singapore Pfandals demand an effective annual rate of 17 % , just above the 15.4 % required by the United Overseas Bank , a local lender with a branch in the same shopping centre .	-11.3232
Pfandals , however , offer the advantage that there is no need for a credit rating or proof of income , which is why loans are faster than banks can .	-6.6169
That is why millions of people in the region turn to Pfandhäuser after families feel the pressure from rising living costs and increasing household and consumer debt .	-4.4828
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis , and cheap loans due to loose fiscal policies in the developed economies , low- and middle-income families are seeking Pfandhäuser to offset the difference in a staggering economy .	-6.6831
This week , the rating agency Standard & Poor 's growing fiscal debt , mainly through rising mortgages , described as a risk factor for the credit rating of Asian banks .	-4.0410
Malaysia , Thailand , and Singapore , according to the Agency , have the highest budget debt in Asia relative to GDP .	-3.5456
Malaysia is at the top of the list , with 80 % of GDP , an increase of 60 % in 2008 .	-11.4471
Economists are also worried about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand , which has just emerged from a technical recession this week .	-3.3496
On Thursday , the data showed a continuing weakness in exports and a reduction in consumer demand .	-3.5138
“ In the end , this means that , given rising costs , people in the middle to bottom segment ( the income scale ) will try to supplement their income wherever possible , ” says Song Seng Wun , economist at CIMB , a Malaysian bank .	-4.2949
Historical highs in gold prices over the past two years have reinforced the trend to pledge personal items , as people take the opportunity to turn family jewellery into cash .	-4.8775
In Singapore , about 70 % of the pledged objects are gold in the 200 pawns of the city state .	-4.7405
People say , “ The gold price looks good , let us pledge grandmother ’ s gold chain and return next month . ”	-3.6968
The largest Thai Pfandhaus operator , EasyMoney , has experienced a 20 % increase in its branches in recent months .	-3.8023
Growth in the Pfandschaft business is so strong that ValueMax , owner of the branches in Bendemeer and 15 others in Singapore , wants to expand not only to neighbouring Malaysia – where the company operates four houses – but also outside Asia , according to Yeah Lee Ching , Managing Director of ValueMax .	-5.4559
The company finances this with 60 percent of the 66 million Singapore dollars it received this week with the Singapore Exchange .	-4.6763
While some lenders have come to the crossfire because of high interest rates , Yeah explains that Pfandhäuser not only offered cheaper interest rates than other lenders , but also did not directly raise the debt .	-6.3412
“ Customers will not increase household debt , ” she explains .	-4.8066
Pfandlers are increasingly accepted as short-term , secured financing in society .	-9.4844
Nor are all people using Pfandlers in financial trouble .	-4.2561
Rich people from Singapore also come to the branches of ValueMax to pledge gold bars and Rolex watches , for which they receive up to 60 % of the purchase price in cash .	-3.8324
Customers from every social class come to us .	-3.5497
“ These include wealthy who borrow something for a business or investment in the short term , or small businesses that need to bridge bottlenecks in the cash flow , ” Yeah says .	-4.9372

Following the presentation of Hans-Christian Ströbele , the Green Party member , his surprising meeting with Snowden in Russia was about the conditions under which the ex-intelligence officer would say to a German prosecutor or or to a committee of inquiry .	-6.7035

Rescue package of more than 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanian health care	-4.0238
The Australian government insists on the harsh conditions associated with the rescue package of more than $ 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanian health care to ensure that the state government cannot waste the money .	-4.7584
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take “ immediate measures ” to avert a crisis caused by an ageing population of the island state , a higher rate of chronic diseases and system restrictions .	-3.7323
The funding for a four-year period was decided after government consultations with independent Tasmanian MEP Andrew Wilkie .	-8.7199
“ The government has set up an emergency rescue package that , in our view , addresses the unique challenges facing the state , ” Plibersek said today .	-4.0032
The $ 325 million package comprises $ 31 million emergency aid for election services .	-3.7972
Further 2600 operations , including orthopedic surgery and treatment for grey star , are intended to eliminate residues .	-5.4644
There is also money for daily clinics in Hobart and Launceston , better post-hospital care , specialist training , mental health services , and the introduction of a system for electronic recording of health data in local hospitals .	-4.7734
“ These investments are in line with the ideas that affected clinics workers have told me that they are the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system , ” Tanya Plibersek said .	-4.7609
The Minister insisted on strict reporting and accountability of the Tasmanian Government .	-2.4266
The state must maintain the current level of funding to receive money from the Commonwealth and report monthly on where the additional funds were spent .	-4.2814
A three-person commission will be set up to ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible .	-3.5169
As Wilkie has said today , the $ 325 million would be of little use if “ they were not accompanied by real reforms that put the public Tasmanian health system on a more sustainable course . ”	-4.6153
Nevertheless , he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent assistance , which he first expressed to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May .	-3.5058
“ I am confident that federal aid will make a major contribution to removing the state ’ s public health system from the list of concerns , ” Wilkie said .	-3.8353
According to the government of the state , these electoral services will largely offset the recent cuts .	-3.0029
But the federal opposition ’ s health spokesman , Peter Dutton , believes that today ’ s announcement is only a “ pavement solution . ”	-3.5183
“ We are in a position today because the Labor Government has withdrawn $ 430 million from the health system , ” he said to ABC TV .	-3.7073
It is not acceptable for a government to pull almost half a billion dollars out of the system , and for the Commonwealth to inject 300 million into it , and then pretend to be good news .	-6.1889
Dutton called on Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the bailout package would be spent on extra bureaucracy .	-10.1624

Syria has destroyed its ability to manufacture chemical weapons , according to a surveillance group .	-3.1188
Syria destroyed important chemical weapons and poisonous gas munitions facilities , declared the global chemical weapons surveillance group on Thursday , while severe clashes occurred in the north of the country near one of the sites where allegedly toxic substances are stored .	-5.9875
Also on Thursday , a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the civil war began almost three years ago .	-3.4132
The announcement of the Organisation for the Banning of Chemical Weapons ( OPCW ) came one day before the date on	-8.5536
1 November , which Damascus , based in The Hague , had set up to destroy or make “ inoperable ” all chemical weapons manufacturing facilities , including all machines for mixing chemicals into poison gas and filling ammunition .	-5.5706
The conclusion of this process , which is basically the first stage of destruction , is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable aimed at destroying all Syria ’ s chemical weapons by mid-2014 .	-3.4973
Destruction of facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons .	-2.5402
However , Damascus must begin to destroy existing weapons and stocks .	-3.4046
It is assumed that there are about 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons in the country , including septic gas and sarin nerve gas .	-4.7875
The announcement came at a time when battles took place in the city of Safira on Thursday , experts said that there was a production facility for chemical weapons and warehouses , as announced by the United Kingdom ’ s Syrian Human Rights Observatory .	-5.0613
The activist group , which is following the number of deaths via a network of activists in Syria , declared on Thursday that 120,296 people died .	-4.2688
Of these , 61.067 civilians , including 6,365 children .	-2.3352
On the government side , 29.954 of them belonged to the army of President Bashar Assad , 18.678 were pro-government fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militias .	-3.2307
Also among the dead are 2,202 deserted army soldiers and 5,375 opposition fighters , many of them foreigners .	-2.5932
On 25 July , the UN estimated the number of deaths in this conflict to 100,000 since March 2011 .	-2.5146
This number has not yet been updated .	-2.0039
The conflict has forced about two million people to flee the country .	-2.1873
Assad ’ s troops have been fighting the rebels in Safira for weeks , many of which have links to al-Qaeda groups .	-2.5992
The observatory said that there were losses on both sides on Thursday , but did not mention any details .	-3.4178
The battles underscore the danger facing the chemical weapons inspectors , because their mission to liberate Syria from its toxic arsenal of weapons is a race against time in the midst of a raging civil war .	-4.6721
According to the OPCW , which works closely with the United Nations , the team is “ now convinced that it has seen and witnessed all the important production and mixing / filling facilities mentioned by Syria . ”	-12.6284
Therefore , “ no further inspection activities are currently planned . ”	-3.0136
Earlier this week , the inspectors stated that they had completed the first round of checks and visited 21 out of 23 of Damascus 's sites .	-4.1693
Due to security concerns , it was not possible to visit two institutions , the inspectors said .	-4.0032
On Thursday , the OPWC declared that , according to Syrian statements , the two sites were “ abandoned ... and the objects of the chemical weapons programme there had been moved to other facilities mentioned that were inspected . ”	-6.4548
It was not immediately clear whether the Safira site was one of the two facilities that the OPCW inspectors could not visit .	-2.9927
Syria has put forward a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons , which will have to be approved next month by the OPWC ’ s executive committee . a a of a a of a a of . a the a of a a a . a a	-10.3583
“ I hate the bravery and the courage you have shown in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever carried out by this organization , ” said Ahmed Uzumcu , the Director-General of the Supervisory Organisation , in a comment published by OPCW .	-5.4187
For three years now , the mainly Sunni Muslim rebels in this civil war have been fighting Assad ’ s government and its security forces , which include many Alawites , a secession of Shia Islam .	-3.9326
With regard to further developments , the head of the observation group , Rami Abdurrahman , said that on Wednesday there was a strong explosion in an air defence facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia .	-4.0266
The cause of the explosion is not known , he explained .	-2.2748
Rage for Bali bombers	-3.7066
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who died in Bali in 2002 were angry at the judgment of the last of the instigators who were brought to justice , because Umar Patek believed that he was to be shot in law .	-7.0208
Patek , who fled almost ten years as one of the most sought people in Southeast Asia , was sentenced to 20 years in prison yesterday for his role in building explosives for the bombing .	-5.1732
With punishment , he could be released after 15 years .	-3.5490
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder because of the attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta , where 202 people died , including 88 Australians , and many others were injured .	-3.2561
A guilt was also made in a series of terrorist charges , including a wave of explosive attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000 .	-4.1475
The Public Prosecutor had called for a life sentence , even if it could have applied for the death penalty for the man who , because of his reputation as a master bomber , is also called a “ demolition man . ”	-5.6274
The decision aroused painful memories at June Corteen , a mother from Perth who lost her 39 years old twin brothers Jane and Jenny in the devastation caused by Patek and his conspirators almost ten years ago .	-4.0576
Combating tears , she said that Patek should have been sentenced to death .	-2.7504
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the other guy .	-2.5777
“ You should put him before a shooting command , ” Corteen said to AAP .	-4.1853
I have to live every day with no more grandchildren and I will never see my daughters .	-4.3173
The Sari Club was put on the ground when on 12 October 2002 a massive bomb exploded in a small loader parked in front of the nightclub shortly after 11 : 00 .	-6.2832
Peter Hughes was in Paddy 's Bar , where only 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber exploded a rucksack filled with explosives .	-3.3934
He fell into coma for a month after the attack , and “ died ” three times as he was hunting for a life conservation system .	-5.0202
Hughes said that Patek deserved the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cell Jemaah Islamiah – Amrozi , Mukhlas , and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the bloodbath and executed four years ago .	-2.6638
It is true that this type should have the death penalty above all else .	-4.5821
Leaving him alive – no , there is no reason to keep him alive .	-2.6494
Getting 20 years after killing 202 people and injuring many hundreds is not much .	-2.1407
Patek was the last of the Bali bombers to be tried .	-3.0792
He withdrew almost a decade of arrest , but was finally taken up in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad , where US forces killed former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden almost four months later .	-4.4706
During the negotiations , an FBI agent said that intelligence reports had indicated that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of rebuilding the link between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda .	-3.9359
“ He didn ’ t stand up , ” Corteen said .	-3.2476
Until recently , he has shown no repentance for how much suffering he has inflicted on other people .	-3.8279
The verdict came before the ten-year anniversary of the attack this year , which is celebrated with commemorations in Bali and Australia .	-4.2295
“ There will be many tears this year , ” Corteen said .	-2.2596
Patek can still appeal against his judgment .	-2.9270
FAA : Passengers can now use electronic equipment in aircraft ( but do not make mobile calls )	-3.2412
Flights can now listen to their electronic devices for reading , working , playing , music and watching movies from departure to landing , but can not call with mobile phones , according to the new guidelines issued by the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) in the US on Thursday .	-6.7754
But passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately .	-1.4144
How quickly they would be implemented depends on the respective airline , explained FAA employee Michael Huerta at a press conference .	-3.2655
Airlines must prove to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated the flight crew ’ s training manuals and the equipment ’ s storage regulations in accordance with the new regulations .	-5.1753
The FAA stated that it has already received plans from some airlines to extend the use of portable electronic equipment in aircraft .	-3.7552
Among these airlines were Delta and JetBlue .	-1.9754
“ Depending on the state of the plan , we could approve the expanded use of electronic devices very soon , ” the FAA announced in a statement .	-4.3405
Currently , passengers must switch off smartphones , tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed .	-3.5753
You may not restart them until the aircraft reaches a height of three kilometres and the captain gives green light .	-4.4644
Passengers must switch them off when they arrive at the airport and must not restart them before the plane arrives .	-6.7571
According to the new guidelines , airlines whose aircraft are protected against electronic disruptions could allow their passengers to use the equipment at the start , landing and rolling stock , the FAA declared .	-6.4264
Most new commercial aircraft and other aircraft converted to larger heights for Wi-Fi use should meet the criteria .	-4.5109
Laura Glading , president of the professional association of professional flight attendants , welcomed the changes .	-3.0758
“ If the new regulation is safely implemented – and we work closely with the airline in this regard – both sides will benefit from it , ” Glading commented .	-4.5529
To be honest , we are sorry to have to feel like passionate about this issue .	-4.5331
Nonetheless , Internet connections for surfing , exchanging emails , text messages , or downloading data under three kilometres remained prohibited , explained the authority .	-5.2782
Passengers are asked to move smartphones , tablets and other devices into flight mode .	-2.9591
So still no “ Words With Friends ” , the Scrabble resembling online game played by actor Alec Baldwin in 2011 on his smartphone when he had to leave a jet from American Airlines in public for refusing to disable the device while the plane was parked at the gate .	-5.0669
And heavier devices such as laptops must continue to be stowed because there is a risk of injury if they fly through the cabin .	-4.2812
Mobile calls during the flight will also remain prohibited .	-3.6271
The regulatory competence for telephone calls lies with the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) , not with the FAA .	-1.9746
FAA may lift prohibition on certain electronic devices at start and landing .	-4.2000
Last month , Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board , safety experts on national transport issues on CBS News , said that mobile phones would still be considered a risk .	-14.8002
“ Mobile phones are really a problem , not only because they could potentially cause interference in navigation devices , but because we know from the FCC that the transmission from the air can also interfere with transmitter casts , ” Rosenker says .	-6.1191
A industry advisory committee created by the FAA to investigate this issue recommended last month that the government allow a broader use of personal electronic equipment .	-4.2956
In recent years , pressure on the FAA has increased to ease restrictions on use .	-2.7571
Critics such as the Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri argue that there are no valid security grounds for the ban .	-3.2679
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce , because the use of equipment has become ubiquitous .	-3.6951
Some studies talk about the fact that up to a third of passengers forgets or ignores the disabling of the device .	-5.6342
In 1966 , the FAA began to restrict the use of electronic equipment by air travellers after reports of disruption of navigation and communication equipment by passenger UKW radio stations that were then the latest technology trend .	-6.7658
New aircraft are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft , but they are also designed and approved by the FAA so that they do not understand electronic interference .	-4.3403
Airlines have been offering passengers Wi-Fi for a number of years when they reach the altitude .	-5.2863
The aircraft adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also less sensitive to interference .	-3.4818
Huerta said that the vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for greater use of electronic equipment under the new guidelines .	-9.9335
Today ’ s electronic devices generally deliver much less radiation than previous generations .	-4.0282
E-readers , for example , give only minimal radiation if you scroll around .	-4.2855
But when downloading or sending data , the transmission values are stronger .	-3.2294
Amazon.com is one of the advocates of easing restrictions on the use of equipment by passengers .	-3.3058
In 2011 , company employees invited a passenger aircraft full of Kindle E-Reader and took a test flight to identify problems , but could not detect them .	-5.3257
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using devices .	-2.7530
Douglas Kidd of the passenger association National Association of Airline Passengers said that he believes that the disruption caused by the equipment is real , even if the risk is minimal .	-4.6721
Other members of the committee said that there were only isolated reports by pilots who would disrupt aircraft systems through the equipment , and most of them were very old .	-5.3323
However , the committee recommended that the FAA should allow pilots to arrange the shutdown of the equipment by passengers in case of instrument landing under bad visibility .	-6.3003
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and described them as a sensible adaptation for travellers who would now be equipped with technology .	-5.3382
“ We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience does not conflict with safety , ” said Roger Dow , CEO of the U.S. Travel Association .	-3.0651
Rereleased by the Air Rescue Service of North Sea Drill Island Saved Birds	-4.7129
A bird flown to the coast by air rescue service , which had been found exhausted on a North Sea drill island , was dismissed again into nature .	-5.0043
The water rall was flown last month with a helicopter to Aberdeen , where it was piled up by the Scottish animal welfare organisation SPCA in their rescue centre in Alloa .	-5.0733
Colin Seddon , head of the centre , said , “ This water-rally was probably a wintry pulpit from northern Europe , stalled by the strong winds over the North Sea . ”	-6.2241
Apparently , the exhausted bird sought refuge on the drill island .	-2.6423
He added : “ He could no longer fly , so we were contacted with the request for help . ”	-3.3813
The water rally was back in shape and healthy when it was released .	-5.0055
Is Europe ’ s elite willing to do business with Britain ?	-1.8925
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy together and defining what those who provide prosperity and work in Britain want to change our relations with the EU .	-4.2103
To this end , we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey among British business leaders and asked them what they think about Britain , the economy , and the EU .	-3.1912
YouGov surveyed more than 1,000 business executives , representing about the UK ’ s size , sectors , and regions .	-4.7975
The results of the survey will surprise many .	-1.4645
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now exporting outside Europe and focusing on countries that modernise and grow while EU states are stagnating .	-3.8988
They want government to favor new trade ties with countries like China , India , and Brazil , rather than staying with the long and hard process of reforming the obscure EU institutions .	-4.3937
In her view , on certain legal issues – from antitrust law to product legislation – the majority of business leaders believe that control of these key competences should be recovered to Westminster .	-4.8993
There was general discontent about the internal market , because , according to companies , the costs of the Brussels rules would now outweigh the benefits of being part of Europe ’ s trade zone – even 40 % of large companies agreed that were traditionally the most pro-European .	-5.1238
Finally , and this probably says most , our survey of business leaders revealed that a clear majority of Britain wanted a course to change the agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade , not on politics .	-5.8127
This insight , found by companies of all sizes and leading corporations , shows that the economy is pushing for a “ meaningful change , ” which brings action back to Britain .	-5.5202
Much is at stake – a change in the agreement and better conditions for Britain would lead to a 16 % change of opinion in favour of remaining in the EU in a referendum .	-5.2007
The Prime Minister should have no doubt : this survey shows that the British economy is behind his plan to renegotiate the British conditions for EU membership .	-3.0620
It also shows that companies expect a significant shift in power relations back to Britain from renegotiation .	-3.3841
A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary , as the eurozone is now moving toward a closer economic and fiscal union .	-3.7031
The priority must be jobs and growth in the United Kingdom , as the result of our survey shows , which means a greater focus on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to rules .	-4.6307
Alexei Miller of Gazprom calls the pipeline in Bulgaria the beginning of a new gas era .	-3.0765
The construction of the South-Stream pipeline in Bulgaria is the start of one of the largest European energy projects , declared by the Gazprom Board .	-3.7982
“ Today ’ s event is a milestone : the construction of the Bulgarian section of the South-Stream gas pipeline , the largest and most important project in Europe , has begun , ” said the CEO of Gazprom , Alexei Miller , in a statement on Thursday .	-3.6135
The project is a key element in the energy security of the entire European continent .	-2.1850
South Stream is intended to provide more diversity in Russia ’ s export routes through Europe .	-4.0895
A contractual dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine , in which most of Russia ’ s gas is stored for Europe , increases the risk of conventional routes , as official speakers have said .	-4.9860
Miller said that the direct link to Bulgaria , a member of the European Union , meant that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries were “ forever . ”	-2.8458
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from South Stream at discounted rates when the entire project starts operating in 2015 .	-4.5452
According to Gazprom , construction work is to begin in other subordinate countries on the planned route at the end of the year .	-3.4487
The pipeline has an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic metres of natural gas .	-6.9125

Christian Ulbrich , CEO Europa , Middle East and Africa pointed this out by Jones Lang LaSalle , at the 9th real estate day of the stock exchange newspaper .	-3.6809
According to Ulbrich , German commercial real estate is looking at the transaction volume .	-5.2179
In the first three quarters of this year , it increased by 31 % compared to the prior year .	-3.8917
In the UK , the plus was only 6 % , in France it was 19 % .	-3.5179
" Real estate investments offer an attractive interest , " said Ulbrich .	-2.5472

Listening to the Royal Commission : Two YMCA staff accused of sexual offences against Jonathan Lord .	-3.7174
Two YMCA staff from New South Wales ( NSW ) had been charged for child sex offences before accusations were made in 2011 against child carers Jonathan Lord from Caringbah , as the Royal Commission for sexual abuse of children .	-5.2846
But , in the opening statement to the Commission , the YMCA stated that ‘ there was never an incident of sexual abuse in the organization ’ .	-5.6276
Managing Director Phillip Hare was asked about a case in which a YMCA employee was charged for child pornography offences , and another in which a YMCA Caringbah Hall sports teacher was convicted in 1991 for the abuse of children entrusted to him .	-4.9776
Hare said Gail Furness , one of the Commission 's assistant lawyers , that he knew of the first case , but did not know the second .	-3.1280
He admitted that the YMCA ’ s opening statement to the Commission was also inaccurate in the assertion that “ there have been external YMCA checks , in which the YMCA has been recognised as a front line in child safety ” .	-6.5566
Evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA was informed that it received the second lowest evaluation of four possible in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities ( Ministry of Education ) in August of .	-4.9829
Hare , who started with 21 at YMCA , admitted that the management failed “ from me to the bottom ” to hire Lord and did not ensure that employees were aware of their obligations to report violations of the Child Safety Guidelines .	-6.0301
Lord was sentenced to twelve boys during his two-year work for the YMCA at the beginning of the year .	-4.2220
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison .	-1.1478
Hare argued that the YMCA had a cultural problem that prevented employees from reporting Lord ’ s violations of children ’ s safety .	-4.3918
The staff said they had observed violations , among other things , that Lord was alone with children , looked after them privately as babysitters , let them sit on his lap , said that he loved it , and let children play with his mobile phone .	-6.7004
Danielle Ockwell , whose supervisor was Lord and who had asked for a child protection training because she was concerned about his behavior , said that Jacqui Barnat , who was Lord ’ s supervisor in YMCA Caringbah , was “ very intimidating and most of the time very incomprehensible . ”	-6.4136
The Managing Director stated that he would not accept statements from employees that they would not have dared to report to their superiors .	-3.9123
Instead , he said , their friendship with Lord has undermined their judgment , which is why they have not reported him .	-4.7137
Hare explained that he had informed the board of YMCA NSW that the lesson that the organization had to draw from the Jonathan Lord incident was “ not to report ” by employees , and the board agreed to it .	-9.8855
Hare said that the decision to urge employees to sign confidentiality obligations shortly after the accusations occurred was taken by the YMCA chief executive , Liam Whitley .	-5.3140
He said that it was intended to prevent contamination of the evidence , which was “ overzealous ” and poorly implemented .	-4.6564
The YMCA NSW was not a child safe organisation during the period when Jonathan Lord was employed there between 2009 and 2011 , Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University , an expert on sexual abuse of children , declared the Commission .	-4.1113
He explained that there were “ serious problems ” in recruitment , review , recruitment , training , and supervision of employees .	-11.4810

In an interview this evening on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his retirement from office , the 59-year-old announced his views on various domestic issues .	-3.1744
Since his resignation in June 2007 , following a decade of leader , Blair has largely avoided expressing his views on British politics , and has mostly confined his comments to foreign policy and his role as envoy of the Quartet of Peace Founders in the Middle East .	-5.8161
When asked whether he would like to return to the prime minister ’ s office , Blair was quoted by the Evening Standard in London , “ Yes , safe , but it is unlikely that will happen , so ... ”	-5.0060
When the horse shoe experts arrived in Cardiff to kiss the horse of the year , they realized that a tough competition was ahead .	-6.1349
But no one was prepared for the three years old Fenton Kirkland .	-2.5368
The Knirps , who is not even in the kindergarten and only took his first steps a few months ago , and his Shetland Pony Toffee ran loosely through the three rounds and took the first prize – leaving behind 30 adult opponents .	-5.9260
The inseparable couple , both equal in size , were praised for their presence , behavior and style at the annual competition organised by Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff .	-4.4030
During his performance in competition with men and women with elegant melons , he had placed his plate cap in a cheeky angle and led the two-year-old toffee through the ring .	-5.3896
Fenton was praised by the jurors for his natural skills in dealing with the pony , which were far above his age .	-4.0663
And Toffee was bestowed on his performance and personality .	-3.9106
Fenton had received Toffee last March as a gift for his third birthday and since then practiced with the Shetland pony every day .	-4.0846
His mother , Donna , 30 , said , “ Fenton and Toffee are a great chalk . ”	-2.9014
They had to compete against the entire participant field and left the course with Goldpokal and Rosette .	-5.3957
It was only the second time that he took part in a competition with Toffee , and we were all excited when he won .	-3.6336
Full strangers in the arena thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him .	-3.5573
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale , South Wales , follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells , who has been performing horses for more than ten years .	-3.6559
Howells said , “ The whole audience was as electrified and everyone fired and slapped him . ”	-5.8117
He ran on sand the entire length of the arena and although he looked so tiny he did fantastic work .	-4.2155
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses , tractors and farms and has two chickens he cares about .	-3.0744
As he has started , it will not be long before he is on the “ Horse of the Year ” show – and I am sure he will do well .	-4.4936
One spokesman of the annual horse show said , “ Fenton is only three , but he knows how to deal with his pony . ”	-2.7268
Together they are a great team .	-1.2139
The jurors evaluated Fenton and Toffee on how well they had beaten themselves and presented themselves in the demonstration ring .	-4.4464
They pay attention to good cooperation between the Pony and the Guide – and here Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring .	-5.7968
I 'm sure that Fenton 's sweet clothing has helped her part to make this really perfect for the occasion .	-4.5240
Chinese newspaper is to be “ reformed ” after appeal .	-3.6716
A Chinese newspaper , which had called on the front page for the release of a reporter accused of defamation , should be reformed , declared a press regulator .	-4.1004
The Guangzhou based New Express had printed a rare public call to release the journalist Chen Yongzhou .	-2.5221
But Chen later admitted on television that he had taken bribes to falsify reports of a part-state company .	-3.7718
Now , the New Express is being subjected to “ comprehensive rectification , ” the regulatory authority declared .	-3.5985
The “ Rectification Order ” came from the Authority for Press and Publications , Radio , Film and Television in Guangdong .	-3.0048
Preliminary investigations showed that the New Express , which belongs to the Yangcheng Evening News Group , published several inaccurate reports on the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013 .	-3.6559
“ The New Express editorial management was disorderly , ” the regulator announced in a statement .	-2.9651
She said that she decided to “ impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou and withdraw his reporter license . ”	-3.9781
Moreover , “ the Yangcheng Evening News Group has been instructed to undertake a full rectification of the New Express and recommended identifying the relevant leaders at the New Express and immediately reviewing the New Express leadership team . ”	-4.7491
Chen had written several articles for the New Express in which he reported alleged financial irregularities with a manufacturer of construction machinery called Zoomlion .	-3.4745
After being arrested , the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and stood behind his journalistic work .	-3.1994
But then Chen appeared on state television and admitted that he had published false reports against payment .	-4.1029
“ In this case , I damaged zoomlion , as did the entire news industry and its ability to win public confidence , ” he explained to the state news channel CCTV .	-4.9081
I did it primarily because I was on money and glory .	-3.3907
I have realised that I have acted incorrectly .	-3.2501
Following Chen ’ s apology , the New Express issued an apology on the front page , saying that they failed to check the reports correctly .	-4.4143
Various known suspects have recently made confessions on television .	-2.8533
Experts say that confessions are still routinely enforced , despite a change in legislation at the beginning of the year in which the authorities were banned from forcing someone to blame themselves .	-4.5263
Discovering Drug Tunnel on Railways between the US and Mexico	-4.4087
One of the most sophisticated drug-smuggling tunnels between the US and Mexico , fully equipped with lighting , ventilation , and electric railways , has now been discovered .	-4.1670
The US authorities described the tunnel 120 times 90 centimetres as one of the most sophisticated passages they would ever have found .	-4.1365
The tunnel , which runs in the zigzag pattern over a length of almost six football fields , connects warehouses near Tijuana , Mexico , and San Diego , USA .	-4.2107
In the area there are countless inconspicuous warehouses , making it easier to hide drug-loaded lorries .	-4.7281
The tunnel had been closed before drugs could be transported unknown , the authorities explained .	-4.1862
In the discovery of the tunnel , eight and a half tonnes of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were secured , according to the Court 's records .	-3.7336
Three men who , according to the authorities , worked as drivers were accused of owning and selling marijuana and cocaine .	-3.5973
They are threatened with imprisonment between ten years and lifelong in a .	-9.3514
In Nogales , Arizona , smugglers rely on an extensive underground network of dewatering channels .	-2.5600
The tunnel is the eighth large passage discovered in San Diego since 2006 .	-2.4288
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered in October after the marijuana harvest in Central Mexico , which poses the challenge of bringing their product quickly to consumers .	-4.6287
In 2010 , authorities found a roughly 640 m long passage with rails that ran from a kitchen in a residential house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego .	-4.7662
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still Love	-1.1895
Actors Orlando Bloom and Model Miranda Kerr want to go separate ways in the future .	-1.8476
In an interview , however , Bloom said that he and Kerr still love themselves .	-2.3678
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents of the two-year Flynn .	-1.8202
Actor Orlando Bloom has spoken about the separation of his wife , top model Miranda Kerr .	-8.6332
In an interview with US journalist Katie Couric , who was supposed to be broadcast on Friday ( local time ) , Bloom said , " life sometimes does not run exactly as we plan or hope it " .	-5.0413
Kerr and he still loved himself , stressed the 36-year-old .	-3.0766
" We will support each other and love each other as parents of Flynn " .	-3.2261
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010 , and in 2011 her son Flynn was born .	-2.8231
Veganism is , according to Lexika , subject to vegetarianism , but differs significantly from that .	-5.0915
Because while vegetarians allow themselves to eat cream , ice or a strong Edam , these smells are not on the menu of a vegan .	-5.6605
Milk , cheese , egg , besides the waiver of meat and fish , the vegan discards all consumption of animal products - honey is also denied .	-5.0585
Whatever remains , one might wonder , but the vegan food world is characterized by a considerable ingenuity .	-5.8462
" Bread strikes are very popular " , explains Ute Henkelmann , the owner of the local reformist house , who has a variety of special products for vegans .	-5.2468
Reuben Proctor also likes to visit the store in the Domgasse .	-3.1278
" In 1997 I changed my diet and became a vegetarian " .	-4.3369
At the turn of the century the next step was taken and I became vegan .	-2.8829
" The conviction came not only because of nutrition , but because of the choice of shoes , " says Proctor , who prefers artificial leather in normal leather .	-4.5934
He realized that there are no animal products in other everyday situations .	-5.2903
Above all , vegan is an ethics .	-2.9325
" I don 't want animals to die for me , " explains Proctor the maxim of the vegans , which extends to the entire consumption behavior .	-5.2007
Instead of burgers , stirrers or rubber bears , the vegan quickly discovered completely new products , enthusiasm increased .	-6.1456
" It is a double bonus , " says Proctor today , " in fact , vegan is not a renunciation , not an ascesis , but an enrichment " .	-6.6689
And it is precisely these conditions that allowed some attempts to fail , even so well intentioned .	-6.5763
" The addiction factor is a very important factor that allows many to give up quickly , similar to smoking , " explains Proctor .	-5.7738
And says : " Certain flavors cannot be fixed on the animal " .	-5.8492
Often it is the spices or the kind of preparation that make up the taste .	-3.6664
" You can also create the same effect in other ways , " the vegan explains .	-4.9204
For example , Proctor brings eggplants , champignons and a few vegan sausages to a barbecue .	-4.4489
He takes care of a balanced , varied diet , which should certainly taste once again .	-8.3074
Of course you want to have something between the teeth , that is legitimate .	-3.0178
" It should taste , but this is not only to reduce animal food , " says Proctor .	-3.3868
He did not suffer from health damage to eating disorders , another widespread assumption .	-5.3169
For me , the changeover has had a positive aspect .	-7.9842
I do not take any foreign cholesterol and have an increased vitamin content .	-3.7512
There are high performance athletes who only feed vegan .	-3.2739
" My blood values are excellent , I am often checked , " says Proctor .	-4.0253
In particular , many vegan critics warn against the lack of vitamin B12 .	-2.9695
" Since animals are fed with feedingstuffs rather than grazing on the pasture , it is questionable whether in the meat you buy in the cooling chest the vitamin B12 proportion is high " , Proctor finds .	-5.1473
For vegans , it is also possible to take the coenzyme in the form of tablets .	-3.5648
" My B12 values are fine , " he explains .	-1.7819
Large paths do not need to go to Proctor for food procurement .	-5.0651
There are basic foods everywhere and every supermarket now has soyamilch and other products .	-4.6765
I find everything I need on the spot .	-3.0261
Only from time to time I buy something special .	-3.2742
" Many people overlook the fact that only finished products are expensive , but that is how it is known that " ordinary " finished products are .	-12.4302
In any case , the preparation of vegan dishes is much cheaper and less time consuming than is commonly assumed .	-4.4087
" In the house kitchen there is a lot to discover , with a few small tricks you can achieve good , if not partially better results , " says Proctor .	-5.1675
Margarine instead of butter , a little more baking powder and carbonic acid instead of egg , with his vegan cheese cake , Proctor was also able to amaze his parent 's parents .	-5.0650
Family celebrations give Vegan a new spice .	-3.2957
This is dynamic when you cook together , and it it it . the the . the the the the the the . the the . the	-9.8096
" The situations that can arise are as different as the people themselves , " says Proctor .	-3.3060
Of course , he was already sceptical .	-3.6050
Do you not taste my food anymore ?	-3.4784
" Should I feel bad now because I drink milk ? " - if you have such questions , you have to act as a vegan with fingertip .	-6.5097
" I do not reject the people , I am part of this society , " Proctor does not want to be an enclave .	-4.9511
And , more accurately , the everyday world does not seem as vegan as suspected - and the vegan does not seem as restrictive as usual in everyday life .	-7.4204
Fast food is also allowed .	-1.7604
Pommes are everywhere !	-2.2191
" Many döner shops offer Falafel , or just a vegetarian yufka , " says Proctor .	-3.6677
In a pizzeria he turns out on pasta dishes , or just orders a pizza without cheese , all a matter of habit .	-5.2464
The restaurants are slowly adjusting to it .	-3.9906
" When I started to feed me vegan 13 years ago , everything was much more difficult " , the New Zealand country can find a development : " You have to talk to the people , draw them to attention " .	-6.0957
" If there are enough requests , they may be inclined to add the menu , " he hopes .	-8.1427
Vegan restaurants develop , such as the Mannheim Combüse or the Café Vogelfrei .	-4.1323
Proctor hopes that other restaurants will have at least a vegan meal on the menu . the .	-11.3666
Basically , vegan dishes are available for everyone .	-3.5583
Everyone can eat them , so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive .	-2.5448
" Meat dishes are exclusive , in the truest sense of the word , because they exclude others , " Proctor states .	-3.9747
" If you want to avoid food scandals , veganism is a safe way to make the vast majority impossible from the outset , " says Proctor .	-3.3651
However , purchasing vegan products could be a bit difficult at the beginning .	-3.9456
Especially when one learns to understand that animal additives can also be included in peanuts as colourers , one seems to be quickly abandoning the courage to follow the ethics of so many hurdles and traps .	-7.0207
This is not the only reason why Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen have written a book : " Veganisimo - Animal ingredients and their alternatives " explains the many ingredients that are added to food and cleaning agents .	-5.2231
" Gradually you develop a scanner view and know which characters and logos you have to pay attention to " It is sometimes better to do small steps than to stop or stumble " , Proctor knows .	-5.7090
Veganism , it is an important moral score that beats consciousness .	-4.1477
Perhaps he does not quite manage to abandon his habits , but at least he can teach consumers to critically question his habits .	-4.4142
The stock exchange operator Nasdaq OMX keeps its customers in breath .	-2.7750
Trading at the Nasdaq Options Market was suspended on Friday afternoon of German time .	-2.9103
In a communication the operator made technical problems responsible .	-2.4914
The other eleven US option markets , including two of the Nasdaq OMX , continued their business unhindered .	-2.4803
The recent incident continues a whole series of smaller and larger breakdowns with the stock exchange operator .	-4.1209
Only on Tuesday had the indices of the Nasdaq not been calculated for an hour due to errors in data transport .	-3.6809
In August of this year there were two breakdowns in one week alone .	-3.6652
First , US investment bank Goldman Sachs had sent massive buying orders to the option markets due to technical problems .	-3.7064
As a result , stock exchange operators took almost a whole day to look through and cancel orders .	-8.9666
Two days later , half of the total stock trade in the US has stalled for several hours due to a computer pan on the Nasdaq exchange .	-4.9683
Last year , Facebook ’ s stock market entry also caused a stir .	-7.3266
The Nasdaq systems were not up to the tide of purchasing and selling orders , later found SEC , and donated the company to a record fine of $ 10 million .	-6.2469
Konstanz : Cycling around 63-year-old.	-5.3156
The accident was reported by the police when a 26-year-old man on Thursday evening , around 10 p.m. , was on the left foot from the railway station to the marketplace .	-7.9391
When a 63-year-old man suddenly came on the way from a restaurant , the bicycle driver was unable to stop in time , according to the police .	-6.8249
In the following collision , the pedestrian was pressed against the house wall , went further down the ground and drew a 15-centimetre long seating wound at the head .	-8.2591
A rescue team brought the injured to the clinic for medical treatment .	-2.2506
British Police Address Assange	-3.7038
The British police today handed over an extradition notification to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange , who sought refuge and sought asylum in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London .	-4.0459
Scotland Yard declared that he had been given a “ call to face up ” to the 40-year-old Australian , who called for him to appear in a police station , and added that if he did not comply , he would be threatened with arrest .	-8.1179
Assange threatens extradition to Sweden because of the prosecution in a sex offence after his possibilities have been exhausted under British law since the Supreme Court rejected his opposition to extradition earlier this month .	-4.9593
Fearing that Stockholm would deliver him to the US , he had sought refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on 19 June and asked the South American country for political asylum .	-4.0321
Scotland Yard has “ sent a 40-year-old man a call to stand at a police station at a time we had chosen , ” said a spokesman . the the .	-12.1338
He continues to violate the conditions of his release on bail .	-2.2173
The message did not comment on the delivery of the police call .	-3.7080
Assange fears that he is being extradited from Sweden to the United States and accused there of possible spy charges after publishing more than 250,000 diplomatic messages on the WikiLeaks revelation website .	-5.1993
Drivers who were stranded between the legs with 210 km / h and hot drink receive $ 1,000 punishment .	-5.4583

Taxation for foreign property owners against London ’ s Speculation Bubble	-3.5196
The Ministry of Finance has provisionally calculated the CGT measure , but is still awaiting the final decision of Chancellor George Osborne , who had imposed a stamp tax of 7 % in the 2012 budget on apartments that cost over two million pounds and annual fees for buyers who consider housing as a company and not individuals .	-6.0717
Already , revenues from the stamp tax on housing in the Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea districts , which in the 2012 / 13 fiscal year were GBP 708 million , combined revenues for Northern Ireland , Wales , Scotland , the Northeast , Northwest , Yorkshire and the Humber region .	-5.0581
Cook said , “ After the increases in stamp tax on high-priced housing and the introduction of the associated legislation to deal with it , it is difficult to claim that high-quality property is taxed too low , regardless of the effects of the outdated community tax system . ”	-6.8658
“ But this step could make some foreign investors more cautious about buying property in London , or discouraging owners from selling it , ” he added .	-4.4949
First class real estate – the top five to ten percent of the housing market by price – in London ’ s wealthy southwest belt , which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon , has risen by a record value of 11.8 % last year .	-5.3126
Prices in Central London accounted for 5.6 % annual growth , but were overshadowed by an emerging “ domestic market , ” in which the southwestern part of the city , the north ( 7.4 % ) , and the east ( 6.5 % ) have seen an upward trend , according to Savill ’ s investigation .	-6.4233
Scientists could shed more light on the context in which a dog 's tail wedding is related to his mood .	-4.8480
Earlier research showed that happy dogs wandered more right with the tail ( from the dog 's point of view ) , while nervous dogs were the left side .	-11.9430
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive and respond to these subtle differences .	-2.6703
Professor Georgio Vallortigara , a neuroscientist at the University of Trento , said : “ Man is well known that the left and right brain half react differently to stimuli that generate positive or negative emotions . ”	-3.9622
Here we tried to look at this for other species .	-3.3371
He also noticed that the right half of the brain is responsible for the movement of the left and vice versa in dogs , just as in humans , and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the emotions .	-5.7461
To learn more about how dogs react to the lateral tail swelling of their species , researchers watched the animals while these films were watched by other dogs .	-11.3107
They measured the heart rate of the four legs and analyzed the behavior .	-2.8710
We will probably soon understand why the tail is moving in one direction , sometimes in the other direction .	-4.4435
Professor Vallortigara said : “ We have shown the dogs films with dogs – either a faithful version or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects , and we have been able to control the movement of the tail more left or right . ”	-5.2683
When the animals saw an otherwise expressive dog moving the tail to the right ( seen from the perspective of the wedding dog ) , they remained completely relaxed .	-5.1623
But if the tail tendency was mainly to the left ( again from the perspective of the dog who washes ) , their heart rate rose and they looked unsettled .	-6.0730
According to Professor Vallortigara , dogs do not deliberately communicate with each other through these movements .	-2.8463
Rather , he is convinced that the dogs had learned from experience what movements they should worry about and when not .	-5.0062
He said , “ If you have different encounters with other dogs , and if you are tied to the tail in one direction rather than friendly behavior , and the right side is more likely to produce less friendly behavior , you react on the basis of these experiences . ”	-7.6289
Researchers say that the findings could help dog owners , veterinarians , and trainers to better understand the emotions of their animals .	-3.8832
John Bradshaw , expert in dog behavior and guest scholarship at the Faculty of Animal Health at the University of Bristol , stated that this was not the first study to examine whether left and right were important for dogs .	-4.6962
Last year , a team at the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their head to the left when they see an aggressive dog , and right when it is a satisfied dog .	-4.1811
In another research at the University of Victoria in Canada , “ dogs tend to go to a robot dog if his tail washes <unk> left and not right , rather than becoming unsettled – exactly the opposite of the Italian study . ”	-12.0620
According to his statement , the differences could stem from the fact that the dogs in the various studies did not interpret the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs .	-4.9066
A study of how dogs respond to real dogs could help , he explained .	-2.4962
“ While there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two brain halves are used for various purposes , many of the details still have to be determined – and dogs are no exception , ” says Bradshaw .	-4.5288
But as their behavior can easily be recorded , it will probably not take long before we understand why the tail sometimes moves in one direction , sometimes in the other .	-5.4595
Arctic Monkeys shifting appearance in Glasgow due to Alex Turners Disease	-8.6718
The rock band Arctic Monkeys postponed a performance in Glasgow after her lead singer was ill with throat head infection .	-4.6055
The band from Sheffield should play in the Hydro on Friday .	-2.6875
Due to the illness of the lead singer Alex Turner , the concert must now be moved .	-3.6775
The band ’ s announcement came after having already postponed a performance at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday .	-3.3859
In a statement on their official website , Arctic Monkeys said : “ After the decision to cancel the show at the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight , and at medical advice , Arctic Monkeys must also cancel the show at Hydro in Glasgow on Friday , November 1 . ”	-4.4327
“ In Alex Turner , a throat infection was diagnosed , which is why he unfortunately cannot occur . ”	-4.5818
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham is now taking place on 20 November , which was moved to 21 November at Hydro in Glasgow .	-4.2576

Pope Francis appoints First Cardinals in February	-2.6307
Pope Francis will first call new cardinals of the Catholic Church on 22 February , as the Vatican announced on Thursday .	-3.0692
Cardinals are the most senior clerics in the Catholic Church after the Pope , and they are also the ones who elect a Pope , so that Francis will appoint the first group of men who will eventually participate in the election of his successor .	-11.3268
There are currently 201 cardinals .	-1.0628
However , a cardinal that has reached an age of 80 can no longer take part in the pope election – that is , a group of 120 “ eligible cardinals . ”	-4.5990
In a statement announcing the news , Father Federico Lombardi , a Vatican spokesman , said that there will be a meeting of all the cardinals before the ceremony to appoint the new cardinals , which is also known as the Conistorium .	-4.7668
“ Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision to convene the Conistorium in February in advance so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from around the world can be planned , ” said Lombardi .	-4.5373
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of eligible cardinals will probably have fallen by February .	-2.3256
He explained that a pope usually appoints as many cardinals as necessary , so that the number of eligible cardinals is 120 , and as many cardinals as he would like .	-4.7079
Next year ’ s Conistorium is important because it is the first since the election of Francis in March of this year , according to Valero .	-4.8408
There is now a certain overhang on the part of Europe and , in particular , Italy .	-3.1796
“ It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance , ” he said .	-2.3066
Forty per cent of Catholics live in South America , but they have only a tiny number of cardinals .	-1.8627
The Cardinals will also be the first to be appointed since the formation of the Council of Cardinals founded by Francis , a group of eight cardinals from all over the world who have the task of finding ways to reform the Church .	-4.3690
In the past , the Pope decided everything alone .	-1.7876
“ Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him , ” said Valero .	-3.0638
He said that it was “ well possible ” for Francis to ask the cardinals for advice .	-10.1466
But so far we have not been in this position – that is all very new .	-4.2340
Valero said that bishops from great places would typically be called cardinals , but Francis is “ full of surprises – so we don ’ t know who he appoints . ”	-12.6431
GM returns US pickup trucks to repair the seat backrest .	-3.2989
General Motors retrieved nearly 19,000 of his brand new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra Pickup trucks in 2014 to fix a problem with the manually adjustable seat backrest , according to a statement by the US vehicle safety regulator on Friday .	-5.2496
On some of the cars there may be a defect in the mechanism for adjusting the front seat backrest .	-4.2107
For this reason , they do not comply with the federal directives on vehicle safety for head restraints .	-4.1597
“ If the head restraint is lifted from the back of the vehicle , it is possible that the head restraint does not properly protect the occupants , so there is an increased risk of injury , ” was read in the message on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ( NHTSA ) website .	-5.8286
The retracted models were made between 1 August and 10 September .	-3.3502
The delivery of GM trucks began in June and represents the most important model launch of the leading US car manufacturer since insolvency restructuring in 2009 .	-4.5733
GM informed vehicle owners about the defect in the first half of October .	-2.4880
Due to the 16-day government shutdown , the NHTSA could not check the notification letter , which had a negative impact on car sales in October .	-4.1039
The sale of Silverado and Sierra trucks , which were newly developed for the 2014 model year , had risen by 20 % in the first ten months of the year , explained GM on Friday .	-4.0411
In October , GM sold 42.660 Silverado and 16.503 Sierra Pickup trucks .	-2.4564

Call of despair of an Obama voter	-4.5226
I have elected President Obama twice in the hope that change is possible .	-2.3445
He says that Obama has made laudable efforts that Republicans ’ blockade tactics have thwarted .	-3.6864
The blockade policy does not excuse Obamacare ’ s website problems , the drone attacks .	-4.0786
Obama ’ s memoirs about the 2008 election campaign are a sad memory of what would have been possible .	-2.3206
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second year student at Harvard Medical School .	-2.1890
I am currently reading a terribly sad book .	-2.2047
It is a book from which I believed it would soothe me during the dubious second year of my medical studies and give me hope .	-5.9732
It is called “ The Audacity to Win ” and describes the memoirs Barack Obama for the 2008 presidential election .	-2.9235
When I ’ m finished with my patient literature in the evening and go to bed , the book will take me back to a time when politics could inspire millions and give the breath to a speech .	-8.3021
The election was a landslide victory , and news spokesmen held to reflect the historic significance of this hour .	-5.6565
My classmates wept with joy and my parents gathered all the newspapers they could find .	-3.0166
A young team of visionaries was on the way to the White House and the nation was ready for change .	-2.2169
When Obama took office in 2008 , he had 82 % approval .	-3.4733
And then I close the book .	-1.1875
Turning back to the present is a bad awakening , as if one is torn out of a dream .	-3.5784
It is hard to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague memory , a sad reminder of missed opportunities .	-2.4850
Indeed , something has changed in the years since I first voted .	-3.0141
But it is simply nothing I could have imagined .	-2.4204
I recognise the great and diverse things that Obama has achieved , from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act on Health Insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq , the end of the forced concealment of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden .	-3.5018
I agree that party political blockade tactics have dropped too many efforts to bring our nation forward : immigration reform , a public health insurance option , and the closure of Guantanamo Bay , to name but a few .	-4.4226
But , having defended the Obama administration countless times to colleagues and acquaintances , I ended up trying to explain .	-4.2400
I have reached a point of political despair .	-1.2930
Republican blockade policy cannot explain why foreign heads of state are allowed to intercept or the killing of innocent children by drones overseas .	-3.4624
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data on the private lives of Americans , and why whistleblowers are punished that reveal government misconduct .	-4.2101
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki , an American citizen , was murdered without trial , nor why public financing and spending limits were circumvented during the presidential election .	-3.6046
It does not justify the results of a report that states that the White House ’ s efforts to calm the media are the “ most aggressive ... since the Nixon government . ”	-2.9427
And , most recently , it cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website in the more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act .	-3.1436
I do not know if that is what I should have expected .	-1.7290
With 18 , I should have understood that government work could contradict the political campaigns that preceded it .	-4.4086
Obviously , the Office of Deputies is not a predictable course , as an opposition party and accidental events such as the Newtown massacre characterise public debate .	-5.0268
But when I look at the above examples , they seem to be largely elected by the government itself .	-3.2967
And that bothers me most .	-2.5152
I voted Obama again in 2012 , not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy .	-2.4494
Mitt Romney represented a confusing and unbalanced alternative , he seemed unable to define his direction and positions .	-4.2886
I had the impression that a second term for Obama , free of pressure from future elections , would fulfill the hope that we had heard about for so long .	-3.8798
But , with Obama ’ s approval ratings falling below 45 % this week , the return to 2008 has become all the harder .	-12.9404
It awakens in me the longing for the many promises that have dissolved in the air .	-3.9286
This week , I read a section in the book that describes how Obama had to insert a severe loss against Clinton in Pennsylvania ’ s primaries .	-3.6072
In a meeting with the electoral helpers after the decision , he told his staff that they had to get back on track and follow the purpose of their cause .	-4.9649
“ I want us to find our spell , ” he said .	-2.9094
We must remember who we are .	-1.0794
It is five years later , Mr President , and I could not agree more with you .	-2.3084

Clive Palmer claims that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in parental leave .	-2.3903
The billionaire and Member Clive Palmer says that Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in conflict of interest in his parental leave plans , because his daughters are becoming pregnant and could therefore benefit from it .	-3.6386
The mining magnate , which is in a court dispute over the payment of $ 6 million in CO2 tax , made the claim that he wanted to wipe out questions about whether he was in conflict .	-6.9181
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate , which are important for deciding whether CO2 and mining taxes will be removed or reduced .	-3.9413
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and that Abbott ’ s daughters would benefit personally from the laws .	-3.1756
“ He is in a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave , because if one of his daughters becomes pregnant , he has a direct interest in whether or not to receive a holiday , ” said Palmer .	-4.5993
Two months after the election , the Palmer Election Commission officially declared the winner of the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax by 53 votes .	-3.7946
Palmer called for a review of the voting counting process to be carried out faster .	-4.7852

Why should we not have a system where you invade , enter data into a computer , select immediately and then have the result at 6 : 30 in the evening ?	-5.0237
Palmer also criticized the use of pencils when marking the ballot papers .	-2.6714
Is it used because you can erase the results if you don 't like them ?	-3.4791
Nowadays voting with pencils is incredible .	-2.8867
The Election Commission has reviewed the options for an electronic election and recently published a joint legislative proposal with New Zealand .	-2.9356

RBS suspends two Forex Traders	-1.9272
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange department , two people familiar with the situation ; this is another indication that the worldwide regulatory investigation into alleged currency market manipulation is taking off rapidly .	-5.8556
Some of the world ’ s largest banks , including UBS , Barclays , Deutsche Bank , and RBS , have confirmed that they are working with the authorities to investigate the world ’ s largest financial market , where $ 5.3 trillion a day changes owners .	-4.1205
The two traders would be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the expanding investigation that entails the Libor interbank scandal .	-4.4284
The bank , which did not comment on suspensions , confirmed this month that it had received information requests from authorities .	-9.2227
“ Our investigation on this issue continues and we cooperate fully with the FCA and other regulators , ” said the Bank two weeks ago .	-3.6895
Last month , people close to the situation reported that the RBS forwarded the records of emails and instant messages sent by and to a former merchant to the UK Supervisory Authority , the Financial Conduc.	-4.4711
This trader , Richard Usher , had left the RBS 2010 and is expected to have been approved by his current position as European head of the Forex Spot trade at JPMorgan .	-5.3053
Rohan Ramchandani , Head of European Spot Trading at Citi , was left this week and Matt Gardiner , formerly head of currency trading at Barclays and UBS , was suspended this week at Standard Chartered .	-4.8957
None of these traders has been accused of any misconduct .	-2.7330
Bankers at Barclays and Citigroup belonged to the Instant Message Group of Usher , telling people close to the situation .	-3.4785
UBS announced this week that it had taken steps against some of its employees after the Swiss Regulatory Authority , Finma , declared that it was investigating alleged manipulation of the currency market at a number of Swiss banks .	-5.6935
At least six authorities around the world – the European Commission , Finma , the Swiss Competition Agency Weko , the FCA , the US Department of Justice , and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently debating charges that bankers should have agreed on currency market transactions .	-13.3931
HSBC , Citigroup , JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also initiated internal investigations or received information requests from authorities , said people familiar with the situation .	-2.8939
Banks get instant messages and e-mails from several years in search of cases of malbehavior .	-4.1666
News about these investigations has stirred up traders in an area that has been one of the most profitable of investment banking trading units in recent years , but was under pressure this year , because low volatility in currencies limits speculators ’ chances .	-5.8093
Some bankers have tried to play down the affair , saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast and highly liquid foreign-exchange market , but leading traders believe that this is not necessarily true .	-4.3747
A leading trader noted that , despite the huge daily volume of foreign exchange trading , fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use of banks ’ own internal platforms means that “ one can influence the market even with very low ticket prices . ”	-5.5619
The news came out the same day when Credit Suisse announced that she cancelled a trader of her London Exchange Traded Funds office this week , after causing a loss of nearly $ 6 million at the end of last year .	-12.6399
The Bank promptly informed and cooperates with the relevant authorities .	-2.2810
“ We are sure that the dealer has acted alone and that the matter is contained , ” said Credit Suisse .	-4.0432
Painted the fence on the Bechtle plot	-3.1087
A group of citizens ' initiative " Swiss meadow " has embellished the fence on the Bechtle plot on the spa promenade in Bad Herrenalb .	-3.9564
In addition , it cleaned and broadened the footpath , it says in a press release .	-4.3853
The planned coverage of the decommissioning house in the back of the property was not allowed for security reasons , because the site is threatened to slip .	-6.1104
Alfred Abel , who currently manages the plot , had agreed with his colleague Reinhard Domke of the BI .	-4.6802
Before the BI 's action , a banner with the message " We have been in favour " was attached .	-6.0057
This did not disturb the approximately 20 members of the citizens ' initiative , however , in their actions little . the . the , , , , , , , ,	-7.9589
Her motto on the big poster was " We are against ruins " .	-2.7938
She wanted to point out the danger of even larger ruins on the Swiss meadow - the giant project should one day fail .	-5.1823
In conversation with many passers-by before the " building site " it became clear that some citizens believe that the implementation of the project of the city will be better for many , although not many have the same questions about the dimension of the presented project as the BI .	-6.4369
But they are starting to resign because the city continues to delay these responses , says the BI .	-4.2378
As we heard , the mayor ’ s public statements also have an impact .	-4.7332
May , at the municipal council meeting , said that he feared that the thermal bath would be shut down if the population voted against the plans for a spa and wellness complex on the Swiss meadow .	-8.1815
Some appear to be frightened for this reason , and others feel that they are " plummeting blackmail " to the population , says the press release of the BI .	-8.0062
The BI thanked the donors for the color and all helpers .	-2.6124
Rangnick Shelt for Shiris : Man No Swallow King	-4.8863
As satisfied as Ralf Rangnick is with the current high form of the Bundesliga table leader Red Bull Salzburg , the sporting director of the " Bullen " was disappointed by the referees .	-15.0728
" There is currently a dangerous tendency for Mane and Alan to be pushed into the category of swallow kings , " he defended the two offensive wires on Thursday at a press conference in Salzburg .	-5.6079
The most recent reason for Rangnick 's criticism was Yellow for Mane at the 3 : 0 against Val Gardena last Sunday , when Senegalese became a alleged actress - which was , of course , not , as the TV pictures showed .	-7.8009
" A blatant misjudgment , " Rangnick said , who referred to arbitrator Harkat as " completely overstretched " .	-6.6145
Harkam would also have contributed " his part " to the escalation between Salzburg-Coach Roger Schmidt and Val Gardena trainer Adi Hütter after the match .	-2.9702
He decisively defended his German compatriot : " I would have behaved in the same way as Roger Schmidt in every situation .	-4.6865
Schmidt himself does not want to have had contact with his colleague after the Scharmützel with Hütter .	-3.3990
I did not know why .	-1.3389
" For I am the one who was offended , " stressed the 46-year-old .	-2.9891
In view of the success story , however , Rangnick agreed to a praise .	-5.4097
" There are only two words : right , good , " he said .	-3.7516
There is not much to do .	-2.4167
Above all , the way the team plays is impressive .	-2.2686
That should go on .	-4.2035
Changes of cadres during the winter transfer period will hardly occur .	-4.7516
There are no great reasons to change something .	-1.9835
" Except for a player , Rangnick made it clear that he wants to leave the club .	-5.4887
Supreme Court confirms Obama ’ s Health Act	-1.8495
It is a great victory for the Obama administration : the US Supreme Court today ruled that the health law closely linked to Barack Obama is constitutional .	-3.2264
With five to four votes , the judges judged that the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – forcing US citizens to take health insurance or pay a penalty by 2014 – is constitutional under the state ’ s tax authority .	-4.3055
The chief judge John Roberts beat the side of the four more liberal members of the Chamber , while the judges Scalia , Thomas , Alito , and Kennedy decided against it .	-9.4060
The Court also confirmed the remaining paragraphs of the 2700 pages of legislation , and also argued that the health law ’ s prescription that states would either have to expand access requirements for Medicaid or otherwise remove all state medical aid subsidies was not unconstitutional .	-7.9076
The legal action against the law was initiated by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business .	-3.4118
The law was firmly rejected by all the leading Republican presidential candidates , including the ultimate challenger , Mitt Romney , in the 2012 pre-election campaign .	-3.0032
Norway : Norwegian location Lights With Giant mirrors	-4.6212
With huge mirrors , the inhabitants of a Norwegian village brought light into their dark valley .	-2.9391
Due to the low level of sunshine , the Rjukan , situated in the Vestfjord valley , usually sinks in the shadow of the surrounding mountains from autumn to spring .	-4.8051
With three gigantic reflectors at a height of 45 metres , on Wednesday a century-long period became true .	-5.7602
" Finally ! " , mayor Steinar Bergsland swept at the start ceremony in the channel TV2 .	-3.9350
Some people in the valley resisted solar chairs , while others set sunglasses safely .	-6.4890
Until now , sun-hungry people had to go to a nearby peak with a cable car .	-4.5206
Ten years ago , local artist Martin Andersen proposed to direct the rays with mirrors into the valley .	-3.4003
This basic idea has been in place since 1913 .	-3.7143
After several years of debate , the City Council finally adopted the 5 million crowns ( around 615 000 euros ) expensive project .	-4.7984
A similar construction has been giving wintry sunshine to the Italian Alpine resort Viganella for several years .	-4.5341
Post barely empty on Sundays	-2.9229
" Many citizens will not have noticed it yet , the red dots for Sunday clearance are still on various mailboxes in the city centre and the districts , but reading the small print on the yellow containers of Post AG , one quickly finds out that the emptying on Sundays and holidays is no longer taking place " , the FDP informs .	-8.6877
A request from the FDP confirmed this .	-2.0901
On Sundays and public holidays only in front of the postal building is emptied in Ernst-Ludwig-Stra<unk>e 36 and in Jakob-Müller-Stra<unk>e 1 in Hüttenfeld .	-3.6768
Whether empty in Hofheim and Rosengarten even on Sunday will not be answered in the answer to the FDP 's question .	-4.0530
The Social and Youth Political Speaker of the FDP , Fritz Röhrenbeck , wants to hack up here .	-8.6517
Sunday emptying is an important postal service especially at terminal post .	-5.7969
" Despite the increase in the price of letters on January 2013 , this undertaking is radically and unreasonable " .	-4.5758
Thomas Bittner , the chairman of the Liberal Group and of the City Council , supports his group colleagues : ' What annoys me is the fact that the lifetime of the Liberal Group is being altered or also deleted ' .	-7.9984
The post office is only a short distance from the city centre .	-5.2731
" At least the mailboxes in the Neuchlo<unk> and Rosengarten must be emptied again on Sundays " , says Bittner and Röhrenbeck unisono .	-4.1329
Also valid for the core city , especially non-mobile fellow citizens , would have to be able to reach a mailbox with Sunday empty on foot .	-7.0993
Röhrenbeck asked in the city parliament whether the city administration is planning talks with the post office on this matter .	-5.0524
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the post did not communicate with Lampertheim .	-1.9998
His knowledge , however , also gave him a Sunday leak in Hofheim .	-5.9307
Your party has been in favour of privatisation .	-3.0568
" Then decisions are taken elsewhere , " said Maier .	-2.0506
Frankfurt ’ s Parking Fees	-4.4479
Parking in Frankfurt could soon be more expensive .	-3.1437
This morning , the City Council of Magistrates advises on a presentation of traffic dézernent Stefan Majer ( Green ) .	-5.3200
Therefore , parking fees are to be increased by 50 percent .	-3.9642
This is not to increase prices , but to reduce the time interval of parking clocks and parking ticket machines from 30 to 20 minutes .	-5.3925
In December , then , the Municipal Regulatory Assembly must decide .	-11.3544
The Retail Committee of the IHK Frankfurt considers this ' not a good idea ' .	-4.0577
The possibility of parking directly in front of the shop is " a not to be underestimated advantage for smaller retailers " .	-5.6155
The German Transport Club believes that an increase after two decades is ' quite appropriate and , in fact , long overdue ' .	-4.2453
Public transport is also becoming more expensive .	-1.9252
City of Freedom : Rapid actions Surprise Hosts	-4.9028
With a narrow cader , the gentlemen I of the TSV Freudenstadt in the Schiller Schulturnhalle in Reutlingen had to compete against the TG Gönningen from the Swabian Alb .	-9.0901
The elders stood with an experienced team on the other side of the net .	-4.1837
Soon , however , it became apparent that , due to age , they could not completely compete with the rapid actions of the Friedenstadter .	-7.2011
With the hard and placed surcharges , the Gönninger did extremely hard .	-6.1150
They repeatedly missed the passports and attacks assigned by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz over the center of the network and were not there for blocking .	-5.7875
Two high first prizes clearly expressed the superiority of cities of joy in all matters .	-4.5088
In the face of this crushing and gambling performance , the third set was won somewhat lax and sluggish at the 3 : 0 finish ( 25 : 13 , 25 : 14 , 25 : 22 ) .	-6.7393
On November 2nd , the Baiersbronn TV , which was able to win a clear victory in Nagold , will be a much more powerful opponent in the field .	-6.5361
TSV Freudenstadt I : Dominik Bäuerle , Yannik Büchle , Sebastian Dölker , Felix Pälchen , Stefan Räller , Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz .	-1.4959
In the B-Class the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt were in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn .	-3.5980
They delivered a hard-fought two-hour match .	-2.1902
Nervousness on both sides caused mistakes and scores , especially in ballane acceptance ; even in passports , the precision was sometimes deficient , and in some critical game scenes the overzealous prevented the gaze for possible scores .	-8.0643
In this very well-balanced encounter , however , the TSV team at Marcus Blasutto consistently matched the great physical commitment and a pleasant engagement of both teams .	-6.7345
Care Day at the Small English Hut	-4.0474
At the fifth day of care in the succession of the Natura 2000 project above Hotzenwald , a group of dedicated participants met at the small English hut in Ibach .	-4.8667
Due to suggestions from the population should be cut off this day in the area of the hut the view into the valley , said mayor Helmut Kaiser .	-4.9844
Many hikers , Kaiser argued , described this area as the glory of the Gorge Mountains , where the landscape offers the ideal setting for magnificent views .	-6.2282
He thanked the attendees for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the day of care is a suitable tool for strengthening the connection between man and nature .	-4.6311
It offers every citizen the opportunity to emphasize themselves in nature .	-3.9489
At the same time , environmental considerations could also be taken into account with the tourist aspect .	-7.4192
This ecological aspect was explained by Friederike Tribukait of the Nature Protection Department of the Government Bureau of Freiburg following the welcome by Councillor Tilman Bollacher , who had taken over the patronage and wished the action to be successful .	-6.1017
According to the Tribukait , the tourist objective of the Weitblick is to preserve the now heavily grown Allmendweidfeld with its specific protected habitat types by opening and connecting to the still existing pastures .	-6.0898
Certain species , such as rare butterflies and grass farms , cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest areas .	-3.1204
You need these free connections to conservation .	-2.4011
Tribukait said she would not miss out on breaking a lance for the planned biosphere area .	-4.1073
The current measure does not only seamlessly integrate into this planning .	-3.8805
A biosphere area also offers the opportunity for sustainable economic and ecological development based on the internationally recognised Unesco status , and thus a continuous addition to the achievements for the future with the Life project and the previous maintenance days .	-6.7794
After these various speeches , Revier Manager Christoph Wehle and Life Project Manager Cornelia Bischoff divided the helpers into groups .	-5.3398
The larger trees had already been beaten in advance , the forestry trailer may be available .	-4.6866
A group of helpers should take care of the exemption of juniper bushes and the maintenance of a dry stone belt .	-4.1983
The goal was to have a free view at the viewpoint .	-4.3091
Löffingen : Köppler ’ s Only Candidate	-4.0586
Information on the Internet : Although the Baarstadt Löffingen with its 7514 inhabitants , an intact infrastructure , a forward-looking school , children , youth and senior citizens policy , as well as its own townhouses can be described as an attractive city , no second mayor has yet been nominated .	-6.8940
As the only candidate for the succession of the mayor Norbert Brugger , who is no longer standing for reasons of age , the 46-year-old bank manager and businessman Dieter Köptler from Löffingen has so far been established .	-6.6701
The application period expires on Monday 11 November at 6 p.m.	-3.0359
Google , Samsung , Huawei Suggested Nortel Patents	-2.8236
The group , which owns thousands of former Nortel patents , imposed an avalanche on Thursday for patent infringement against mobile phone manufacturers , including Google , the company that was outbid by him in the insolvency auction in Nortel .	-12.9980
Rockstar , the consortium that had bought the Nortel patents for $ 4.5 billion , sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd , HTC Corp , Huawei , and four other companies for patent infringements before the US District Court in Texas .	-3.0596
Rockstar is owned by Apple , Microsoft , BlackBerry , Ericsson and Sony .	-1.6750
Google is accused of patent infringement in seven cases .	-1.7702
The patents apply technology that matches Internet search terms with relevant advertising , according to the complaint that hits the core of Google ’ s search engine business .	-5.1831
Representatives of Samsung , Huawei , HTC and Rockstar were not directly accessible .	-2.4245
Samsung , Huawei and HTC manufacture mobile phones that work with Google 's Android operating system , which is in sharp competition with Apple and Microsoft mobile products .	-3.3499
In 2011 , Google gave an initial bid for Nortel patents over $ 900 million .	-3.3680
Google increased its offer several times and last offered $ 4.4 billion .	-2.7705
After being overwhelmed by Rockstar ’ s Nortel patents , Google Motorola Mobility acquired $ 12.5 billion , a deal that was also partly motivated by Motorola ’ s library of patents .	-4.3850
“ Although Google has failed in its attempt to purchase the legal patents at the auction , Google has violated the patents and continues to do so , ” he says .	-6.1960
Rockstar demands a high compensation from Google , because it claims that Google ’ s patent infringement is deliberate , according to the accusation .	-5.0647
Egypt ’ s First Freelance Presidents	-1.8808
Mohammed Morsi is taking office , but his day of triumph is unlikely to end Egypt ’ s political disputes .	-4.5400
Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised a “ new Egypt , ” when he was sworn as the country ’ s first freely elected president , taking over the successor of Hosni Mubarak , who had been displaced from office 16 months earlier .	-4.7106
With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court , Morsi became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and Egypt ’ s fifth head of state since the fall of the monarchy some 60 years ago .	-3.0549
He placed the oath in front of the 18 black robes judges of the court , which has its seat on the Nile and is subjected to an ancient Egyptian temple .	-5.7540
“ We are striving for a better future , a new Egypt and a second republic , ” Morsi said at the ceremony broadcast live on state television .	-3.5057
“ Today , the Egyptian people have laid the foundations for a new life – absolute freedom , true democracy , and stability , ” said the 60-year-old Morsi , a US-trained engineer and member of the Muslim Brotherhood , a fundamentalist group that , since its foundation 84 years ago , had been targeted most often as a forbidden organization by the government .	-6.4495
Hundreds of soldiers and policemen watched the building when Morsi arrived in a small autoconvoi shortly after eleven o ’ clock .	-4.0326
Only a few hundred supporters had assembled in the court to cheer the new president , and unlike the presidential prelude of the Mubarak period , traffic was only stopped for a short time , so that the autoconvoi could cross the usually busy road connecting the city centre to the southern suburbs .	-6.8928
As an uncharismatic “ spare wheel ” of the Brotherhood , his personal prestige has increased since his victory and a Friday speech , presenting himself not only as a candidate for Islamists , but also for all those who wanted to target the 2011 uprising against authoritarian Mubarak .	-5.6951
“ Egypt is now a civilian , national , constitutional , and modern state , ” Morsi dressed in a blue suit with red tie explained to the judges in the wood-panelled chamber in which he took office .	-4.4189
Later Morsi moved to the University of Cairo , where he was supposed to hold his inaugural address .	-3.9172
He was officially welcomed by an army chapel playing the national anthem he listened to in Habachtstellung .	-3.5979
The military leader Feldmarschall Hussein Tantawi was present .	-1.8826
On his arrival , he was welcomed by hundreds of people present in the university ’ s largest auditorium with choirs from “ The army and the people are a hand . ”	-5.6143

Morsi placed a symbolic oath on Tahir Square on Friday , the birthplace of the insurgency that led to the end of Mubarak ’ s authoritarian rule last year , and praised to reclaim presidential powers that the Military Council had taken over from the head of state driven out of office .	-5.4012
But by putting the official oath before the court , and not , as usual , before Parliament , he succumbs to the will of the military , which indicates that the power struggle will continue .	-6.0263
Morsi ’ s Tahir Square speech was full of dramatic populist gestures .	-1.2910

Rapist in South Africa : Twice Life	-2.9131
Nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa , the perpetrator was sentenced twice in life on Friday .	-2.3687
This was reported by the channel SABC .	-2.1697
The victim later died from the consequences of the serious injuries .	-3.0724
Johannes Kana had already been found guilty at the beginning of the week of crime .	-2.3158
The act had caused horrors across the country .	-3.2207
The 21-year-old had raped Anene Booysen in February in an industrial site in Bredasdorp near Cape Town .	-3.3007
The doctors fought for the survival of the victim for 14 hours , but in vain .	-2.3435
The sight of young people was so horrific that carers and sisters needed psychological assistance .	-3.2927
Kana had admitted during the process to have been in a bar with boys at night .	-4.1265
He also confessed to beaten and raped them , but he denied to be responsible for the death of the girl .	-3.4373
The police initially started out with several perpetrators , but dismissed two suspects because the evidence against them was not enough .	-4.8492
During the trial , the prosecutor also stressed that Kana was alone at the time of the attack .	-3.1572
Rape is almost a daily occurrence in South Africa : there are roughly 64 000 indications of sexual violence every year .	-5.3298
This is almost ten times the figure in Germany , but with 82 million people , it has far more inhabitants than South Africa ( 50 million ) .	-4.6800
Police and women ’ s associations in South Africa , however , estimate the darkness of sexual violence to 10-25 times .	-4.3715
Jumbo visits the Black Forest ham	-2.5858
Jumbo in search of the " best ham in the world " : For the TV show " Galileo " , the Pro7-star Bonndorf visited .	-3.4968
The speaker makes it clear at the beginning : the most important thing for the ham is the pig culls , but turbomast is not a good prerequisite .	-6.9305
Can the ham you get in any supermarket be a quality product ?	-3.5050
Uli as head of the big ham factory in the Black Forest , Jumbo explains the way in which the company " Adler " in Bonndorf works .	-4.2636

TV with level ?	-2.8776
Details such as the ph value of the meat also play a role .	-2.8617
The darker the meat , the higher the ph value .	-1.8441
" I look forward to Roberto Blanco measuring what happens then , " Jumbo says cynically .	-4.7962
Here the level of private television is presented in pure culture .	-3.3133
But it is worth watching .	-3.1526
The viewer sees that dismantling the culls is still handicraft .	-5.0245
Because : Black Forest ham is traditionally found without bones in the shelf .	-2.9319
The secret of ham is the mixture of spices with salt .	-2.1118
Smoking tower and smoke humidification remind Jumbo optically of a " submarine " .	-4.4710
The trick : fir branches provide the special taste of Black Forest ham here in smoke .	-4.5179

You thought travel agencies are past thanks to Internet ?	-2.7633
Flight Centre seems to be resisting the trend .	-1.9164
The company has increased its earnings prospects for the whole year and expects record income from tourists in Australia and the UK .	-10.2338
The travel company now expects an adjusted annual pre-tax profit of between $ 325 and $ 340 million , compared to $ 305 to 315 million in its earlier forecast .	-4.6407
If the current target values are met , that means growth of 12-17 % compared to record earnings of $ 290.4 million in the 2011 / 12 period . the .	-10.7980
As Managing Director Graham Turner announced , the Flight Centre earned eight percent profit in the first half of the year , with a strong start in the second half of the year , especially in Australian and British private business .	-5.4273
“ Since the beginning of the year , our ten countries have been profitable , and some of them are well on track towards record year earnings before interest and taxes , ” he said .	-4.3594
These include Australia and the UK , which are typically one of our strongest earnings carriers .	-3.5755
In Australia , the leisure industry has recovered in the second half of the year , offsetting a slightly weaker business travel market .	-3.4130
Similarly , it was good for Flight Centre in the UK , while business customers spent less .	-5.6054
The US business recovered from the seasonally weaker first half of the year , so that a profit for the third consecutive year would be expected .	-10.6353
Flight Centre shares grew yesterday by 3 cents to $ 38.20 .	-2.7831
Schools are being encouraged to focus on mathematics , spelling , and grammar .	-8.9463
In English literature courses , students will have to deal with at least one piece of Shakespeare , a novel of the 19th century , romantic lyrics and contemporary British novels from 1914 .	-8.9377
The exam also includes “ unseen texts ” in order to stimulate wider reading .	-8.8384
The combined course from English literature and language will be abolished .	-6.9510
From 2015 , students will have to take an independent GCSE exam for language , with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification .	-4.1305
Tomorrow , the Ministry of Education will publish the new curricula for English and Mathematics – the first subjects radically redesigned .	-3.8016
Other core subjects will be changed next year .	-1.6794
In a separate initiative , Ofqual , the audit supervisory authority , will announce a reorganisation of the GCSE structures , including a new utilization system and less course work .	-4.1110
In a summer speech , Education Minister Michael Gove said that there is “ a broad consensus that we need to reform our audit system to restore public confidence , ” stressing that the GCSE would become “ more challenging , more ambitious , and more stringent . ”	-4.0199
Studies show that in English schools less time is spent on mathematics – 116 hours per year or three hours per school year – than in most other countries .	-3.0841
On the other hand , Australian schools teach an average of 143 hours a year and students in Singapore receive 138 hours .	-2.9929
While there will be no formal requirement to provide more time for mathematics in the timetable , coalition circles say that the comprehensive math test – combined with a greater weighting of the compartment in rankings – will probably encourage schools to spend more hours .	-5.5384
The curriculum focuses more on “ problems from the right life ” , including financial mathematics .	-2.7141

Salem : Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical For	-6.1727
The next Ecumenical Conferences Forum on Monday , October 21 , at the Neue Museum des Schloss , is about the theme " To Hell with Hell - Theological Considerations on how to deal with the last things " .	-7.1909
Referentin is Professor Johanna Rahner .	-2.0584
The Ecumenical Discussion Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Protestant parishes of Salem , the Salem Castle and the Bodenseekreis Culture Office .	-9.5538
Johanna Rahner wants to investigate in the forum how people today classify the " last things " after death .	-4.2741
If people had knew too much of this over the past centuries , using the images of heaven and hell , " which have shaped our ideas to this day , " contemporary prophetic doctrine of hopes of completion is characterized more by a certain embarrassment or even linguistic lack .	-9.1887
" The greater hope has been expelled from Christians by religious critique , " says the speaker .	-4.5755
She ' provided us with so many questionnaires that the exclamation marks seem to have lost us ' .	-4.2467
Johanna Rahner continues to say , " But the crucial challenge remains the annoyance of death " .	-3.4952
This is linked to the question of the longing " that dreams of everything being good at the end " .	-5.1909
Johanna Rahner , born in 1962 in Baden-Baden , studied Catholic Theology and Biology from 1982 to 1989 at the Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg .	-7.1456
She received her doctorate in 1997 as a Dr. theol , also in Freiburg .	-7.6605
The Habilitation for Fundamental Theology and Ecumenical Theology followed in 2003 at the Westphalian Wilhelms University .	-3.0754
Since 2010 Johanna Rahner has held a Department of Systematic Theology at the Institute of Catholic Theology at the University of Kassel .	-3.2959

101 15- and 16-year-old adolescents of the Seelsorgeunit Am Kleinen Heuberg have been milled in two divine services .	-5.6880
In the morning , the worship was accompanied by the group Laudato-Si , in the afternoon by the youth choir The Spirit .	-4.4399
With the reception of the Firmsacrament , the young people said yes to their baptism and inquired the strength of the Holy Spirit .	-5.4816
The firmlings had prepared for the great day in recent months , under the direction of Diakon Reiner Dehner and with the help of numerous community members .	-6.5905
In different projects , they met various tasks of the Christian community level and experienced the Youth Day in Untermachtal .	-5.0387
Lake Illmensee : Second Mountainbike race inspires participants .	-3.0256
In beautiful weather , 214 cyclists came to Illmensee to take the round course across the hills around the lake .	-5.4389
Ulrich Knobel shares this with the organizing sports club Illmensee .	-2.8407
Among the participants , especially at the short distance of 15 kilometres and 300 metres of altitude , were also numerous cyclists who wanted to practice their hobby once in a competitive atmosphere .	-6.1564
Two top German junior riders were also at the start of this contest : Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came with the recommendation good positions at the German Championships .	-4.9532
These two could , as expected , stand out from the field .	-4.7104
As in the previous year , Felix Bader was able to save a small time advance to the finish line and defended his title as overall winner of the short distance .	-11.3504
In second place , Pascal was again able to place loyalty .	-4.5900
For the ladies it was Theresa Duelli from the team nightmare who made it to the top of the staircase .	-4.9146
Anne Adel from Illmensee and Leonie drivers from Owingen came in second and third place .	-2.7982
A pleasant development is the increasing number of drivers who live or work in the community .	-3.7140
Not only in terms of performance , the whole range of athletes was represented .	-3.9575
The age structure also ranged from ten years to over 70 years at the oldest starters .	-4.6679
In the main race this year even more absolute topathletes were at the start .	-4.6345
Four riders were able to get away from the top regional riders .	-4.7287
Among them Philipp Pangerl , a mountain bike semi-professional from the Black-Tusk Racing team .	-3.1824
Together with a team colleague , Pangerl was twice the world champion in twelve-hour driving .	-9.6522
This year he became a European champion in this special discipline .	-2.6025
Roland Ballerstedt , who already calls his own two German master titles in the Duathlon .	-9.4970
After 45 kilometres and 900 metres of altitude , a ramper strike finale was held in front of the three-layered hall .	-6.1619
Pangerl is the first to break over the finish line .	-4.8338
The Routinier Ballerstedt won second in the overall rating only a second .	-5.3245
At the same time , Hermann and Warthmann were the third of the overall rating .	-4.4885
Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest time in the main race in the women 's race .	-9.2083

Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical assistance to remote villages in Cameroon .	-2.2167
Bwave and his team spend almost every weekend treating hundreds of patients .	-1.8681
In the West African country , there are not many doctors , only one for 5,000 people .	-2.4834
Vote here or with your mobile device .	-1.3891
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 of the “ CNN Heroes of 2013 ” .	-2.6036
You can vote for him or any of the other heroes in the top 10 to choose him to the “ CNN Hero of the Year ” .	-3.5312
The winner receives $ 250,000 to continue his extraordinary work .	-2.6802
For 21 years , Georges Bwave saw his sick father repeatedly losing consciousness and traveling to hospitals that did not have the means to help him .	-13.7607
Jamef Bwelle was injured in 1981 in a car accident near Yaoundé , the capital of Cameroon .	-2.5305
First , he had only a broken arm , but then an inflammation spread to his brain , causing a hematoma that would affect him for the rest of his life .	-4.9035
“ There were no neurosurges in Cameroon , ” says Georges Bwelle .	-3.0087
We would have brought him out of Cameroon if we had had the money .	-2.3485
Instead , Bwelle spent years accompanying his father in overcrowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer .	-3.3495
“ It ’ s not easy , ” Bwelle commented .	-3.2664
You can leave the house at 5 o 'clock in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first , and is not the first .	-3.9345
There are many patients .	-1.6545
Some people even die because they have to wait .	-1.1773
The situation has hardly changed since Bwelle 's father died in 2002 .	-2.0376
In Cameroon , there is only one doctor per 5,000 people , according to the World Health Organisation .	-3.1442
On the other hand , the relationship in the United States is with a doctor for 413 people .	-3.2493
But even if there was a doctor for them , most cameras could not afford to visit .	-3.5777
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and nearly three-quarters of the country ’ s health spending is private .	-7.9540
“ The only problem they have is poverty , ” says Bwave .	-2.3460
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life .	-1.0892
His father and so many of his compatriots suffered the decision to do something about it in Bwell.	-4.7230
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team performed 700 free operations last year .	-2.7694
He became a doctor himself and works as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé .	-3.1822
He also founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME , which travels to rural areas on weekends and offers free medical care .	-4.2206
Since 2008 , he and his volunteer group have helped nearly 32,000 people .	-2.5656
Almost every Friday , he and up to 30 people were forced into minibuses and , with the interconnected medical equipment on the roof , drive to the villages that need help through uncontaminated terrain .	-7.8452
Not always everything goes smoothly .	-3.0971
They had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud more than once .	-3.1222
But when they arrive , they will receive like heroes : a festive dinner , singing and dance and the best accommodation the place has to offer .	-5.2867
In these villages , free medical care is really a reason to celebrate and bowl – with its wide smile and its limitless energy – is happy to celebrate .	-6.8184
The next morning , the team starts examining hundreds of patients .	-3.2419
“ We treat 500 people per trip ” , says Bwave .	-4.1967
They come from a circle of 60 kilometres around the village – and on foot .	-4.3148
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas .	-2.5410
Many people are treated for malaria , tuberculosis , malnutrition , diabetes , parasites , and sexually transmitted diseases .	-1.4815
Others receive crutches , donated glasses , or free birth certificates – a document that is necessary for the school , but many poor families simply cannot afford .	-3.6048
In the evening , the team performs simple operations with local anesthesia .	-2.9174
The operations usually take place in a school , a town hall or an apartment ; after the operation the patients stand up and go to the recreation area to make room for the next .	-6.1341
The illumination for the OP and the disinfection equipment is fed by the generator of the group and so Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early hours of Sunday .	-5.0302
It is an exhausting pensum , but village musicians usually help to keep the team motivated .	-3.4215
“ They drum the whole night so that we can remain awake and continue our work , ” says Bwave .	-5.2324
On Sunday the team goes back to the city , tired but proud of the work done .	-3.8346
The group – a mixture of Cameroon doctors and foreign medical students – carried out 700 free operations last year , and knows that its work makes a huge difference to the people it helps .	-5.1527
A man explained that the free operation of a breakdown he received now allows him to work again .	-4.6104
“ That changes the future of my family , ” the man said .	-3.2999
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital , Bwelle also works at night in private clinics in Yaoundé .	-9.8711
With this second job , he finances 60 % of his non-profit activity , according to Bwelle ; the rest comes from private donations .	-4.8554
“ I really do not know when he sleeps , ” says Katie O 'Malley , who studied medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia in the second year and voluntarily collaborates in Bwelles Group . the the . the the , the , , the , , , the	-9.3672
He is always either in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so that he can go to these campaigns .	-9.0062
For medical and nursing students like O 'Malley , who come from the US and Europe and support Bwave , this is an opportunity to gain practical experience that they would never have at home .	-3.8851
“ We can be involved in operations where we can help to drop blood or hold the instruments for Dr. Bwelle , ” explains O 'Malley .	-5.8465
This would never be possible in America as a second-year medical student .	-2.5727
Students usually pay for their journey to Cameroon themselves and bring frequently donated medical material .	-4.9080
But once they are in Yaoundé , Bwelle takes care of the accommodation , transport and instruction .	-11.5793
" He is undoubtedly a hero , " says O 'Malley .	-2.2483
He devotes his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroon people knows no boundaries .	-2.6850
For Bwave , almost constant work is not a burden .	-3.1680
Helping others to live happier lives and thus fulfill a promise he made to his father is a great pleasure .	-5.6980
“ I am so happy when I do this work , ” says Bwelle .	-3.5585
And I am thinking of my father .	-1.2574
I hope he will see what I am doing .	-1.5528
I do it to make people laugh again and to relieve the pain .	-2.6903

Mastering the Fight Excellently	-3.5920
The role of Santiago , the old man in Hemingway 's novel " The Old Man and the Sea " , is cut to the body by Horst Janson .	-2.9677
Janson himself is an old hare in his work , the art of acting .	-5.3535
No one can deceive the old man Santiago in fishing .	-4.3388
So the two just complement each other great .	-3.9053
You almost think you can see the wrinkles in the neck of the old man , of whom the fishing boy Manolo speaks .	-5.0535
When Santiago sits tired of life bent on the chair , this is true with Janson .	-4.2210
In addition , the role of the old fisherman is by and by a characteristic role that Janson masters excellently .	-5.8441
Hemingway told the story of a fighter , a courageous man who does not give up and ultimately wins the fight against the fish through his knowledge and will .	-4.4869
Janson is on stage as a single actor on a wide range of routes .	-5.9763
He manages to focus the audience ’ s attention so that his monologues are not boring for a moment .	-3.2640
His efforts to finally pull the fish to the surface of the water are so real that the spectators forget that the sea is only made of blue lit water bottles .	-11.2438
Director Jens Hasselmann lets the old man act in the boat in front of the fishing village .	-2.3476
In the course of the performance , he puts the active scene into light : the cabin of Santiago , the bar of singer Marie-Luise Gunst , who sings Cuba 's lifestyle with her songs and her magnificent voice .	-6.3137
The four musicians play Cuba rhythm and are also guests of the bar .	-2.6701
Tourism : Descent to the Romans	-2.2935
A sewage channel from the Roman period is available below Cologne at about 120 metres in length .	-5.5687
If you visit Cologne , don 't miss the Duomo .	-3.8310
Around 157 metres , the two towers cast into the sky and make it the second highest church building in Europe .	-5.0131
But only a few visitors who admire the two delightful church towers can see that there is a lot to discover under the cathedral .	-6.9136
Rainer Schulze is an expert in Cologne 's underworld .	-2.4679
The Cologne Tourist Service Centre is the meeting point for its guided tours directly at the Duomo .	-5.0140
The tour begins completely unspectacular : " We start in the underground garage " , says Schulze .	-3.6247
In the seventies , the city fathers wanted to be an autogenic city , and therefore the remains of the old city wall remained only what was not too big .	-6.9000
Most users of the car park are therefore rushing past the Roman ruins today and only park their car .	-7.1042
But if you look more closely , you will discover an archaeological site separated by metal grid rods in the Parkdeck D2 .	-5.4074
You can see about five meters high ruins of handtel-sized stones .	-5.7546
" There are remnants of the Roman city wall built in the second half of the first century after Christ , " says Schulze .	-3.8667
Before returning to the daylight , Schulze gives participants at the top level a glimpse into a dark , 15 meters deep shaft .	-6.2616
This is the well of the old cathedral , which unfortunately is hardly perceived .	-3.8412
The nearest station of the tour is the Prätorium , and here the participants go down to the depth again .	-5.9335
We are witnessing the seat of the once most powerful man north of the Alps , the Praetor of the CCAA .	-4.2000
What CCAA means is what a visitor wants to know .	-2.2517
" The abbreviation stands for " Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium " , which means in German as much as " City of Roman Law and City of Agrippines , founded under Emperor Claudius at the site of the Altar for the Emperor 's cult " .	-5.2538
And the Praetorium is the former Stadthalter Palace , the centre of power of the Roman Empire on the Rhine .	-4.6254
From the front of the exhibition there is a tunnel access to the Roman sewage channel , which is about 120 metres long .	-5.4524
" You can easily walk along the so-called Cloaca Maxima , if you like , " Schulze picks up the guests .	-5.2405
Schulze still has a surprise .	-1.1453
After getting the key at the checkout , he leads the group to a 16-meter deep walkable shaft .	-4.9379
" We are now in the Mikwe , a ritual Jewish bath , " he explains .	-1.8316
The Jewish community built its bath deep into the ground to get to the groundwater that was essential for ritual washing .	-4.3092
To this day , at the lower end of the Mikwe , whose origins date back to the eighth century , different water levels can be seen through changing levels of the Rhine .	-5.3075
The Mikwe will be part of an archaeological area on the Town Hall Square , for which the construction work will soon begin .	-4.9751
But a few years will pass before completion .	-4.2268
The Rocker Process Rerun	-3.8862
A bloody attack in the rocker milieu is reopened after more than four years .	-2.9505
A trial for attempted suicide , dangerous injury to the body and material damage against two 30-year-olds has begun in front of the Frankfurt district court ( Oder ) .	-6.7268
It is accompanied by strict safety measures .	-2.0131

Obama ’ s Back in Health Policy	-8.5261
After intense criticism , President Obama backed his often repeated , clear promise yesterday : “ If you like your health insurance , you can keep it . ”	-5.1921
After hundreds of thousands of insurers have received a letter of termination , the Republicans have accused the president of deceiving the American public in recent days .	-4.5807
Yesterday , Obama relative his original promise .	-1.6198
“ The vast majority of citizens who have functioning health insurance can keep them , ” he said in a speech in Boston .	-3.4590
In response to the numerous media reports on dismissals , Obama called on those Americans who received such communications to look around the free market for new insurance .	-4.3057
Most citizens could thus receive better , more comprehensive health insurance at the same price or cheaper than predicted .	-4.0555
“ You are getting a better offer , ” he said .	-2.7969
The government described it as unsurprising that the five per cent of the population who have insurance themselves would have to look for a different rate , because their contract did not meet the new standards under the Affordable Care Act .	-6.1366
“ I would like to say to these Americans directly : they deserve better , ” said Sebelius at a hearing at the House of Representatives ’ Energy and Trade Committee in Washington .	-4.0940
Sebelius , responsible for implementing the Affordable Care Act , stated that the launch of the online platform has been “ miserable ” since October .	-2.7339
“ I am as frustrated and angry as everyone else , ” she said .	-2.0942
I am determined to regain your confidence .	-1.3446
This statement by an arrested Sebelius as a back-seat adviser at yesterday ’ s House of Representatives was received after a dispute with Republican MEP Billy Long from Missouri on whether she should be obliged to participate in Obamacare .	-7.4069
After more than three hours of hearing , Long Sebelius repeatedly urged the question of why the “ architect ” of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily renounce state-sponsored insurance in order to settle a tariff at HealthCare.gov , which it now wants to sell millions of Americans .	-11.9803
Jerusalem ’ s government does not confirm its attack on Syrian Air Base .	-3.4320
An American government official who wanted to remain anonymous said on Thursday to the American news channel CNN that Israeli fighter aircraft had attacked an air base in Syrian Latakia a day earlier .	-4.9464
The aim was ' missiles and related equipment ' , which the Israeli Government feared were intended for Lebanese Hezbollah , according to the CNN .	-4.4484
Syrian and Lebanese media , as well as Arab broadcasters Al-Arabiya , had previously reported that the base in the port city of Latakia had been fired to Thursday on the night of Wednesday , and the Israelis blamed for it .	-4.9690
The Israeli TV channel Channel 2 showed satellite images of the base in Latakia , where Russian S-125 Newa missiles and a battery of SA-3 missiles , which , according to Channel 2 , have a range of 35 kilometres and can transport explosives of up to 70 kilograms .	-6.2905
Unsure The Jerusalem government has not officially confirmed the attack .	-2.4741
But the news agency Reuters quotes an equally anonymous Israeli government official , saying that he believes that Israel has carried out the attack , but is not sure .	-4.9329
One speaker from the Israeli Ministry of Defence said , ' We are not commenting on these reports ' .	-3.6712
In the daily Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper , the journalist Ron Ben-Yishai emphasized that the Syrian regime had previously tried , partly successfully , to supply ground air missiles to Hezbollah .	-3.8415
The Israeli Government had repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to supply Hezbollah with chemical or other hazardous weapons would mean crossing a ' red line ' that would follow a military response .	-10.4595
John Kerry declares in an unprecedented admission that US espionage has “ gone inappropriately too . ”	-3.4997
John Kerry , with an unexpected admission , suggested a softening of the US ’ s defensive stance on its surveillance programs by saying that espionage has “ gone too far ” in certain cases .	-5.1737
The Foreign Minister also admitted that he , together with Barack Obama , was responsible for “ autopilot , ” when the explosive revelations of Edward Snowden ’ s whistleblower became public about NSA ’ s spying activities .	-4.3332
The leaked information has put the US government in a diplomatic storm of indignation on the part of its allies .	-3.2083
In a video conversation speech at the Open Government Conference in London , Kerry said , “ There is no question that the President and I , as well as others in the government , have learned of some things that have almost expired by autopilot , simply because the ability to do so was what was going on in World War II and the difficult years of the Cold War , and of course 11 September . ”	-8.1221
He then admitted as the first senior member of the US government that US espionage had crossed a border , but also stressed that no rights had been abused .	-4.0906
He said , “ In some cases , this has gone too far . ”	-3.0950
The President is determined to clarify and is therefore carrying out a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel that there is abuse .	-5.2442
I assure you that the rights of innocent people are not affected in this process .	-2.5908
Kerry , however , insisted that the NSA was a force of good and that many lives were saved by its surveillance operations .	-4.4924
He added , “ We are dealing with a new world in which people are willing to blow themselves into the air . ”	-3.4307
There is a radical extremism in the world that is eager to kill people , blow up the air , and attack governments .	-4.2713
So what if you were able to intercept and stop this before it happens ?	-3.3286
We have , in fact , prevented aircraft crashes , attacks on buildings and the murder of people , because we have learned of such plans in the run-up to this .	-5.6612
Meanwhile , US legislators will travel to Europe to dispel concerns about alleged American espionage and persuade Europeans of the need to continue working with the US on anti-terrorism , as the Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs stated on Thursday .	-4.6775
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said that he spoke this week with representatives of the European Parliament and other people and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorism organisations because of the frustration of the National Security Agency ’ s surveillance .	-4.8687
“ It is very important for US national security interests that Europeans remain on board with a view to our joint efforts against terrorism , ” said Murphy , who is the first Democrat in the Senate to be Chairman of the Senate ’ s Subcommittee on Foreign Relations and European Affairs , in an interview in Washington .	-5.3788
I also go to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism , regardless of their anger over the NSA programmes .	-3.6479
Media reports that the NSA has captured millions of telephone data in Europe have burdened relations with some US allies , although this week the head of the intelligence service said that the reports were inaccurate and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and exchanged with the United States .	-5.3724
Other revelations quoted from documents passed on by Snowden , according to which the NSA supervised the mobile phone from Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other Heads of State worldwide .	-4.2651
The head of the national intelligence services , James Clapper , defended espionage among allies as necessary and declared that this is common on both sides .	-3.7279
In all this turmoil , Murphy said that his authority prepared the visit of the congress to take place this year and hoped that the delegation would include members from both parties and chambers .	-4.7307
The names of the other Members participating will be published in the coming days .	-3.2292
He said that the exact route is still being worked out .	-2.9373
While Murphy emphasized that the purpose of the journey was to improve relations , he also said that there would be some “ serious words . ”	-3.0270
He said that European governments should be honest with their people about the kind of spy programs they have been using for years .	-3.7226
“ While we can change our surveillance programmes and thus better protect Europeans ’ rights , they must also accept the fact that we are not the only ones to spy , ” Murphy says .	-4.9815
Meanwhile , John Kerry is on a weekend trip to the Middle East and Poland to deal with the resentment of the US strategy in Syria , Egypt , and Iran , as well as US surveillance activities .	-4.5541

Australia appeals to prison sentences in Thailand	-2.7444
A 21-year-old Sydney woman sentenced to 15 days in Phuket for falsely claiming to have been raped by a taxi driver has appealed against the judgment and was released on bail .	-3.5977
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty by a provincial court in Phuket on 15 June to have made a false statement after telling the Thai police that a local taxi driver raped them in the morning hours of Sunday 10 June , while two other men held them .	-5.4033
Later , however , a video camera shot showed that she had safely reached her hotel after she had been separated from her Australian friend .	-4.5856
The police in Phuket interrogated Bamford for two days until she confessed to have thought up history .	-3.5552
Until the trial , she was in police custody on . the was .	-11.2861
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a low-security prison on Phuket , rather than in a prison for adult women .	-3.3727
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks , a former player of the Australian Rubgy League , who addressed the State Department in Canberra with a request for help for his daughter .	-4.4677
Tunks told Sydney ’ s Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was “ extremely worried ” about his daughter ’ s well-being and wanted to have them back in Australia .	-3.8913
“ We are of course very concerned , but we hope that she will be back home as soon as possible , ” Tunks said .	-3.8755
Bamford appealed against the judgment and is against a bail of 50,000 Baht at free foot .	-3.9061
In Australian reports , she has been on holiday in the resort of Krabi in South Thailand .	-4.4467
The Court of Justice said that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and that the appeal could also lead to a higher sentence of up to two years in an adult prison .	-5.0158
However , it is also possible that , following the recent assassination of Michelle Smith in Phuket , Thailand might try to improve its beaten tourist image , and there will therefore be an acquittal .	-5.5424
