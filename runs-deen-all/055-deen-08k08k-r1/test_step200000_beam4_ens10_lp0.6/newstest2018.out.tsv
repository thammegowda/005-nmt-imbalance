Munich 1856 : Four Tickets Changing Your View of the City	-3.6027
This is a misleading institution where young people are to meet today .	-5.2704
A cave where the S-Bahn tunnel is now digged .	-4.1674
Small gardeners manage the former land of farmers .	-4.4359
The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories .	-3.1606
It annoys if maps are not up to date .	-2.9891
Anyone who has had to get excited about this , because the car navigation showed a green meadow instead of a bypass road .	-6.0489
The historical maps of the digital Bavarian Atlas , an offer by the Geoportal Bavaria of the state government , are far from current - but this is precisely why they are very revealing .	-6.0220
Especially if you compare them with current online maps .	-2.3461
Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the spreading area of Munich Merkur since the 19th century .	-4.0569
The digital Bavarian Atlas is a patchwork that cannot be recognized as such .	-3.3805
More detailed maps have been incorporated into the large overview map for cities and municipalities , so-called original position sheets .	-6.2610
According to the Bavarian survey management , these were established between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria .	-5.6719
Your client : Napoleon .	-1.4193
The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .	-2.7620
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographical recording of Bavaria - for military purposes , of course .	-3.5868
Although the French troops finally withdrew with the peace of Lunéville from February 9 , 1801 , it was the present neighbours who created the idea of a comprehensive Bavarian map .	-4.5530
Kurfürst Max IV Joseph pushed the project forward , founded the " Topographic Bureau " - and thus the Bavarian survey management .	-4.2567
The original position sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and can be found on the website of the Bavarian National Library .	-10.4291
The comparison between the former and the present is most impressive in the example of the state capital .	-5.5234
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .	-3.0153
An example of this is Untersendling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856 .	-3.0564
Sendling was incorporated into Munich as a district 21 years after the map was created , i.e. in 1877 .	-5.8918
Today , Untersendling lies in the heart of the city .	-3.3316
The houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along today ’ s Plinganserstra<unk>e , which was only named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878 , a leader of the Bavarian peasant uprising against Austria in 1705 .	-4.1158
Where the Westpark is today is nothing but fields - at first glance : when zooming in , a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears : handwritten numbered floors from the so-called " original collection " from which the property tax was derived .	-6.8597
Small plots no longer show farmers - but small gardeners of the " Land in Sun " plant .	-5.7026
A large green area is visible north of Untersendling .	-3.0423
The Theresienwiese , the site of the Oktoberfest since 1810 , was actually still a meadow in the 19th century - not a concrete desert .	-3.5987
On the other side of the Isar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine .	-2.3732
In the original position sheet , in the area of the current district of Au-Haidhausen , you read not only the street name " am Gasteig " or the hill " Auf der Lüften " - but also in large letters " Irren Anstalt " .	-6.3617
Yes , here at Auerfeldstra<unk>e people were once locked in with madness .	-4.9524
In 1858 / 59 the Munich District Irrenanstalt " Auer Lüften " was established .	-3.8566
In 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the establishment - the psychiatrist who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .	-4.3392
" He was progressive for his time and ended , for example , the chaining of the so-called mistakes .	-4.4004
He has also prohibited personnel from using violence against the occupants , " says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Haidhausen Museum , who has worked with the institution for an exhibition .	-5.3547
For 280 patients , there was first room , later 500 seats were extended .	-6.0290
At some point this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the circular hospital in Haar 1905 .	-10.4664
Since 2006 , the Isar-Amper-Clinic Munich Ost , one of Germany ’ s largest psychiatries , has been located there .	-5.3037
The former Auer Anstalt area now hosts young people in the Munich Salesianum .	-4.3424
The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth home with training facilities .	-3.3159
To the west lies the football pitch of the TSV München Ost , to the east of residential houses from the 1980s .	-5.1432
In 2015 , the children ’ s house " Casa Don Bosco " was built , in architectural style , on the origins of the Irrenanstalt , which was destroyed in bombing during World War II .	-6.7048
The Marienplatz was listed as " Hauptplatz " around 1856 and the Kaufinger Strasse was called " Kaufinger Gasse " .	-4.9122
The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .	-3.5945
In December 1944 , the bombs of the Allies broke many holes into the city .	-4.0772
A large one remained until today - at Marienhof .	-3.2958
The English Institute , small business houses and a Middle Ages Gruftkapelle once stood at Marienhof , where the preparatory work is being carried out these days and on 5 April 2017 the spatenstich for the second S-Bahn stem railway line takes place .	-8.5208
With the slider you can compare the old Munich map with today 's aerial picture - and fill up the hole at Marienhof .	-4.2032
Civil Rights Group Published Travel Warning for Missouri	-2.9500
The National Association for the Promotion of Colors has issued a warning for coloured people travelling to Missouri on account of the discriminatory policies and racist attacks by the state .	-4.8224
" The NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri , which is due to enter into force by 28 August 2017 , calls on African-American travellers , visitors , and Missourians to pay special attention and extreme caution when travelling through the state , as a number of dubious racial incidents have recently occurred and recorded in the entire state , " says the Group 's opinion .	-6.5666
A recent Missouri law , which makes it harder for people to win discrimination actions , as well as the law enforcement authorities of the state that target minorities disproportionately , led the group to issue the travel warning , said the NAACP .	-5.8050
" They have violations of civil rights that happen to people .	-3.4092
They are stopped because of their skin colour , they are beaten up or killed , " said the President of Missouri NAACP , Rod Chapel , the Kansas City Star .	-3.2491
'We hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not yet heard ' .	-2.6585
It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States .	-2.7202
The group cited incidents such as racist offences against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .	-2.2360
Sanders died in dubious circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no petrol during his journey through the state and was detained by the police of Missouri without being accused of a crime .	-6.4844
The Council also draws attention to a recent report by the Office of the Prosecutor General of Missouri , which shows that black drivers in the state are 75 % more often than white .	-4.9205
" The recommendation is that people are aware and their families , friends and employees are informed about what could happen in Missouri , " Chapel said .	-3.6553
'People must be prepared to bring security benefits or let the relatives know that they are travelling through the state ' .	-5.5576
In 2015 , Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes , according to the FBI ’ s latest figures , classifying the state to the country ’ s 16th rank in terms of the number of such violations .	-4.9603
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination .	-2.5236
Previously , the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states passed immigration laws that oblige local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration violations , which ACLU believes will contribute to further racial profiling .	-5.1747
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries , but recently interest groups have used the measure to respond to certain laws and trends within the US .	-3.9889
The Fence Project is Fundamental	-3.6784
The Fischerbacher Weidezaun project is a success project and will continue next year .	-2.4206
The CDU members Peter Wei<unk> and Kordula Kovac got a picture on site .	-11.3308
At the Richtgrabenhof the Schwendemann family , representatives of the Fischerbach CDU local association met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two Members .	-3.7802
Markus Schwendemann initially gave insights into his farm , where he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , supplies 40 dairy cows and as many young animals as possible and accommodates holiday guests in five apartments .	-5.8932
For him , " Black Forest Milk " is the alternative marketing route for the milk of his cows , Schwendemann says .	-4.5945
There is only a regional table on the holiday guests ’ table .	-5.7303
Since he is also BLHV Chairman of Fischerbach , he called the pasture fence project " fundamental " .	-3.8449
I cannot be profitable on such steep areas .	-3.9171
A lot of work has to be done with the engine sensor .	-4.8158
" We are struggling with the conditions and topography here , " said Schwendemann .	-3.5719
In 2003 he took over the parental business and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if he did not operate a bio-plant .	-5.0181
For Mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear : " The municipality recognized the importance of the pasture fence project and is happy about the promotion of leadership " .	-5.4739
Farmers would have to be supported at the cost of EUR 3000 to 4000 per hectare .	-3.2794
It is hoped that this could take a long time to reforestation the land .	-6.3479
" The greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how to continue their business , " said the mayor .	-5.3026
Farmers are often criticized for promoting them .	-3.3394
In 2013 , a total of 25 plots were fenced by eleven participants through the fence promotion .	-4.8915
The open area is thus 40 hectares which cannot be reforested until at least 2023 .	-4.3409
Of the total cost of 71 500 euros , half was supported by Leader , and a quarter was carried by the municipality of Fischerbach .	-4.9257
Thus , farmers remained EUR 12 610 , which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of grazing fence .	-3.9082
" The great advantage is the longevity of fences , " explained Schwendemann .	-2.6833
Kordula Kovac stressed : ' You are doing a good job , without farmers and rural women it is not possible ' .	-4.3081
Peter Wei<unk> also said : " Here the best food is produced " .	-4.5759
The Landscape Care Directive ( LPR ) of Baden-Württemberg enables the state promotion of fences .	-3.9148
The aim is to keep the Black Forest open .	-1.9890
A precondition is the existence of a promotional environment called the LPR .	-5.0528
Moreover , the area to be fenced must not be trailer manageable ( approx . 35 % ) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation .	-6.2610
For the 2018 Fischerbacher Weidezaun project , eight participants with 24 plots are currently seeking to build about 16 kilometres of fence .	-5.4989
The open area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated cost is more than 112 000 euros .	-4.1524
Is nothing more sacred ?	-1.3362
Now the White House of Trump Maps the Statue of Freedom	-3.8898
The safest sign of regime change is to start attacking the statues .	-2.5921
The Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003 .	-4.9985
Stephen Miller , one of the Trump regime ’ s key ideologues , certainly knew what he did when he included a symbolic axe on the Statue of Liberty in a heated dispute with CNN ’ s Jim Acosta about the president ’ s proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration .	-3.8939
To remain fair , Miller did not attack the statue itself .	-2.0142
A horde of boat owners and liberty imitators would have lynched him if he had done so .	-3.2900
But he attacked their importance , and in particular the importance that was attributed to it when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus was added to its base in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument .	-10.1877
When Miller Acosta insulted , " I don 't want to go into a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world .	-4.9930
The poem to which you refer , which was added later and is not part of the original statue of freedom . '	-7.1327
Miller is right , but , as he himself said , it is not really about history .	-3.1429
It is a question of contemporary resonance to the upsetting words of Lazarus , the only one in which a state invites not only any old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : ' Your tiredness , your poor , / your crowds that are longing for breathing freely , / the miserable waste of your rich coasts ' .	-7.3031
There was never a time when the ' miserable waste ' on our screens was better to see .	-3.2653
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump ’ s US .	-3.0015
This conflict , because of the importance of a statue , is part of a broader political and cultural debate : it is indeed a conflict over the importance of America .	-3.7823
Lazarus - and her friends who worked to place their words on the ground after their death - knew very well that they were doing a highly political act .	-4.9952
The sculpture was supposed to show the links between French and American Republicanism by portraying the female embodiment of freedom in a disguised classic picture .	-4.7284
Lazarus changed this meaning : In her poem , the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .	-8.7111
And she gives herself a completely different name : Mother of Exilants .	-3.2770
The combination of the poem with the picture is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism .	-2.4848
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , people from the right wing wanted to change it for a long time .	-3.6791
The great shrine of Rush Limbaugh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Freedom was not inviting anyone , but rather an early neo-conservative who would bring the American flame into the surrounding world : " Lady Liberty is moving forward .	-5.1775
It is supposed to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .	-1.8039
The torch should not illuminate the way to the United States . '	-2.5977
Limbaugh was quite unusual here .	-4.6107
The meaning of the statue is quite a question of the point of view of perception .	-3.8079
The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see it as seen by the exhausted , miserable but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships .	-3.7626
It is truly a question of seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and an opportunity to improve their lives .	-3.5842
Her statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they must hear .	-3.1449
And that , of course , is not the prospect that Miller and Trump would ever like to acknowledge .	-3.7351
Their torch is not intended to illuminate the way , but to inflame the hatred that is its only source of power .	-8.3015
World Championship 2017 : Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team .	-2.1282
Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when only two Scots belonged to the UK team .	-2.1542
The UK athletic performance director , Neil Black , says that the 16-member Scottish contingent in the World Championship Skader will " make a massive contribution to the team " .	-5.2644
A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which will start on Friday .	-2.3708
Black believes that ' something special is developing in Scotland ' and that UK athletics must learn something from it .	-3.7752
" We welcome it , and we try to understand it , and we will continue until we find it out , " said Black .	-8.1827
" I speak to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done .	-2.7242
Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .	-2.1271
British athletics : It has something to do with what they have done .	-1.9132
And also with the type on the street corner .	-2.8738
Whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . '	-1.8897
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal candidates , including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track , while Eilidh Doyle was chosen by the team as the team captain .	-4.9263
" Eilidh is pretty modest .	-1.5795
Your Captain 's speech was incredible , " says Black .	-2.2755
" A number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or where they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and motivated .	-4.2737
The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh naturally brought was great . '	-4.1579
The Commonwealth silver medal winner , who will compete at the 400m hurdles at her fifth World Cup , says that it is " incredible " that 16 Scots are in the British team .	-4.6834
Scotland ’ s best overall number of athletes in the World Cup has been seven , achieved in 1983 and 2015 .	-4.1049
The middle-range runner Muir is on this path and has set up five British and two European records last year .	-5.8045
It will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs .	-2.9824
Chris O 'Hare , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot to watch after a great season that included victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games .	-4.3402
Doyle remembers her first world championship when the only other Scot in Lee McConnell was .	-3.7838
The team captain says that she is " extremely proud " of the fact that many of her compatriots will not only belong to the team , but will also , in some cases , participate in medals and finals .	-5.4464
" The special thing about being a team captain is that she was elected by the other members of the team , so it was a great honour anyway , but knowing that my team colleagues voted for me and voted for me makes it something very special for me , " she added .	-4.7957
" Obviously I am very proud of all the Scots who belong to the team .	-2.1963
It only shows how far we have come .	-1.9180
And they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to climb on podiums .	-3.1917
What is my speech as a captain ?	-3.0552
Yes , I think she went well .	-1.4888
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation , as we have a home world championship .	-3.5765
So it is really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympic Stadium .	-4.1006
I get a second chance to go out and compete there and it will simply be a great atmosphere out there . '	-4.3414
Blocking Critics on Facebook : Don ’ t bother for a public office if you cannot sustain voter heating .	-5.1473
The father of our country knew something of bad press .	-2.0304
Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long for the newspapers to beat him for everything , from domestic politics to its political principles .	-8.6701
He fought in criticism , sure .	-3.8100
But he has not silenced his critics .	-1.2177
In 1783 , Washington said : ' Freedom of speech can be removed - and , stupid and mute , we are being battled like sheep ' .	-4.2056
This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan , who must work to be more like Washington .	-2.4463
Hogan ’ s employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .	-3.8184
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him earlier this week .	-2.3491
The staff of the governor dismissed the complaint as frivol , and the online comment was full of a backlash with " Na , and ? " .	-3.4001
" It 's just Facebook " , many people said .	-1.5812
But it is important .	-0.7512
And it is especially important if it is a type like hogan .	-2.7673
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state that is astonishingly .	-2.7212
He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation .	-2.5751
Hogan is not a reactionary heat head .	-1.0213
He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict respect for principles .	-3.8906
He was also very skilled in using Facebook as a primary means of connecting with his voters and playing his hairless head for chemotherapy on his side .	-4.1691
Therefore , blocking people on the side of the governor - which is a public forum that is called official and paid by staff paid with public tax-dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .	-6.1118
In an interview with The Washington Post , Hogan ’ s spokesman Amelia Chasse defended the governor ’ s actions , arguing that blocking comments was nothing more than moderation .	-2.6782
But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people who swing the stick online .	-3.1798
The post spoke to some of the real people blocked by Hogan .	-2.0430
And these are only real people who speak to their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur , a priest , not trolls .	-3.5180
They all said that their comments were respectful , thoughtful and not profane .	-2.1573
The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan 's Catholic faith .	-2.2625
Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie , Md . , was not hated , but she asked for hate crimes .	-2.0793
" I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other current news , " she wrote in the commentary section of the news programme " The Post " .	-3.8722
'I do not appreciate this idea , either , if a number of people comment on the same subject , they are disregarded by some as a so-called collective effort and not recognised as a large group of citizens affected ' .	-6.3866
What the governor ’ s staff called a “ concentrated spam attack , ” others would probably call “ advocacy . ”	-4.2559
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment .	-1.9893
It is much cleaner than in the past if the same thing had been done , that staff were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles , or to arrest and silence protesters .	-4.7362
But that is exactly what is happening digitally .	-2.3308
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for imprisoning Facebook and other social media .	-2.6863
President Trump is sued by Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed .	-2.0721
One of the first milestones on this issue was in Virginia last week .	-2.3956
The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County violated the First Amendment , according to US District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria , when she banned a voter from her Facebook page .	-3.9506
And in Kentucky , Governor Matt Bevin ( R ) also received a visit from ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter .	-2.2437
This should not be so difficult .	-1.7739
At the time of Washington , the time of affordable posts had a similar effect as the Internet .	-4.1846
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800 , and anonymous letters struck on his leadership .	-3.7789
And even then , Washington had anonymous trolls .	-7.0096
The people who used pseudonyms like " Juricola " , " Valerius " , " Belisarius " and " Portius " wrote all the letters to newspapers that ruled Washington .	-3.2764
Petitions criticizing his position on the Amity Treaty , trade and shipping with the UK overwhelmed his office , according to the historical documents collected by the George Washington Project ’ s online papers .	-4.1756
But he did not silence them .	-1.7275
Freedom of speech , disagreement and discourse form the basis of our nation .	-2.0507
And true leadership means accepting that .	-1.6559
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comfort in the Renaissance Club .	-2.1771
The former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope for home comfort in the next three days , as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian will host the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .	-3.9421
The Nortire , who took links next year in the Archerfield to the final round before losing against Paul Eales , is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador on behalf of the club founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi .	-6.0685
" I have seen how the Renaissance Club was built and we see how it achieved its fame with this event , " said Rafferty .	-3.5860
" The players will see this course from its best side , it is in a great condition .	-3.3331

" It always means a bit more when you play at home , " said Orr , the man from Helensburgh .	-2.3633
" You want to do it well , but you also feel this extra pressure .	-2.4653
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .	-1.8242

Less Passive Smoking Lung Cancer	-2.4006
Over the past two decades , fewer and fewer people have died of lung cancer because of passive smoking .	-2.2890
Scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf ( UKE ) come to this conclusion in a study .	-3.9725
" According to our estimates , 167 lung cancer cases are due to passive smoking per year , " said Heiko Becher .	-3.3972
In comparison , he conducted his own study on this issue from 1994 .	-4.6468
At that time , there were still 400 lung cancer deaths in Germany due to passive smoking per year .	-3.7842
The new investigation is published in the International Journal of Public Health .	-1.9635
Housing connections prove to be very complex .	-2.8433
The construction works in the Villinger Stra<unk>e are in full swing and " are somewhat in time " , according to the manager of the Bauhof Fred Heinze .	-5.9749
In the area of domestic connections , the situation is more complicated than expected , as there is a lot of hidden underground , which is not stated in the plans .	-6.7591
The traffic , which repeatedly hinders the construction work , is a major problem for the Stumpp construction force .	-5.4163
" The ignorance of drivers in front of red traffic lights and gates is already enormous , " says Heinze .	-4.8540
The road is closed and only buses are allowed to pass .	-4.2061

It rarely uses a pot .	-1.9645
In her wooden house in Enarotali , the capital of the Paniai regency in the unsettled Indonesian province of Papua , the housewife usually puts a sweet potato - locally called " nota " - directly into the fireplace .	-9.8390
After half an hour , the bowl is taken and swallowed with diligent , unwashed hands .	-5.3869
Degei sits on the clay floor - she does not have furniture - where she also performs her daily work , such as washing clothes with clouds from the nearby swamp .	-5.0387
A bucket in a roofless room serves as a latrine .	-1.5110
As the youngest of the four wives of her husband , she was not assigned .	-7.5485
Polygamy is common here .	-2.3001
Of course , working late can be dangerous : most villagers are unemployed , and many drink hard , and there are soldiers here .	-3.4352

It is a rare insight into daily life in the highlands of Papua , a former Dutch colony that was admitted in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,026 elders were to vote by a public rally before the occupying forces .	-4.8066
An existing movement that stirred up independence against Dutch rule quickly turned against the Jakarta government , which maintains control of the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers .	-3.8285
In 2003 , the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua , with the independent part of Papua New Guinea covering the eastern part of the island .	-3.2375
Enarotali is as remote as it is deserted .	-3.4684
There is no public transport .	-2.1051
The town , with about 19,000 inhabitants , consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences and corrugated roofs converted into different yellow brown tones by rust .	-4.4772

Papua is Indonesia ’ s poorest province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst child mortality and literacy rates in Asia .	-2.3270
But it is also Indonesia ’ s goldland .	-1.5857
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Grasberg , owned by the Phoenix Freeport McMoran , is only 60 miles from Paniai , a high land province in the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants .	-3.8763
In 2015 alone , freeport amounted to $ 3.1 billion in gold and copper .	-2.5677
Moreover , Papua has timber resources worth an estimated $ 78 billion .	-2.4639
But these riches are a source of misery for the Papua , ensuring that Indonesia ’ s powerful military retains a stifling presence .	-2.8704
A 2005 investigation in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid nearly $ 20 million to local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004 , including up to $ 150,000 to a single officer .	-3.2349
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden gans and are treated mercilessly .	-2.3731

Indonesian President Joko Widodo , known as Jokowi in the popular mouth , promised to address inequalities and violations in Papua during his 2014 campaign .	-3.5646
The former carpenter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua - including Paniai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jakarta .	-3.3247
But little has changed in Papua , and today the locals feel cheated .	-2.5157
" Our hearts have broken because we voted in favour of Jokowi in 2014 , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , " says you .	-3.9041
Indeed , only two months after Jokowi ’ s inauguration in October , Paniai suffered a low point .	-2.8685
On December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children was out there and sang Christmas songs before a campfire in Enarotali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle .	-10.5475
The frightened children told them that they should turn their headlights on .	-2.9362
One of the soldiers took up their tone and later returned with four soldiers , according to the local pastor Yavedt Tebai .	-4.4502
The soldiers who had drunk hunted and beat the group with their guns , said victims and witnesses .	-3.1171
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .	-1.6842
A child , the 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo , was beaten so hard that he fell into coma .	-2.8491
A few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was burnt in fire , and things escalated the next day .	-8.9053
About 1,000 young Papua men , women and children gathered in a football pitch in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice .	-3.2389
They performed ceremonial hunting arches and performed the Waita dance - running in circles and imitating a bird song - by Papuas Mee Pago Stamm .	-5.2221
Some protesters began to throw stones on police and military posts .	-3.1426
When the mood was heated , the soldiers were sent a command over an internal radio : " If the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , " says a TIME official document that was not released to the local media .	-4.6947
Yeremias Kayame , 56 , the head of the Kego Koto district of Enarotali , saw the threat and called for peace and asked the crowd to return home .	-3.7269
Nobody was listening to the mood .	-1.8741
" When I turned around , I was suddenly shot into my left wrist , " he said TIME on the veranda of his colourful painted wooden house .	-9.8188
Kayame still does not know who fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here .	-2.5824
" It was crowded , many shots were fired , " he adds .	-1.7663
The local man Alfius Youw was met three times , so his cousin , who witnessed the shocks .	-3.4991

'I saw him dead ... I kissed him . '	-2.3396
The Papua police chief , Yotje Mende , said reporters that his officers only wanted to " secure " their station because they were attacked .	-3.9938
'We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us ' , said the spokesman of the Papua police , Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo , in 2015 .	-2.9019
'It is about life and death ' .	-1.3349
According to Human Rights Watch , five young protesters were killed and many more were injured .	-1.8484
The news about the killings came ' filtered ' to Jakarta the following day .	-3.2348
Three weeks in Jayapura , Jokowi made a passionate speech expressing sympathy for the families of the victims and vowed to address the historical abuses in Papua .	-3.8889
" I want this case to be resolved immediately so that it will not happen in the future , " he said .	-3.2982
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he was setting up an extrajudicial mechanism for resolving historical human rights violations .	-3.8733
But the excuses began almost immediately .	-1.1619
" Most injuries occurred a long time ago .	-1.8324
Some were in the 1990s and early 2000s .	-2.1102
The point is that we have committed ourselves to tackling these violations , but there are processes that need to go through , " he said .	-4.0532
Then Wiranto withdrew when he spoke to TIME in Jakarta on 5 June and said that he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua .	-3.2319
Instead , ' everything is regulated by law ' , he said .	-2.0879
Wiranto , accused by the UN of ' crimes against humanity ' , which claimed more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor 's bloody vote of independence in 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had already been resolved , including the Paniai incident .	-4.0880
Families of the Paniai victims received such claims with grim disbelief .	-3.1776
" I have been interviewed four times over the last three years , but there has been no progress , " Yohanes says .	-2.6691
'I am tired ' .	-1.2479
He says that years later he still lives in fear .	-2.0527
" I am afraid , " he says .	-1.3308
'I am afraid to be arrested by the military , I am afraid to be shot ' .	-3.1032
His brother Yacobus repeated the view that the people of Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident .	-2.3717
He says that he was beaten by the military after helping bury four of the victims .	-2.0794
" After burying the corpses , the military searched for me , " he says .	-2.5999
The shootings have not ceased .	-1.6413
On Tuesday the Indonesian police shot on villagers in Paniai 's neighborhood Deiyai .	-2.7764
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company that refused to bring a conscious man to hospital , one person died and 17 others were injured , including children .	-3.1763
The man who drowned 24-year-old Ravianus Douw when he fished in a nearby river died on his way to the hospital .	-3.4133
Appointed villagers protested at the company ’ s office .	-4.3765
The police said that the villagers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warning shots .	-3.2331
But locals say that the mobile brigade ( Indonesian paramilitary police ) began to shoot on the crowd and kill one .	-8.2953
" We were so panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , " says the 29-year-old Dominggu Badii , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly delivered here , the TIME .	-4.6195
'I have hidden myself in my house two days ' .	-2.6950
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the officers involved to be held to account and to withdraw the police ’ s mobile brigade from the area .	-3.5706
Paniai has always been a trouble for the Indonesian government .	-2.5091
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the discontent of the tribal members of Mee , Moni , Dani and Damal , who live in the green highlands of Papua . the the the . the the . the the the . the	-8.6356
Many joined the Free Papua Movement ( OPM ) , the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of Papua by initiating sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers .	-3.0414
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai , including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya .	-1.9763
In response , thousands of people have been arrested and arbitrarily detained in Paniai in recent years , on the pretext of ' securing national sovereignty ' .	-2.9969
Some never appear again .	-2.2620
Among the people of Papua , Paniai is known as " a tragic , forgotten place " .	-2.3477
Poverty strengthens discontent .	-1.1090
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals .	-1.9494
Bread is also out of reach .	-2.1488
The people here cultivate everything they eat : nota and fruit and vegetables .	-8.5488
Agriculture is the task of women , who can each process four or five fields of sweet potatoes .	-4.3096
They keep most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .	-2.3254
Ten pieces of Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees ( 75 cents ) .	-1.5261
Over time , economic inequalities have grown between the indigenous Papua and the new migrants , who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to Nabire Airport .	-4.6115
The few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the more educated and prosperous migrants .	-3.0257
Papua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to run their own companies competitive .	-3.6074
" The young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money here , " says John Gobai , Chairman of the Paniai tribal council .	-3.0335
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua .	-1.8420
Moreover , restrictions on reporting remain tense for international media .	-2.8291
Earlier this year , French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua for lack of coordination with related institutions , although they were given the rare permission to film .	-3.0536
According to Phelim Kine , Deputy Asian Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jokowi ’ s campaign to lift reporting restrictions to promote transparency and development have not been realized .	-3.7777
" There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia 's most troubled eastern provinces of Papua and Western Papua : visa refusal and a blacklist , " he said in a statement .	-3.4889
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely confined to Papua ’ s immediate neighbors .	-2.6200
In March , six Pacific states - Tonga , Nauru , Palau , Tuvalu , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the ' various and widespread violations ' in Papua , including the Paniai shooter .	-3.1914
The same countries have historically supported OPM .	-1.6559
The spokesman of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Arrmanatha Nasir , rejected the group 's accusations and said to journalists in Jakarta : ' There is still a democratic system in Indonesia and there are free media , so it is difficult to hide the evidence of human rights cases ' .	-4.7315
The local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .	-2.1676
When an official delegation from the Netherlands , led by the human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar , visited Jayapura on 4 May , locals broke their silence and pushed him " We want freedom " , according to a source that also attended the meeting but wants to remain anonymous .	-4.4943
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua say that they are unlikely to vote for Jokowi again .	-2.2997
" Jokowi is a person with good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Paniai shots , " says Gobai , chairman of the tribal council .	-3.6275
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people , apart from living under the constant threat of a predator military , are in poor education and health services .	-3.3995
Gobai says that the Paniai people , like other Papua , view their voice for Jokowi as a " guilt " that he must repay .	-3.7706
" They do not need money , they just want justice , " he says .	-2.1860
Despite the threats and intimidation , the Paniai victims ' families performed a final symbolic act of the Trotz : the corpse of a victim was buried on an area just opposite the police and the military station .	-6.1577
They know that they may never have justice , but at least they do not let those responsible forget their crimes .	-3.6422

Fires capture the ' Torch ' skyscrapers of Dubai for the second time	-3.6930
A fire took place on Friday in one of the highest residential towers in the world in Dubai and forced hundreds of residents to flee the 337 meter high 79 floor building .	-4.7250
It is the second fire that sweeps through the high house in just two years , which one randomly calls the Torch Tower ( torch-tower ) .	-5.2492
The building was evacuated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .	-2.7369
" We slept and we stood up with the fire alarm and criing people .	-4.4126
We ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50th floor , " said a resident who named his name as George , Reuters .	-3.5683
Dubai ’ s civil protection authorities said that fire-fighting units deleted the fire at around 4.00 a.m. local time ( 00.00 a.m. GMT ) and cooled the building .	-12.5784
The government said that it is working to provide accommodation for those affected .	-3.3291
The incident can revive questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high-rise buildings around the world .	-3.9849
A survey carried out by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage from the lining , the outer lining , came to decoration or isolation .	-12.2592
In the United Kingdom , the police said that they believe that the system of plates for isolation and coverings at the London Grenfell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire that killed about 80 people .	-5.1097
No Davis Cup Reform : Continue Best of Five	-2.2349
The President of the International Tennis Association ( ITF ) has passed through the General Assembly with his large Davis Cup coup .	-3.6620
At the Ho-Chi-Minh City meeting , the revolutionary proposal for this sport to play Davis Cup singles only on two prizes was not supported by the required two-thirds majority .	-6.8386
The Five Satz classics , which are often very long , but are also very valued for this reason , remain the traditional competition .	-8.1083
63.54 % of the member states voted for the reform , so ITF President David Haggerty ’ s goal was barely missed .	-3.9839
" We respect this decision , but are disappointed that our member states have not adopted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and the Fed Cup .	-2.9428
We need a change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historical competitions , " said Haggerty .	-2.5023
We will continue to work to improve the candidates .	-3.3218
Not until the vote , after many objections , the proposal had already been made to hold the final in a neutral location .	-11.6484
New from 2018 are only comparatively minor details : the finalists in the Davis Cup and the Fed Cup will have host law in the next round .	-5.6641
In order to reduce the costs for the organizers , requirements for training places and so on will be made easier and players will have to make less official media appointments before the Davis Cup .	-5.6055
More than 1 out of 5 US travelers brings prohibited items into the aircraft , finds a survey .	-4.4887
A survey among air passengers revealed that more than 20 % of deliberately or unconsciously prohibited items were smuggled past the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 % that entered the aircraft while accidentally carrying forbidden knives or other items with blades .	-5.5174
Less than 1 % claimed that they were late in discovering that they were wrongly traveling with firearms , ammunition , or explosives .	-4.2741
The survey of more than 1,000 people - carried out by a jet charter service , Stratos Jet Charters Inc . - also found that younger travellers tend to disregard the rules .	-4.4561
Of the respondents who admitted that they knowingly tried to fly with something banned by the TSA , 19.7 % were Millennials , compared to less than 15 % , who were members of generation X .	-3.7890
The most common items deliberately passed by TSA agents were food and liquids .	-3.6191
More than 3 % admitted that they knowingly carried objects with blades through security control , while 2.2 % of female respondents and 3.7 % of male respondents also confirmed that they had deliberately brought banned drugs into the aircraft .	-5.3609
The company said it asked travellers across the country to find out how many accidentally brought smuggling goods through airport security and how many would have deliberately done so .	-4.9576
It is no surprise that the people who carry the most smuggling goods - knowingly or unwittingly - through safety were those who fly most frequently .	-4.9133
However , the company points out that the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing .	-2.7877
People are often uncertain about what liquids they can take with them or how much of them .	-4.1787
So it is no surprise that the largest amount of liquids banned by the TSA are prohibited .	-4.2368
For a while , people thought that the TSA could view books as smuggling goods .	-3.3060
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .	-2.1222
Elon Musk doesn ’ t care : Tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel order .	-2.7896
Elon Musk is pleased to announce the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla " Model 3 " .	-3.4888
In so far he has failed to accept that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation .	-5.9392
In addition to the ever-triumphant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tesla ’ s CEO Elon Musk revealed a different , less glossy number for the first time when the latest quarterly balance was announced : the cancellations of the new mass market model 3 .	-13.2152
In recent months , Musk had often advertised the more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car , whose delivery is just beginning .	-4.9259
Now Musk admits : Of the total of 518,000 preorders , 63,000 have already been withdrawn .	-4.0768
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations .	-3.4573
In case of cancellation Tesla will refund the 1000 Euro ( in the USA 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds ) " reservation deposit " in full .	-6.1217
At present , 45,000 such non-binding reservations were made , and Musk agreed to a telephone conference with analysts .	-5.2761
However , the Tesla boss does not believe that the cancellation of about 12 percent of all orders could become a problem .	-5.3360
His argument : the challenge of ambitious growth targets is not demand , but production .	-3.5398
Last year Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles .	-1.5192
In 2018 - all models taken together - it will be 500,000 , one million by 2020 .	-4.5508
The demand for this is obviously there .	-2.2890
According to Musk , there are currently 1800 reservations per day .	-2.4391
Anyone who orders a " Model 3 " today can expect delivery in the second half of 2018 at the earliest - if Tesla manages to drive its brand new production lines , which have never been tested in practice , without major interruptions with maximum utilization .	-6.2947
Many experts doubt that this is possible .	-1.5143
However , if there are major delays , the non-binding nature of reservations could become the problem for Tesla .	-4.7385
Because then , the company cannot prevent unhappy customers from moving away in droves .	-5.2622
EPA leader Pruitt withdraws for delaying the Obama Era rules on reducing emissions .	-3.9425
A day after being sued by 15 states , Scott Pruitt , the head of the Environmental Protection Agency , withdrew his earlier decision to delay implementation of the Obama era ’ s rules to reduce emissions of smog causing air pollutants .	-4.2153
Pruitt presented the change when his agency proved more responsive to the needs of public environmental authorities than previous administrations .	-3.9855
He did not mention the complaint that had been brought against his previous post in a federal court of profession .	-3.4971
It is a deadline that expired on 1 October for states to comply with 2015 standards for ground-level ozone .	-4.3186
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid " interfering in local decisions or impeding economic growth . "	-3.9632
Pruitt , who was a prosecutor of Oklahoma before he was appointed by President Donald Trump , has long been a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations .	-9.0663
Since his arrival in Washington , Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations that the chemical industry and the fossil fuel industry have resisted .	-4.0908
The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the recent legal setback for the Pruitts regulatory rollback agenda .	-1.7459
Last month , a Federal Court of Appeals in Washington ruled that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a Obama administration rule that required oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks .	-5.4370
In a statement published on Wednesday evening , Pruitt proposed that his reversal of ozone standards simply reinforce the EPO ’ s willingness to cooperate with states through the complex process of timely fulfilment of the new standards .	-4.6221
" Under previous administrations , the EPO has often failed to meet the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be charged by activist groups and others , and to set the deadline for implementation in an agreement , " said Pruitt , who sued the EPO more than a dozen times in his previous job .	-5.0613
" We do not believe in regulation through judicial proceedings , and we take deadlines seriously .	-3.3557
We also take the law and the authority that we have . '	-2.9077
Nevertheless , the opinion of the EPO said that Pruitt will at some point use his ' delayed power and all other legally available powers ' to ensure that the rules ' are based on a sound policy and the best available information ' .	-5.7251
Congressional Republicans are pushing for a broader recast of ozone rules .	-2.6507
A bill approved last month is intended to delay implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .	-2.3412
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate .	-1.3809
The New York Public Prosecutor Eric Schneiderman , who led the coalition of states that sued the EPO this week , said that the group intends to maintain legal pressure .	-3.8626
" The reversal of the EPO - according to our complaints - is an important benefit for health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities , " said Schneiderman .	-4.0598
New York joined California , Connecticut , Delaware , Illinois , Iowa , Maine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Pennsylvania , Rhode Island , Vermont , and Washington , and the District of Columbia .	-1.7466

The emergent smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people , and can contribute to thousands of premature deaths every year .	-9.1443
Representatives of the public health sector and environmentalists cheered at Pruitts ’ surprising change of course .	-9.0064
" It is worrying how much pressure it needs to get this sensible step from the person responsible for protecting the air that we breathe , " said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity .	-3.6702

Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church	-2.2485
750 years of St. Hilarius Church : On the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church , a serenade is invited to the old cemetery area in Tumlingen on Sunday 16 July at 4.30 p.m.	-4.8117
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historic St. Hilarius complex is a popular place to stay .	-3.8244
Visitors to the sixth charity venue can be enchanted by this powerful place .	-3.8400
The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the town has made Tumlings friends and promoters their concern .	-8.7902
Walter Martini stresses : " It is a unique village gem " .	-3.3081
In 1267 the St. Hilarius Chapel was first mentioned in the Württembergische Urkundenbuch : Count Hermann von Sulz sold " the mountain with the parish church at Tumlingen and the Vogtei " to Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver .	-4.7151
According to the text of the document , on the Tumlinger mountain , apart from the former parish church , there was also a splendid courtyard , which included the church or the patronage law and not the other way around .	-6.3364
So people also lived there .	-3.3012
As is evident from the description of the Oberamt Freudenstadt of 1858 , besides the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf , which are still visible today in the townscape of Tumlingen , the " mountain " was the third , the ruling settlement centre of the village .	-6.2895
Old maps dating back to 1600 underpin these historical realities .	-7.7765
The patronage law came from the early medieval law of the own church .	-6.1238
A Lord who built , equipped and occupied a church remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this own church .	-4.5144
The right to appoint a priest or to propose a new priest to the bishop was connected with this .	-4.7099
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower .	-1.6971
The larger of the two most crumble on Christmas 1673 .	-3.8792
The newly acquired bell then sounds for the first time in 1692 , but had to be released later in World War II in 1942 .	-4.8927
In the 30-year-old war ( 1616 to 1648 ) the windowpanes were beaten and the bell rope stolen .	-8.4307
The room was very clean and comfortable .	-6.3021
In 1796 , French troops camped near the church .	-2.6479
They broke out the candles and church chairs and used them as firewood .	-3.4310
The remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809 .	-2.5121
Until 1869 , the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery also served as the last resting place for the deaths of the Hörschweiler .	-4.3484
In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Hilarius Church was abandoned .	-3.2187
Only the church tower was left standing .	-2.9635
In New Year 's Eve , 1834 , a storm split the church tower and half collapsed .	-4.1345
In order to prevent an accident , the tower was cut off .	-3.6444
Only the still existing tower mill was preserved as a witness to the 750-year-old church history .	-4.3196
Today , Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem from the " Schaffigen Pensioners " as successor to Dieter Dockhorn cultivate the Hilarius plant .	-3.8571
On Sunday 16 July , the Friends and Förderer Tumlingen invite the sixth Serenade to the old cemetery at the St. Hilarius Chapel .	-5.6231
It is designed by the Combo of the Kepler Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with contributions from Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis .	-8.0286

" Enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over the meadows to the forest " , the organizers present the fantastic view .	-5.7175
The serenade takes place only in dry weather .	-2.3868
The organisers hope for many supporters to maintain the historic St. Hilarius facility , which is important for Tumlingen and Hörschweiler .	-4.0321
Friends and sponsors Tumlings feel particularly committed to home care , as confirmed by the Serenade organizer Walter Martini .	-4.2193
The Association wants to check the approval of wind turbines .	-8.6662
" Boisheim defends itself " does not see any legal precondition for the construction and has therefore addressed the council .	-5.3509
The association " Boisheim Wehrt sich " has asked Landrat Andreas Coenen ( CDU ) to withdraw his permission for the construction of planned wind turbines at the Boisheimer Nette .	-5.3340
It was illegal .	-1.9872
The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 no wind turbines could have been approved at the Boisheimer Nette , since at the time only a wind power concentration zone existed at the city boundary to Schwalmtal .	-6.2640
Within this concentration zone , the construction and operation of wind turbines are basically possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes an exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city .	-6.0569
Such zones are intended to prevent the landscape from being " saved " .	-5.2859
The city of Viersen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette a few days earlier by amending the land use plan - but the district government of Düsseldorf had not approved it because of a form error .	-7.3094
" Due to the lack of planning requirements , the authorisation document issued is still illegal and therefore also withdraw , " said Christoph Erkens , Chairman of " Boisheim is opposed " .	-6.0917
Current state of affairs : before the summer recess , the City Council again decided on the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette ; the district government has yet to approve it .	-6.6229
Erkens : " This means that the granting of permission for the construction of wind turbines is excluded from planning law " .	-6.9876
The circle confirms the receipt of the request .	-1.8046
" The corresponding letters were received by the district of Viersen last week , " said a speaker .	-4.9191
The circle takes it as an opportunity to re-examine the matter .	-4.0491
However , they are not likely to result in the process being stopped .	-4.4460
With a view to ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court , the circle on Thursday did not wish to comment on the content of the argument of the association " Boisheim is opposed " .	-5.9165
NEW Re , a subsidiary of NEW , plans to build four 200 meter high wind wheels on an area at the Boisheimer Nette .	-4.2127
Last year , the company , in which the city of Viersen is indirectly involved , had already concluded leasing contracts with the owner of the area of about 65 hectares .	-5.1274
With the construction of the four wind turbines , the power needs of around 11 400 households are to be met - roughly one fifth of the electricity needs of all four-storey households .	-6.9261
NEW Re wants to invest around EUR 20 million .	-2.2361
Last summer , Viersen City Council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines at the Linnich wind farm near Aachen , as well as participation in a wind energy plant in <unk>bach-Palenberg in the Heinsberg district .	-5.0210
Car and tractor crash together : woman dies in the event of a terrible accident .	-4.7368

City and Traders Plan Homeland Shopping Weekend	-3.3504
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region will rediscover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September .	-3.2639
The trade association and the city administration want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to attract the residents to the shopping centre .	-6.3794
As the Chairman of the Industrial Association Christian König announced , the " Homeland Shopping " weekend is intended to make customers aware of the offers offered by their own city away from the usual supermarket goods .	-6.6856
A market with regional suppliers is therefore planned , similar to the weekly market .	-3.8569
In addition , local companies will present themselves with their training places .	-4.3965
In addition , the shops of the city centre should invite you to the " Mitternachts-Shopping " .	-5.2724
The action is aimed not only at residents of the city and the nearest region .	-4.9097
In preparation , advertising spots on the radio , an Internet video and printed bags pointing to the action weekend , Christian König said .	-5.0034
Municipal administration and commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .	-4.2262
The trade association and the city thus enter another stage of the project " Attractive City " .	-5.4169
This includes new offers such as the first " Active Day " at the Brunnenfest and open to sale Sunday , discussions with all traders and hosts to encourage them to participate actively .	-6.1424
Also attractive offers on Saturday and the waiver of parking fees on that day are part of the concept .	-3.8695
In addition , customer potential is to be reopened or reopened .	-3.8953
These include spa guests and tourists .	-2.7103
But many locals would also have lost sight of the city during shopping .	-5.0263
In the end , everyone would have to contribute to revitalising the city centre , including landlords , the businesses of the entire city and .	-6.1630
King had said in the spring that he would be able to overcome the lethargy with a network that had partly spread .	-7.0550
Birgit Streich , head of the IHK Center in Mühlhausen , announced that for the first time five Thuringian cities will participate in the third " Homeland Shopping Day " day in Germany .	-5.3082
In addition to Bad Langensalza , these are Weimar , Sömmerda , Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode .	-7.7288
The day should ' promote the appreciation of local trade and highlight its importance for the common good of our cities ' , says Strich .	-4.8818
The action under the auspices of the IHK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen , with his or her purchasing behavior , can influence his or her own direct environment .	-6.3750

Trump put Mexico under pressure for paying the border wall after leaked transcripts of telephone calls .	-3.4938
Transcripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .	-2.2373
On January 27 , Trump , in a telephone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto , called on him to stop publicly saying that he would not pay for a planned border wall .	-3.2306
The US President insulted him because he publicly denounced the wall , and reportedly said to him : ' You cannot tell the press . '	-4.9059
Trump launched his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the US , and vowed to pay Mexico for the project .	-11.0727
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and revealed a tense exchange .	-2.7405
Mr. Trump said to Mr. Turnbull that trade for the US would be ' ridiculous ' , ' mies ' and ' stupid ' for refugees emigrating to Australia , and that the existence of the trade conveyed by the Obama administration would make him look like a ' depp ' after proposing a ban on the resettlement of refugees to the US .	-12.2669
Mr. Trump ended the call after saying to Mr Turnbull , " that is the most unpleasant call for the whole day . "	-11.2677
Moores Ford massacre : Activists re-launch racist lynchact as a call for justice .	-3.4619
A 1948 Ford Mercury drove through a group of viewers in rural Monroe , Georgia , and rumped on the Ford bridge of Moore .	-4.4249
Before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men with guns emerged to block his way .	-3.5040
The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man in a needle strip suit - took a long train on his cigar and looked through the windscreen .	-4.3642
Inside , the inmates floated in fear .	-3.7259
" We want this n ---r Roger ! " the man rushed .	-4.2846
'Get him out of the car ! '	-1.7890
Shries tore the silence when a young black man was torn by the front-passenger seat .	-3.3191
Fortunately , this terrible scene , which was played on 22 July , is just a replica .	-3.4581
But when a string is thrown around the neck of " Roger " , almost everyone in the audience shot out very real sights .	-5.6876
Since 2005 , civil rights activists have returned to Moore 's Ford Bridge to emulate the night when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom , George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by Ku Klux Klan in 1946 .	-3.6974
No one has ever been charged for the murders .	-2.7048
" It is really incomprehensible that not a single person has been arrested in all these years - although we see them in our communities , although we know who they are , " said Tyrone Brooks , who helps to organise the reproduction .	-5.5875
'It is a dirt stain on a story , but it is a burden on our souls ' .	-2.9766
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Georgian Congressman and a civil rights activist for a lifetime .	-3.0407
For him , reproduction serves as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected .	-3.6363
" We want prosecution , we want the end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we need justice , " he said .	-3.4035
'We cannot get healing and reconciliation until we get justice ' .	-2.4798
A medical doctor places a bed cloth on the corpse of one of the victims of the Moore Ford Lynchen on July 27 , 1946 .	-10.2060
According to FBI files received from the NBC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the lynch process .	-3.0373
But no one has ever been charged .	-1.9847
Although suspects have been on the free footing for decades , civil rights activists say that the dual motivation for Lynch actions throughout the city has always been known : politics and sex .	-5.6320
In April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court allowed black citizens in Georgia to vote for the first time in the summer pre-election campaign .	-3.7480
Around the same time as the election , according to the FBI of the black farmer Roger Malcom , a white landowner , Barnett Hester , fell down during a battle - allegedly for a woman .	-12.0299
Brooks said that the rumor in the city was that Hester slept with Malcoms Mrs Dorothy and that the baby she wore did not come from her husband .	-3.2475
On July 25 , 1946 , Loy Harrison , a prominent white landowner , paid $ 600 to free Malcom from prison , according to the FBI .	-2.9257
He was imprisoned by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey .	-2.0863
But when they moved away from prison and approached Moore 's Ford Bridge , a Lynchmob surrounded the car .	-3.4261
" As it turns out , it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the killings , " concludes an FBI report .	-2.7890
" It is also obvious that there was a plot between state and local prosecution , which was not only involved in the murders , eliminated evidence and hidden the identity of witnesses " .	-4.4953
Brooks formulates it even more concise .	-6.9439
" It was a massacre of voting rights , " he said .	-8.3701
'They have all been killed to send a message to black people in this community : ' If you register and if you vote , you will be here . '	-4.7350
For almost a decade , Cassandra Greene led the annual reproduction of Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murders .	-3.0886
Their presentation is vivid , graceful , and is based on a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe is no longer in America .	-5.5891
It is difficult to watch and even more difficult to look away , but Greene said that this is the point .	-3.9011
" We do not want to talk about the lynch because we are then confronted with its ugliness in all of us , " she said .	-3.9867
" But I cannot build a relationship with you if you do not want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have gone through " .	-7.4516
The rehearsals for this year ’ s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors – a dozen white and the rest of the black – moved into a room and listened when Greene started a well-rehearsed overview of the piece . , and .	-10.2199
Wade Marbaugh is Green co-director here .	-2.2926
He has played the role of chief clan member for years , but he said that the role would never be easier .	-3.1384
" I feel dirty because I am not so , " said Marbaugh .	-2.4611
'But I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return to these times ' .	-2.9428
On the other side of the room , the actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona , who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester , tried their lines .	-2.9578
The play starts with Malcom , who cries to Hester and afflicts him , angry that he slept with his wife Dorothy .	-3.9830
'I said n --- he , disappear from my property ! '	-2.3619
Rascona replies the fire .	-1.7758
There is a pause .	-1.3191
And then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks off laughter .	-3.2387
Greene laughs the loudest .	-0.9659
" What ? ! " , Rascona asked .	-2.0964
It is alarmed and confused .	-1.4876
Was I too hard ?	-1.3502
'No ' , Greene said , still crushing .	-3.1647
'I simply do not believe that white people then said ' n --he ' .	-3.6827
" But " , one of the other black actors joked .	-2.4421
'You only have to hit the hard ' R. ' .	-2.8188
And that is exactly where the energy is shifting in space , a feeling of comradeship replaces the unease .	-5.1846
Everyone is busy getting this right , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four people killed .	-3.0270
The scene starts again .	-1.4425
This time , when Rascona says the N word , he says it sharply and emphatically .	-2.2865
Absolutely no one laughs .	-1.4650
This repetition ends violent and fast .	-2.1595
There are cries , shots and then silence .	-1.6939
A woman dressed with a mourning dress stands above the bodies of the actors and executes Billie Holidays 's mourning praise " Strange Fruit " .	-5.1293
Her voice breaks every second word .	-2.3437
About one hundred meters behind it , a group of about four dozen spectators caught their eyes sweat and tears .	-4.7665
The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white .	-1.9082
A couple arrived from Ithaca , New York , to see the performance , many just come down the street .	-3.6034
They have all experienced Georgia ’ s depressing moisture for almost eight hours when Brooks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tombs of the Malcoms and Dorseys .	-5.5455
Until this point , the killings have remained an anecdote , but now , when you stand in the same country where the Lynch murders took place , the air feels ghostly .	-4.9659
When the last notes of the song end , Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the body name .	-2.9315
Children hook at their heads , register the falsified blood and the silent bodies and whisper each other .	-2.9819
" They are not really dead , " a little boy murmurs as if he wanted to remember .	-3.6575
After a few minutes Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it is over .	-2.7076
The actors throw away the lynx rope and wipe their tears .	-2.9258
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh , the man in suit who played the clan member .	-1.7440
Nick Rascona embraces two of his fellow players and then crushes together in their arms , the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through with him .	-10.9191
" It is okay " , whispers one of the women .	-2.1547
" We know that this is not in your heart .	-1.8834
You did so for one reason . '	-1.6951
Later , the audience met with the actors for dinner .	-7.7614
At a table , a white couple from Atlanta chats about the reproduction with a black pair they have just met .	-5.0705
Denise Duplinski fought to find words that left the performance feeling .	-3.3601
" It is difficult to hear these terrible words and deeds ... from people who look like you and who do so because they look like you , " she said .	-3.4489
'What this really does with me makes me believe that the lynch is still going on ' , she added , ' today it is only called the police foundry ' .	-5.4838
In the same room , Tyrone Brooks holds court at his table , he eats and recalls civil rights .	-3.8824
He said he started planning the performance next year .	-2.7497
" The postponement is somewhat inspiring , because it describes the horror of what we have endured , but it is also a moment of learning , " he said .	-3.2711
" It is so if we do not learn from it , then it can happen again .	-4.3474
Those who do not study their own history , who do not know their own history , are condemned to repeat them . '	-3.3220
" Dawn of Gods " reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth	-2.5142
Even in the fourth part of Richard Wagner ’ s monumental work , director Frank Castorf relies on a colourful staging of gigantic , six-storey scenes .	-4.8635
The screenplay ( designed by Aleksandar Denic ) shows a shabby street corner with the remains of the wall and the Dönerbude in Berlin , a " plast and elast " logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange .	-6.7018
Before that , an open Mercedes classic car park , where the Rhine daughters position as rock girls , or alternatively an Isetta .	-5.6012
Stacked oil barrels remind you of Castorf 's leitmotif - money , power and greed - which passes through his " ring " staging .	-4.4210
The three Rhine daughters - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel , Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize just like in the Rhine gold .	-3.1896

Brutal the scene when he beats Siegfried .	-2.8659
Later Gunther ( Markus Eiche ) must believe in it .	-3.1898
The audience thanks the ensemble with strong applause .	-2.6508
Foster , Milling , Vinke and conductor Janowski are celebrated in storm , who modestly boasts his hands to Merkel Raute .	-6.3952
There is great applause for the festival orchestra , which is on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat , again in legendary leisure clothes .	-7.3759
The performance of Frank Castorf and his director team was eagerly awaited .	-3.5241
In 2013 , he had to have a yellow pipe concert , and five years later , there was great rejoicing in which the isolated " buh " calls fell .	-7.8661
Chairman Katharina Wagner may have been pleased about this .	-4.3304
" It is noticed that the audience has grown together with the " ring " in a way , " she said just before the performance of the dpa .	-5.0469
The audience has not only made a form of peace with Castorf , but has also grown an understanding of its view .	-4.3359

" We believe in dialogue with and in responding to our state partners , " EPA chief Scott Pruitt said in a statement .	-9.9268
In June , Pruitt announced the EPO ’ s intention to delay the ozone provisions – in which pollutant emissions are to be measured in one part of the country to determine where cuts need to be made to meet stricter air quality standards – by one year until October 2018 .	-5.4178
A group of 15 largely democratic states , together with the district of Colombia , appealed on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .	-3.3157
President Donald Trump ’ s administration has tried to reduce a wide range of environmental constraints imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that Trump says should boost economic growth .	-3.6440
However , efforts have triggered the setback of democrats and nature conservation groups , which are worried about the impact of greater emissions on public health .	-4.2527
The EPO website says that inhaling air containing ozone can " reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms " such as asthma .	-3.9014
Municipal Council wants Community area	-2.9900
In the end , the decision was clear : in the case of two votes against , the Municipal Council of Fluorn-Winzeln decides to establish a Community area in the future of senior citizens ' homes .	-5.7890
Before the discussion there is an important information : The purchase contract for the missing plot was signed , says Mayor Bernhard Tjaden .	-4.5205
While it will still take time for the area that has so far belonged to the parish to be in the municipality , there is now no obstacle to planning the project to be stemmed by a private investor .	-7.2713
There is a discussion on a Community area for this .	-3.2152
One of the two investors still on board has offered to accommodate the community .	-3.5186
On the ground floor it would provide a living area - about 55 square meters - and a adjacent terrace with a surface area of 70 square meters for a special price .	-5.1298
The administration and the majority of the municipality council envisages that such a common area should not be used as a meeting place only for the residents of senior citizens ' homes , but openly into the municipality . . , , , a , , , , and , , , and , .	-16.0845
As an example , the word " knitting café " made the round .	-3.8078
The decision , which was prejudiced by the allocation of funds for the current budget last autumn , will be swept through funding opportunities .	-6.5953
The building is located in the rehabilitation area .	-2.6643
The creation of a Community area , Tjaden reports , would be eligible for 60 % of 30 % .	-4.1864
The proposal for a decision , in order to signal to the investor that , in this respect , it does not want to throw a stick between its feet , provides that both saddle - which is based on the construction of the environment - and powder roof - which reduces the height of the grape and makes the construction more economical .	-9.1831
Not only Wilfried Sohmer thinks this addition is unnecessary .	-3.8265
If it helps , it passes the board unanimously .	-3.5516
The common area is not so easy .	-3.1639
Daniela Ruf refers to the many own buildings with which one does not really make progress , for which one now rejects the common space from the window , she says : ' I am having a hard time doing this ' .	-15.9286
Yvonne Staiger is absolutely in favour of the common area - but absolutely against local participation .	-4.6417
It sees behind it a covert subsidy to already wealthy investors , or even foreign investors .	-5.1993
This is not the case , because the acquisition of land does not give a subsidy , but rather receives a real value marketable in the event of doubt , is the .	-7.4853
Staiger ’ s request to split the proposal for a decision accordingly finds three advocates .	-4.3685
Thus , two votes against the original programme , which Stefan Haller summarises : ' If we take the decision in this way , we are taking a huge step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure ' .	-6.1025

The Italian confirmed this on Friday .	-1.8636
In addition , Munich 's Manuel Neuer , James , Thiago , Jerome Boateng , Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat are missing .	-2.3733
For the five defeats in the last six games Ancelotti has blamed the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team .	-4.4013

It was not good last time . '	-2.9388
However , the 58-year-old believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory game of the season .	-9.2049

The first " star path " is to be created in the resin throughout Germany .	-3.6267
This is planned by the association Sternwarte Sankt Andreasberg .	-3.2194
There is a planetary path in Göttingen - since 2003 .	-3.2328
A " star path " responds to the need for information from many resin visitors , it was said .	-4.5754
It combines nature , science , movement and sporting performance .	-1.9384
Members want to set up tables along the planned route and inform them about stars and constellations .	-4.8338
In a first phase up to 2018 , the association plans " achievable installations in five to six places " in Upper Harz .	-5.2833
Infrastructure would be St. Andreasberg , Braunlage , Hohegemei<unk> and Sieber .	-4.2113
The information on the tables should be supplemented via the Internet .	-3.4451
This is why good mobile network reception plays a role in choosing the location .	-10.3302
Accessibility is also a criterion .	-1.2933
Later , the star trail of Zug is to be extended to include a train .	-6.1108
" On the star path , the observers learn a lot of interesting things , for example about the physics of the individual stars , " the association explained .	-6.1436
They also learned why stars have different colors , or why a star shines stronger than another , although it is far further away .	-4.5187
It also provides information on which star image a selected star is in and when it is best to see .	-6.4825
Since 2014 the association has operated the highest observatory in northern Germany in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg .	-4.0197
The location in the middle of the Harz National Park ranks among the six darkest regions in Germany , according to the Federal Office for Nature Protection .	-3.7377
Often the Milky Way and even the Andromeda galaxy can be seen with a naked eye .	-4.1179
Since 2003 , at the initiative of the Planetarium Göttingen Förderverein , there has been something similar to the planned Starwedge - the Planetenweg .	-5.5126
Starting in front of Gebhards Hotel in the Goetheallee , which forms the interior of our solar system , the Planetenweg with its steles leads up to the Hainberg and to the observatory - as well as an " alien " location in Diemarden ( municipality of the same ) with the planet Sedna .	-5.7878
The stels with the individual planets - including the Dwarf Planet degraded Pluto at the end point - are situated precisely at a distance and scale of one to two billion .	-5.6135
The earth is shrinking to a ball of 6.5 millimetres in diameter , while the exactly 75 metres away sun measures 70 centimetres .	-5.6778
The entire distance of the planetary path is about four kilometres .	-3.6914
While the light from the sun to the Pluto takes about eight hours , pedestrians need a good hour to the stele with Pluto .	-3.8333
Pedestrians are therefore faster than the light in space .	-2.1797

After Garcia ’ s victory by unanimous decision on the former Four Division World Champion Adrien Broner on Saturday at Showtime , both fighters are members of the top five pound-for pond list .	-4.5056
Garcia stretched out the right hand and said : " How do you , Champion ?	-2.8610
I wish you good luck . '	-1.4649
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday evening at 7 p.m. on ESPN .	-2.2647
When the couple positioned for photos , Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas noticed that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the " perfect order of magnitude " .	-3.9857
" I am a former feather weight , " Garcia recalled .	-2.6677
" I rose for Broner [ to 140 pounds ] , but I 'm not so big .	-3.1567
I am small for 140 .	-0.8741
I would like to come down to light weight .	-3.5120
And he must move on lightweight [ 135 pounds ] and then we fight .	-2.3100
That is what the fans are asking for .	-3.0012
Let us give them that . '	-1.4991
Lomachenko agreed .	-0.8822
'Boxes need this fight ' .	-2.6618
Climate asked whether it should be on pay-per-view , part of a strategy that Lomachenko has to fight with a 135-pound debut this year to agree a date next summer with Garcia ( 37-0 , 30 Knockouts ) , which also has an interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight title fight in the forum on September 23 .	-5.5141
" This fight could take place in pay-per-view mode because all fans asked for it , " Garcia said , and later openly expressed himself to fight with the network that offers the best financial package .	-5.1432
We are the best .	-0.6828
No other names can generate this kind of attention .	-1.7707
Whenever they are ready ... "	-1.3873
Garcia said he appreciated Lomachenko as " a huge fighter , " and he might participate in his Saturday fight .	-4.2853
But Lomachenko stopped at the generous praise for Garcia and said that he think the three-fight champion from Riverside look " very slowly , I am sorry Mikey ... you wanted the co-off " .	-4.8717
Garcia said that the focus is to show blow strength , then boxes .	-3.0497
Both said they could feel the momentum that was built for their own struggle .	-4.0469
" This is the fight that must be carried out .	-2.5069
No other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm .	-2.0816
I am more than happy to work on it , " Garcia said .	-1.8351
Lomachenko said : " I waited for the top fighters , and that is Mikey .	-2.5391
It will be a great battle . '	-1.9776
Four Injured After Tire Platchers	-3.6466
In the case of an accident on the A7 , four people were sometimes seriously injured on Thursday afternoon .	-3.2087
According to the first information , the driver of an Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle at 4.30 p.m. shortly before the terminal market width .	-6.0702
The car shifted to the right into the evil where it overlooked and then remained on the roof in the green strip .	-12.1394
The four occupants - two adults and two children - were partly seriously injured in the accident .	-2.5632
During the initial care of the injured by the rescue service , the A7 was locked to the north for about an hour and then the traffic could be passed on the left lane at the accident site .	-6.6058
Fortuna 's Hoffmann : " Triple chain works better "	-3.7297
Andre Hoffmann hopes after 2 : 2 to start the season against Braunschweig that optimizing the defense formation will bring Aue points .	-5.1826
Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the first season game , and the result would not have been the two opponents at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .	-5.2221
" These were two opponents too much , and we need to be even more careful in Aue , " says Fortuna Düsseldorf 's defender .	-4.8959
In the Erzgebirge the triple chain is to be further optimized .	-8.2558
And a gate after a shot , the forts don 't want to capture themselves .	-6.4290
" For the future , it will be the case that no one will stand alongside Michael ( Rensing ) . "	-4.7139
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will be better able to cope with the triple string even after the experience gained in preparing the triple string than with the four-string .	-8.6823
" I do not yet know how to act in Aue , " says his coach Friedhelm Funkel , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , " because we have just in the triple chain at the semi-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gie<unk>elmann players who can build up well , " said Hoffmann .	-5.5438
'A prerequisite is , but that we harmonize even better and that we do not afford so many playback errors ' .	-5.5723
Of course Hoffmann also goes to Aue to win the game .	-2.4673
" But if you can talk about a failed start after a draw , don 't know .	-5.0744
The performance could be quite okay , " said Hoffmann .	-3.5332
" But if we can stand on Sunday with four points and concentrate on the cup , we will certainly be able to talk about a proper season start . "	-6.0451
His coach didn 't want to know about that .	-3.2005
" I judge the start of the season only after six to eight days of playing , " said Friedhelm Funkel , who does not want to speak of an advantage over Aue just because the game of Saxony in Heidenheim had to be cancelled prematurely because of a storm .	-5.1804
" Now they can start the season almost with a home game , " said Funkel and Hoffmann , believing that Aue players might even be a little fresher , as they would not have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against a ascent favorite in the bones .	-6.8292
" But they don 't know where they are currently " , says Fortuna 's interior defender .	-3.7429
It is true that guests from the Rhineland enter the meeting at the final ( almost ) finished stadium of Aue as a light favourite on Sunday .	-6.7251
" That we sweep them away simply because we are entitled to come under the first six is nonsense , " says Funkel , whose record is very positive in the event of only a defeat against Aue from nine games .	-6.1580
" There are no teams in the 2nd Bundesliga that must be beaten from the outset , " says Fortunas Chief Coach .	-4.3908
'Making such a statement would be arrogant and overwhelming ' .	-2.7001
And so Funkel doesn 't want to experience his players on Sunday .	-4.1239
Published New Results of Swedish Asylum Age Assessment Tests	-2.2045
The recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , which have been subjected to a new method of medical evaluation of their age , show that more than 80 % of the people tested are over 18 years old , but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .	-5.3577
The Swedish Forensian Medicine Authority ( Rättsmedicinalverket ) has begun carrying out the tests last year .	-4.3650
During the asylum procedure , they are supposed to make age assessments more accurate after the Swedish Migration Administration ( Migration Sale ) was criticised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were minors .	-6.6368
To date , Migration Verket has sent 6.880 to test cases and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31 July 2017 .	-5.1046
Eighty percent ( 2002 ) were judged to be 18 or older , while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the person was " possibly 18 years or older " .	-3.5453
In 432 cases , the conclusion was that the person is " possibly under 18 years of age " .	-2.6236
The tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .	-3.0911
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency , the results have been consistent in recent months .	-2.7962
" We see no big difference in the statistics of recent months , the numbers are fairly constant , " he said the magazine The Local .	-3.2439
The high proportion of cases in which the person was judged to be over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker lied about his age .	-3.8192
In May , the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases ' suggesting that the person investigated was 18 years or older ' .	-3.5255
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results , she found that in 243 of these cases , the person frankly said that she would be 18 years old this year .	-3.2811
The method of medical age assessment , in which X-ray photographs of wisdom teeth and MRT photographs of knee joints , which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists , was also criticized in some areas .	-5.2912
A sceptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute , whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of humans to see if they were going through puberty sooner or later than usual .	-4.4209
" I had reason to think about it , and I do not think the type of measurement should be used .	-2.9430
Judging biological age in this way is very uncertain .	-2.5301
If we can not say it safely , we should not pretend that we could , " he said the newspaper Metro .	-9.6141
However , Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests : " In general , you can say that the risk of a child being incorrectly judged as an adult is low .	-3.7579
The biggest risk is that the person is less than 18 , in this case it is about 10 % . '	-4.5378
Full in the Plan	-2.0023
Work on the three bridges of Landstra<unk>e 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well .	-2.6108
On Wednesday , a seven tonne concrete part was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach .	-3.5215
" We are very good at the time , it is running super , " says Reinhold Leicht , construction manager at the Department of Road and Transport at the Government Bureau of Freiburg .	-5.6914
In April the work began simultaneously on all three bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach in need of renovation .	-3.6991
The construction is planned for October and it is easy to keep to the schedule .	-4.3940
The first bridge , coming from Schramberg , leads over the Trombach .	-2.4352
It is a concrete arched bridge covered with red buntsandstone and has a total length of 4.80 meters .	-4.6161
It was built in 1900 .	-1.0971
Like the other two bridges , it has now come into the years .	-8.3753
In order to ensure stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly restored .	-4.1032
The other two bridges cross the Lauterbach .	-2.4951
They are made of red sandstone .	-3.0205
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve , or 10.60 meters long .	-7.9132
On Wednesday morning , the bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach received a 1.30 meter wide bridge cap and seven tons heavy .	-5.9160
This is a peripheral attachment , which is also used as an operating route .	-4.9604
On the southern part of the bridge a 2.20 metre bridge cap is to be used on Friday .	-4.7201
The pedestrian path is to be followed .	-4.6767
The special thing about this is that these are finished parts , a patent of the Schramberg company Dizbo .	-4.8395
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps .	-2.7997
The laying of lines through the building in Lauterbach has required a special feeling of fingertip .	-6.0760
Because there is also a fibreglass cable to which many companies are connected .	-4.2236
The residents were informed about the project in advance by hand slips .	-4.2758
In addition , fish and cancer had to be fished first .	-9.2179
For the bridges between the Bauhof building and the Satellite Weiher in the direction of Schramberg , traffic is regulated by a traffic light .	-4.9086
For the construction work on the bridge at the Lauterbach town entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels " Tannenhof " and " Seven Linden " is fully closed .	-4.9239
The cost of the three bridge renovations is EUR 700 000 .	-3.5457
It is financed by the country .	-2.2992
AfD in Gerolstein : Colour protest at German potato salad	-3.7166
It is not so often that parties pull together , but when it comes to the Alternative for Germany ( AfD ) , what else is difficult to reconcile .	-4.5200
The parties represented in Kreistag Vulkaneifel ( CDU , SPD , Green , FDP , FWG , Left ) belong to a broad alliance that flies peacefully this day , because the AfD invites Rondell to the poster " Big Election Campaign " in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle .	-6.5545
And well-known names bring to the start - like Alice Weidel , who , together with Alexander Gauland , is the top duo for the Bundestag election on 24 September , and the Deputy Chairman Beatrix von Storch .	-6.4301
But those who are already on the spot hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the AfD people , but to demonstrate .	-5.5703
The motto " The Eifel stays colorful " .	-2.4134
Originally the city picnic was planned under the motto " All at a table " on the Brunnenplatz , but now takes place in the parking lot below the Rondell - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the Stadthalle .	-5.8253
A colourful picture that offers itself .	-3.2210
And what Christa Karoli , Chairman of the Ein Welt Forum and one of the leading organizers , really pleased : " Toll how many people have come together here " .	-4.9914
There is music and a lot of food , including a " original German potato salad , which the AfD could eat without any problems " , says the woman who brought him with him .	-5.6275
The police have ordered many officials to Gerolstein , especially at the train station , which is only a few meters away from the venues .	-5.9895
How did the AfD actually come to Gerolstein ?	-1.9099
Mario Hompes of the AfD Vulcan Eifel reported that he was trying to do this and got the supplement .	-5.7539
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf initially asked for a refusal in Daun , because of the already built Laurentius parks there were not enough parking spaces .	-5.4095
So now the Rondell , Hompes is pleased that " we can have such a nice event here " .	-3.2194
With a view to the event at the Rondellvorplatz , he says : " This is the right of people , the main thing , it remains peaceful " .	-4.9730
This is also the case : at about 8 p.m. at Rondellvorplatz a band provides entertainment , in the Stadthalle various speakers , including the Rhineland-Palatinate AfD Chairman Uwe Junge .	-6.9128
There are about 200 listeners in the Chamber waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag election , Alice Weidel , and the deputy Federal Chairman Beatrix von Storch to make their speeches .	-5.5644
The police presence is unchanged , but so far the officials have had a quiet evening .	-2.8962
The AfD event lasts a little more than an hour , the guests on the pitch have a longer breath , but also there is a time to clean up .	-6.8982
The police can leave - no special events .	-2.5248
Trompet	-1.7213
In the series Haslach monastery concerts tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 p.m. in the monastery church , there is a repetition with the Wolfacher trombonist Frederic Belli .	-7.3003
Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov he gives a concert under the motto " Black Sea meets Black Forest " , or even " Balkan folklore " meets a classical German training with roots in blazing music .	-4.2394
Both soloists are winners and prizewinners of numerous international competitions and hold solo positions in top European orchestras .	-3.3812
Petkov Solotrompeter is the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is a solo songwriter of the SWR Symphony Orchestra .	-3.8864
Both combine the desire not only to cross the boundaries on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres .	-3.7860
For example , Johann Sebastian Bach finds herself in a new guise , Daniel Schnyder 's " world music " combines with Bulgarian folklore , and in the " Exchange Suite " of the jazz choreographer Nils Wogram , classical , jazz and free play become a fascinating overall artwork .	-7.9120
This core part of the programme was only launched this spring with huge success in Freiburg .	-4.6029
The renowned composer Nils Wogram wrote it specifically for the two musicians and more : the Haslach monastery church with its special acoustics is deliberately included in the concert .	-4.5205
Kristen Stewart talks about her bisexuality	-2.1632

'When I bite in grilled cheese , I think ' Oh that was cool , what will come next ? '	-4.6180
The most famous relationship of the Hollywood star was her twilight colleague Robert Pattinson , who eventually disintegrated bitterly .	-5.1262
In spite of all this , the brunette actress assures the " Harper 's Bazaar " magazine : " I was seriously in love with everyone I have dated .	-5.4090
Or do you think I played it ? '	-6.7520
After their separation , crises admitted that it was bisexual : " I have always lived dualism and seriously believed it .	-4.3461
So I have never been confused or obstructed .	-2.5821
I never wanted to be taken seriously . '	-2.7815
She suffered particularly from this , according to " Bang Showbiz " but in school time , when she preferred to dress like a bub : " Not all girls are typical girls .	-5.2381
That really hurt me very much .	-3.2034
When I was eleven the children told me I would look like a bub .	-2.3549
I felt really attacked , frightened and ashamed .	-2.3798

Coe praises " honest " Russian apology for doping scandal .	-1.9715
The global leader of athletics , Sebastian Coe , praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia for a doping scandal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be reinstated in sport .	-4.2472
Russia ’ s athletic leader , Dmitry Shylakhtin , said during the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World athletics Championships that his country ’ s exile from sport was correct , and that he was determined to combat doping .	-10.8907
He said that he was sorry for " all athletes who were thrown away gold and silver medals in competitions " . the .	-11.2395
Despite his comments , the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia .	-3.0811
" I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , " said IAAF President Coe to the reporters .	-2.1660
'The whole Council and Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation itself realised that it has experienced some rather hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the federation is restructured ' .	-12.1788
Coe said he was also ' pleased ' about Russia accepting the criteria for its reintroduction .	-3.4851
" I think it was a very constructive day , and I think progress has been made , but Congress supports the recommendations of the task force that this is not the moment to reinstate Russia , " said Coe .	-3.5778
" We must do everything in the coming months to normalise this situation .	-3.1787
The guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the spoilt system , " he added .	-3.1445

Saddened Soldiers in Mali	-3.5447
At a mourning ceremony in the North Hessian Fritzlar , some 1000 people thought of the two soldiers who were killed in a helicopter crash in Mali .	-5.2384
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security measures .	-3.5343
On the unresolved crash , Secretary of Defense Ursula of the Leyen ( CDU ) said nothing .	-4.0256
However , she called the two victim pilots " skilled " .	-6.3468
" We bow to the highest sacrifice they made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany , " she said .	-3.7808

Among them were Hessen ’ s Prime Minister Volker Bouffier ( CDU ) and the general inspector of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker .	-2.9507
The mourning guests laid down roses , the relatives stood in arms at the coffins .	-6.0784
In front of the church , Fritzlarer and many soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas .	-2.8918
Secretary of Defense of the Leyen called the reversed soldiers " highly decorated " and operational experience .	-3.7861
The Chief of Staff has built up the Tiger fighter helicopter in Fritzlar and was one of the first six Tiger pilots in his regime .	-6.1443
Volker Bauersachs , the commander of the regime , to which the soldiers belong , also said : ' If this occupation could not avert the crash , then no one would have succeeded ' .	-5.3397
Doubts about the UN mission in Mali did not show Leyen Minister : the deployment was dangerous .	-3.2092
But he was also of great importance ' for a country from which we are only separated by two states ' , she said .	-3.7470
After the funeral , the coffins were brought out of the cathedral .	-3.7108

This was shared by the royal house on Thursday .	-3.3206
Traditionally , the Danish royal pair is buried in the Cathedral Church of Roskilde .	-3.5529
The sculptor Bj<unk>rn N<unk>rgaard already produced a sarcophagus for the two .	-2.4222
The queen agreed with the decision of her husband , and it was also stated in the communication .	-5.5130
Where Prince Henrik is buried is still unclear .	-2.1861
But he does not intend to be buried in his French home .	-3.2195
Prince Henrik never concealed that he was not happy with his title .	-2.8138
After the throne of his wife Margrethe in 1972 , he would have liked to become king .	-3.4415
In 2016 , he retired , taking the title " Prince Member " .	-5.9793
As Henrik did not receive the title and function he wanted in Denmark , he did not consider himself equal to his wife - not even after death , Lene Balleby , the leader of the Danish royal house .	-5.7560
It is still unclear where the last resting place of the 83-year-old will be .	-3.9125

My Danish was fluctuating , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk stockings instead of knitting socks , Citro<unk>n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .	-2.8363

Prime Minister Weil Was Rapid Reelection	-2.3171
CDU and FDP in Lower Saxony	-2.4231
Niedersachsen ’ s Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) , after the loss of the red-green government majority , is in favour of a rapid re-election of the country ’ s day , but he does not want to resign .	-4.6242
Because on Friday we called for the dissolution of Parliament .	-3.6803
Previously , the surprising withdrawal of a Green MEP from her country ’ s faction in Lower Saxony had plunged Prime Minister Stephan Weil ’ s government into a severe crisis .	-4.1647
Five months before the official date of the country ’ s election , the red-green coalition in Hanover lost its narrow one-vote majority in parliament to the opposition from CDU and FDP .	-4.8527
The previous Green MEP Elke Twisten founded her move with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg ( Wümme ) .	-5.0292
" I see my political future in the CDU , " she explained on Friday in Hannover .	-2.0380
CDU group leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend that his group accept them .	-3.4902
This means that CDU and FDP together would have 69 seats in the Lower Saxon country day , SPD and Green seats .	-4.9884
So far , the relationship has been reversed .	-1.9320
The new Landtag will be elected on January 14th next year .	-4.8848
Thümler said that the red-green state government must now decide whether it can continue to rule without a majority in this situation .	-4.0224
However , Stephan Weil considers it essential that the day of the land should decide on its own resolution as soon as possible .	-5.4600
The CDU Group is expected to decide on its future action on Tuesday .	-3.2032
The constitution also provides for the possibility that the day of the country will deprive the Prime Minister of confidence and elect a successor .	-10.2178
" Our constitution offers several options .	-1.5504
These possibilities must be checked in a legally clean manner , " said Thümler .	-4.5010
'You will be discussing all the issues in peace if they are legally properly examined ' .	-6.3237
Thümler called Twisten 's step " but something curious " .	-3.2070
The politician himself stressed : " I am not a traitor .	-3.0675
I feel very good " .	-1.6541
She called herself a follower of black green .	-3.1663
The Greens called on the breakaway Members to return their country 's mandate .	-4.0981
" We assume , of course , that she will return with immediate effect her country 's mandate , which she has received via the green list , " said the Chairmen of the State , Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner .	-6.7320
The chairman of the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance , Anja Piel , said : ' We deeply regret Elke Twisten 's decision ' .	-3.9331
You deliberately decided not to hold a debate in the group .	-3.0608
'Against the background that there were no differences in content , we cannot understand this step ' .	-4.1573
SPD Chancellor Martin Schulz condemns the conversion of Lower Saxon Green MEP Elke Twisten to the CDU as betrayal .	-4.1452
" The behaviour of the former Green MEPs in Lower Saxony is not only betrayal of the voters , but also betrayal of the Red Green , " the German Social Democrats wrote on Facebook on Friday .	-4.6804
He supports Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) ’ s decision to quickly re-elect the country ’ s day .	-3.8058
The withdrawal of Twistens costs the majority of the Red Green in Lower Saxony .	-3.7291
The politician " in her violated vanity and frustration place her personal interests before the welfare of the country , " criticized Secretary-General Hubertus Heil .	-11.1100
" It is scandalous that the CDU in Lower Saxony is participating in this dirty intrigue game and trying to make political capital from it " .	-9.0698
Lower Saxony ’ s CDU group leader , Björn Thümler , wants to recommend to his MPs that Elke Twisten be included in the CDU .	-4.3709
The SPD ’ s leader in the Bundestag , Thomas Oppermann , accused Twisten of falsifying the results of the 2013 Landtag election with personal career .	-5.1630
The CDU was the strongest force before the SPD , but the SPD and the Greens had a very thin majority of one vote in the country day .	-5.6255
Agriculture Minister in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from toxic eggs , Mr Schmidt ?	-3.1008
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs .	-1.0886
How could the scandal happen ?	-1.1531
How can consumers protect themselves .	-1.1912
Agricultural Minister Christian Schmidt ( CSU ) speaks and responds in the interview with the editorial network Germany ( RND ) .	-3.6761
Mr Schmidt , how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs ?	-1.6918
I can only encourage all consumers to look carefully at the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp print .	-3.1778
At the Consumer Protection Portal www.Förderwarnung.de , the Federal Länder will provide the latest information on the affected egg batches .	-5.2032
The eggs affected should be destroyed or returned .	-2.5035
Even if , according to everything we know at the moment , there is virtually no health risk .	-4.1615
Does Aldi now take the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of supply - because the central role of the enlightenment is not really perceived by the Federal Minister for Agriculture ?	-4.9682
Food surveillance is the responsibility of the federal states .	-3.0254
Nonetheless , my House has immediately opened up and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since Germany became aware of its concern .	-6.5503
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers .	-2.2914
Trade , like manufacturers , must ensure that the products sold are commercially safe and safe for health .	-5.4442
If the maximum residue content of 0.005mg / kg is exceeded for eggs , they cannot be used .	-4.0992
Unstressed eggs can be sold and eaten .	-3.0493
This time , businesses are not to blame .	-2.2066
Are production companies and consumers in the same boat ?	-3.2142
According to current knowledge , the production companies are not directly responsible .	-4.1954
Instead , they have to face economic damage due to alleged illegal practices by service companies .	-4.2254
As always , there are too few controllers in the event of an accident .	-3.0628
Is it only a lack of personnel or of coherent competence ?	-4.8536
It was precisely the official controls that revealed the process .	-3.2361
The truth , however , is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded 100 % .	-3.4413
It is precisely for this reason that it is essential to ensure that such events are properly investigated and that the public prosecutors are handed over to the courts in cases where criminal acts can be committed .	-8.4151
I have already made it clear on several occasions that I expect the authorities responsible to provide full information .	-4.2552
Is regular alarm in food scandals really necessary ?	-2.6046
Consumers have the right to receive only safe and accessible food .	-8.7088
If an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly outraged .	-2.8211
The panned means have put producers , traders and consumers in a situation that is absolutely unnecessary .	-5.1506
In principle , it must be clear that the illegal use of the insecticide Fipronil in the attitude of food-supplying animals is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately .	-5.3537
This must be done consistently and with great pressure at all levels .	-3.8553
I expect all the competent authorities to clarify the matter quickly and in full .	-5.0829
How Football ’ s Financial Rules affect Neymar ’ s move to Paris	-2.8167
The rules aimed at preventing unhindered spending by European football clubs will not disrupt Neymar ’ s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to French Paris-Saint Germain .	-4.1462
Any consequences will come from UEFA for Paris Saint-Germain , because the leading organisation that supervises the European game has the power to ban teams from accessing the prestigious Champions League Tournament .	-5.1587
Financial fair play rules , which were created by UEFA in 2011 , mean that PSG will eventually have to prove that Neymar ’ s transfer was financed without major losses .	-4.9441
Barcelona has paid EUR 222 million ( $ 262 million ) to buy the Brazilian out of its treaty , and Neymar will receive a salary worth several $ 10 million per year .	-3.2260
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar 's move to France .	-1.3897
PSG can certainly make money loose so that Neymar sign and bring him into a galaxy of other stars , given the team 's funding through the energy-rich ruling family of Qatar .	-6.0926
clubs may spend a lot of money on acquiring players , but they must counter legitimate sources of revenue that enable them to make the break-even point in their soccer related business .	-6.7955
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA president in 2007 .	-4.4368
Former French players believed that clubs that had taken on huge debt in their quest for success effectively cheated and risked ruining when banks or owners withdrew their support .	-4.5797
In 2011 , FFP shifted from focusing on club debt to monitoring its losses .	-2.4338
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a tougher issue .	-4.0864
During the current three-year FFP investment period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million .	-3.8349
And , while Platini disliked the presidency in 2015 , his UEFA successor , Aleksander Ceferin , remains committed to discouraging excessive spending .	-3.3441
" Certainly FFP is not dead and we will certainly reinforce the rules for the future , " said Andrea Traverso , who is responsible for FFP at UEFA , to The Associated Press last week .	-3.4584
Although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a lump sum , it can distribute the amount for reporting over the duration of its contract .	-4.2414
Neymar has signed a five-year contract , so that the deduction sum for the next five years , amounting to EUR 44.4 million , can be recorded in the annual accounts .	-4.7623
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 , together with Abu Dhabi , owned by Manchester City , hit the PSG with the most severe sanctions .	-3.3904
The PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million ( then $ 82 million ) , which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and it was ordered that the team members for the 2014 / 15 Champions League should remain limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players .	-5.0624
UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outlist their financial supervision by inflating their revenues by companies associated with the owners of a club .	-5.1973
While a Catarian company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsorship exceeds standard market rates , UEFA would not consider this to be a legitimate income .	-4.6887
This was precisely what happened in 2014 , when UEFA decided that the value of PSA sponsorship was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .	-2.7728
It has been reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come to Qatar on payments made by the World Cup 2022 Organization Committee .	-3.8026
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar will become a World Cup ambassador , and that such a manoeuvre could easily be found for UEFA regulators .	-3.9966
The previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules .	-3.3489
UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymar 's transfer , said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .	-3.7115
They spoke with The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity , because they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation .	-3.2114
The latest reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 , with a turnover of 542.4 million euros , achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros .	-4.2871
The accounts for the last fiscal year are still to be published .	-2.6003
PSG expects Neymar ’ s arrival to be a blessing for sponsoring deals , merchandising , and tricot sales .	-3.1600
The association assumes that sales will increase by at least 30 percent after signing .	-11.8605
The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players go , and it tried to prevent Neymar ’ s move by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP .	-3.5333
" It is a clear case of " financial doping " with the club and the state , " said the President of the La League , Javier Tebas , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar 's final ownership of PSG .	-3.3100
Arsenal Manager Arsene Wenger , whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon , shares the reservations of La League against a state that finances a club .	-3.6874
" It is the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , " said Wenger on Thursday .	-3.0991
" Once a country has an association , everything is possible .	-2.6505
It will be very difficult to respect financial fair play , because one can go different ways or have different interests when a country has such a large player to represent a country . '	-4.6195
Swiss is Looking for a New Shoggil Supplier	-2.5180
In recent years , Chocolat Frey has made board chocolate for Swiss .	-3.4505
Now sweet cooperation is coming to an end : the airline is rewriting the order .	-4.3466
Swiss spokesperson Meike Fuhlrott confirmed on request of the news agency sda a corresponding report by the newspaper " Northwest Switzerland " of Friday .	-4.1913
According to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .	-2.6250
The products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .	-3.0839

Swiss did not want to give any information about the costs .	-3.5057
Industry insiders estimate the order volume according to " Northwest Switzerland " to 1.5 to 2 million francs - the Migros subsidiary generates annual sales of around one billion francs .	-5.5811
But the advertising effect is more important : it is a prestigious task for a shogging manufacturer .	-4.8674
The Swiss does not want to betray how many applicants there are in the new tender .	-4.4946
However , only Swiss manufacturers are eligible for this . the .	-8.5256
According to the newspaper report , Chocolat Frey intends to renew the treaty beyond the spring of 2018 .	-3.5554
For the sda the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not reachable for an opinion .	-2.9285
Chocolate panels have been distributed by Swiss on board their flights since 2006 .	-3.6260
Before the Swiss signed a contract with the Migros daughter , Barry Callebaut had delivered the chocolate tables in cooperation with Hug .	-10.2411

Nostalgia goes into the niche in " Wet Hot American Summer " and " Comrade Detective " .	-2.8644
This repetition of history is nostalgic at the same time because of the glorious days of characters of the 80 's , for the 90 's Grunge era ( when the forebears David Wain and Michael Showalter shot the sketch comedy " The State " for MTV ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , such as Elizabeth Banks , Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to bigger things .	-5.4246
As a cultural artifact it is also a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook capable era of permanent memories .	-3.1449
But as a franchise , it feels like time is running out .	-2.1187
" First Day of Camp " worked surprisingly well , not only because of its absurd humor ( it contained an original story for a talking can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .	-3.1571
By attacking the core of the gag - middle-age actors play horny children who will grow up - they managed to get the last part of the joke back .	-6.6575
" Ten Years Later " , with his adults now playing adult , is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more according to the molding principle , including a reef on the Stalker films of the 1990s such as " The Hand That Rocks the Cradle " ( " The hand that shakes the cradle " ) .	-5.6281
At one point , a character interferes with an Apple Powerbook , some inline skates , and " a number of other things from 1991 " .	-3.7071
Many of the central stories are the same .	-0.9511
The dear Coop ( Mr. Showalter ) , now a novelist , has still not forgotten Katie ( Marguerite Moreau ) .	-3.5168
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost his virginity .	-1.5231
And there is another crazy malicious plot that includes Ronald Reagan ( also Mr. Showalter ) , now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good impression of Michael Ian Black ) .	-3.6413
As always , the excursions are the best part of the franchise .	-1.8106
It is especially fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rudd , who shows Matt Dillon 's Unterlippenbart by " Singles " , whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old cracker .	-4.9528
It is the moments of random madness that could fuel this franchise like a kind of repetitive " Seven Up ! " series until it reaches what I assume as his logical conclusion : " Wet Hot American Summer : Twenty Years Later " , whose final scene will show the band how to visit the film premiere of " Wet Hot American Summer " .	-5.1782
" Comrade Detective " on Amazon is now reminiscent of another kind of nostalgia : the revival of the Cold War of " The Americans " , the film " Atomic Blonde " and even " GLOW " with its east-to-west ring iconography .	-4.3824
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka , with Rhys Thomas as director , claims to be a TV series found : a Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two policemen as friends , two Bucharest officers fighting for truth , atheism , and the path of Marxism Leninism .	-4.2862
The main roles are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici , whose dialogs are synchronized in English by Channing Tatum ( also an executing producer ) and Joseph Gordon Levitt .	-3.7307
It is a brilliant idea .	-1.1569
But it is not much more than an idea .	-1.3481
There are some nice gags to watch ( the police spend time watching chess on television , as Americans might do with football ) .	-3.5905
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate , Nick Offerman , Mahershala Ali and Chlo<unk> Sevigny - ensures a decent game ' Find the voice out ' .	-3.1299
But " Comrade Detective " is so committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like a single one . the the the the . the the the .	-7.0716
Six long episodes are moving in , and the comedy is not fast or often enough .	-8.9233
" Comrade Detective " , edited to a lesser length , could provide his agitprop satire better , as Gregor and Iosef always visit the American embassy , whose lobby is always filled by two thick men who devour a bunch of hamburgers .	-6.1654
The message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can make everything feed for a garage .	-3.8929

There were German arrest warrants against the two suspects of Italians .	-2.5844
The two are therefore probably shipped to Germany .	-3.4698
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the campaign .	-2.5926
More than 300 police officers were in operation .	-6.6397
The members of the mafia are accused of organised drug crime , serious acts of violence , attempted murder , robbery and blackmail .	-3.9542
Since the summer of 2016 , the prosecutor has been investigating Konstanz against organised drug trafficking in Southern Germany .	-4.6114
Between the prosecutors in Constance and Palermo there was a strong exchange and the investigators of Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .	-5.1333
Therefore , on Wednesday morning , four officials from Palermo accompanied the large-scale operation .	-4.2469
In particular , Italian nationals with close ties to the Italian mafia were targeted .	-5.8706
An incident on 27 May in Hüfingen , where several shots were fired into a restaurant early in the morning , is likely to go to the band 's account .	-5.4140
Large gaps in the Foreign Register	-3.4510
" Data from citizens who should not appear " : according to a report , the foreigner register in Germany has significant shortcomings .	-5.3500
This leads to some serious mistakes in asylum procedures .	-2.9486
According to a media report , the Federal Government ’ s Refugee Management Officer , Frank-Jürgen Weise , has drawn attention to major gaps in the foreign central register .	-4.9076
Defects in the data registered there could lead to ' some serious mistakes ' in asylum procedures and deportations , warned in an analysis presented by the ' Süddeutsche Zeitung ' .	-5.0543
According to the register , ten million people with foreign nationality are covered , including some 5.7 million from non-EU countries .	-4.4446
The data are therefore managed by some 600 foreign authorities in Germany .	-3.2795
Because the data had not been maintained sufficiently , the data quality had not been good in parts .	-4.9256
In individual cases , data from 1921 have been found , ' of people who have long since been alive , or of citizens who have become German citizens and should not actually appear in the register ' .	-6.4165
" Errors can slow returns significantly , " says the report .	-4.5806
Moreover , EU citizens who do not need to travel should be included in the statistics on people subject to leave .	-6.1561
Such incorrect allocations , however , have ' led to a distorted debate on the treatment of persons subject to leave ' , so the analysis says .	-6.9117
Meanwhile , the Federal Government seems to have begun to send refugee families with under 16 years of age back to Italy when they enter from there .	-4.6555
This emerges from an internal paper by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees ( BAMF ) , reported by the " Neue Osnabrück Zeitung " .	-3.8598
The paper states , therefore , that the BAMF is carrying out such proceedings ' on families with children - with the exception of infants and micro-children - to Italy since 1 June 2017 ' .	-6.0198
Since the end of 2014 , this has been virtually impossible , according to the newspaper , referring to the difficult situation on the ground .	-4.3402
Under the Dublin Agreement , refugees are the responsibility of the EU state that they reach first .	-3.8021
If a migrant travels to another EU country , that state can return it to the country of entry .	-4.1280
As an explanatory statement , the office now writes : ' In the meantime , the absorption capacity for families with underage children in Italy has increased substantially ' . the the the the the . the the , the , the ,	-10.4466
Italy has given guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families .	-2.7810
Even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECHR ) considers these commitments to be sufficient .	-2.3915
Other EU countries would also send refugees back there under the Dublin Agreement .	-2.6991
The domestic spokesperson of the Left Group in the Bundestag , Ulla Jelpke , criticized this decision : " Families with children are threatened by the shortcomings in the Italian asylum system in terms of unlawful reception conditions and a threat to child welfare " .	-7.0951
The Second Best Earnings	-2.9490
A total of 220 litres of blood from people living in Oberleichenbach has already provided blood donation services to other people .	-3.9266
At least of the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .	-3.1629
Jürgen Greule , who now shares 50 litres of blood with his 100 donations .	-3.8479
Traditionally , at the meeting of the council , the municipality appreciates the multiple willingness to donate blood .	-4.5023
" It is ingenious how our body is designed to do so , and we pay tribute to the donors who make their blood available to strangers , and also unselfish , " said Mayor Karlheinz Kistner .	-6.7609
" One single blood donation helps several people , " explained the head of the German Red Cross ( DRK ) , Holger Maisenbacher , because the conserves are being split into their constituents .	-11.8095
Three people could already benefit from blood donation .	-3.2465
At the same time , Maisenbacher reported on the actions carried out in the spring in Obereichenbach .	-8.1822
" This year we achieved the second best result with 114 donors , " said the DRK circular readiness manager .	-4.2638
Obviously , a few years ago , the change to the theatre house led to higher numbers of participants .	-4.6184
Before that , Thomas Bockstadt , Susanne Reichle , Sandra Schöck , Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiple donors and were awarded for 50 blood donations .	-3.6241
Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger scored half as many , while Tamara Pfrommer , Petra Schleeh , Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter spent ten times a 500 millilitre of their life juice .	-4.6494
The Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25 %	-7.0584
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and inflation weakening have dampened speculation about an increase .	-4.1200
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain " sluggish " when it maintained interest rates on family incomes in the midst of increasing pressure .	-4.0951
Policymakers of the Bank ’ s Monetary Committee ( MPC ) voted to hold interest rates to 0.25 % , with fewer members seeking an increase this month , as weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase .	-4.2804
In its quarterly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts to 1.7 % in 2017 and 1.6 % in 2018 , warning that the pressure on household income would continue , with inflation expected to rise to just under 3 % in the autumn .	-4.0123
But it signaled that interest-rate hikes would be needed in the next few years to curb Brexit-fueled inflation , and she said that borrowing costs might have to rise more than expected in financial markets .	-4.7720
Members also voted to withdraw part of the Mammut stimulus package issued a year after Brexit .	-2.5067
It will demand time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funding for banks from next February , although it has been said that it is now expected to make GBP 15 billion more available within the framework of this system , at GBP 115 billion . GB1115 .	-5.9764
minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : ' In the MPC 's central forecast , GDP remains weak in the short term , as pressure on real household incomes continues to burden consumption . '	-4.9756
At interest rates , she repeated that ' a certain tightening of monetary policy ' would be needed to cool inflation and a ' slightly larger ' extent than markets expect .	-4.5497
Markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .	-2.5616
However , the Bank stressed that increases would be " progressive " and " limited " .	-3.2445
The Bank ’ s downward corrected growth forecasts for this and next year are compared to the 1.9 % and 1.7 % forecast in May .	-3.5956
It maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .	-1.8784
The pound fell after these news against the dollar and the euro .	-2.9610
The pound fell by 0.5 % to $ 1.31 and fell by 0.4 % to € 1.11 .	-2.3272
The decision will not change after the recent disappointing growth figures have dampened rising expectations for an interest-rate hike , and GDP has risen from 0.2 % in the second quarter to 0.3 % in the previous three months .	-4.7841
Growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , even though it will recover slightly after the bank by the end of the year .	-3.7094
The recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and marginal salary increases , as the aggravation first becomes even worse before it will improve .	-5.6558
It added that monetary policy cannot " prevent " income collapse in the coming years , but it added that wages will " recover significantly " at the end of their three-year forecast .	-4.7818
The economy is also strengthened by rising demand for British goods , owing to the weak pound , which will compensate for some of the lower consumer spending .	-3.7256
The decision comes one year after the reduction in interest rates to 0.25 % last August , following the shocking EU vote that caused the pound to fall .	-3.6255
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years to achieve prices and the economy in full .	-3.0373
Prior to the Bank ’ s last verdict on interest rates , the call for an interest-rate hike had risen , as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households , with three policymakers calling for an increase to 0.5 % in July .	-5.0471
Inflation has fallen from 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % last month , even though the Bank said that this was expected and that it would recover in the coming months .	-4.7641
The Bank said that the excess in relation to its 2 % target was " entirely " attributed to the weak pound .	-4.1967
Andrew Montlake , Director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers , said : " Given the recent fall in swap rates , the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again , as lenders are looking loudly for business and want to end the year positively .	-4.8546
The market looks particularly good for those in which the existing deals are expired and the new mortgages are completed , and many with toll-free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . . ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' '	-11.1584
NHS ( The National Health Service ) is to prescribe disputed HIV drugs to 10,000 people .	-3.0998
Patients will gain access to " transformative " HIV prevention treatment after a fight before the High Court against the financing of the drug in the NHS .	-4.7200
NHS England announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) taken prior to sexual intercourse , which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 % , is now delivered by the health service over a first three-year study for an estimated 10,000 people .	-4.9574
He agreed to finance the trial after last year ’ s appeal court confirmed a Supreme Court ruling that the NHS had the power to pay for the PrEP despite the claim that local authorities should finance it .	-4.3953
The chess announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England leader Simon Stevens as " important new intervention " , while the National AIDS Trust ( NAT ) called this a " decisive moment " .	-4.6434
Sexual health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool , and Sheffield will be among the first to enable people to register , and more clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 .	-3.4851
Pre-exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) is a sequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .	-2.7814
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces the HIV transmission of infectious persons .	-3.2932
Taking prEP before sexual intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in a person ’ s body to prevent HIV infection .	-3.9132
Such drugs can be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse .	-3.3329
Those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men , transsexuals and people with HIV positive partners who have not been treated successfully .	-9.2549
In clinics , suitable participants are identified who agree with the study , including men , women , transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment .	-3.6590
People who live in England and are registered with a domestic doctor can also apply for participation in their local participating sex clinic .	-4.3071
The program will be $ 10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply drugs this week after an international competitive procurement .	-2.5864
The study is intended to assess the entire potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence on a large scale , including and implementing it .	-5.5504
Stevens said : " This major new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .	-2.6168
It is another milestone in the ongoing progress made over three decades in addressing one of the greatest health challenges facing humanity . '	-4.3200
Deborah Gold , Chief Executive of NAT ( National AIDS Trust ) , said : " This is a decisive moment in the fight against HIV .	-2.3847
PrEP , if targeted at needy and vulnerable people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic .	-3.7086
From September onwards , people with a high risk of HIV will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is genuinely individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner , which will improve many , many lives .	-5.4580
We warmly welcome this announcement . '	-1.6554
Ian Green , Chairman of the Terrence Higgins Trust , said : " The priority must now be to ensure that the study is carried out quickly across the country and that no one with a risk to HIV is left behind .	-4.4720
Now that PrEP Test Medicine has been acquired , we are on the best track to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people . '	-4.9479
Sharon Hodgson , Shadow Health Minister , said : " The beginning of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and hesitant implementation by the government .	-3.4790
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection .	-3.3797
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of PrEP .	-2.7312
It is now important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country in order to protect people who are HIV infected and that it will help us to move one step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society ' .	-4.9243
Living the Great Life : Intermediate floors and clever designer tricks have transformed this small Earls Court apartment into a generous home .	-4.5260
Joanne Leigh , a former banker with a passion for real estate , shrunk from a large house in Knightsbridge in 2014 to an Earls Court apartment .	-2.7964
It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne did not pack and sell her bags .	-3.1038
" Before that I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room , " says Joanne .	-3.4696
" I was looking for something comparable to my price .	-2.2307
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings .	-2.5002
I fell in love with her and made an offer on that day . '	-2.5472
Since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely overtaken .	-3.9856
Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - one had to go through the kitchen to enter the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and an intermediate floor to make the most of the spacious ceiling height .	-4.5960
" I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .	-1.4477
That was my request , ' she says .	-2.0665
To this end , she commissioned Erfan Azadi ’ s architectural and design studio Duck & Shed from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development , but also a place to live for Joanne .	-3.9664
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms above each other , so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor where one could stand .	-3.4598
Erfan had to think creatively in order to solve the preset .	-9.8058
" The steel mill is quite complicated , " he explains .	-2.1953
" We had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bust ourselves .	-5.1471
It was not just a matter of building a simple platform , but of creating the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or below . '	-4.8734
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms at full height above each other - with much more drama .	-4.1298
For the intermediate floor , a classic copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area .	-3.3744
mirrored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage serge mouille lighting set the style for the program .	-2.9059
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .	-2.3925
A short corridor is mirrored on both ends to make it work longer .	-3.0042
In the kitchen mirror feels like a window in another room .	-2.3988
At the entrance mirrored units offer space for all Joanne cutlery and glasses .	-3.2184
By perceiving a more glamorous room , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .	-2.9404
Foldable kitchens are nothing new .	-2.5380
What is special about this is that it is a garage door .	-2.5285
" A bit of engineering art went there , " explains Erfan of the steel reinforced , veneered MDF door .	-3.5132
'It is counterweight so that when you push the door up , it slides very easily ' .	-4.6283
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Joanne won an additional 16 m <unk> , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .	-3.5948
" At the end of the day you will sell the base area - or how your property is valued " , says Erfan .	-3.6722
'In a rudimentary form , a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the soil size ' .	-4.6271
Here they have managed to enlarge the floor and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage .	-5.9206
" The materials are the things you touch and which therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home , " says Erfan .	-3.4933
" You do not fall in love with the electric sockets in the walls .	-8.9885
They are important , but they do not play with your heart . '	-2.0934
It shows that a flat can be transformed into something amazing by good design and increased square meters of something standard .	-5.2588
Indeed , like Joanne , you could decide not to leave it .	-2.4990
Brothers Fight for a $ 500 million Real Estate Empire	-3.5086
Two brothers , four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty , are confronted by one of Victoria ’ s largest property empires worth more than $ 500 million .	-3.8518
Former director of the Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak , just three doors away from his younger brother Paul , who brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets should be shared .	-4.0229
Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp debate about separation is taking place in the Supreme Court .	-3.5122
Together with her mother Anna , the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , since the family bought a business at Smith Street , Collingwood in 1973 .	-3.7211
There the Westco Jeans family founded and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores .	-3.7845
It was sold in 1999 for $ 85 million .	-1.6315
This money was invested in real estate , and De Lutis ’ s portfolio now includes offices in the city centre , the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento , apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller , and shopping centres in the suburbs .	-3.6102
According to an agreement with her late father , Colin - described by Paul as " the main operator and the dominant personality " in the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of the company 's assets and Paul about one-third .	-4.6393
A court act states that this means that Colin possesses $ 316 million worth of property and Paul worth $ 176 million .	-4.6693
The distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .	-2.6645
" The divisions proposed by Colin left him with what I thought was the best objects , " he wrote in 2015 in a first affidavit .	-9.4196
Last Friday , following several failed conciliation , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place .	-2.6431
The brothers are now also fighting to control the existing business - which Colin , as Paul claims , has ruled out .	-4.8305
Colin argues that this is not true , but accuses Paul of managing some possessions incompetently .	-2.7901
In an early affidavit filed by Colin , he says he hopes to settle the dispute .	-2.5276
" My Italian heritage prescribes that the family is the most important priority , " he wrote .	-2.3648
The cost increases in this case , with hundreds of affidavits , e-mails and reports from companies , including Deloitte , Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer , and leading lawyers , including Allan Myers , QC , and law firms held by both sides .	-4.5066
Mrs De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated dairy bars and delicacies from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970s .	-3.3912
They used security to buy the Collingwood property in which Colin opened the family ’ s first jeans shop .	-3.4019
Colin says that he started Westco when he was " High School in my last years , when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) . "	-9.9949
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass their property on to their sons amicably .	-2.7631
" Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , " she wrote .	-2.2658
Two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lutis group , with Colin claiming that Mark was paid $ 10 million and Luke $ 26 million when he left the company .	-3.6483
Both Lukas and Mark , Paul says , ' have been bitter about the terms of their financial separation ' .	-5.0169
Colin was very reticent , although he was a former AFL board member and , after a 2015 biography by Eddie McGuire , the best friend of the television star .	-4.9402
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers .	-1.5366
Only Colin answered via SMS to say " I really can not say much " because the case is before the courts .	-3.2635
" It is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and pull our surname through the courts , " he wrote .	-2.8009
In mid-2016 , Colin wrote to the court to try to meet his brother ’ s demands .	-2.6006
" Our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end in our current dispute , " he said and added that he " still hope for a solution " .	-2.9575
On Friday , that hope seemed to be over .	-2.4369
" Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future , " wrote Colin .	-2.1333
Trump ’ s new chief of staff plans to limit the president ’ s media abstinence .	-2.2538
Others have tried it and have failed .	-8.1888
Perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do so .	-1.8804
If so , it will be the first .	-1.3435
Politico reports that the White House ’ s new chief of staff is planning to limit the flow of information to President Trump , including news media reports , in the hope of keeping the boss on a more consistent course .	-3.9152
Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey :	-2.0562
" When John F. Kelly , the White House ’ s new chief of staff , met senior officials on his first day of work , he posed a major problem in President Donald Trump ’ s White House that he wanted to repair : bad information that came into the president ’ s hands .	-4.3596
Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he got good information . '	-4.5446
Kelly ’ s diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to tame Trump by watching his media diet .	-7.8879
President Trump ’ s relationship with television goes back decades – and now that he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong .	-3.0850
" If candidate Trump was angry about unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting of posts to be persuaded , " former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg told Politico in February .	-4.5997
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that " the key to keeping Trump ’ s Twitter habit under control , according to six former campaign officials , is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise . "	-3.5032
Okay .	-0.5503
But the idea that Trump ’ s Twitter habit has ever been “ under control ” is ridiculous .	-1.8906
Perhaps these campaign officials know something we others do not know - that without their interventions , Trump ’ s tweets would have contained even more fuel .	-4.6992
We will probably never hear about the tweets that Trump has not sent .	-2.7102
If his employees have managed to keep him out of trouble several times , their efforts have been worthwhile .	-5.0224
But no one has consistently prevented Trump from causing controversy .	-2.2058
Part of the problem is that in a White House composed of competing parties , people repeatedly try to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump with material that may promote their views from the world .	-4.3479
Politico , which deals entirely with this story , reported in May about the preference of advisers to provide the president with dubious information for strategic reasons .	-5.4554
This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher :	-1.5198
" Current and former Trump officials say that Trump , like a volcano , can react to negative press clips , especially those with damaging leaks , and that he will find out where they come from .	-4.8368
This was exactly what happened at the end of February , when someone maliciously gave the President a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com , the website of Internet provocator Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh of being " the source behind a bunch of leaks " in the White House .	-4.5281
Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for harassment , or that he did not offer any concrete evidence , or that he has in the past voiced false accusations and revoked them .	-5.1645
Trump read the article and began to ask employees about Walsh . "	-7.8808
Goldmacher added that then-chief of staff , Reine Priebus , and the White House Secretary-General , Rob Porter , have " attempted to implement a system to manage and document the paper crunch Trump recei. "	-4.8011
How did that work ?	-1.3707
Kelly tries to do the same three months later .	-2.1052
Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective manager than a priebus , but Trump is still his impulsive self , and his advisers are still seeking influence .	-3.8203
These unchangeable factors make Kelly 's mission very difficult .	-6.4976
Europol ’ s Post for Criminals	-3.2622
Since the address is unknown , the help of the population is requested and hoped for .	-4.0610
The police all over Europe this summer ( virtual ) postcards are sent to dangerous criminals on the flight .	-9.9442
As the addresses of the serious criminals are naturally unknown , information from the population is hoped and requested .	-11.1406
Europol reported on Friday about the action following the EU Most Wanted advent calendar of winter .	-3.4070
Experience has shown that many volatile people are hiding in holiday destinations , as Europol said .	-5.1632
21 postcards were put together for criminals from 21 EU countries .	-3.3392
Since 2016 there is the website www.eumostwantited , more than 2.5 million times it has been viewed .	-3.8551
36 of the online searches have been arrested , at least eleven of which have been arrested on the basis of references after publication on the website .	-5.6252
Travellers negotiate a ditch and return to the ' Millionaires ' series .	-2.6554
Some of the wealthiest landowners of the West Midlands are back on war with some determined travellers who negotiated a ditch drawn by the community to reclaim a field in front of their mansions .	-5.6719
Travellers have parked their 20 caravans in a field outside a wealthy street of Solihull , which is called the " Millionaires series " .	-3.7187
They brought horses , babies and an army of transporters with them after they were thrown out only in May , without being deterred by a ditch excavated by the Council to prevent their invasions .	-4.9844
The tactful group found a gap in defense systems and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unhindered to find a way .	-4.5274
Random residents have afflicted the Solihull Council , which said that it is ' useless to deal with the problem ' .	-5.3573
An anonymous resident said : " They moved there on Monday evening after they were sent by Bentley Heath , where they thrown stones on the passers-by .	-4.2999
The Council must be forced into practice by shame , because it was useless in dealing with the problem .	-3.8428
Travellers were there in May , moved on and are now back .	-8.8528
More came yesterday evening , probably even more today . '	-3.2441
She added : ' The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with this by keeping long instructions to protect their parks .	-4.0028
I live on the Street Brook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my local tax if the Council cannot even stop it . '	-3.2137
A resident who did not want to be called said : ' It is ridiculous , we have just seen the last round of those travellers just to be looted by another round .	-4.5004
The numbers have increased this time and you have even seen a horse in the parking area . '	-3.5607
A spokesperson of the Solihull Council said : ' We are aware of an unauthorised camp in the country beyond the Streetsbrook Road and are working with the Solihulls police , and we are taking the necessary legal steps to move forward as soon as possible .	-5.7061
To support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible report anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101 .	-2.8240
This helps to create a picture of the situation in which the Court must examine when we are presenting our case . '	-4.5110
Waldhotel Luise from Birkenhof	-1.2583
The former Hotel Birkenhof becomes the Waldhotel Luise .	-2.0039
The house is currently under renovation and will be reopened on 1 March next year .	-4.1415
This is good news for the city .	-1.6363
After the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014 , some 30 000 overnight stays per year were lost and revenues from the spa tax were also lost .	-5.4188
In the autumn of 2014 , with dramatically increasing numbers of refugees arriving in the county , the hotel building was offered to the council as a collection accommodation , causing controversial discussions .	-5.4175
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by drawing up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .	-4.3531
The decision at the time was not uncontroversial in the municipal council .	-3.8400
However , Freudenstadt ’ s Mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and talked about serious stakeholders at that time .	-5.8719
He should be right .	-1.1746
The Luisenhotel group , headquartered in Bad Bergzabern , has bought the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to turn it into a three-star plus category hotel called Waldhotel Luise .	-5.2488
The group has four houses with the Freudenstädter Object .	-6.8157
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb .	-1.2498
They are called Hotel Luise , Luisenpark , Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise .	-1.4299
The former Hotel Birkenhof has been in front of the entrance for a long time , and when you enter the house you will see the extensive renovation work .	-6.4101
The floors were torn out , some ceilings were removed , old bathtubs were removed from the rooms .	-5.2968
The entire hotel building is a single building .	-2.4239
There is still much to be done by March .	-2.0114
" It is actually a nice hotel , " says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper .	-2.9746
Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style .	-2.3805
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers , the entrance area is redesigned and new windows are installed .	-3.6556
Everything should become " nicely close to the citizen " as Thomas Scherer puts it .	-9.3694
'We want to make a jewel out ' .	-2.2111
Swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room are available .	-4.2295
The hotel was very clean and comfortable .	-6.8900
The Waldhotel Luise , with its 60 rooms , would like to expand , explains Scherer further . . the . the the the . the the . the .	-9.0098
Both individual holidaymakers , groups or businessmen should feel comfortable at the hotel .	-8.4068
He has already held talks with OB Julian Osswald and tourist director Michael Krause , according to Scherer .	-3.4162
The ideas of the city are similar to those of the hotel group .	-7.6051
'We are on the same line ' .	-1.3210
Asked about the level of investment , Thomas Scherer does not want to be precise .	-3.7561
Nearly under one million euros , he expects .	-4.0865
External installations are also brought to the forefront , which is already clearly visible .	-4.9261
In a courtyard there is a large terrace which will be accessible by the restaurant , which is open to the public .	-5.2388
Thomas Scherer is optimistic : " Freudenstadt is a good market " .	-1.2853
Russia ’ s affair : US Special Representatives	-4.0944
In the Russian affair with US President Donald Trump , special envoy Robert Mueller is said to have set up a so-called Grand Jury after a report .	-4.8954
The panel has started work in recent weeks , wrote the " Wall Street Journal " , calling people familiar with the matter .	-5.5570
The newspaper evaluated the step as a sign that Mueller has expanded and intensified his investigation .	-3.8167
The CNN broadcaster reported that there have already been initial invitations from the panel to a meeting between Trump ’ s oldest son and a Russian lawyer .	-4.5736
US intelligence agencies have long accused the Kremlin of being targeted in the 2016 presidential election campaign .	-3.5445
Mueller examines whether there were agreements between Trump ’ s campaign team and Moscow .	-2.4167
The investigation will focus on several men acting as Republican advisors in the campaign .	-3.7379
According to reports , Mueller also increasingly looked at Trump ’ s private and business environment .	-3.5536
The Washington Post wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Counsel had put Trump at the centre personally and investigated whether the president might have hindered the judiciary as a result of the affair .	-6.2064
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine the evidence available in possible cases of crime and to decide whether charges should be brought .	-6.2022
Grand Jurys are therefore also called accusations chambers .	-3.2101
Most of them are turned on when these are major and controversial cases .	-4.3086
The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors .	-2.0404
The body can also be activated by the prosecutor to invite people to attend an oath .	-5.6829
According to the CNN broadcaster , presentations have already been issued about the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer .	-4.8505
People who participated in the meeting had been asked to make a statement , as the report says .	-9.3788
They should also provide documents .	-1.2514
Apart from Trump Jr. , Trump ’ s advisor and son-in-law , Jared Kushner , and his then campaign leader , Paul Manafort , were also present in the discussion .	-4.4466
Legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the appointment showed that Mueller did not allow himself to be intimidated in his work and that , if necessary , he wanted to act quickly .	-4.7997
But it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be activated at the end to decide on the charge .	-5.3422
Still , setting up the body is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause for concern for President Trump .	-4.2623
In the midst of the new revelations , the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portray the Russian affair as a campaign of his political opponents .	-3.2396
" Russia 's history is a total invention , " Trump said .	-2.1221
The issue gives democrats a chance to " feel good because they have nothing else they can talk about " .	-4.1365
His special adviser , Ty Cobb , stated in an opinion that he was not aware of the establishment of a Grand Jury .	-4.6253
But they usually work in secret , he emphasized .	-4.1698
The White House is in favour of any measures that accelerated the work of the special investigator in a ' fair ' way .	-4.1927
Former FBI chief James Comey said three times that he was not being identified against the president .	-3.7534
There is no reason to believe that this has changed , as the declaration continued .	-5.4943
But Mueller was only deployed after Trump fired Comey .	-2.4102
Because of this outrage , accusations against Trump had been made that he wanted to impede the judiciary .	-5.3041
Comey told a Senate Committee in June that Trump asked him to stop investigating the former national security adviser Michael Flynn .	-3.5333
The President is under great pressure for the investigation .	-2.2359
After depicting US media , the White House gathered material against the special investigator and his staff .	-4.4632
This triggered speculation about whether Trump wanted to release Mueller .	-2.9217
Unlike an independent congressional special envoy , such as the Watergate affair around later resigned President Richard Nixon , Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired by the Ministry of Justice at the request of the president .	-4.6389
Several senators from both parties want to prevent such a move .	-2.6968
Two groups of Republican and Democratic senators presented draft laws on Thursday , according to which the special investigator could no longer be dismissed so easily .	-4.3799
Antarctica ’ s Gigantic Ice Mount Drives in Antarctica	-7.3769
In the Western Antarctica , a gigantic iceberg has been removed from the Schelfeis from the size of Berlin almost seven times .	-9.5767
This was shared by the Bremerhaven Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .	-3.0145
The trillion tonne and 5800 square kilometres of colossus now drift north and will probably take two or three years to melt .	-5.9578
With a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered in the last three decades .	-3.8331
It does not pose a threat to people .	-3.2390
To what extent climate change has played a role in breaking the iceberg is unclear , according to researchers .	-3.3122
But there has been a series of unusual collapses of ice shelves in the region for about 30 years , writes the US Research Centre for Snow and Ice ( NSIDC ) in a factual background .	-5.0787
Many researchers believe that this can be linked to global warming .	-2.6479
The now broken colossus has been part of the Larsen C Schelfeis .	-4.7591
Schelfeis swims on the sea and is fed by large glaciers .	-2.6616
It therefore continues to grow into the sea and regularly breaks down .	-4.8484
The Larsen C-Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula .	-3.3371
North of this blast , the balance of growth and abortion was disturbed a few years ago .	-4.8312
AWI researcher Daniela Jansen writes that a complete shelf has collapsed there .	-5.2078
The Larsen C Schelfeis is also at risk , because the front edge has never withdrawn as far as it is now .	-6.1598
In addition , the ice plate is under tension and could disintegrate if a piece breaks down at a key point .	-5.7289
The melting of Schelfeis and Ice Mountain does not increase the sea level , as they swim on the water and ice displace as much water as they do after melting .	-6.4765
However , the loss of the barn means that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and much faster than before .	-5.6023
This may increase sea levels , but only to a small extent , writes the British research project to observe the Antarctic ( Midas ) .	-4.2720
According to AWI data of almost 50 000 square kilometres , the Larsen C shelf is the fourth largest shelf in Antarctica .	-4.8934
At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters .	-4.9117
It breaks out regularly .	-4.0411
" Although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change , the ice shield is now in a more dangerous position , " said Martin O 'Leary of the British Swansea University .	-4.9398
" This is the widest withdrawal since the beginning of the records , " he also confirmed .	-3.0056
Among scientists , it is controversial whether the Larsen C Schelfeis is going to grow again or go back in the long term and possibly collapse , his colleague Adrian Luckman said and added : ' Our models say that it will be less stable ' .	-6.6924
But this will take decades .	-2.2300
Although these researchers do not attribute the demise of this gigantic iceberg to climate change , a great many ice shelves of the Antarctic Peninsula have disappeared in recent decades .	-4.6311
This long tip of the Antarctic extends towards South America .	-2.9927
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey research programme , the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has decreased by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s .	-3.2585
The temperature increase has contributed to the decline .	-3.4171
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed up by about three degrees in the last 50 years , making it one of the areas where the temperature rises most rapidly .	-5.0355
CDU Wants Home Tariff on Personnel	-3.9923
Because it is becoming more and more difficult to fill vacant jobs , the CDU is asking to leave the employers ' association to become more attractive .	-4.8190
Just before the summer break , the Kreistag won 41 new posts in the administration .	-10.5918
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann .	-2.2513
Now 17 trainees have their first day of work .	-8.4500
The apprenticeships at the circle are obviously very desirable .	-4.2903
Around 620 applications were submitted for the seats to be awarded this year .	-4.4119
However , the circle still lacks staff to cope with the increased requirements and tasks .	-4.1872
Currently , the Mettmann circle still has 50 unoccupied positions .	-4.3753
We are looking for doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration .	-4.5732
The CDU now wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG to address the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .	-10.3455
According to the parties ' wish , the administration should " draw up a concept for recruitment and personnel development " .	-5.9738
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs of skilled workers , but to counteract the shortage of applicants in a future-oriented way .	-5.5821
The overall concept should be oriented inwards and outwards , should show concrete measures for beginners and include a training offensive , demand CDU , FDP and UWG .	-6.0484
That sounds like a good approach .	-1.6674
The circle is dealing with personnel problems that were not known before .	-5.6601
Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .	-2.7341
There is talk of genuine ' public employers ' competition .	-3.1168
In addition , there are a large number of employees who leave the service due to illness or age .	-5.0317
Hence the maximum time to act so that more jobs are not left unfilled .	-5.4910
But Klaus-Dieter Peoples , leader of the CDU , goes beyond the joint motion with his party .	-3.7016
He recently caught a bleak surprise in the circle day , when he publicly questioned the cover of staff costs and astonished the other parties .	-7.5069
Peoples want to see all the possibilities for leaving the local employers ' association reviewed .	-5.5793
" If we do not reach a satisfactory solution here in the short term , then the district administration with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the circle cities - should strive for a house tariff , " said peoples .	-7.2054
In doing so , the CDU is trying to pay employees and officials better than the public service collective bargaining .	-5.4315
The salaries are currently precisely prescribed , there are increases or more money only if you change to a higher level , which is based on professional years .	-6.7224
But the circle ’ s tasks have grown more and more over the past few years .	-4.2505
Only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up in which employees had to take care of the provisions of the new Prostitution Protection Act .	-4.6928
Not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers , Councillor Thomas Hendele and Councillor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too few staff .	-4.0550
Italy is tightening the tone of NGO migrant rescue boats .	-3.5108
Italy has warned NGOs using rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they cannot continue unless they comply with new rules for their operations .	-3.6426
" If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue to work , " said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa .	-2.9411
Minnitis Warning came a day after the Italian authorities seized a boat from the German Youth Rescue Agency , because their team had effectively cooperated with human traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration .	-4.6020
The aid organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to comment on detailed allegations by the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio .	-4.5576
" For us , the rescue of human life is and remains our top priority , so we are very sorry that we cannot currently operate in the search and rescue zone , " said the organisation in an opinion on the social media .	-4.6278
'We can only judge all the accusations that are currently being made after we have gathered all the information and can assess the situation ' .	-4.5525
The Italian authorities have been monitoring the Youth Rescue boat , the Iuventa , since October .	-3.1871
It is suspected that his crew will take tube migrants on board , delivered directly to them by human traffickers , and that the smugglers can leave so that the ships can be used again .	-5.6691
At least such a meeting was supposedly only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the Prosecutor 's Act , the content of which was published by Italian media .	-4.1820
The occupation is suspected of ignoring the authority of the Italian Coastguard , which monitors rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other motives .	-10.9000
Under the Code of Conduct , boats such as Iuventa must , above all , have an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities .	-3.4014
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue missions have agreed to abide by the code : Save the Children , MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain .	-3.1861
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be regarded as unnecessary but acceptable , because they would not entail any ' substantial changes or disabilities ' of their bailouts .	-4.7902
Among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel Prize winner is Doctors Without Borders ( MSF ) .	-2.3815
Minniti has now said that the number of migrants arriving after the rescue operations in Italy has fallen sharply in recent weeks , suggesting that efforts to strengthen Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit .	-4.0871
" In recent days we have started to see light at the end of the tunnel , " said the minister .	-2.3055
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives , and with Chad , Niger , and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in the hope of reaching Europe .	-3.2073
Riders and Trials	-1.7469
Nine Weiler bikers , the " Berlin outpost " and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the North Pfalz to enjoy trials and sights for four days .	-4.1850
Three friendly guides were available for this purpose .	-2.0392
Accommodation in the Wachenheimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .	-3.0763
The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra .	-2.4133
The first tour led to the Michael Chapel above Deidesheim at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards .	-2.8894
It was followed by viewpoints , partly on towers , from which one could look far above the Pfalzer forest and the upstream plains .	-7.2811
In between , there were repeatedly longer rises for which long trials rewarded .	-4.7057
On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and the Volksfest Wurstmarkt .	-3.9891
Again , viewpoint ran at viewpoint , connected by " flowing " trials and moderate ascents .	-4.9780
On the last two days a lot of altitude meters were announced again .	-4.8866
Caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and refuges brought welcome breaks .	-1.8725
In Bad Dürkheim the bikers breathed in the open-air inhalatory healing sole .	-3.3240
Neustadt was also headed .	-4.6314
After 173 kilometres and almost 4500 metres of altitude , the group had met the Pfalzer Forest from its best side - sporting and cultural .	-5.4560
Console Instead of Rasen - Bundesliga Equipped for E-Sport	-4.2565
Are sporting stars sitting in front of computer consoles in the future , rather than fighting over the stadium grass in wind and weather ?	-5.7962
The fact is : E-Sport has long since become a serious industry , a lucrative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge high-speed tournaments included .	-4.7515
The first Bundesliga leagues , which are increasingly involved in this area , have recognized this .	-5.9699
In 2015 , the VfL Wolfsburg started , followed by FC Schalke 04 and VfB Stuttgart , who founded an E-Sports Department in mid-July and signed two professionals for the FIFA 17 computer game .	-5.3477
" We hope to inspire new target groups for the VfB by doing so , " says Executive Board Jochen Röttgermann .	-4.8330
He is sure " that there are still many clubs up on this train " .	-5.0960
Next weekend , the FIFA World Cup in London will organise the first " Interactive Club World Cup " in which the gamers of different clubs compete against each other .	-5.6719
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint-Germain or the PSV Eindhoven qualified . the . the the . the . the . the the	-7.9879
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sports .	-1.6226
The former trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players .	-2.7171
" Real football has to deal in particular with the 14 to 30 year-olds that young people will continue to go to the stadium " , says the 52 year-old .	-5.8235
And : the clubs tried to conquer all kinds of markets , especially the Asian ones .	-3.4441
With prominent e-sportsmen under contract , you could be more present on these markets online than just sending the Bundesliga team to Asia once a year .	-4.7105
What exactly is it all about ?	-2.2609
In e-sports , computer games such as " League Of Legends " , " Dota 2 " , " Counterstrike " or just the football simulation FIFA are being fought at a competitive level .	-11.6728
As in normal sports , leagues have long established themselves in which the professionals compete against each other .	-3.9870
And in Asia games in 2022 , E-Sport is already part of the official program .	-3.3695
But is it really a sport ?	-2.5741
For many , the idea is certainly in need of getting used to .	-3.5346
Ingo Frobönose has also dealt with the question for a long time .	-4.9724
For the professor at the German Sports School in Cologne , E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions , which are also found in classical sports - for example , increased heart rate , stress reactions , hormonal changes .	-5.6207
It also needs cognitive skills , technical and tactical understanding , and rapid responsiveness .	-3.0368
Professional gamers should train not only at the console , but also their body and pay attention to nutrition .	-7.7164
'Fitte player is a good player ' .	-2.9485
Frobile also sees problems : " Doping is becoming more and more a topic " .	-4.2498
Controls are difficult to implement in online games , and in the scene the structures of classical sport were lacking .	-4.9092
On a positive note , the scientist emphasizes the high integrative effect of e-sport .	-4.2219
The players are on the international road , like a large global family , and there are no intercultural barriers .	-9.6478
A study by the Deloitte Corporate Consultancy and the Federal Interactive Entertainment Software ( BIU ) predicts rapid growth in e-sports .	-10.4253
In 2016 , it had implemented EUR 50 million in Germany , mainly through advertising , sponsorship and large tournaments .	-4.9271
In three years , sales will be 130 million .	-2.7480
This is little against the EUR 2.4 billion of the Football Bundesliga .	-3.7676
However , the E-Sport " no longer far from other established sports such as handball , basketball or ice hockey " , writes the Deloitte consultants .	-4.7773
Many countries are already international .	-3.0236
Large markets are Asia and the USA , where ex-basketball players Shaquille O<unk>Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez participate in the US Team NRG eSports .	-3.0506
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSports betting provider Unikrn .	-2.6136
There is also a lot to be done in Europe .	-3.6047
In a Norwegian school , e-sport was introduced as a subject of teaching , says Froböse .	-9.5428
According to Dutt , in the Netherlands and France , the first league football clubs are now obliged to set up an e-sports department .	-4.4294
" Germany is lagging behind in European comparison , " explains VfB board Röttgermann .	-3.6544
It is no longer enough to fall into nostalgia and to clarify the old times .	-5.0244
It is a matter of preserving the tradition of the association , but at the same time aligning the company with the modern market .	-4.4129
" We live in a digitized world , " says Dutt .	-2.0328
'One cannot insist that only in football everything remains as it always was ' .	-5.8014

The poisonous eggs scandal now affects almost all federal states .	-3.4341
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord have reacted and have removed all eggs from the sale throughout Germany .	-3.8013

Michelle Carter condemns the texts that push Conrad Roy to suicide .	-3.0466
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend to commit suicide through texts and calls .	-2.9094
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars , and five years have been suspended on trial .	-3.5175
Carter was sentenced in June for negligent killing of Conrad Roy , who died on 13 July 2014 .	-2.4143
The father of Roy said at the hearing on Thursday : ' My family is untrustworthy .	-3.3497
My son was my best friend . '	-1.1111
Carter was allowed to remain free until the appeal .	-3.2677
She had been faced with a maximum sentence of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered a mental illness .	-3.7781
dressed in red pants and a cream blouse , Carter stood with tears in her eyes , with folded hands and downward eyes when she was convicted .	-5.2759
" Their actions have killed Conrad Roy , " the prosecutor said to the court .	-2.6784
" She finished his life to make her own better .	-2.2650
She has taken no responsibility , " she said .	-2.7649
'She has shown no repentance ' .	-2.6992
But Carter 's lawyer said it was a ' terrible circumstance that she completely regrets ' .	-3.8226
Judge Lawrence Moniz , however , said that he did not find that her " age or maturity , or even her mental illness , have a significant impact on her actions " .	-3.9292
A public prosecutor read a statement by Roy 's mother Lynn Roy , who said that " there is no day when I do not mourn the loss of my beloved son .	-3.6021
I would like him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything , and I try to his sisters , despite all the pains we will with for et" .	-6.8155
Roy 's sister , Camdyn Roy , said that she would be " persecuted " by the realization that she would never attend her brother 's wedding or be an aunt to his children .	-3.9082
" Not having this only person with whom I have been together every day since my birth is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , " she said .	-4.4834
The case seems to set a legal precedent , because there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide .	-2.7764
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014 .	-2.5495
The case attracted national attention after Carter ’ s text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life .	-2.9566
" Hand up , jump from a building , smile yourself , I do not know there are many ways , " she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on holiday with his family .	-5.3524
In the moments before his suicide , she wrote : ' You have to do it , Conrad ' and ' All you have to do is turn the generator on and you will be free and happy ' .	-3.6790
Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention by the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from the case by any press .	-2.9117
The case has shared the legal opinion .	-2.1356
Among the few who defended Carter were Amanda Knox , who was sentenced in 2007 for murders of her British fellow daughter in Italy before being acquitted two years ago .	-4.4991
Mrs Knox , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : ' Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not prison ' .	-2.7556
Joshua Kimmich : Learning from the FC Bavaria ’ s new mini-lamb	-3.3115
It is no coincidence that Joshua Kimmich was allowed to run as a captain at the Audi Cup .	-3.8944
The FC Bayern dares to the Confed Cup winner a big season - extra motivation doesn 't hurt .	-11.7894
Something else was different on his seat in the cabin , which saw Joshua Kimmich immediately , even though the extra piece of clothing was very , very small .	-4.3924
But since far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup , of course , no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel Neuer was to be seen , he stopped the bond assigned to him .	-6.0089
" The coach did not announce it , " said the Confed Cup winner afterwards , after his first assignment as a Bavarian captain .	-4.5750
Well , it could have been better than at 0 : 2 against the SSC Naples .	-4.7576
But the sign of the coach could also interpret Kimmich like this .	-3.9776
Not the eight years old Arturo Vidal had been chosen as a player in the C-Elf , consisting of junior players , debutants and professionals who just came out of the holiday , but he .	-7.5108
Sugar is preferably distributed to those who are much trusted to keep their mood .	-6.4575
So those who have been selected to enter the legacy of lame can only use a small extra motivation .	-5.3597
Kimmich confirmed : " This is what you want as a player to take responsibility " .	-3.3149
On Wednesday the 22-year-old flitted over the field as a mini-lamb .	-3.1215
To the right , that is his position , the white tie on the arm did the rest .	-5.0989
And Kimmich at all worked like the one who could take the rower in his hand .	-7.9264
He gave instructions , tried to steer the unheard force .	-3.9539
He looked at the whole while many others were concerned with himself .	-5.1286
Vidal was able to overplay his lack of fitness ( barely worked ) ; Renato Sanches was able to rely on the achievements of the Asia-Travel ( only to a limited extent ) ; and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle not to be negatively noticed in their first appearance in the Bavarian Tricot .	-10.1593
That , after all , worked very .	-3.7146
Sule ran alongside Kimmich , Rudy before the defense , both acting sovereign .	-3.2491
The namesake of Napoli Storm was often difficult , and Süle also tried to build a few times successfully .	-8.0438
His colleague Rudy admitted that the result was ' not as we hoped for it ' .	-3.2105
But he also performed well in the debut .	-3.6959
Play relocation , Tempowechsel : " For this style I was also brought " .	-5.6776
How unusual this Bavarian world is for the new entrants was seen after the match .	-5.2248
Rudy , for example , did not give one or two interviews in the catacombs , but determined six or seven interviews . . the , , , the , , , the , , , the , , , , ,	-9.6911
Kimmich passed away after a few crisp statements in the back of his new players .	-6.0313
There he heard an interesting sentence from Süle : " What is going on here I have already noticed .	-3.8707
You just have to win every game at Bavaria " .	-3.3810
After all , he no longer has to teach the new .	-2.9121
Alaba motivates <unk>FB ladies	-2.4630
David Alaba believes in the success of our <unk>FB ladies .	-1.8030
Austria ’ s most famous soccer player talked about Twitter shortly before the match and wished the OFB ladies all the best .	-5.6439
The Bavarian Legionary is almost a club colleague from <unk>FB captain Schnaderbeck and is involved with our ladys .	-6.0892
The tweet of the Austrian football player of the year and Champions League winner should be a special motivation injection .	-3.6243
Our ladies might also need the famous Bavarian Dusel .	-3.8418
Companies satisfied with Rhineland-Palatinate Minister : Economy praises Wissings ’ pace	-3.8338
It was often inconceivable that the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when Eveline Lemke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economics of Rheinland-Pfalz .	-3.8145
This is apparent after more than a year when the new Minister for Economic Affairs , Volker Wissing ( FDP ) , is in office .	-3.3470
Kammers and companies from the region speak of a change in economic policy at T V request - and at the same time blame the old minister .	-5.8928
Frank Natus , Chairman of the Association of Trier Enterprises ( VTU ) , says : " Wissing takes up the wishes of the economy that Lemke has all blocked " .	-4.0998
Natus sees the greatest reversal in infrastructure policy : the gap between Kelberg and Adenau is now high on the country ’ s list of priorities .	-4.1810
This year , the Ministry hopes for a planning procedure , and by 2021 the construction law will stand .	-6.0200
The Trier Western circumvention , which is in the primary need of the Federal Transport Plan , also plays a role in the country ’ s plans .	-10.4601
The aim is to launch the route in December 2020 , says Minister Cornelia Holtmann .	-4.2474
Natus sees this as a guide to supporting regional but internationally competing companies .	-3.6790
The Chamber of Industry and Commerce ( IHK ) Trier , as Wissing suggested , seeks a Rhineland Palatinate label for wine in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports that have lacked for ten years .	-6.2189
Furthermore , Wissing has an open ear for people who want to start their own company , praises the IHK .	-9.1711
The Trier Chamber of Trade sees in the new Master Bonus an additional incentive for young trainees , says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach .	-3.6390
A premium of 1000 euros for the existing master exam and 2500 euros is planned if graduates become independent within ten years of the master training .	-7.0867
But the country ’ s homework list remains long .	-2.4811
In the planned road construction , the country lacks the necessary staff , says Jan Glockauer , Chief Executive Officer of the IHK Trier .	-5.5703
Of 56 new engineers wishing to stop mobility in the country , only 29 jobs have been filled .	-6.1698
The IHK calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices .	-3.5137
CDU Group vize Christian Baldauf points to calculations by the Court of Auditors that the country invests more than EUR 20 million less in the conservation of national roads than proposed in 2017 and 2018 .	-4.7572
Frank Natus also expects a concept of the country to address the region ’ s shortage of skilled workers .	-3.7045
It is also disappointing to have broadband in the country so far .	-5.7149
In 2016 , regional companies had only evaluated the power supply in an IHK survey with note 3.4 .	-4.6364
They complained about stalling Internet connections and breakdowns .	-3.3792
Ex-Minister of Economics , Eveline Lemke , is currently out of politics and is still in the supervisory board of the wind turbine Pro Wind .	-4.1529
The Green Group left Lemke in April to become President of a private college in Karlsruhe , where , after four months of disagreement , she had already cleared the field again .	-5.0923
Audi is supposed to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a backlash .	-2.5145
One day before the Audi announcement , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles .	-3.0094
The BMW Chairman said that the company believes that ' there are smarter options than driving restrictions ' , and thus referred to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - to prohibit or restrict diesel vehicles .	-4.7724
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .	-2.3754
None of the companies described the undertakings as a recall .	-2.7967
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions rules .	-3.3070
But nitrogen oxides emitting diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma .	-1.8525
The cost of car manufacturers to install plants to neutralize diesel exhaust gases is also increasing , making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .	-4.8024
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also being charged with confusing the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem .	-2.5750
Businesses are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so-called switch-off devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the rules when a car has been tested , but go back in normal driving conditions .	-6.2845
In the United States , several Volkswagen employees have been charged , and others are investigated on both sides of the Atlantic .	-3.5976
Last month , the former Head of Thermodynamics was arrested in Audi ’ s engine development in Germany .	-2.5340
The former manager , Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition , and could be brought to justice in the United States .	-8.3806
Earlier this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen , after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to bypass emissions regulations in Europe , and a question focused on the United States was extended .	-4.2392
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could be difficult for Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to the profit of Volkswagen .	-3.7229
This message is the raft on the Isar Saturday	-4.0745
The city wants to protect the Isar .	-1.5723
For the Isar visitors to take part , a raft through Munich will take place tomorrow , Saturday , with a special message .	-6.2031
Anyone who moves to the Isar on Saturday will see a big raft between Flaucher and Reichenbachbrücke .	-4.7680
And this is not a common raft , with Isar tourists .	-2.3074
The building consultant wants to enlighten .	-6.3899
On the raft you can see a large infotransparent .	-4.0818
It shows a rubbish mountain .	-2.1359
The start of a public relations campaign to appeal to the Isar visitors .	-3.1123
With the motto " True love is ... " the understanding of the Isar is to sharpen as a protective wild river .	-5.0852
The raft crossed the Isar last summer and this year , too , there are other actions and measures to achieve cautious and environmentally conscious behavior .	-5.8228
Mordillos Knollennosen and Laughing Against suffering	-4.0663
Mordillo was at times one of the most published cartoon drawers , the noses of his figures are his trademark .	-5.1933
Even with 85 the Argentine still draws and works on a film .	-3.5463
His message : laugh , ' because there is too much suffering in the world ' .	-1.7969
Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .	-2.0631
In the early years as an artist , he was among others a painter of congratulations - which frustrated him .	-6.9732
" The happiest day in my professional life was the day when lost in my job , " he once said .	-2.4924
After stopping in Lima , New York and Paris , he achieved a breakthrough in the late 1960s : with the publication of his cartoons in " Paris Match " and then in " Star " and other leading magazines around the world .	-5.0823
Even in China , Mordillo found many fans .	-1.1113
Again and again , the artist was inspired by cities .	-7.7142
Large , roundabout Mordillo figures roam in drawings with the slate tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .	-4.6196
In the early morning , according to his own data , he is still sitting at the drawing table , working almost ten hours a day .	-5.5265
His slender figures continue to be widely spread around the world via calendars , puzzles , books for young and old , t-shirts , loose animals and watches .	-11.4398
For six years he has also worked on a cartoon film and a TV series with his characters .	-3.5687
The main character in the film " Crazy Island " is a giraffe - Mordillo 's most popular animal in his drawings - who has a thousand feet of opponent .	-3.7021
For the first time , his figures speak in the 3D film , which is due to be released in 2019 .	-5.0119
" I don 't know exactly what they will say , it 's strange for me , " says Mordillo .	-2.0502
The script is not written by him .	-1.8218
This is why he prefers to use the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced wordlessly .	-5.1574
Lavender of Provence Threatens Climate Change	-2.7359
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .	-2.0162
Lavender is declining because of the conditions of drought and insects transmitted by disease , causing major headaches to scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions .	-5.4239
Eric Chaisse , expert of the CRIEPPAM agricultural research institute in Provence , said : " The lavender in Provence is effectively at risk because the plant has been exposed in recent years to the effects of climate change , which caused much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn .	-5.2368
This has an impact on the lifetime of lavender . the .	-7.5407
There is also a small cicade , a microbacterium that transmits dwarf cicades , and in very dry weather there are many of them . '	-3.9779
And the stakes are high .	-1.7783
Lavender oil not only attracts tourists , it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics .	-3.8951
Eric Chaisse said : " Instead of having very long plant ear with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , underdeveloped and either missing or weakened .	-2.6426
So we have fewer parts with essential oil . '	-1.8995
The solutions that are being considered include better water distribution and decreasing evaporation from the ground , but also spraying plants with a protective mix of sound and water and developing varieties that are more resistant to dryness .	-5.2608
The town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhön celebrates its 1200th anniversary this year .	-3.2436
The highlight is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival .	-3.6632

The assassination of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico .	-7.6922
The workers of the Riodoce weekly usually meet on Wednesday to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in Sinaloa by organised crime , corrupt officials , and perpetual drug wars .	-4.8111
But on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .	-2.3504
They were told that it is important to change their routines .	-2.1273
Two senior journalists discuss what is more secure : they should take their children into the office , who were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009 , or leave them at home .	-5.2307
Security experts have written three words on a board at the front of the room : opponents , neutrals , allies .	-2.7976
You ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary , perceptions and abdominal feelings are sufficient .	-4.1837
There are drug smugglers , politicians , businessmen , journalists suspected of being on the pay list of the government or cartels , a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .	-3.3670
There is no break from violence , and while corpses are growing throughout the country , there have been more and more journalists : at least 25 , since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012 . 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats , and so far there have been at least seven deaths in seven states this year .	-5.5710
Among the latter is her editor and inspiration by Riodoce , co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas .	-3.0762
" The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , " Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs .	-2.9143
His absence is deeply felt , although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez showing his middle finger with the word " justice " hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building .	-16.4769
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the reporters discuss their shared themes , the trauma , their nightmares , insomnia , paranoia .	-7.0315
Although a special attorney was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists , according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists , it has only initiated two criminal proceedings .	-8.7436
As with most of the thousands of murders committed every year by drug trafficking and organised crime , journalists ' murderers are rarely brought to justice .	-4.6717
At Riodoce , they are still insisting on treating the violence of Sinaloa , although they are untrustworthy and even though the terrain is now even more treacherous .	-4.9150
Without information about the murderers , without justice , the meeting to discuss security has little benefit , Ibarra says .	-3.3617
" It 's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , " he says .	-1.8930
'Until we know why , we distrust everyone ' .	-3.2525
In the morning of May 15 , Valdez left the Riodoce newspaper office in the capital of Culiacan .	-3.2171
He only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men .	-4.6603
The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .	-2.5922
Valdez was 50 years old .	-0.9024
He left a woman and two adult children .	-1.1997
Rumors tend to fly around freely in Culiacan .	-1.8666
But on the subject of Valdez , there is practically nothing but silence .	-2.7838
Since Guzman ’ s arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January , Sinaloa has become one of the country ’ s bloodiest battlefields , as rival factions are fighting here to fill the vacuum .	-3.2612
It is not clear that in Sinaloa every day someone or more people are shot on the streets or that the cemetery is full of decorated two-storey mausoleums for drug kings who are larger than many homes for the living .	-6.3735
Forget for one minute that there is a state of ' calm ' when only one cartel has control over the coastal state with its precious ports and drug trading routes to the United States .	-4.3418
Despite this , and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work , Ismail Bojorquez ( 60 ) , a co-founder and director of Riodoce , is blamed for not being able to protect his friend .	-3.8357
He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder .	-1.3301
First , in February , there was an interview with Damaso Lopez , a leader of one of the rival cartel factions in the war with Guzman ’ s sons .	-3.7603
This publication may have annoyed the sons , suspected gang members bought each copy of the issue once it was delivered to newspaper kiosks .	-3.8028
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own security after the confiscation of another newspaper that published the same story .	-3.3659
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .	-2.2358
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there .	-2.4055
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 , when he joined five colleagues for the creation of Riodoce and sold USD 50 investments .	-5.4990
In Sinaloa , " it was impossible to carry out journalism without encountering the problem of drugs , " said Bojorquez .	-2.4804
Over time , the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .	-2.7637
Reporters loved to be able to publish tough investigations without fear of censorship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to treat .	-4.4159
Eight years after Riodoce was founded , she received the prestigious " Maria-Moors-Cabot Prize " for her coverage in Latin America .	-9.4354
In the same year , Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in persecuting Mexican drug history wherever it led .	-4.3576
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid .	-0.9096
" I want to continue , " he said at the time of the CPJ award .	-2.5348
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa " is a way of life " , he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV .	-1.9751
" You have to take on the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the stupid . .	-4.9077
I do not want to be asked : ' What did you do in the face of so many dead ... why did you not say what was going on ? '	-3.4247
The Riodoce team misses Valdez , the bird of fun that could curse like a dock worker , the friend who was generous with hugs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .	-3.6811
They relied on his routine .	-1.8923
He would always bear his hat .	-1.7670
He would always go to El Guayabo , the bar opposite the office , and always sit at the same table there .	-2.6447
Now they ask : Was his love of routine his spoil ?	-2.7067
His death has also forced her to question her own assumptions about how best to do her job and stay alive .	-4.2907
" You don 't like it if you are dealing with their women , their children , their clean shops , their secret runways " to move drugs .	-5.0409
" These things were not allowed , " said Bojorquez .	-1.5014
The result , even in the best times , is a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation .	-2.1759
Trust his own instincts .	-1.1752
If it smells wrong , stay away .	-1.7734
The anger is , the editor of Riodoce Andres Villarreal said , ' smell a sense that can be deceived ... and then the matter happened with Javier . '	-3.7602
The old rules , as he and others say , no longer apply in Sinaloa , just as in Tamaulipas , Veracruz , Guerrero , and other states where a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes , weak institutions , and corrupt government officials is at home .	-3.4972
The landscape is constantly changing .	-1.1601
In the space in which Riodoce ’ s staff met for security training , no mobile phones were suddenly allowed , and days before it became known that spyware sold exclusively to governments was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .	-5.5166
Outside , two policemen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 <unk> C ) in the shadow of a tree .	-2.5805
They were commissioned by the state government to protect the Riodoce offices in a four-storey building in a middle class district of Culiacan .	-3.7013
Half joke , some of the reporters wondered if these officers were among the 50 % of the policemen who the governor himself described as untrustworthy .	-10.8635
It has been months since the reporters entered the mountain landscape , where the drug gangs are de facto under control .	-3.5839
For this week 's edition , Riodoce has clicked on three main stories .	-4.0759
There was the assassination of the brother of the former well-known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa .	-2.5175
They also had an exposé on government spending , which focused on the governor ’ s home city .	-3.3545
And there was a group that kidnapped in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan , a block away from the prosecutor 's office .	-10.2419
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened , so caution was required when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite place for drug dealers and authorities .	-4.1869
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the governing Institutional Revolution Party ( PRI ) , which dominated all political levels almost the whole century .	-3.9367
Recently , several PRI governors were accused of top-class corruption cases .	-2.3599
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant , including one in which a son of " El Chapo " Guzman escaped a military attack .	-3.1160
Only a few months earlier , readers would have seen Valdez ’ s column as the best informed source of abduction .	-3.8601
" In the past we would have known what happened , " said Villarreal , 46 , with the nickname " El Flaco " because of his lean body stature .	-3.9309
'Now all channels of communication with our sources have broken . '	-2.2969
The Valdez office has been transformed into a storage room for signs and stickers protesting against the murders of journalists , because the staff have become something they would never have expected : activists on behalf of the press .	-5.2050
Reporter Miriam Ramirez drew a few signs and went to a demonstration the next morning for another journalist to the office of the prosecutor .	-3.7288
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan .	-1.7336
A burned body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests that it is his .	-2.3699
Throughout the country , journalists have become more vocal by writing " SOS Press " on walks and buildings in organized protests .	-3.9047
On that day , the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and is trying to gather international support for justice in the Valdez case .	-4.1588
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after the assassination of Valdez , Ramirez accused the authorities of spying out journalists and letting them die because they said the truth .	-3.7297
She has since asked for it to be re-divided by the government because it is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity .	-4.7864
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were " surrounded " by organised crime , government officials involved and an indifferent society .	-3.0842
In his last book , " Narco Journalism , " he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs , but also by orders from politicians and security forces , who were under a blanket with organised crime .	-5.6312
Last year , the media guard group " Articulo 19 " assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists to the police and officials .	-3.6938
" In Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth , " said Ramirez .	-2.0742
Obviously , the killings have a deterrent effect .	-2.0752
No one forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago .	-2.5513
Your body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel : ' I am here for my reports ' .	-3.4628
A computer keyboard and headphones lay next to their separate head .	-2.3356
Some branches have chosen to close , as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the assassination of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March .	-2.9196
Others continue , as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the murder of her director in 2004 .	-2.6165
In 2010 , the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with a headline article on the front page entitled ' What do you want from us ? '	-4.2732
Some journalists have fled their home countries , or even the country .	-3.2586
It is a painful decision .	-0.8656
It is difficult to find work in exile , and they are still watching the streets and looking for dangers .	-2.6483
And sometimes they are hunted , as evidently the photographer Ruben Espinosa , who was murdered in 2015 , together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the flight from Veracruz .	-3.9783
For those who stay behind and continue work , it is a daily dance with risky decisions .	-3.1772
Ibarra , who once wanted to be a poet , admits that drug trafficking is frightening him .	-2.7111
" Mexico goes to hell , and therefore I became a reporter , " he said .	-2.3761
At midnight last Friday , when the last issue was finished , the editors of Riodoce sat on the pavement in front of the office and drank beer when all their phones started to sum up .	-5.2645
A number of shootings with rivals and security forces near the seaside resort of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead .	-3.3840
The war continued to escalate , as promised by a series of cartel messages in the region .	-2.7825
From the brick edges they published the news on the website of Riodoce on mobile phones .	-4.9218
The front page had to be changed the next day .	-1.6591
Sirens howled up nearby - another shooter in the area .	-4.2390
Bojorquez threw a glance at the policemen who kept guard to see if they were ready .	-3.4312
If they were afraid at all , they did not show it .	-2.7627
Under the enormous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle-finger was visible to the whole of Sinaloa , the Riodoce staff followed his footsteps .	-4.6303
'How can you think of closing it , ' said Bojorquez , ' when , on the same day that Javier was murdered , the intern asked me to send her to the streets for reporting ' .	-4.9800
Dinosaur used camouflage to evade his enemies .	-2.6878
At first glance , it looks like a statue , albeit a frightening one .	-2.2541
Researchers have now found that the first findings of a Canadian miner 's incredible nashorn were so well received that experts described it as " Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs " .	-5.6181
It was so well received that they could even find that his scalp skin was of reddish brown - and they said it had had something of a " troubled past " .	-5.0576
The report in the magazine " Current Biology " called it " the best preserved armored dinosaur ever found , and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world " .	-3.7919
The fossil is a newly discovered type of nodosaurian who lived between 110 million and 112 million years ago in the middle of the circle .	-3.9044
Its unbelievably well-preserved state has astonished researchers who describe it as " truly remarkable " .	-3.5026
According to reports in National Geographic , armored vegetable eating is the best preserved fossil of its kind .	-3.6993
It was found by Shawn Funk when he died on March 21 , 2011 at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta , Canada .	-2.8882
He met something that seemed misplaced by the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely .	-4.2102
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology .	-2.0558
They spent the next six years exposing the wild animal within the 2,500 pound ( 1,100 kg ) heavy earth clump .	-3.7341
After all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .	-1.9365
" If you blink a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it has slept , " said the main author Caleb Brown , scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum , where the creature is to be seen .	-4.1672
'It will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs . '	-3.5684
Researchers have found that , although this plant eater is covered with armor and resembles a changing tank , it was probably threatened by meat eating dinosaurs .	-4.7443
The heavily armored dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators , and used a shielding technique known as countershade , which is also used by many modern animals .	-4.7041
This would have allowed him to blend better into his environment and evade his enemies , experts say , suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs .	-5.2303
The 110 million year-old Nodosaurian family creature made headlines for the first time in May and is now visible in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology .	-4.0005
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell , one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours discovering it carefully .	-3.1886
The astonishing preservation of the copy allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armor over his body .	-4.4968
They discovered the contrast shade , a common defense method in the animal kingdom , meaning that the top of the creature was darker than its bottom .	-9.3284
Although contrasting is common , the results are surprising , as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of the animals living today .	-4.2276
It suggests that the dinosaur was driven by enough pressure from meat eating dinosaurs , that evolution favored the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival .	-3.6819
But most contemporary animals using counter-shade - think of deer , zebras , or belt animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey , which signals that this nodosaur was subjected to a real struggle for survival .	-5.1302
" Strong predator behaviour on a massive , heavily armored dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaur predators must have been at the circle time , " said Brown .	-4.7672
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was red brown .	-2.1957
Scientists continue to study the animal for references to his life , including his conserved intestinal content , to find out what it eaten as his last meal .	-3.9168
They believe that the dinosaur , when he died , came into a river and was driven out into the sea , where he sank on his back to the seabed .	-5.1237
At that time , Alberta was as warm as South Florida today , and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland than they are today .	-3.6572
" This nodosaurian is truly remarkable because it is fully covered with preserved scalp skin , but also remains in three dimensions and retains the original form of the animal , " said Brown .	-4.7836
" The result is that today the animal looks almost the same as in the early circle period .	-4.5789
You don 't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it , and if you slide a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it is sleeping . '	-5.8933
The circle time was a time when huge theropods , carnivorous dinosaurs , which stood on two legs , crossed the earth .	-5.4176
Although the king of them , the Tyrannosaurus Rex , lived millions of years after Borealopelta , the armored dinosaur was driven by some of his terrifying ancestors .	-3.1730
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus , a 38 feet ( 11.5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monster .	-3.5844
The scientists , whose latest findings appear in the Current Biology journal , believe that Borealopelta was sink into the sea after death and mumified in the mud .	-11.5092
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he died on March 21 , 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta , Canada .	-2.9462
According to the museum , it is the best preserved armoured dinosaur in the world , including skin and armor , and is complete from the snout to the hip .	-8.8817
The creatures were on average 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,300 kg ) .	-3.1466
It contained two 20-inch long tips that ran from its shoulders .	-5.4997
Researchers believe that armored vegetable eating was swept through Western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea .	-4.2832
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur preserved its armor in exquisite detail .	-3.1457
The petrified remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the remnants of the skin still cover bumpy tank plates along the dinosaur .	-4.4653
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic , such a level of conservation is as rare as a profit in the Lotto .	-3.3914
The more I see it , the more confusing it becomes .	-1.6200
Petrified remnants of the skin still cover the bumpy tank plates that wear the skull of the animal .	-4.7377
His right forefoot is on his side , his five fingers are spread upwards .	-3.8862
I can count the scales on his sole ' .	-2.2244
In the Storm : Mass Carambolage on A8 : Many Injur	-3.3380
Happy accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : barely 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carambolage .	-5.1755
There are many injured , kilometer-long congestion and gaps .	-3.4493
On the motorway Stuttgart-München ( A8 ) some 20 people were injured in a mass carambolage at late Thursday afternoon .	-4.1121
According to the police , almost 30 vehicles were interconnected during a thunderstorm , including probably trucks .	-5.7236
The exact number of injured persons had not been given any information at first .	-4.6168
It is light to medium injuries , said a police officer .	-4.3687
A large number of rescue vehicles were at the accident site .	-4.0707
The A8 was completely locked in the direction of Munich .	-2.7882
In the direction of Munich , a ten-kilometre backlog was formed .	-6.0191
As an AZ reporter reports , there were also massive disabilities on the counterpart - through numerous gaps .	-6.1527
The fire brigade noted the characteristics of the vehicle steers , who now face severe penalties .	-6.3274
Shortly after 18 : 45 a second accident took place on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and Dasing .	-3.6446
There was a collision between a car transporter and a car .	-2.9225
A rescue helicopter was on the road to the accident site .	-3.2370
Deutsche Bahn : Group tests " Comfort Check-in "	-2.0707
It is a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced : nobody is suspicious of sitting in the train and sleeping .	-6.0340
Or one is deepened in his work and has just a brilliant thought .	-3.5062
And then : pufff .	-1.0692
Come and wake up a gentle or tear the passenger out of the workflow .	-5.9354
Ticket control .	-1.9147
But the times of interruption are soon over .	-2.8090
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the impairless ticket control .	-4.2464
You simply confirm by mobile phone that you take your seat and thereby devalue the ticket .	-4.8010
Currently a test operation runs on two tracks .	-3.3547
" If the offer comes up , we expand it .	-3.9597
It will probably be available at the beginning of next year on many other long-distance routes in Germany , " said a railway speaker .	-4.2296
" Comfort Check-in " calls the train the ticket depreciation without a driver .	-5.1028
In order to be able to use them , however , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or a tablet .	-5.2060
And you have to book an online ticket - what most passengers already do .	-3.9948
You also have to buy the DB Navigator via the app of the train , which is the most convenient way to book a ticket . the the , , the , , , , , , , , the , , the , , , the ,	-14.0666
Last but not least , a seat reservation is required .	-3.4983
The " Comfort Check-in " works like this : you get into the train , call your ticket under " My Tickets " .	-4.8515
The test customers will then receive a button for electronic devaluation .	-4.0946
The cabin crew will receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and has taken the booked seat Y .	-5.7232
If the train attendant arrives at number Y during the ticket control , he knows that there is a passenger with an already invaluable online-ticket there .	-12.9309
So we can sleep , continue working and remain silent .	-4.3933
The " check-in " has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should benefit passengers .	-4.3350
" If you want to travel without ticket control by our train accompanying staff , simply check in at the DB Navigator .	-5.5339
This allows passengers to personalise their travel time by train , " says Michael Peterson , Marketing Board of DB Fernverkehr .	-4.2840
Second plus : " And our employees have more time than they are today to respond to individual customer needs " .	-4.0872
Those who often travel by train know that besides delays and missed trains , ticket controls are one of the most annoying things .	-12.4391
Because you often do not have all the documents you need to devalue your online-tickets .	-7.0844
Either the credit card or identity card is missing or a document you need to present .	-5.1982
The result is endless discussions between train attendants and passengers , resulting in poor mood in the section or in large areas and delays in checking their own ticket and ultimately taking the time for the crew to take care of other concerns .	-8.3663
Only a small number of test customers can still use the new service .	-2.1974
And this also only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen .	-2.9649
Other train numbers on the same track are not yet unlocked .	-3.2679
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question : Who Streets ?	-2.7925
On 9 August 2014 , Brittany Ferrell was shocked to its core .	-2.2811
Just one day after she arrived in New York City , the born in St. Louis sat on the bed of an Airbnb apartment that she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone .	-9.2372
She stumbled over a post from someone from the High School .	-1.9815
" The police have just killed an 18-year-old child , and it is still on the streets , " it said .	-3.7710
Confused because nobody else posted the information on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .	-3.1112
A user with the handle <unk> TheePharoah was constantly retweetet on her timeline .	-3.2783
The rapper from the area of St. Louis was in the process of tweaking live the death of Michael Brown , an unarmed black 18-year-old killed by a white police officer in Ferguson , Mo .	-4.2825
He posted a picture of Browns lifeless body that was stretched out on the street and would stay there four hours .	-3.5959
" That 's wild , " Ferrell thought .	-2.8148
But death was nothing new for them and their community .	-1.5833
She left her cell phone to return to tweets on people on the Canfield Drive later in the evening .	-4.9516
There were photos of the police band and people who shouted , and of a man who claimed to be Brown 's father , who carried a sign with the signature : ' Ferguson 's police just killed my unarmed son ! '	-4.9708
She observed a live feed in which a policeman stood in front of a group of protesters with a belling dog .	-10.2705
In another video , she said , another policeman secured his gun and cried : ' I will kill you ... animals all ' .	-4.2049
" This is not usual , " Ferrell recalled her statement .	-3.4177
'This is not the kind of murder we have accustomed to and we can call it ' .	-3.9342
At this moment I felt shaking frost .	-2.4974
I was angry and crying . '	-1.8846
She booked a return flight and went home the next day .	-1.9647
After landing at 11 p.m. , she picked up her six-year-old daughter from her father ’ s home and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning .	-4.3752
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the following three years is the theme of a new documentary , " Who Streets ? " , in cinemas from 11 .	-3.9772
It is a history of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resilience that exists from the point of view of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers .	-4.0492
When Ferrell and her daughter , wearing a flower dress and a matching crown , drove to Ferguson , the two discussed a conversation that they had » about the black experience and the black state <unk> countless times before this morning .	-5.7263
" You remember how I taught you when black people must fight for what they believe ? " she remembered what she said .	-3.5052
" We are now going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that was not right .	-3.0528
I could not take them with me , " said Ferrell later .	-2.7290
" What happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .	-2.1840
She must know it and see it and be raised in it .	-3.3154
It must be well developed , not only activism and organisation , but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution , and what we need to do to become free to liberate ourselves .	-4.3100
Although I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience blatant racism , she is no different from the next black female child .	-4.7651
I have the feeling that I would be doing her a bad service to keep her away from it ' .	-9.3036
The first station when they arrived in Ferguson was at the South Florissant Road , a place in front of the police authority , which became a campground when the activists waited for the possible non-prosecution of Officer Darren Wilson .	-4.9736
There Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch .	-3.4051
They prepared bags and helped pass them on to demonstrators .	-2.2373
A new type of activism for Ferrell began to take shape .	-2.2474
" My activism changed completely after 9 August , " she said and noticed that as a student at the University of Missouri-St . Louis was President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on Essen justice and health inequalities in black communities .	-4.2336
" I had no experience organizing .	-1.8216
Everything has come . '	-1.8998
Weeks later , during an evening demonstration , Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan , one of the co-directors of the film .	-2.6760
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar only wanted to " document " what happened .	-2.3958
One question came to mind by Ferrell : ' Do you want to document or try to find a story you can exploit ? '	-3.6836
This scepticism was fed by countless cases of people , often white - in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience .	-3.6994
As Folayan said in an interview recently : ' We had heard that people born and raised in Ferguson have not centred their voices and we wanted to do it differently ' .	-4.4069
Folayan had already worked with the then co-director Damon Davis , an artist from the field known for his activism around death tract passengers .	-3.9440
His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project , together with six other locals , followed the team of " Who Streets ? " in the years following Brown 's shooting .	-4.5493
" This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us .	-3.3743
'That was the main thing for me , how these people are presented , because that is how I will be presented ' .	-5.2578
The aim was not to focus on Ferrell 's experience - to show that the movement " is not a Messiah leader , but a community that meets , " said Folayan - she proved to be the most open participant of the film .	-4.2835
As a result , documents from " Who Streets ? " surprisingly show personal aspects of Ferrell 's life as she falls in love and marries her wife .	-3.8122
" I felt like naked , " Ferrell said and laughed when she first saw the finished product .	-2.2708
'But I have understood that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanisation of black people . '	-3.8282
In addition , Ferrell ’ s story repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement .	-2.6267
Two of the three founders of the movement who , following the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 , have marked the film " BlacklivesMatter " in social media , identify themselves as gay .	-3.4307
" Black , gay women in leadership positions have supported the movement as a whole , " Ferrell said , " and therefore we are constantly fighting on various fronts .	-4.4727
Black , gay women must bear the brunt of everything . '	-1.8316
Folayan agreed to note that ' the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women ' .	-3.2127
However , she insists that " this is not an affirmative type of action " , in which Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity .	-4.0254
" She was the person who upset this energy , " she said .	-2.3001
" It 's no coincidence , although she was at the forefront , because in a life on these crossings as a black , gay woman , so much is at stake .	-4.7814
You can feel their energy through the screen . '	-2.0977
Meanwhile , the news cameras in Ferguson have long disappeared , but the racial links between the community and the police remain .	-3.7934
Ferrell is on trial for 2 <unk> years because of the blocking of a motorway during a demonstration .	-3.9533
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : " A chaos " .	-3.6274
However , she clings to singing and she feels committed to this memory since she took to the streets three years ago in Ferguson .	-5.2300
" It is our duty to fight for our freedom .	-0.9484
It is our duty to win .	-0.8042
We must love and support each other .	-1.3503
We have nothing to lose - except our chains . '	-1.8433
From Dream to Grö<unk>enwahn : TV-Readers discuss Bit Gallery	-3.6785
The bit gallery moves people , although it is far from being built .	-3.4644
But the idea of a shopping centre at the southern end of the pedestrian zone has divided the population into proponents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .	-4.0051
Cold is hardly an issue .	-4.4936
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page " Volksfreund Bitburg " .	-2.9006
While they say to the Bit Gallery : " That would be a dream " ( Anja Becker ) or " That would be really class " ( Nicole Schausten ) , it comes from the other side : " Need no man " ( Siggi Betzen ) or quite simply " Grö<unk>enwahn ! " ( Lars Scholz ) .	-5.3875
While proponents are relying on a gallery to attract more customers to the city , which also benefits the rest of the shops , opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will be bleeding out . the . the the , the , the , the , the , the , , ,	-14.4899
In addition , the gallery is planned precisely on the plot on which the farmer 's market hall , where 13 direct marketers offer their products .	-6.2128
This will stop at the beginning of the construction work .	-4.0504
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Beda Square with the possibility to sit outside .	-4.6563
Simone Zimmer : " We have been buying in the farmer market hall for many years .	-10.6202
Especially our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the rural women are always very happy .	-4.7777
We also discovered the butchers .	-3.4061
We would like to see an opportunity to maintain this offer even during and especially after the construction of the gallery .	-4.0505
There are also other cities .	-3.5809
Especially the Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt is interesting . '	-2.5712
Gerd Densing : " Whether direct marketers reside in the gallery in a market hall depends on the amount of the rental .	-9.8039
This should not be very low in the new project . '	-4.6133
Eva Kilic : " What shopping palaces in Bitburg ?	-2.1595
Be it clothing , shoes , drugstore or supermarkets : I find this superfluous .	-3.9321
There is enough of this in our city .	-3.2231
You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .	-4.0990
However , since there is not even a proper weekly market here , it is all the more important that we should at least retain the market hall .	-4.8384
After all , the goods offered there are fresh , mostly offered directly by the producer and are also cheap .	-5.2435
As you can see , stores in a shopping centre are only rented by larger companies , because the rents there are often unsustainable for a retailer .	-5.8585
It is a pity , there are almost no more special shops and what remains of them will probably disappear . '	-6.1298
Wolf Fandel : " A shopping centre with a market hall doesn 't fit me .	-3.0842
And the gallery does not fit into Bitburg .	-1.7137
Above all , where should the farmer market hall go during the peasant period ?	-5.3086
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run , if the bit gallery actually comes at some point .	-9.3979
Or does the ghost bit-gallery manage to sell all shops from Bitburg before ? "	-11.7325
George Marquet : " This will simply not work .	-2.0253
And no one needs a shopping centre that is empty .	-3.3173
I think it would have been better to promote a real farmer market , rather than this gallery .	-3.9062
But there is no room for a farmer 's market hall thanks to the mad many - I think - pointless construction projects in Bitburg .	-6.5022
If the farmer market hall is broken , a piece of culture will disappear again . '	-4.7338
A fitting similarity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA	-3.0103
In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces - white , black and brown , almost unnoticeable - that hang on cables from the ceiling .	-4.4998
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheeks and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning .	-3.6055
Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison , where the former intelligence analyst served a 35-year prison sentence after making public diplomatic messages classified as secret on the WikiLeaks website .	-4.7488
The new exhibition , which was opened on 2 August , is called A Becoming Resemblance ( A suitable similarity ) .	-3.7290
She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg , whose discipline united her expertise in technology , computer science , and art , and Manning , a transwoman and pioneering dissident , whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in office .	-7.5518
Dewey-Hagborg , through the algorithmic analysis of DNA , extracted by Manning and created from the 30 portraits of how someone could look with these genomic data , has created a sharp , albeit somewhat intellectual comment not only on the formability of DNA data - the many ways in which they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also on identity .	-5.5960
Manning , born as Bradley Edward , but has spoken openly about identification as a woman since her puberty , was convicted in 2013 for 20 charges , including six violations of the spy law , computer fraud , and theft .	-4.0932
Her image was repressed by the prison , so much so that there was only one photo - a grain , black and white selfie , in which Manning visibly sits on a driver 's seat and wears a platinum blonde wig - with which she was associated .	-6.7162
In 2015 , Dewey-Hagborg came from the great success of her 2012 Stranger Visions project .	-3.3825
In it , the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artefacts such as cigarette stumbling and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of what these people might look like .	-4.8520
That was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine .	-2.3105
" They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , " explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition .	-3.4946
And she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed , so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .	-4.4772
The artist and her imprisoned Muse became unequal letters , which exchanged several letters over the course of two years .	-4.4205
They even created a comic " Suppressed Images " illustrated by Shoili Kanuno , which predicted a future in which President Chelsea would convert judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally .	-4.1935
Indeed , just days after the book was published , Obama would demand Manning ’ s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome kind of happy meeting .	-3.9038
There is also now something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Trump is waging a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new , tweetable ways to further flame the rigid divisions that he should fix .	-6.5368
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said that " things happen for a certain reason " .	-2.9919
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Manning called for an end to the ' automatic fragmentation , the basis of which was sex , race , sexuality and culture . '	-4.7672
On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand feet of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .	-12.6134
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show how surprisingly similar , at least in biological terms , we are all by incorporating the 200 letters ( or nucleotides according to the advanced scientific lexicon of the artist ) .	-4.3476
" What people will hopefully take with them is that our genome does not care who we are and how open genetic data are for an interpretation and how subjective they are , " said Dewey-Hagborg , whose video work of 2007 , Spurious Memories , is also to be seen .	-4.6994
" DNA data can tell so many different stories , so that is 30 of these stories . "	-2.9585
The last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in a separate room , is a page from the above mentioned comic novel .	-3.9001
She shows Manning how she appears with a handphone in her hand from the disciplinary barracks of the United States like King Kong .	-4.1694
" When they cold up your speech , they won , " it says .	-4.2947
" So never stop your mouth " .	-1.9792
" It came directly from a letter she wrote to me , " said the artist , who greets from Philadelphia .	-2.6127
'I still get goose hats when I talk about it ' .	-3.7792
Manning has not yet personally seen the exhibition , as anticipated in the comic book , but if it should do so , it will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks , by their own genomic simulacres , which are like hordes of protesters .	-6.0493
This was also targeted , like everything in the exhibition , to the size ( 5 " 2 , Manning 's stature ) , where their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil .	-4.4075
" In the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , " said Dewey-Hagborg of the portraits .	-2.3254
'I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement that was also behind its liberation ' .	-3.4308
Professor of Northwest University and an employee of Oxford University for Killing	-2.9676
A nationwide human hunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of the University of Oxford , who are searched for suspects after a man had been killed in a luxury apartment in Chicago .	-5.7402
On Monday , Wyndham Lathem ( 42 ) and Andrew Warren ( 56 ) arrest warrants were issued for murders because of their alleged participation in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau , as shown by the acts of the Official Court of Cook County .	-3.7948
The documents say that Cornell Duranleau , 26 , died after several sticks .	-1.7554
A Community warning system published by the Chicago police authority states that the corpse was discovered on 27 July .	-3.0504
Officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .	-2.2179
Cornell Duranleau was still declared dead in the place of events , and detectives investigate the sticks as murder , while the police actively seek the two suspects , said officials .	-4.3660
Lathem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007 .	-1.9059
Alan K. Cubbage , Vice President of University Relations , said in an email statement that Lathem was now in leave and was excluded from entering the campus of Northwestern University .	-4.4408
" This is now a criminal matter being investigated by the competent authorities , and Northwestern University cooperates with this investigation , " said Cubbage .	-3.5897
Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University .	-1.8257
A University and Somerville College spokesman said in an email statement that ' we are in contact with the police in the UK and are willing to help the US investigation authorities in any way possible ' .	-5.0535
The statement added that Warren ’ s colleagues were shocked and want him to stand .	-3.3087
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Authority , Anthony Guglielmi , said he urged suspects to face up to the authorities .	-3.5317
" The police has an idea of their place of residence , and our efforts to localize them intensify , " said Guglielmi .	-2.9420
Guglielmi said that local , regional , and national authorities are helping to find the suspects .	-7.4769
Guglielmi said that the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received a puzzling tip saying that something had happened in apartment 1008 .	-3.6672
The police described the scene as very cruel .	-1.0742
Guglielmi said that it was unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July .	-2.0555
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building .	-2.0743
" We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship , " said Guglielmi .	-1.7530
The Grand Plaza management team published a statement to the residents : ' The police are currently working on the timeline and the victim 's background and exploring a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . '	-4.5680
'We will conclude the WADA roadmap in the near future ' - Russian Vice-Prime Minister Mutko	-7.7294
Russian Vice Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that it will not take long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency ( RUSADA ) are implemented .	-3.6432
" At a certain stage of meeting the roadmap criteria , RUSADA has been given the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD ( UK Anti-Doping ) .	-3.7745
The WADA timetable has been updated in this respect , " said Mutko on Thursday .	-2.5158
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA roadmap for compliance with the code , which describes the criteria for the reinstatement of RUSADA and was recently published on the Organization 's website .	-8.2581
According to Mutko , it contains nothing that could cause concern for Russia .	-3.2682
" Everything has been announced , everything is being implemented .	-2.1700
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and WADA in the near future , " he added .	-1.8762
One of the criteria mentioned in the list , however , states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the WADA ’ s approved investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport .	-4.6816
With regard to the matter , Mutko said : ' We are carrying out the investigation because our anti-doping system has acknowledged a mistake .	-3.9829
All measures have been implemented .	-1.3997
But there were no government programmes , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . '	-3.5015
Mutko 's words coincided with those of Vitaly Smirnov , head of the independent Russian anti-doping commission .	-2.9594
In talks with the Russian sales office RSport at the beginning of the day , Smirnov raised problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organisations , but added : " We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .	-4.6923
No one intends to accept this report unconditionally , " added Smirnov .	-2.9835
RUSADA was excluded from the implementation of doping controls in Russia in November 2015 as part of the doping scandal .	-4.0398
However , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping ( UKAD ) .	-2.3912
After a visit to Moscow 's headquarters in July , WADA Director-General Olivier Niggli declared that RUSADA was moving " in the right direction " to be reinstated .	-4.0716
Aldi no longer sells eggs for the moment . the . the . the . the . the the the .	-7.6320
This was shared by the corporate groups .	-3.4297
It was a mere precautionary measure that no further health impairment could be assumed , as stated in the communication .	-6.2888
From now on , only eggs will be delivered to Aldi , which have been proven to have been tested negatively on fipronil-containing anti-lice agents .	-6.3112
Aldi wants to make clarity and transparency with its customers .	-3.9675
The Start-Ups that will help your company not to become the next Uber .	-3.3051
Amy Errett wanted to measure luck in your e-commerce start-up , but the surveys did not work .	-4.1029
Answers were often vague , unhelpful or - even worse - fraudulent .	-2.7908
And even if you promised anonymity , some workers did not trust the process .	-2.2367
" There was simply never consistency and objectivity , " said Savior , who operates the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care company Madison Reed .	-3.9481
She called people from outside for help .	-2.2164
A new breed of Human Resources Start-ups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel .	-3.5896
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee involvement , it enables companies to conduct surveys , address special groups and demographic groups , provide anonymity and complaint hotlines to employees , and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass the C-Suite executives and contact the Board of Directors directly .	-5.1345
" You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit to follow their health , but where is the fitting for your company ? " said Jim Barnett , co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employees ' commitment .	-4.5096
Save said that they gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint .	-3.1259
In addition to the snap surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which executives have low approval results - so you can drill on why .	-5.7930
Companies come to understand that they must remain at the forefront of the workplace culture , so that they do not become the next robber involved in scandals since a former employee published a blog post describing an environment of harassment that punished those who have spoken .	-5.8072
For start-ups like Glint , this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity .	-2.5786
The global governance , regulation , and compliance industry could have more than $ 118.7 billion in 2020 , according to the financial site Let 's Talk Payments .	-3.2878
Denver , Colorado , Start-up Convercent , which helps companies avoid and recognize bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity early this year in the midst of the Uber case in discredit .	-3.7961
Convercent has nearly 600 clients , including Airbnb , Microsoft and Tesla .	-1.8354
Recently registered as a client .	-2.7356
Like Glint , Convercent lets companies send tailor-made " pulse " surveys , collect confidential responses in real time , and view the heat maps of your problem areas .	-4.6528
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior .	-2.9530
And if the Chief Executive Officer is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .	-2.4462
" The court of public opinion has captured the regulators , " said Patrick Quinlan , the founder and CEO of Convercent .	-3.4524
When a company is found that treats its employees badly or behaves unethically , it can experience costly consequences from consumer boycotts , worker fluctuation and complaints , said Quinlan .	-4.2873
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations , has been using Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to reach their headquarters .	-4.8362
Earlier , when an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or e-mail for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .	-4.4335
It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vitrano , Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel , who said that there was no good way to follow the complaints of employees .	-2.9249
Now that the company uses Convercent , problems previously hidden by executives sitting in offices in cities or states , such as discrimination , harassment or unfair practices , can be identified and addressed more quickly .	-11.6060
" I can get closer to this holistic , 360 degree view of employment experience , " said Vitrano , who heads Ruby Tuesday 's risk management group .	-4.4091
'And we protect our shareholders from employment disputes ' .	-2.7123
Companies began to take ethics , values , and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 , after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations by the Enron scandal , Quinlan said .	-3.6890
But it took the " social media came to their right " that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry from going online .	-4.1161
" Before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , " he said .	-1.4352
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service and charge companies with recurring fees for using their products .	-4.3092
It is a business model and an opportunity that finds the approval of venture capital investors who supported both start-ups .	-3.0634
Convercent received $ 10 million in funding in February from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital , raising the total capital to $ 47 million .	-3.3731
Glitzer secured $ 10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners and brought its entire financing to $ 60 million .	-2.9407
These investments are hardly surprising , given the interconnected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .	-2.6654
There is a growing set of research that shows that today ’ s employees expect more from their jobs than they have done so far .	-4.4101
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley , high salaries and interesting projects are only stakes .	-2.9677
The employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .	-3.8161
" If people are happy to be in a company that belongs to their voices , and that the work you do is worthwhile , then they feel more committed to making this company successful , " said Nina McQueen , Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn , which uses both Convercent and Glint .	-4.1542
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies run well , and companies run well when employees work and are committed .	-5.4741
If third party analytics tools promise to increase engagement and employee involvement , it is no wonder that you will find support .	-4.8221
The data on employee engagement according to the experts of the workplace culture is important . the . the the . the the the . the the . the	-8.8175
But the data is useless if a company ’ s managers do not take action .	-3.3860
Indeed , when a company asks employees for your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way .	-3.5021
And if change does not come quickly enough , or not at all , it can breed disappointments and demotive employees .	-4.9870
" If you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be ready to have 4,000 conversations , " said Russell Raath , President of Consulting at the business management company Kotter International , who has seen companies that have relied too much on data collection .	-4.2413
" For if you do not follow , employees will ask themselves , " Have you really heard me ?	-4.1722
Are you concerned about this ?	-2.6552
And who do not care , why should I ? '	-3.4802
Madison Reed , who is now carrying out monthly employee surveys , was able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported on Glint , Save .	-4.5626
And after gathering feedback from frustrated employees , through the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication , she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems .	-4.7132
At Ruby Tuesday , the company gets new insights about its employees and hopes that in the long term this will lead to a better bond between workers in an industry known for high sales .	-5.9590
" If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose the people , " said Vitrano .	-2.1160
" And if you lose people , you also lose customers .	-2.2166
And if you lose customers , you will lose companies .	-2.7410
The NCAA eliminates two-day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins .	-2.9292
It ’ s about 11pm when a lot of UCLA football players talk on a side of the team ’ s new training fields on the campus .	-6.2154
Some have pulled out their tricoto parts and show their back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .	-4.2641
For a good part of the team , these inactive minutes represent a lunch break .	-3.7255
Players enrolled in the Summer Courses will return to their final exams after the three-hour exercise before returning to the Waterman Football Center at 6 : 30 a.m. the next morning .	-5.4588
" This is a real pedal mill for the boys for the next three days , " said Bruin-Trainer Jim Mora shortly before Monday became Tuesday .	-3.5040
The NCAA eliminates two day exercises to ease the load of the players and has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .	-4.2102
Therefore , the first three training sessions of UCLA should start at 19 : 15 in order to meet the players ’ already packed schedules .	-5.3592
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins postponed the start of the camp almost a week after the last season , and during the summer school for the first time during Moras six games in Westwood performed practical exercises .	-5.1915
They are expected to perform 18 exercises during August , 20 before the formal preparations for their start against Texas A & M in September .	-5.7848
Mora said he supported the NCAA ’ s rule change , even if he adds another point to the players ’ busy routes .	-5.5644
" We put this enormous burden on them three or four days , and it is very challenging , " said Mora .	-2.7296
" And they simply pushed it through , they continue to plunge on , they are great people .	-4.8238
I think that as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will really be great . '	-3.8525
UCLA will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished , which , given the clear sights of its fields , will not be an easy task , given the adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center , a hotel of the upper class , which has already been wrapped with footballs , which have cleared a safety net behind a peat post .	-9.0792
Bruin players are supposed to occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mora admitted that there might be a problem as soon as these rooms are available during the season .	-4.1605
" We will use our security , " said Mora .	-2.0203
" This is a real problem , and it is not far-fetched to think that people rent a room there and then adapt to recording an exercise there .	-5.1379
If you have the video tape of an exercise , it is a pretty good deal .	-2.6308
But we have security forces there and we have security forces on parking 8 .	-2.4448
We will do the best with what we have .	-1.3782
I am not very concerned about that .	-3.3116
We have a plan . '	-0.8339
Facebook wants to intensify factual review in the fight against counterfeit news .	-3.2368
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false messages to fact-checkers from third parties and then show their results under the original post , said the world ’ s largest online social network on Thursday .	-5.2336
The company said in an opinion on its website that it will begin to use updated machine learning methods to detect possible false messages and send them to fact-checkers who may show results of fact-checking from the original article .	-5.7202
Facebook was criticized as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news , many of which believe that they also influenced the 2016 US presidential election .	-3.6078
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with French voters flooded with false stories in the run-up to the May presidential election , and Germany supports a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to quickly eliminate hateful postings , as they did before the September elections .	-4.3568
On Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new fact-check will be launched in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany .	-3.7920
" In addition to recognizing which stories are contested by fact-checkers from third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , " said Sara Su , product manager for Facebook messages in a blog .	-4.5643
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the " related article " and will work on other changes to its news feed to reduce false messages .	-5.1716
Creating a comic novel : A Castle in the History of England	-1.8642
In his recent past , Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s .	-3.7063
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cosy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes , a mophaarien Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents .	-5.1179
" I find it so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years , " he says painfully .	-4.2472
'What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand ' .	-2.2105
" A Castle in England " spans the period from the Middle Ages to the Age of Edward , documenting the families who lived in Scotney , a of other of British , Isaac Lenki, Briony May Sm, WilEx, Becky Palmer and Isabel Gre. , .	-12.2153
It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive : he wrote ' Dead Men 's Teeth and Other Stories ' in 2014 , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotionally .	-3.0431
" I only reacted to the thumb on the page of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700s who worked for the Jacobins , " he says .	-3.5500
" This is his thumb print !	-2.6545
And letters always smell smoke , because at that time they lit a fire because of the light .	-4.1884
For someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if it were there .	-3.3933
Oh , I love archives ! '	-1.3231
For someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( " To be honest : I have a little overvalued my welcome greeting " ) , all this seems too nice to be true .	-6.1859
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian " new " castle , watching the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle , such as the mounted hyene heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch .	-4.5141
He walked through the grounds and ruins of the old castle and talked to landscape carers , gardeners and sometimes the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .	-5.1254
Then , at night he drank " Whiskey and began to write " .	-1.7656
The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown , as the National Trust only received full access in 2006 , when the last heir , Elizabeth Hussey , died .	-3.3881
When Rhodes arrived a decade later , employees began to look after the archive he described as " hundreds of years in which aristocrats said " Oh , throw it on the attic " .	-4.5143
Diaries , letters from the time of the English Empire , cards that represent who possessed what : " You might think that land conflicts would be boring , " says Rhodes , " but there was a birch to which two families fought .	-4.6140
guys , let everything go its way ! '	-2.7437
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point for a broader dive into English history , including ' The Labourer ' , following a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381 .	-5.0712
" There is a record of a turmoil that occurred in 1380 in the castle , in this book entitled ' Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex ' , says Rhodes .	-3.0209
" The peasant uprising began in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start .	-2.8414
Perhaps the two are connected ? '	-2.4920
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle , such as ' The Priest ' , which tells the story of the Jesuit father who the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation .	-4.7850
Or ' The Smuggler ' , in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell from the 18th century is depicted , who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones ( a discovery that was made years later when his coffin was excavated ) .	-4.2289
The Darrells are Rhodes ' favorite family of Scotney : " The lords seemed to be quite crooks , repeatedly debt , and spend money on things they could not afford .	-5.7261
Other generations of Darrell men triggered their debt crises by marriing rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well-looking boys , with a talent to promote inheritance . '	-9.2969
After the end of his work in the castle , Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences .	-4.2887
He passed a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämäki , the site of an early 20th century sanatorium , which has since been reclaimed by nature .	-4.5072
But Scotney has a special place for him .	-1.9261
" I was sad to go again , " he says .	-1.1392
It was like ' Oh , now I have to cope with the damn life ' .	-4.0477
Campaign Started : More than 300 years old Marian Chapel in Rhöndorf	-10.7503
On Friday , the city of Bad Honnef launched its campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rundschau of Thursday ) with the cover of the 301 year-old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf . .	-11.3514
Until Thursday mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and slogan secret .	-2.9579
At the end of August there will be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth .	-3.5179
" Too nice for us .	-1.6204
Or ? " , the makers of the action have been asking on the posters at the Rhöndorf Chapel since yesterday .	-5.2966
" We don 't really think this ( of course ! ) , " write it on your website yesterday .	-5.3399
" But we use this measure to attract your attention .	-2.0421
And to make it clear that some things are better than they seem .	-2.3917
Basically , we firmly believe that as a Bad Honnefer citizen we know very well about the beauty and attractiveness of our city . '	-4.0218
The action is about more than " just " a logo and a slogan , it goes on .	-3.0303
" It is important to formulate a single promise , one that gives the city a distinctive unique feature " .	-5.1875
After all , it is in competition with other municipalities .	-2.3013
The city of Bad Honnef will be able to cost a medium five-digit amount of its new umbrella brand and campaign .	-6.5499
Military Reforms in Turkey - Erdogan 's Fear of the Army	-2.4806
Every year in Ankara , the Supreme Military Council ( YAS ) advises on retirement and promotion in the officer corps .	-3.7675
This week too .	-2.6182
At first glance a normal procedure .	-2.0381
But nothing is routine for the Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt .	-2.7133
The meeting was no longer held in the General Staff building , as in the past , but in the Prime Minister 's office .	-4.1408
The five vice-premiers and the Ministers for Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs have now taken part in the discussions under the chairmanship of the Head of Government .	-5.6834
Thus , the civilians in the YAS were overwhelming .	-4.8181
The government is taking the reins in the military .	-3.3333
Chief of staff , Hulusi Akar , remains in office , but the commanders of the army , the air force and the navy have been dismissed .	-4.7306
Since the failed coup , Head of State Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals .	-1.8354
More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the army , mostly because of alleged ties to the movement of the exile preacher Fethullah Gülen , whom Erdogan sees as a wire pilot of the coup attempt .	-5.7114
About 486 people who were supposed to be directly involved in the coup attempt have been negotiated in Ankara this week .	-4.5815
Already the day after the coup , Erdogan described the attempt to overthrow as a " gift of God " because he gave him the opportunity to " purify the armed forces completely " .	-5.5402
But does Erdogan really control the army ?	-2.0361
At the end of February , the newspaper " Hürriyet " published an article entitled " Unease in the Military Headquarters " .	-3.0645
In the General Staff there are concerns about an increasing " Islamization " of the army , which , among other things , manifests itself in the lifting of the ban on headscarves for soldiers , the newspaper wrote .	-5.3980
In any case , large-scale purification by the army and the security forces continues .	-4.6396
In mid-July , Erdogan fired a further 7395 civil servants , including 2303 police officers and 546 soldiers .	-3.6444
It seemed as if Erdogan tamed the military .	-2.5726
The generals used to be the real masters of the country .	-3.5696
Three times they did so calling for their role as guardians of the secular order of state .	-4.6132
After his election victory in 2002 , Erdogan step-by-step pushed back the power of the military , not least by appealing to the European Union ’ s reform targets .	-4.9924
Former officers say that Erdogan is propelling the armed forces to Islamize .	-9.3532
In the " Vocal Europe " magazine , a notably unnamed officer , who sought asylum in a few years after the coup attempt for fear of persecution abroad , warned that the Turkish army would be " full of extremists and salafists " in a few years ' time .	-5.8272
If so , such a development could not leave NATO cold .	-3.8118
In any case , after the purges , there are doubts in the alliance about the Turkish army ’ s willingness to act .	-5.0016
Leadership structures and operational skills are " weakened , " says NATO diplomats .	-2.7070
Washington Changes the Green Card Rules	-1.0164
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Trump , quoted by the media .	-1.7526
It provides for the reduction of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stricter rules for obtaining visas for temporary work permits and restrictions on family-oriented visas .	-3.5508
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President .	-1.6105
The bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .	-2.6657
'This law will reduce poverty , increase wages , and save billions of dollars for taxpayers , and will do so by changing the way in which the US will spend green cards to citizens from other countries ' .	-4.2594
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .	-1.3673
This new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English , who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , " said Trump , quoted by the American media .	-4.1087
Ministry wants to rehabilitate track for racing shuttle .	-4.5454
Over the past few months , we have been debating the future of the racing shuttle - now it is going to be very fast .	-8.5530
Before the end of the year it is planned to be built on the marvellous route on which the tourist train runs .	-6.7094
In order to ensure the future of the racing shuttle in the long term , according to the Ministry of Transport , construction work is to begin this year .	-5.4678
" With the decision to continue the Ilmenau-Racetrack route , the country is committed to this connection , which is particularly important for tourism , " declared Secretary of State Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt .	-6.3891
The cost of repairing the route was approximately EUR 2.5 million .	-4.1620
Of this sum , the country takes 75 % .	-3.8427
The contract , on the basis of which the shuttle will continue to be ordered by the country , is currently being finalised , explained Sühl .	-4.8189
The Ministry and the Südthuringen Bahn as operators are already agreed on the technical details .	-3.7586
" This is the road map , the vehicles used and the quality standards negotiated , " said Sühl .	-3.9546
The planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be concluded for a period of eleven years .	-3.1006
The race track shuttle is scheduled to be ordered in December 2017 .	-4.8843
The Racetrack Shuttle is a popular railway connection between the railway stations Ilmenau and Racetrack .	-5.4219
Over the past few months , a pilot operation has tested whether the route is used by enough people to reorder it in the future .	-6.6400
The route is also very fragile in parts .	-4.5076
The rise of sex robots is real , and we should be worried .	-10.3655
Precisely when you thought that it could not become even crazy in 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots comes .	-5.2121
Yes , indeed .	-1.0124
Sex robots are currently a big thing .	-2.3939
Recently , the Foundation for Responsible Robotics ( FRR ) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years .	-1.9102
According to Noel Sharkey , emirated professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR , we must begin to take their rise seriously .	-3.5005
Customers can choose the eye colour of the robot , its form of breast wart and the type of fingernail .	-3.6049
'People are making fun of them , but companies are delivering a lot of them , and we will see them much more often , ' said Mr Sharkey when he published his new report .	-6.1542
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence .	-3.4768
The user can also " customize " his robot according to his convictions , choosing everything from the eye color of the robot to the form of the breast warts to the type or color of his finger nails .	-5.9755
But it becomes even more disturbing because many robots have the " personalities " that would make a stepbord woman look progressive .	-4.5020
Modern sex dolls have become robots with a silicone skin .	-1.7681
The RealBotix robot , for example , allows users to adjust their robots to the properties they find appealing , such as timidity .	-3.8227
And then there is the Roxxxy Gold Sex robot developed by True Company with pre-programmed personalities such as " Frigid Farrah " , which conveys the impression of timidity and " Wild Wendy " with a " adventurous " personality .	-4.7736
" Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is as well adapted to your personality as possible , " the site of True Company sweeps .	-4.4097
So she likes what you like , and she doesn 't like what you do not like , etc .	-2.7483
She also has her moods during the day - just like real people !	-3.9690
It can be tired , fixated on conversation or it can be ' in mood ' !	-8.9663
There are many worrying aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relations - but the subservient female qualities , the allusions to rape , when one goes a step towards Frigid ( which means resistant ) Farrah , worry one most .	-6.1377
On his website True Company compared Roxxxy with a vibrator , but for men .	-2.1626
" If women ( sic ) can have a vibrator , why can men not have Roxxxy ? " says the website .	-3.1073
But these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy .	-2.8211
Their emergence and increasing refinement point to something darker and deeper in our culture , a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with subjugation as an optional addition .	-4.4299
Most men , of course , will not hold sex robots , and while the FRR notes its rising popularity , they remain on the margins of consumer culture for the time being .	-5.0590
But what leaks out of the peripheral zones can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time we live in .	-3.7146
And many people are not strange or offensive until the free market gives them permission to do so .	-2.3029
There is a certain overlap that these advanced sex robots appear at a time when women ’ s rights are threatened worldwide , when there is a president in the White House who has boasted of having sexually attacked women .	-4.5625
The most dissuasive aspect of the TV series ' The Handmaid 's Tale ' ( ' The Report of the Magd ' ) is not the graphic images , the blurred bodies and the blurred eyes , but how realistic this vision is .	-5.7082
The Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap .	-3.0446
The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as possible ( albeit with porn star proportions ) .	-3.3555
Their builders want them to feel human , to imitate the movement of a real body .	-2.8862
But , to the point , when it comes to their " personalities " , the robots are not real women .	-3.5603
You cannot separate yourself from your companion or just go away .	-3.2653
They have no mediation or background history , nothing that indicates independence or anything that could disrupt the imagination of total subjection .	-3.9676
In other words , they are happy slaves .	-2.3001
Or , to put it in 2017 ’ s 2017 speech , servant girls	-5.3237
Trump ’ s Great Performance ?	-1.3829
He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense .	-2.1258
It has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions that the US electorate has polarized have also divided small-format families .	-3.6208
Around Christmas and Harvest Festival , US newspapers have given advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump ’ s electing relatives .	-5.5928
We are all supposedly striving to burst our filter bubbles .	-3.2430
Trump ’ s power to bring families together has been less noticed .	-2.1088
I mention this because my cousin , a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Republicans in our family , visited me this week in New York .	-3.2648
She reminded me that unity can have a powerful effect against a common enemy .	-2.1743
With Trump in the White House , everyone she knows , including the Republican kinship with which she had fought for decades for politics , is suddenly and quite strange on the same side .	-4.5094
This is certainly a good thing for the dining table , but it strikes me in another context that this also entails significant risks .	-5.3245
The left has been strengthened by Trump , but the disruptive effect of his presidency has the strength to push us all to the right .	-3.9753
When we talk about ' normalization ' and Trump , we refer to the cruel possibility that one day his girls will no longer throw us off .	-5.4330
But there is an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump “ normalizes ” right-wing Republicans , who suddenly appear to be the embodiment of wisdom relative to his standards .	-4.4191
Nowadays I find myself infected by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney 's original version of the madman - the dog on the roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew what his tax statement was ) - both of which , in fact , occur as a very mild offence compared to Trump .	-5.9785
When Trump goes , Republicans ’ next candidate must be mentally healthy to qualify as an immense improvement .	-9.1624
When my cousin was in the city , we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park , the largest of New York 's carousels , and the best three dollars that can be spent in the city if you don 't need a caffeine .	-4.7841
The horses are huge , the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are crumbling and the animals are twisting to look at their own shoulders with fear - extremely dark and the climbing music conveys this in a str.	-6.9103
So many clichés of a city disappoint : the views of high buildings become old , the skylines become too familiar to offer a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city does not live up to the dream .	-4.5207
Thirty-five years later , and I am still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a major roundabout in northern London .	-4.9633
The Central Park Carousel , however , is still a strange magical experience , as there are two two-year-olds , one 11-year-olds and two women in the 1940s and all have a great time .	-6.1333
If I could have assessed the carousel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one asked for it .	-3.7392
On the other hand , this week in a department store I was forced to rate my " experience " with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card .	-3.9802
In the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to compare the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the store table .	-4.4021
This not only slows down what should be a neutral exchange , but also puts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no one is required .	-3.8805
The poor woman in the department store was apologetically grinning , while I tired of the experience to reach her my credit card with five stars .	-5.3396
Oscar Pistorius moved from prison to hospital with breast pain .	-2.3661
Pistorius left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time .	-2.4080
Last year , he was taken to hospital for the treatment of cuts on his wrists , which he suffered after a case in his cell , according to the prison authorities .	-5.0468
Pistorius was convicted of murders following an appeal from prosecutors against a first death sentence .	-3.6335
He killed Steenkamp in the early morning of Valentine 's day in 2013 by shooting them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria .	-4.2826
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a nocturnal intruder hiding in the cabin .	-3.8333
The prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six-year sentence of Pistorius , which they say is too lenient .	-4.1952
The National Prosecutor said that she would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the appeal could be heard this year .	-3.7186
Pistorius runs the risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if prosecutors succeed .	-3.3382
There is no death penalty in South Africa .	-0.8117
When Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg	-2.4523
As the last of the Blumberg schools , the four-plässlers from Fützen and Epfenhofen were dismissed in the holidays and in the secondary schools .	-6.3838
Three of the unemployed students will go to school in the future , four to the real school .	-5.9993
SchulLeader Angelika Sitte greeted the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürgerhaus Biesental in Epfenhofen on Tuesday evening .	-4.2441
The 29 students of the four classes , led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder , chose a young eagle who grows up in the chicken farm but is then released into freedom .	-5.2646
In addition , the lively Schar performed a musical entitled " Der Eagle im Hühnerhof auf " .	-6.0376
Farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and let it bury from his chickens .	-3.2374
Instead of a chicken cake a small eagle came out .	-2.3078
But the hope of making a chicken out of him broke , the eagle spread his wings on a high mountain and excused .	-5.4424
After that , the classes three and four showed a chicken dance in the classification of Yvonne Frank .	-3.4528
The Hens danced with the young chickens who carried cylinders to the bet .	-3.8305
The eagle stands for integration , said school leader Angelika Sitte .	-2.5186
The kitten is different from the other kittens , but belong to it .	-5.2176
But he will never be like a chicken .	-1.7038
Its purpose is to be free .	-1.9290
She wanted every four-plaintiff to feel at his new school .	-4.8830
I would also like to thank the former head of the school , Michael Müller , who repeatedly intervenes in shortages of teaching , and the parent representatives .	-13.3319
The Kükenzeit is now over , declared class teacher Sophia Schumacher .	-3.5244
She was very reluctant to leave her students after two years of teaching because it was a really great time .	-5.2654
In the end she was able to rely on the fourth-plaintiff .	-5.0713
At the end , all students made a song of summer time and holiday time .	-9.4849
There was great pleasure in the children .	-4.5527
For the new school year , eight first-class patrons are already registered .	-10.0505
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece	-1.2523
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted by television , informed .	-3.5747
On the morning of 1 August , a group of illegally tening people was arrested in Sithonia , including the two Bulgarians .	-3.7929
On the same day , they were released while an investigation is under way .	-2.9811
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported bTV that the Bulgarians were released later .	-8.4384
The Greek authorities have tightened control over free camping and have imposed substantial fines on anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose .	-4.8151
The controls will continue throughout the season .	-2.6347
The ministry said that the court can impose a fine .	-2.7700
Software Update for Diesel Vehicles : What those affected now need to know .	-3.5323
How exactly does the software update take place ?	-1.6613
Do diesel drivers have to participate in the event ?	-3.1050
Overview of the most important questions and answers .	-8.3025
At the Diesel Summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars .	-2.2911
They are intended to improve the exhaust behaviour of cars in the emission classes Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 .	-4.8990
Euro-4 diesel or worse are exempt from this . the the . the the . the the the . the the .	-7.2117
Anja Smetanin of ACE Auto Club Europa gives assessments :	-2.9614
Is the new action mandatory ?	-1.6857
No , the negotiated software updates are voluntary .	-1.4874
" The obligatory updates previously apply only to the vehicles that have muzzle software , " says Anja Smetanin .	-4.3964
Their retrofitting has been arranged by the Federal Office of Car Rental ( KBA ) .	-5.5105
How and when will customers be informed about updates ?	-2.2691
Manufacturers have announced rapid implementation in the coming months , but have not yet given an exact date .	-4.2681
Daimler has announced that he will write to any person concerned .	-5.3913
If an inspection is already due , it will be done within its scope .	-4.0616
How long will the conversion take ?	-4.1116
" Hard to say , " says Smetanin .	-2.6691
This depends on the commitment of the manufacturers and on political pressure .	-3.0095
'For we have seen that car manufacturers are not acting voluntarily on the subject of the environment so far ' .	-4.9767
How long should the update take ?	-1.6465
The conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .	-2.9142
It may be more time consuming to get an appointment .	-3.1711
What do drivers who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group do ?	-2.6201
The ACE advises to wait .	-1.7726
It is likely that foreign producers would follow , Smetanin says .	-9.4461
Is there a massive fall in the price of Euro-4 cars now under threat ?	-4.4224
The ACE fears this .	-1.5816
But it is precisely in the regions where driving bans are threatening .	-3.4422
In rural areas , there has been no loss of value for older diesel .	-3.3669
The ACE advises you to wait for a sale .	-2.3982
LL Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award .	-2.2179
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in the Washington .	-1.3860
The first prize ceremony under President Trump promises to become political .	-2.6795
One of the winners does not want to come - out of protest .	-2.5491
LL Cool J ( 49 ) is the first rapper to receive one of the prestigious Kennedy Center awards .	-2.9483
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday , singer Gloria Estefan ( 59 ) , Lionel Richie ( 68 ) and choreographer Carmen de Lavallade ( 86 ) and TV producer Norman Lear ( 95 ) are among the honors this year .	-3.6378
The awards will be awarded at the beginning of December .	-7.2957
Traditionally , US President Donald Trump will host a reception and attend the ceremony with his wife Melania .	-3.2115
The winner of the progressive TV series Lear has therefore already announced that he will not participate in the gala .	-6.3840
He said to the New York Times : ' This Presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even to deprive them of the means - and this burdens me ' .	-4.4897
59-year-old Estefan emphasized that she would use the conversation with Trump to clarify her view .	-3.7830
The Kennedy Centre , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital .	-2.3538
Former winners include Meryl Streep , Aretha Franklin , Robert De Niro , George Lucas , Tom Hanks and Sting .	-2.4252
The City of Living	-2.6867
Roland Wacker , Hassalch ’ s city builder , retires next year .	-3.0474
The job is already advertised , but suitable candidates are rare .	-3.7616
Wacker has been a city builder for 31 years .	-2.3810
And the work is still a great pleasure for him , as he conveys in the press conversation .	-4.6083
He reports on varied but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor .	-3.1936
At the same time , he is surprised that no application has yet fulfilled the requirement profile .	-4.1353
The city is looking for an architect or construction engineer at the earliest possible time .	-3.0758
Thus , with due regard for the regular deadlines for termination , there is still enough time to begin work .	-7.6960
Since Haslach acts as the Lower Construction Law Authority for the Administrative Community , the Applicant must present the relevant qualifications .	-5.9147
The city wants to retain this function .	-3.9240
If they were no longer able to fill them , citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice .	-4.1089
But proximity to the city and to it itself is important , says Wacker , who reports on a good working climate and good mood between the public and the public .	-5.4054
In more than 30 years in office , a number of significant projects have accumulated , with Wacker looking back with pride .	-5.0274
" We make the city livable " , he is assured of the building office and its employees .	-5.1562
In the future , however , varied projects will continue to be on the agenda : the transformation of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofenparkplatz , for example , has begun .	-6.2937
The Kinzigbrücke between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renewed . Stadium renovation is still a topic .	-3.9940
The latter alone will beat about EUR 1.5 million , ' if we do it right ' , Wacker estimates .	-4.7601
" All in all , great tasks await my successor .	-2.5159
The work here is fun . '	-2.0097
There is a lot of room for a city builder to design .	-5.3970
With Haslach ’ s own farm and garden , many things can be reacted very flexibly .	-5.8602
" You can move a lot " , says Wacker , and the design of the green areas is often commended by citizens and visitors .	-4.7269
Since the old town is listed as an ensemble , it is important to " have an eye on what fits in " when new buildings are approved , the outgoing city builder emphasizes .	-5.6921
In any case , the city builder bears great responsibility .	-4.7859
He is a builder , " in the end everything runs over my table " .	-3.5756
With care and coordination , he can count on many years of employees : Markus Neumaier ( Hochbau ) has been present for ten years , Manfred Schöner ( Deep Building ) for 15 years .	-6.0284
Also , that his successor remains long , Wacker wishes : " We are looking for someone who really identifies and wants to stay with the job " .	-4.9378
Continuity is important not only for a good working climate , but also for the further design of the city .	-3.5555
If you would like to inherit Roland Wacker , you should be able , according to the information of the city of Haslach , to have completed your studies as a graduate engineer or bachelor with an Architecture Department and have good technical knowledge in the areas of construction and construction planning law .	-8.2259
The Municipal Building Office is subject to construction , construction planning , basic occupational matters , management of urban properties , Municipal Court with a courtyard and a Municipal Gardener as well as the Lower Building Authority including monument protection .	-10.5383
Bicycle thrown on tracks : Südbahn Road Locked	-4.8659
According to the police , the hitherto unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway transmission in the area of the Leobener Stra<unk>e ( B116 ) onto the lines .	-4.8532
These were damaged so much that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .	-12.7996
The investigators choose two male perpetrators and have been looking for them since the night hours .	-3.5188
A rosy scooter and a bicycle driver were observed close to the town .	-5.8345
" This goes far beyond a bubble strike , " said <unk>BB spokesman Christoph Posch on APA .	-5.1410
The perpetrators would have put themselves in great danger and also put rail transport at risk .	-4.2276
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant , as well as the delay minutes and the cost of rail replacement transport , there could also be the potential for the perpetrators of rail customers .	-8.7426
Overall , it should be assumed that a " significant " sum is required , the speaker said .	-6.7197
The damage was rectified on Friday afternoon , the rail traffic on the South Railway could be carried out without disabilities .	-6.5194
Nearly ten passenger trains were cancelled on Friday morning , two of which concerned long-distance transport .	-4.6651
Freight trains did not work , but they were delayed .	-3.3246
According to <unk>BB spokesman Christoph Posch , about 200 meters of overhead lines had to be replaced .	-3.7318
Isolators and masts were also damaged .	-1.6480
Red meat , dairy products , and chocolate could help alleviate IBD ( inflammatory intestinal disease ) .	-2.8299
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system .	-1.3505
But a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet rich in meat based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory intestinal diseases .	-3.5443
The incurable state , which affects around 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the UK , causes stomach cramps and bleeding , recurring or bloody diarrhea , weight loss , and extreme fatigue .	-4.1564
While those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms , researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid Tryptophan of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine .	-3.9039
The chief researcher , Dr. Marco Colonna , explained that immune cells in the intestine patrol to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in food do not penetrate into the body .	-4.1523
Cells capable of triggering inflammation are offset by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without harming sensitive tissues .	-3.1593
If the balance tends too far towards inflammation , it may result in inflammatory intestinal disease .	-5.0575
Experiments found that a kind of tolerant immune cell occurs in mice that carries a particular bacterium in its initials .	-11.4125
And the bacterium needs Tryptophan - one of the proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .	-3.6970
Professor Colonna said : " We have established a link between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbiology , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .	-3.8971
The more Tryptophan the mice had in their food , the more they had of these immune cells " .	-3.0422
He proposed that the combination of L. reuteri and a Tryptophan rich diet should promote more tolerant , less inflammatory intestines , if the same system also works in humans .	-5.1802
The postdoctorate Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan investigated a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which was separated , had not .	-5.1381
She suspected that the difference had to do with the mice 's intestinal robiomes - the community of bacteria , viruses and mushrooms that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract .	-4.6187
The mice 's noise was sequenced by DNA and six types of bacteria were found that were present in the mice with the immune cells , but were missing from the mice .	-5.7297
mice were raised in a sterile environment , so that they lacked an intestinal robiom and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells .	-6.1393
In order to understand how bacteria had an effect on the immune system , researchers L. reuteri grew in a liquid and then transferred small quantities of liquid - without bacteria - to immune cells isolated by mice .	-4.7023
Immune cells have become tolerant cells .	-2.8987
When the active component was cleaned from the liquid , it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as indol-3 milk acid .	-4.0019
If researchers doubled the amount of Tryptophan in mice feed , the number of such cells increased by about 50 % , but if the Tryptophan values were halved , the number of cells fell by half .	-4.3868
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells as mice , and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our stomach intestinal tracts .	-2.8337
It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop cells in humans as they do in mice , but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory intestinal disease .	-4.5755
She said : " The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote , as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine .	-3.4476
Potentially , high Tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population . '	-4.1670
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has committed a " genius " with Nemanja Matic .	-1.9918
Manchester United has signed a " genius " with Nemanja Matic , Jose Mourinho believes after the midfield player had his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening .	-3.8743
The <unk> 40 million signature from Chelsea began with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid begins on Tuesday , and impressed in the holding role when people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marched as they wanted .	-5.2502
Matic , however , had been excluded from the preparatory Asia tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes , which Mourinho admitted that he had to improve before the Premier League season began .	-4.9607
" He needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , " said Mourinho .	-1.9053
'We will help him sooner than later ' .	-2.0624
In addition to Matic , Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started in the Aviva Stadium , when Mourinho formed his start XI for the beginning of the season .	-4.4424
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three more commitments , but he insisted that the club had already done a " fantastic job " to meet three of its four priority new commitments .	-4.0603
" Three of four to get , for that I thank the association , " he added .	-9.3751
'I will be happier if they get four out of four for me , but they have done a great deal of work ' .	-4.0732
Boeing " paints " Dreamliner in the Sky	-2.9999
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner in the sky .	-2.5846
The pilots flew from Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington , but the drawing began in Marquette in U.S. state Michigan and moved in the form of a Dreamliner over the US , which is several thousand kilometres .	-4.6607
The action lasted 18 hours and one minute .	-1.7842
On the radar screens was the form of a dreamliner .	-3.1396
The whole thing was a stamina test for new engines .	-2.4091
Boeing had already made such advertising .	-2.4186
Thus the number " 787 " and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky .	-2.7480
Martin Schulz - Hannover , We have a Problem	-4.4638
As the wind turns : when Sigmar Gabriel was still SPD chief , social democratic prime ministers always looked to Berlin with some concern before elections .	-4.4510
Just no disturbance from the party headquarters , just no headwinds from the federal government - that was the main wish of the campaigners .	-6.9794
Since Martin Schulz led the party , this has changed fundamentally .	-3.0513
Since then , the Willy-Brandt House staff have been watching with increasing horror the events in SPD-ruled state capitals .	-4.7322
What Schulz got from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described by headwinds .	-3.5496
They were deep blows .	-2.9420

After the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of the SPD and the Greens .	-3.6065
" This shows once again : Red Green simply cannot govern reliably , " said CDU Secretary-General Peter Tauber of the German editorial network ( RND ) .	-4.3041
The surprising exit of a Green MEP has plunged Prime Minister Stephan Weil ’ s government into a serious crisis .	-3.1895
Five months before the country ’ s election , his red-green coalition lost its one-vote majority to the CDU and FDP opposition .	-3.6164
The Green Chairman Michael Kellner has called on the breakaway Lower Saxon Green MEP Elke Twisten to return their mandate .	-5.1115
Transferring to the CDU is a clear distortion of voters ’ will .	-4.2220
Elke Twisten must immediately return her mandate , " said the Federal Managing Director and Election Manager of the Greens to the editorial network Germany ( RND ) .	-5.2005
" All of this must not be true " , a SPD campaigner is saddened when on Friday morning the new Hiob message reaches the party headquarters .	-7.6476
Stephan Weil , Prime Minister of the SPD of Lower Saxony , is here after the passage of the Green MEP Elke Twisten to the CDU without his own majority of government .	-10.1543
It is the provisional highlight of a whole series of major and small crises in SPD national federations .	-3.7507
And no one knows what comes next .	-1.8950
The malaise began with the unexpectedly significant defeat of the Saarland election in March .	-3.2897
A blue eye , no more , the comrades reassured at the time .	-8.4138
After the national elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia , everything will be different .	-2.7800
That was what happened - and it all became much worse .	-5.9254
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to tumble , the Düsseldorf bankruptcy turned the party smoothly .	-5.6679
In the weeks afterwards , the comrades struggled again .	-5.7687
Then when they had just created new courage , the G-20 summit in Hamburg came .	-3.0793
And with him came the next deep blow .	-2.5345
Mayor Olaf Scholz , the last strong SPD leader , lost his nimbus on that weekend because he sat in the Elbphilharmonie while his city burned .	-3.3076
And because he made almost everything wrong in crisis communication .	-7.5126
Since then , Scholz has been fighting for his political survival .	-1.7331
Now also Stephan Weil .	-2.3388
Due to the VW exhaust affair and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been criticising for a long time .	-4.8829
Miese polls were added .	-2.1307
Nevertheless , or perhaps precisely because of this , because in recent weeks , more and more attempts have been made to accentuate in the coali. . the , , , , , , , , ,	-10.4295
The efforts of the former mayor of Hannover to expand his power in Berlin were not hidden by comrades around Martin Schulz .	-5.2099
They allowed him to be granted because they promised Weil to stabilize the party .	-3.7598
Now the exact opposite could happen .	-3.6498
Because of the partisan twist of the Lower Saxon Greens , there is nothing to blame .	-6.7528
And Schulz certainly does not .	-2.6379
For the time being , the comrades are trying to keep their own ranks closed .	-3.2920
Her anger is directed at the Greens and , above all , the breakaway parliamentarian , Mr Twisten .	-4.9619
" It is intolerable and damaging to democracy , as Mrs Twisten puts her own career interests above the interests of everyone else , " says Matthias Miersch , head of the party left in the SPD Bundestag Group , the editorial network Germany ( RND ) .	-5.0706
Mrs Twesten was elected to Parliament not because of her person as a direct candidate , but through the list of countries of the Lower Saxon Greens , the Lower Saxon Member states .	-5.8792
The logical consequence is that it returns its mandate .	-2.4738
Thomas Oppermann , head of the SPD Bundestag Group , complains of an " undemocratic manoeuvre " . the the . the the . the the . the . the the	-8.7722
" The voter will four years ago was clear : the people have made Stephan Weil Prime Minister , " says Oppermann , who leads the Lower Saxon SPD as a leading candidate for the German Bundestag election , the RND .	-6.1027
" Now the personal career thinking of a future CDU MEP distorts the election result , " said Oppermann .	-4.0263
He called for the background to be clarified .	-2.5030

Promotional funds for the centre III	-5.6482
Anyone who wants to rehabilitate his house over the years can soon receive support from the country .	-6.5402
The mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG city development informed about this on Wednesday in Receiving .	-5.4040
At the beginning of the information event Schindler once again gave a look at what happened so far .	-4.1440
Since 1991 there have been reconstruction areas in Receptions .	-3.3760
Baden-Württemberg took over two-thirds of the total funding from that period , in the I rehabilitation area from 1991 to 2004 .	-6.5949
In the rehabilitation zone II from 2005 to 2016 , the grant was still 60 % .	-3.8002
For Schindler , the refurbishment to date is a " success project " - after all , it is important to promote internal development as well , and not only to open up new building areas .	-6.8496
On 4 April , the President of the Government of Karlsruhe informed us that there will be a rehabilitation area III .	-4.1495
The amount of funding is EUR 833 333 , of which EUR 500 000 would be received from the country , the rest from the municipality .	-4.7692
How does a rehabilitation area emerge ?	-3.9260
We will continue , Schindler says , to investigate where the " really old " houses are .	-4.5284
However , it also has a role to play in whether there is any interest in the planned area to be reconstructed .	-6.4257
If necessary , the territorial boundaries could then be shifted again .	-5.3413
STEG represented Martin Keller , Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening .	-1.7461
Keller presented the contents of the federal state program " Social City " , in which the rehabilitation would then be carried out .	-4.6866
At the heart of the programme are the revitalisation of inner cities , the improvement of housing and work conditions and the maintenance and development of infrastructure .	-5.8722
The measures would be carried out on an object basis , i.e. per plot .	-4.0749
The rehabilitation area would then finally be defined as a statute .	-4.6499
The allocation period for funding has been running until 30 April 2026 since 1 January 2017 .	-3.9035
However , by September of this year , the inventory would be carried out , in which those involved in the rehabilitation area would receive a questionnaire for completion .	-6.3287
In November or December , if possible , the Statute will be adopted so that the reconstruction can begin next year .	-6.0922
Pietzschmann then declared that every municipality had to carry out the said preliminary investigations .	-4.1709
It is a question of assessing urban abuses and deciding when to rehabilitate them and to what extent .	-10.1606
The property will then be rehabilitated in the land register .	-6.2137
Pietzschmann himself will come to reception again and take a picture of the situation , she promised .	-4.6296
Gotzel stressed that the participation of the participants was an essential success factor for the project .	-3.7786
That is why there will be questionnaires which will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be completed by the end of the summer holidays .	-4.7109
The yellow questionnaire is the " Building and Property Arc " , which deals , among other things , with the building condition and the renovation intentions .	-5.8483
In the grey questionnaire , the " household and apartment arch " , information about the size , distribution and residents of a living room can be provided .	-5.5230
The blue " Operating Arc " must be filled only if business premises are operated in the building .	-4.5386
However , it should be noted that Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time a request for funding .	-3.3722
Furthermore , new construction measures are not eligible .	-2.9737
Schindler also stressed that the distribution of the funds works according to the ' greyhound principle ' - who comes first grinds first .	-5.7988
You cannot " reserve " funds for later .	-4.3442
Finally , photos of the project " Ortskerner II " were shown to make a " tasty " renovation for those present .	-11.0145
British inventor sets himself a microchip to come home and car with a hand movement .	-3.6194
A British inventor is the first in the country equipped with a microchip to open his door , enter his office , and even start his car with a hand movement .	-4.0488
Steven Northam , 33 , had implanted the tiny chip between thumb and pointer finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology through BioTeq .	-4.5425
He joined Dr. Geoff Watson , an advisory anaesthetist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester , Hants , to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards .	-3.8923
The technology resembles a cat and dog implanted microchip and lasts only 30 seconds .	-2.0911
The company of Mr. Northam also wants to change the locks of houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip , all for a surcharge of $ 300 per lock .	-4.3768
The married father of one has now installed both at home and his BMW Z4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel .	-4.3169
The White House ’ s Advertising Cost to Taxpayers Thousands	-2.6424
The White House ’ s decision to fly a naval helicopter to South Lawn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month costs taxpayers up to $ 24,000 , according to the military that were handed over to the TIME magazine .	-11.2243
The green and white Sikorsky VH-3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on 17 July in the White House with American construction programs .	-3.6536
President Donald Trump , Vice President Mike Pence , and White House senior officials took a tour of products from all 50 states .	-3.0409
The helicopter manufactured in Connecticut was exhibited alongside a yacht from Maine , a fire-fighter car from Wisconsin and a fork truck from Mississippi .	-9.2113
The White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on South Lawn , according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One ( HMX-1 ) , the unit responsible for operating the helicopter .	-3.7858
" I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , " the commander of the HMX-1 wrote on the eve of the event to his superior , the deputy naval commander for aviation .	-4.7176
The news showed that the helicopter arrived at 3 o 'clock on July 17 at 7 o 'clock in the South Lawn at 7 o 'clock in the morning and stayed until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 this evening .	-5.3580
The note adds that if the departure from the White House is delayed , a second team would be required for the return flight due to the limitation of the hours of service .	-5.1514
The original crew was on the helicopter during the event , while the unit ’ s security personnel remained on the ground during the time .	-4.8969
It was not clear from the TIME records that a second crew was needed .	-4.3581
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes .	-2.0252
rows indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could violate the provision .	-3.7092
" One question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case , " wrote the commander .	-3.5196
" Sounds as if you are closed , " the Deputy Commander answered .	-3.4903
The event " Made in America " was referred to by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act .	-9.0090
But official events also have political overtones .	-1.7286
At the event , the President gave impetus to the reform of the Senate ’ s health reform , and he advocated efforts to curb government regulations .	-11.1003
The use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically beneficial purposes is hardly a new phenomenon .	-3.1362
Presidents are obliged to use them for the journey .	-2.0758
But requesting their use only for a photo OP is unusual .	-2.9122
Trump conducted an investigation in February , when the presidential plane provided taxi services in the light of its first campaign rally in Melbourne , Florida , and his Twitter account is full of messages complaining about his predecessor ’ s use of the presidential aircraft .	-4.4537
" The White House is enthusiastic about the show " Made In America " - which shows products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials , " said the Deputy White House Press Secretary , Lindsay Walters .	-4.2161
HMX-1 crews often carry out training flights in the Washington and South Lawn area to replace the US president in the White House with precise centimeters .	-4.4954
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July , HMX-1 conducted 58 practice landings in the White House .	-3.2238
The flight for the " Made in America " event counted in the training needs of the crew for the month , said a civil servant . .	-10.9762
Helicopter units flew an additional 11 hours a day for " non-presidential support missions " .	-9.7984
The White House said that taxpayers did not take over the burden for any of the other requirements presented at the event .	-3.4360
A Sikorsky spokesman said that the company was not involved in issuing the helicopter on South Lawn .	-3.0344
HMX-1 does not maintain budget records for presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .	-3.2346
However , according to Hours of the US Defense Department for the 2017 financial year , the DoD refund rate for the VH-3D is USD 24.380 per flight hour .	-4.2677
Records of the unit recorded the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia .	-3.4498
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is well below this rate .	-2.1376
" Setting the costs for taxpayers on the basis of the estimates for the reimbursement rates is highly misleading , " said Walters .	-4.0623
'These estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds ' .	-3.3013
According to a 2015 RAND study , the DoD reimbursement rates do not include personnel costs , but take into account the cost of fuel , maintenance and contract conclusion .	-4.1354
At that time , the former White House press spokesman Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter for the event .	-2.8746
" The idea is to present things that are made in America this week , " said Spicer .	-2.2487
" And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not thousands , of people are dependent on it .	-3.1053
And I think , like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly .	-2.2730
It is , of course , appropriate to emphasise this . '	-2.5651
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter when he took his tour of the South Lawn for the event , but he was in the driver ’ s seat of a fire-fighter car .	-5.2027
In the White House , Trump spoke to Sikorsky representatives , and chatted with the media about his own fleet of company products .	-3.9980
'I know Sikorsky very well ' , the President said , ' I have three of them ' .	-2.2899

The TC Blau-Weiss Neuss will start tomorrow at 11 a.m. in Kiel at the third table search village SV .	-4.3140
Despite five games , the top rider of the Second Tennis Bundesliga has retained the sense of reality .	-5.3133
Head of the team Marius Zay has respect for the opponent .	-4.0293
" This is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formations .	-2.9941

How America Can Damage OMV	-1.3650
Donald Trump was not really happy when he signed his signature on Wednesday evening under the law to tighten sanctions against Russia .	-3.6034
" In his haste to enact the law , " the Congress packed some " unconstitutional rules , " he said .	-5.0512
The response from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels was ashamed of the US push .	-4.0451
After all , the draft envisages penalising European companies that help Russians build gas pipelines into the EU .	-3.1236
Accordingly , investors from the local OMV , together with other European companies , have been worried about the construction of the Russian Nord Stream 2 Baltic Sea Entity .	-5.8232
The threat scenery is enormous .	-3.4927
However , it is too early to assess the consequences , according to the official statement of the oil company .	-3.8844
Indeed , Donald Trump himself would have to bring sanctions to life by executive order .	-4.1498

Narcos Staffel 3 Trailer : Without Pablo Escobar , the Cali Cartel will be placed at the centre of the Netflix hit series .	-4.3954
Despite the second season of Narcos , which reveals Pablo Escobar 's killer , the series of Netflix is far from over .	-3.2802
The relays three and four were already confirmed by the streaming service , the first got their first trailer and showed the latest evils of the show .	-4.3047
With the third season , the DEA has focused its attention on the world ’ s richest drug trafficking organisation : the Cali cartel .	-3.6487
Led by four powerful sponsors , they operate " like a Fortune 500 company " only with more state bribes and violent actions .	-2.2237
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela ( Damian Alcazar ) is the leader of the cartel , Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , Pacho Herrera ( Alberto Ammann ) commands the Mexican connection , and Chepe Santacruz Londono ( Pepe Rapazote ) is located in New York .	-2.1187

On September 1 , the city of Krefeld takes over the food supply in the city 's Kitas .	-6.4835
For Sonja Pommeranz , Deputy Director of Youth Assistance , this is good news : " We were all very pleased " .	-4.0776
Cooking is still out of the house : a caterer takes over this task and supplies freshly cooked cooled .	-10.9324
The town operates 46 childcare centres in the Krefeld area , in 44 the children receive a warm meal at lunchtime .	-5.1557
In the last kita year , 2800 children sat on the tables each , and demand is growing steadily .	-5.1348
" Meanwhile , not only children who are cared for 45 hours a week are eating in the kita at noon , " explains Pommeranz .	-5.2052
'The offer also applies to 35-hour care if children stay until 2 p.m. '	-4.5204
46 part-time staff will have a kitchen service from 1 September : they warm up the delivered dishes , complement them with salad , raw food and fruit , portion the meal individually , prepare the meal , clean , rinse and clean the kitchen .	-8.0520
" The employees are firmly assigned to a kita , " says Pommeranz .	-3.0840
The size - there are two groups as well as seven groups - decides the amount of hours .	-4.6190
" The kitchen helpers now belong to the Kita team , " says Pommeranz satisfied .	-4.0357

It is also about healthy nutrition and cooking lessons . the the . the the the . the the the the . the the .	-8.4953

" They have a known force in Kita , a person who is familiar to them and not constantly changing people " .	-3.7622
This continuity is important for children .	-1.4864

Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN	-1.6262
Elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .	-2.0646
Nicholas Haysom , President-in-Office of the United Nations Mission , said that hundreds of women will stand in the provincial elections ; three women stand for the role of Vice-President and more than 30 % of newly registered voters are women .	-4.4960
" The role of women cannot be overestimated , " he said on Wednesday in a statement .	-1.7924
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women are fully involved and involved in all parts of the electoral process .	-2.7237
Afghan elections for the provincial council and presidential elections will take place on 5 April .	-2.1874
The Taliban have published threats against an electoral process that coincide with the transition from international fighting to an advisory role .	-2.6805
This year , for the first time , the elections will pass power peacefully from one democratically elected government to another .	-2.8977

Two young men aged 19 and 23 were supposed to have tried on Thursday to deprive a 13 year old girl .	-9.6774
According to police information , the 13-year-olds who were with friends on Kolpingstra<unk>e spoke about 14.55 , because they wanted to phone the girl 's mobile phone .	-6.8555
The 13-year-old refused the request and continued with her friends .	-3.1986
One of the perpetrators then tried to pick up the cell phone and the girl ’ s necklace , but this failed .	-5.2466

GMB concern about investment in the McVitie factory in Glasgow	-2.3023
A trade union would like to check with Biscuit manufacturer McVitie managers about the long-term commitment to production at its factory in Glasgow .	-5.5557
GMB Scotland said that the company has been silent about the future of investments at the Tollcross site .	-3.7315
More than 500 employees work at the plant , which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits among other products .	-3.3670
McVities owner Pladis said he has invested more than <unk> 5 million in recent years .	-2.3074
He added that workers and trade union representatives would " experience first " if their activities changed .	-3.8395
In a letter to the company 's director , GMB Scotland McVitie 's called for " concerns to be expressed that funding for the modernization of production lines is not being promoted " .	-5.1344
GMB senior organizer Drew Duffy said : " The fact that we cannot gain clarity from the General Site Manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of rabies affects our members deeply .	-4.4803
Generations of families have worked here and the workforce is concentrating heavily on the local community and the Glasgow area , an important pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage .	-4.6757
Therefore , from the perspective of jobs , wages and prosperity , and in the context of Brexit , rising living costs , and chronic decline in production , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a prosperous production presence at McVitie " .	-11.4101
One of Pladis ’ s spokespersons said : “ The Tollcross branch leader received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday , and the company will respond directly , as we appreciate the continuous commitment of employees and trade union representatives .	-5.8740
Two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross , where some issues were discussed openly .	-3.2618
We discussed with our employees that , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , we are continually reviewing our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - in order to remain competitive .	-17.5144
She added : " In recent years , we have invested more than <unk> 5 million in our Tollcross location , especially in production lines and operational improvements .	-3.1399
We fully recognise the legacy of Tollcross as a production site , and if our operations change at the site , the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to know . '	-5.8219
Did the PSG Barcelona warn of Neymar three years ago ?	-1.7517
The La League side may regret its interest in Marco Verratti .	-8.8175
Paris Saint-Germain will not diminish her persecution of Neymar after making an offer of $ 189 million to trigger his release clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago of the world record attack ?	-4.3110
The sensational approach has fueled the transfer window in summer , because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United last season for GBP 89 million .	-4.7603
After finishing , Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athlete in the world .	-4.0459
Barcelona is angry at the way Neymar has forced his way out , even though a source near the Catalan Board insists that the club has always done its best to take care of it since its arrival in Santos in 2013 .	-4.9065
But was the football world warned three years ago by the PSG president of this prospect ?	-2.3147
When Manchester City expressed interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014 , Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for every club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PSG .	-3.6943
" I 'm not concerned because they know that if they touch one of our players , then we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact their players , " said Al-Khelaifi .	-2.8181
" We respect all clubs .	-1.1152
But if they try to sign one of our players , they will have consequences . '	-3.9447
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish association expressing interest in the PSG midfield player Marco Verratti at the beginning of this summer .	-3.6610
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the International to leave Italy under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its prize offers to Neymar .	-4.3025

The driver of the coming car , a Mercedes Benz , had overtaken a lorry and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident .	-4.3003
According to the injured person , it may be good that the Mercedes driver did not even notice the accident .	-4.4728
The police are now asking witnesses to the incident and the driver of the polluter pays vehicle to contact the Commissioner in Stolzenau under Tel 05761 / 92060 .	-4.5088
Interview : ' Dompatz report relieves Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger '	-2.7555
The Regensburger Dompatz report on the abuses relieves Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger .	-8.1545
This means author and historian Michael Hesemann .	-1.8198
The final report on the misuse scandal at the Regensburg Cathedral Spatzen continues to generate discussion .	-8.3739
Christian Weisnder , Speaker of the Reform Movement " We are Church " , explained after publication to the German Press Agency , he expects an apology from the former Regensburg bishop and today 's Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the cathedral master Georg Ratzinger , the 93-year-old brother of the emitted Pope Benedict XVI .	-5.2686
It would greatly benefit the image of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret at their own omissions or their misjudgement of what happened at the time .	-5.0828
The Vatican newspaper " Osservatore Romano " , on the other hand , criticised the double standards used in reporting violence in the cathedrals .	-5.3431
With regard to the attacks in Regensburg , no one doubts that they are ' shameful and shameful acts ' which should be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the ' degree of media manipulation ' , according to the author Lucetta Scaraffia , historian and member of the Italian National Bioethics Committee , is striking .	-5.6144
" The habit of describing the Catholic Church as a source of all evils is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to consider it normal , " writes Scaraffia .	-4.3426
Prince Gloria von Thurn and Taxis also said in the interview with the Bavarian broadcaster : " You like to go out to the church and that is a food found " .	-5.9022
She also pointed out that in her youth ' beats were a normal pedagogical means ' to deal with cheeky children , as I was one ' .	-5.8817
It would be unfair to apply today ’ s standards to previous decades , because the world has changed .	-2.9207
In connection with the reports on abuses , Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared .	-3.0200
The author and historian Michael Hesemann , who wrote the book " My Brother of the Pope " with Ratzinger ( translated into 12 languages ) , is completely wrong .	-4.6928
" I have to protect Georg Ratzinger , " says Hesemann , " because all this had nothing to do with him , " he evaluates the results of the final report .	-3.6852
What exactly does the 440 pages of the report presented by the lawyer Ulrich Weber , appointed by Bitum Regensburg with the Enlightenment ?	-5.1339
A total of 547 Regensburg Cathedral Spatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s " with high plausibility " victims of attacks , 67 cathedrals .	-5.0567
In the final report , Georg Ratzinger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 , says : " In summary , it can be said that in many cases , forms of physical and psychological violence were used by Domkapellmeister R. .	-5.5080
Especially with high emotionality , the punishment for the pupils could be more severe .	-5.0412
However , unlike many other accused , it is noticeable that many victims estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore , in many cases , despite violence , even link positive memories with him " .	-6.0275
In the interview Hesemann explains why he believes that the final report on the misuse scandal at the Regensburg Cathedral Spatzen Georg Ratzinger relieves the burden .	-5.1218
Mr Hesemann , the 440 page report on the ' incidents of violence against defenders at the Regensburg Cathedral Spatzen ' gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger .	-4.7434
On the one hand , many students highlight their " humanity " .	-2.9556
On the other hand , he also appears as a choleric and perfectionist , who often became handsome when a Domspatz musically did not produce top performances .	-6.7804
How do you view this final report as your biographer ?	-7.7803
Michael Hesemann : If you take the trouble and read the 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger actually appears in it .	-6.1127
Just eight pages are dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .	-5.2539
The pre-school violence processes also took place outside its sphere of influence .	-4.8110
At best , he can be accused of being too late or of not being taken seriously enough .	-5.3541
The Domspatzengymnasium on which he worked was perceived by virtually all respondents as " redemption " , " sky " and " better world " .	-4.9473
The vast majority of his pupils , Georg Ratzinger , also exhibit an excellent testimony , describes him as " warm-hearted " , " loved " , " sincere " , " competent " and " comprehensible " , as a very good teacher , who regularly supplied the guys with cakes , biscuits and bonbonbons and was " always relocated by grapes of children " .	-11.9514
Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and high emotionality , which has led to outbreaks .	-3.8454
He admitted years ago , deeply regretted and apologized for the fact that he not only banked with chairs and thrown the keyring onto the ground , but also spread slaps and pulled too cheeky guys on the hair or ears .	-8.7707
In his salvation of honour , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the period in question , the 1960 ’ s and 1970 ’ s , with parents and teachers alike .	-5.0757
Do you know such breeding methods ?	-2.2686
Of course , I think each of us born before 1968 .	-1.9117
I , too , have experienced this in a secular school , a state gymnasium .	-3.4353
Compared to what this report is actually about , namely horrific sexual abuse and pre-school violence , these are , of course , bad guys .	-6.8356
One wonders if his fame and role as a brother of Benedict XVI is not the case , that many media have just plunged into him .	-8.1042
Many of those who have never understood him are still eager to work on the Bavarian Pope .	-4.0822
But the truth is that the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect !	-2.3279
A great deal has been reported in the media in connection with the report on the subject of abuse at the Regensburg Cathedral Spatzen .	-5.6207
Will Georg Ratzinger , in the final report , also be charged with any involvement or involvement in sexual abuse ?	-5.8242
Michael Hesemann : Quite clearly no .	-2.2453
Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claims to have entrusted himself to the Cathedral master .	-3.3749
Not even the parents were inaugurated .	-1.5532
" I have never dared to talk about it with my father or mother , " one of the people affected said , " I was very embarrassed " .	-5.5385
The real problem in educating sexual abuse was , and still is , that most victims are silent .	-4.3947
If they did not even entrust themselves to parents and siblings , then certainly not to a choir leader who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators professionally .	-5.3655
How do the Cathedral students rate Ratzinger 's role with regard to the cases of abuse ?	-4.6246
Michael Hesemann : A student in question put it as follows : " With regard to sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which , of course , he ( Georg Ratzinger ) would have had timely findings and could have stopped the perpetrator .	-9.4339
I also think it is really absurd to assume that he ... Jacks have opened up more forcefully , clearer or even more clearly than their parents , boarding managers , trust teachers etc .	-8.2843
That you talk to him about sex ... - unthinkable . '	-2.7450
In this way , the report comes to the very clear result : ' The fact that pupils affected and / or their environment were entrusted to him in the run-up could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation ' . the was . the , , , , , ,	-10.6561
So , as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg Ratzinger is free from any kind of mutual understanding .	-4.7895
Nor can he be accused of not having prevented or brought to the display .	-5.4300
There is therefore no reason to associate his good name with these repugnant crimes , as has unfortunately happened in some cases .	-4.2910
Much of the media was read by the Regensburg Cathedral Spatzen .	-5.1909
The former cathedral master Georg Ratzinger is accused in the report " Wegschauen " .	-3.0939
Do he have to live with this accusation ?	-6.8921
Michael Hesemann : That is the big problem that everything has been mixed up and mixed up in the reporting process into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence processes and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg Ratzinger .	-5.8115
But that , in turn , is an abuse of the .	-3.0130
There is a clear separation : between pre-school and high school of cathedrals , between sexual abuse and violence , and , let us say , other accusations .	-6.5976
In addition , the report deals with incidents since 1945 , including four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choir leader of the Cathedral Spots .	-5.5870
All the terrible caning education , the cases in which boys of sadistic teachers were actually harassed and maltreated and suffered terribly , all occurred at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen , where really scandalous conditions had to prevail .	-7.0907
But Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with them , because he only got the boys to face when they were already on the Cathedral gymnasium .	-4.9334
On that , as most witnesses emphasize , was the subject of " pre-school " taboo .	-3.2701
One was only happy to escape her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even " paradise " conditions .	-3.8160
What was different on the Domspatzengymnasium ?	-2.6168
Michael Hesemann : There was discipline , but no sadistic violence .	-3.8996
And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger , where the report concludes that ' many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore , in many cases , even link positive memories with him despite violence ' .	-5.4315
At most , the accusation of having looked away remains .	-4.7787
However , despite all the efforts , the report could define only two periods in which it was reported about pre-school conditions .	-5.1455
The first time in 1970 / 71 , when he just started to establish himself and did not want to hear anything about what happened at a school where he was not working and responsible ( the witness said ) , and then again around 1993 .	-7.2074
Georg Ratzinger consistently shut his ears off the conditions ?	-4.2246
Michael Hesemann : No , because as early as 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Cathedral gymnasium , which the report even reproduces .	-3.7206
In this , he points out that " caning continues in pre-school " .	-5.9633
Already in the face of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent intervention .	-3.4414
This was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed , when caning was banned in Bavaria , too .	-3.7470
Before that , they took place in a legal grey area , as we all know .	-3.8533
It was also difficult for him to assess where those affected were perhaps exaggerated or dramatised and where the limit was really exceeded .	-5.9267
Nor can we say that he has always looked away .	-3.7367
That is simply not true .	-1.3213
It was only in 1980 that the caning of schools was officially abolished in Bavaria .	-8.8433
Prince Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today ’ s pedagogical standards to that time .	-3.6452
What do you see ?	-1.9511
Michael Hesemann : We historians are talking about the " pitfalls of anachronism " , in other words the danger of assessing the past according to today 's moral standards .	-4.5427
The prince is right .	-2.4527
But this does not , of course , apply to sexual abuse , which at all times was abominable , nor to what was broken in the pre-school of recklessness and violence against innocent children ’ s souls , which goes far beyond what was usual at that time . the . the , , , , , , , , , , ,	-11.6275
That is all quite terrible and I am glad that it is finally being prepared .	-4.2732
But at the same time I have to protect Georg Ratzinger , because all that had nothing to do with him .	-3.2066
His means of discipline and punishment , that is to say , earphones and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .	-5.7936
When physical punishment was then banned , he was also strictly adhering to it .	-3.8516
What image of his Regensburg period did Georg Ratzinger reflect in the conversations with you for the book " My Brother of the Pope " ?	-9.3764
Was the subject of caning also mentioned ?	-4.2686
Michael Hesemann : Well , the book is about the life of his brother Joseph , Pope Benedict XVI , tells from his perspective that the cathedrals played only a side role .	-5.0839
Nonetheless , I do not conceal at all the fact that he led a strict regime there .	-5.0525
But that , too , must be said : without this perfectionism , without calling for unconditional discipline , it would probably have been impossible for him to form a world-class institution from the legendary Regensburg Cathedral Spots , which had been known to date more nationally , a true cultural ambassador to Europe and its musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the US ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .	-8.9972
With biscuits and bonbons alone , one does not make reckless boys any great singer and any success , regardless of the field , but always discipline , passion and self-overcome .	-8.0283
What kind of man did you experience Georg Ratzinger during the conversations on her book ?	-3.7339
Michael Hesemann : Through the work on the book and beyond , I really knew Georg Ratzinger very well , and have repeatedly experienced him as a wonderful , humorous , basic , deeply believing and heart-good person , from whom one cannot imagine that he could even suffer a fly .	-8.2914
I regularly get to know how many former cathedrals still today , 23 years after his Emerition , keep in touch with him , visit him , read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of their family .	-8.4158
Those who , to date , have not forgiven him that he was once strict with them are clearly in the minority .	-5.0230
Today , most of the cathedrals are grateful to him for enriching their lives and bringing them closer to the world of music .	-4.9149
And that he was always a good , fatherly teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a loving respect to whom they still look up today and which they worship .	-7.7339
I would like to make it quite clear once again that all that is being accused of is education methods that were the order of the day .	-7.6212
We can be glad that we have overcome this time long ago .	-3.3380
But it is highly unjust to turn a man simply because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother into a media scapegoat .	-3.0407
The evil intention behind it is all too obvious .	-3.0218
The report that has just been published relieves him .	-2.7508
Now , the decency would be to let a 93-year-old man , who has earned great merits and without those outside Bavaria and perhaps even Germany , know the Duchspatzen in Regensburg , finally in peace .	-8.4440
