The National Assembly ’ s commission , which is currently working on a bill for change of name , said : “ The final decision on the name of the members of the National Assembly is , of course , the members themselves . ”	-5.5538
The Government of Wales Act 2017 allowed the Welsh Parliament to change its name .	-2.1554
Last June , the Commission published the results of a public hearing on the proposals to give broad support to the change in the name in the Welsh Parliament .	-4.2108

The referendum will be held to resolve a decade-long dispute with neighbouring Greece , in which a province is called Macedonia .	-3.3958
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbour 's name is a claim to its territory , and has repeatedly objected to his application for membership for the EU and NATO .	-3.8495
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov , who opposed the referendum on the change of name , said that he would ignore the vote .	-3.0143
But the referendum ’ s advocates , including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev , argue that the name change is simply the price to pay for joining the EU and NATO .	-3.7001
The bells of St. Martin were ringing because churches in Harlem have problems .	-3.5737
" Historically , the old people with whom I spoke said that there was a bar and a church at every corner , " said Mr Adams .	-3.9397
'There is neither today nor . '	-3.2981
He said the disappearance of pubs is understandable .	-1.3957

Churches could be replaced by multi-family houses with condominiums filled with the kind of people who will not help the remaining sanctuaries in the district .	-4.1057
The overwhelming majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be aware , he said , ' and will therefore speed up the day when these churches are completely closed , as it is unlikely that most of those people who move into these condominiums will become members of those churches ' .	-6.1829

A fire in 1939 left the building badly damaged , but when Father Johnson ’ s community members made plans for reconstruction , they ordered the bell game .	-5.7216
Pastor David Johnson , son of Father Johnson and successor in St. Martin 's , proudly called the bell game " the bells of the poor . "	-7.9215
The expert who played the bell game in July called it something else : " A cultural treasure " and " an irreplaceable historical instrument " .	-3.2779
The expert , Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan , also noted that it was the first bell game in the world played by a black musician , Dionisio A. Lind , who , 18 years ago , changed to the bigger bell game at the Riverside Church .	-4.7351
Mr Merriweather said that St. Martin 's did not replace him .	-1.5720
What has happened in the last few months at St. Martin has been a complicated history of architects and builders , some of which have been brought by the Church leaders and others by the bishop ’ s office .	-6.8103

The attack took place just before seven in the morning near the beach of Beacon in Encinitas .	-2.3304
Chad Hammel said KSWB TV in San Diego , California , that he had dived with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy scream for help , and then went over with the others to rescue him from the water .	-11.4034
“ I first thought someone was happy because he caught a lobster , ” Hammel said , but then I noticed that someone said , “ I was bitten ! ”	-4.4091
I was bitten !	-2.4054
His key leg was torn up , Hammel said , he found this when he came to the boy .	-4.9562
I shouted everyone to come out of the water : " There is a shark in the water ! " said Hammel .	-4.3739
The boy was brought to the Rady Children 's Hospital in San Diego , where his condition was critically documented .	-2.5879
The shark responsible for the attack is unknown .	-2.0986

Sainsbury plans to conquer the British beauty market .	-2.1098
Sainsbury 's takes over boat , superdrug and debenham shelves with retail style beauty products , which are staffed with specialist assistants .	-6.6869
As part of an extensive push into the UK beauty market , which continues to grow and is worth $ 2.8bn , fashion and homeware sales will fall back .	-5.1885
The idea of investing in the beauty market was born from the fact that supermarkets are looking for ways to use the Regal Square , which used to be used for televisions , microwaves and household goods , for new products .	-5.3515
Sainsbury announced that the range of beauty products will be doubled to 3,000 products by including brands such as Revlon , Essie , Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time .	-3.7779
Existing ranges of L 'Oreal , Maybelline and Burt 's Bees will also be given more space in branded areas , similar to those found in shops such as Boots .	-5.7342
The supermarket chain is also resuscitating its own Boutique Makeup brand , which offers numerous vegan products that are popular among young buyers .	-6.1325
In addition , the perfume dealer Fragrance Shop is testing concessions in two Sainsbury stores , the first of which was opened last week in Croydon , South London , while a second end of this year will be opened in Selly Oak , Birmingham .	-5.2058
Online shopping and a shift toward daily purchases of small quantities of food in neighborhood stores mean that supermarkets need to do more to encourage people to visit .	-4.5867
Mike Coupe , the head of Sainsbury 's , has said that sales outlets will increasingly look like department stores , as the supermarket chain is trying to fight discounters like Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food .	-4.5165
Sainsbury 's has placed Argos Outlets in hundreds of stores and also introduced a number of habitats since it bought both chains two years ago , which allegedly strengthened food sales and made acquisitions more profitable .	-4.4385
The former attempt by the supermarket to revise its beauty and pharmacy departments ended in failure .	-3.7451
Sainsbury tested a joint venture with boats in the early 2000s , but it ended unetchieden , and earnings from pharmacies could not be shared .	-3.8206
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury 's sold its 281 subsidiary pharmacy store three years ago for GBP 125 million to Celesio , the owner of the Lloyds pharmacy chain .	-4.6221
In four Lloyds stores , the range of luxury skin care products from brands such as La Roche-Pomay and Vichy is to be expanded .	-5.3376
Paul Mills-Hicks , advertising manager of Sainsbury , said : “ We have changed the appearance of our shelves for beauty products in order to improve the equipment for our customers .	-4.5849
In addition , we have invested in the training of employees , who are to assist the customer in providing advice .	-5.9571
Our brand portfolio leaves nothing to be desired .	-2.6877

Dragons The Star Peter Jones went “ angry ” after TV presenter Holly Willoughby , who ran out of the $ 11 million contest with his lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencers and ITV .	-5.3298

Holly Willoughby made Dragons ' Den-Star Peter Jones angry for having withdrawn at the last minute from her collective lucrative lifestyle brand to focus on her own new madness contract with Marks & Spencers and ITV .	-6.0530

The deal was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow ’ s Goop brand , and Willoughby ’ s assets were expected to double , estimated at <unk> 11 million . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-7.4760
When Willoughby , 37 , announced on Instagram that she would leave Truly , Jones left Britain and flew to one of his homes .	-3.1000
One source said , " It was really high on Holly 's list of priorities . "	-3.1611
It should be their long-term future and secure it for the next few decades .	-7.4189
Their decision to withdraw left all the parties involved completely perplexed .	-5.3327
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday , just before the start .	-3.2610
" Marlow HQ has a warehouse full of goods that can be sold . "	-2.6505
Experts believe that the move of the " This Morning " moderator , one of the UK 's most bankable stars , could cost the company millions because they invested heavily in products such as pillows , candles , clothing and homewear , and because of the potential for further delays in market launch .	-5.9356
And it could mean the end of a long friendship .	-2.0434
Willoughby and his husband , Dan Baldwin , Jones and his wife Tara Capp , have been around for ten years .	-3.4614
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones , 52 , in March .	-3.3220
The couples go on holiday together and Jones has a 40 % share of Baldwin 's TV production company .	-3.8477
Willoughby is to become a trademark ambassador for M & S and replace Ant McPartlin as the host of ITV 's I 'm A Celebrity .	-2.4431
One source of information surrounding Jones said last night : ' We would not comment on his business affairs ' .	-3.9122
Tough Talk , and then we fell in love .	-1.1209

This is what Trump said in his mocked “ news spokesman . ”	-2.9276
“ I have not made any compromises ” .	-2.4524
He found Kim interested in a second meeting after Trump welcomed her first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step toward denuclearization of North Korea .	-2.6715
But the denuclearization negotiations are blocked .	-1.7150
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore , Ri Yong Ho , North Korea ’ s leading diplomat , said to United Nations leaders , Saturday ’ s General Assembly that the North sees no “ response ” from the US to North Korea ’ s early disarmament efforts .	-4.7800
Instead , he noted , the US continues the sanctions to maintain the pressure .	-3.7991
Trump took a much more optimistic stance in his Kunde speech .	-3.8422
“ We are making good progress with North Korea , ” he said .	-1.3725
“ We wanted to wage war with North Korea .	-1.5642
Millions of people would have been killed .	-0.9022
Now we have this great relationship . ”	-1.9872
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results , such as ending missile tests , freeing hostages , and returning home the remains of American soldiers .	-3.3525
And he defended his unusual approach when talking about relations with Kim .	-2.2639
" It is so easy to be presidential , but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to enter this packed arena , about 200 people would be there , " Trump said , pointing to the crowd directly in front of him .	-5.5631
In Indonesia , a tsunami and an earthquake kill hundreds and devastate an island .	-1.4455
After the earthquake in Lombok , for example , foreign non-governmental organisations were told that they were not needed .	-2.8473
Although more than 10 % of the population of Lombok has been resettled , no national disaster has been declared , a prerequisite for catalyzing international aid .	-3.9345
Summing up said : ' Unfortunately , in many cases , they have made it very clear that they do not request international aid , so it is a small challenge ' ,	-4.0698
While Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palu , it is not yet certain whether foreign staff can work on site .	-7.7167
The spokesman for the national civil protection agency , Mr Sutopo , said that Indonesian officials would assess the situation in Palu to see whether international organisations could contribute to the aid .	-6.0654
Unfortunately , given the earthquakes that Indonesia is constantly enduring , the country is not well prepared for the forces of nature .	-4.3765
While the tsunami shelters were built in Aceh , which is not common for other coastal lines .	-4.2993
The apparent absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu , though a warning was already in force , is likely to have contributed to the loss of life .	-4.5691
Even under favourable conditions , it is difficult to travel between the many islands of Indonesia .	-3.7516
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated .	-1.1906

But financing deficits have plagued Mr. Joko ’ s government , even though he faces his re-election next year .	-5.2184
Mr Joko is also under pressure from continuing religious tensions in Indonesia , where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith .	-2.2420

The statue of Cromwell ’ s Parliament will be the most recent historical monument success of the series “ Reversing History ” .	-6.7492
His exile would be poetic justice for his talib-like destruction of so many of England 's cultural and religious artifacts by his fanatical Puritan followers .	-2.9552
The Cromwell Society , however , described Mr Crick 's proposal as " folly , " and as a " attempt to rewrite history . "	-5.3826
John Goldsmith , chairman of the Cromwell Society , said this : “ Given the current debate about the removal of statues , it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell ’ s figure would be targeted before the Westminster Palace . ”	-3.6717
The storm of England 's civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell .	-3.7543
Perhaps the false Cromwell would be sacrificed for the deeds of his ancestor Thomas in the last century .	-3.1657
Sir William Hamo Thornycroft ’ s magnificent depiction of Cromwell attests to the opinion that prevailed in the 19th century and is still prevalent in parts of historiography : that Cromwell is worth celebrating .	-5.6429
Mr Goldsmith said on the Sunday Telegraph : ' Cromwell is regarded by many , perhaps more so in the late nineteenth century than today , as a defender of Parliament against external pressure , in his case , of course , the monarchy .	-4.9186
Whether this is an absolutely correct representation is the subject of continued historical debate .	-3.0634
This is certain : the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation , and Cromwell is an individually identifiable figure representing one side of the divide .	-4.2797
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth remembering and celebrating . ”	-1.7110

And Nielsen usually has some problems to capture people who look at offices .	-2.9464
To put this in perspective , it is a similar number of spectators to a Playoff football game or the Academy Awards .	-5.3108
Fox News Channel , whose presenters strongly supported the appointment of Kavanaugh , launched all networks with an average number of 5.69 million viewers during the all-day hearing .	-4.0031

Flake was partly convinced by talks with his friend , Democratic Senator Chris Coons .	-2.8345
After a conversation with Coons and various senators , Flake made his decision .	-3.6214

Scott Robinson broke with the ball , but pulled his attempt over the goal , and then Alan Lithgow could only lead his efforts away after moving Craig Halkett 's head ball over the gate .	-8.3026
The hosts agreed to let the Rangers play before themselves , knowing that they could disrupt the visitors in standard situations .	-4.2816
And that was the way the crucial gate came .	-3.0182
The Rangers admitted a blow and Livingston made an opening by combining Declan Gallagher and Robinson against Menga , who came into the penal area by hand and scored a goal from there .	-7.7235
At that time , the ball was in the possession of the Rangers most of the time , but the host ’ s impenetrable defenses prevented Liam Kelly from sweating .	-6.3953
This pattern continued until the second half , even though Alfredo Morelos forced a ball defense from Kelly .	-4.0784

He had so many heroes .	-0.8865
Captain Halkett provided an excellently organized defense , while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall kept on their toes all the time .	-6.3625
But the Rangers lacked ideas .	-1.8902
As good as they were sometimes under Gerrard , they fell far short of these standards .	-2.6708
Their last ball left something to be desired – only once did they openly cut the home team – and it is something like a wake-up call for the Rangers , who are in the middle table . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-8.8985

Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix , Las Vegas , Salt Lake City ( May benefit )	-2.7580
It is not often the case that Arizona is hit by a tropical low-pressure area , but that is exactly what is likely to happen early next week , when Hurricane Rosa ’ s last stretch of power passes through the desert to the southwest and brings potential torrential floods .	-8.6583
The National Weather Service has already released flash flut gages for Monday and Tuesday for Western Arizona in the south and east of Nevadas , in the southeast of California and Utah , including Phoenix Cities , Flagstaff , Las Vegas and Salt Lake City .	-5.1766
Rosa is likely to cross Phoenix on Tuesday and rain on late Monday .	-4.4679

America Should Double Artificial Intelligence	-2.5753
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence , the US should double its research investment , says Kai-Fu Lee , investor , and AI practitioners who have worked for Google , Microsoft , and Apple .	-5.5975
These demands arose after US officials made announcements about AI , even though the US lacks a formal AI strategy .	-3.1694
Meanwhile , China presented its plan last year : by 2030 , it wants to be the number 1 in AI innovation .	-4.2957
“ A doubling of spending on AI research would be a good start , given that all other countries are far behind the US , and a breakthrough in AI research is just around the corner , ” Lee said .	-4.4273
Doubling funding could double the chances that the next artificial intelligence achievement will be achieved in the US , said Lee CNBC in an interview this week .	-4.2282
Lee , whose book “ AI superpowers : China , Silicon Valley and the New World Order ( AI superpowers : China , Silicon Valley , and the New World Order ) ” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt , is CEO of Sinovation Ventures , a company that has invested in one of China ’ s best-known AI companies , Face + + .	-3.1742
In the 1980 ’ s , he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that defeated the highest level American Othello player , later leading Microsoft Research and President of Google ’ s Chinese branch .	-5.1541
Lee has recognized former US government technology competitions , such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency , and asked when the next one would take place to identify the next visionaries .	-3.9928
“ Researchers in the US often have to work very hard to obtain government subsidies , ” Lee said .	-3.0557
“ It is not China that is responsible for the outflow of high-level scientists , but the companies , ” Lee noted .	-3.9011
Facebook , Google , and other technology companies have hired university cork books to work on AI in recent years .	-4.3122
Lee said that a changed immigration policy could also help the US strengthen its AI efforts .	-2.7833
“ I think Green Cards should automatically be offered to PhD students in AI , ” he said .	-2.8219
In July 2017 , China ’ s Council of State presented its next-generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan .	-2.5553
China ’ s National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people in academic institutions similar to how the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to US researchers , but the quality of academic work in China is lower , Lee said .	-3.5354
Earlier this year , the US launched a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center , which will involve partners from industry and science , and the White House announced the creation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence .	-3.8815
And this month , DARPA announced an investment of $ 2 billion in an initiative called “ AI Next . ”	-2.1560
As far as the NSF is concerned , it is currently investing more than $ 100 million per year in AI research .	-2.3968
Meanwhile , US legislation aimed at creating a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has not been heard for months .	-4.9538
Macedonia votes in a referendum on whether to change the country 's name .	-2.4471
On Sunday , the people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on whether their name should be changed in the Republic of Northern Macedonia , a step that would resolve a decade-long dispute with Greece , which had blocked its accession offers to the European Union and NATO .	-4.9660
Greece , which has a province called Macedonia , insists that the name of its northern neighbour constitutes a territorial claim to the Greek territory , and has vetoed the country 's entry into NATO and the EU .	-3.4704
The two governments concluded an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name , but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavonic majority population of Macedonia .	-3.3358
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he will not vote in the referendum and , in the face of a boycott campaign , there is doubt as to whether the result will create the 50 % threshold , which is a prerequisite for the referendum to be valid .	-8.2782
The question on the referendum paper was : ' Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with the adoption of the agreement with Greece ? '	-3.0122
Advocates of the name change , including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev , argue that it is worth continuing to include Macedonia in institutions such as the EU and NATO , one of the countries to emerge from the collapse of Yugoslavia .	-3.8377
“ I came here today to vote on the future of the country ; it is a decision for the young people of Macedonia to live freely under the umbrella of the European Union , because that means a life in greater security for all of us , ” said Olivera Georgijevska , 79 , in Skopje .	-5.0431
Although not legally binding , enough Members have said that they will stick to the outcome of the vote so that it becomes decisive .	-3.8492
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament .	-2.1484
At around 1 p.m. , the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development said that there were no reports of irregularities .	-5.0460
But turnout was only 16 % – 34 % at the same time in the last general election in 2016 , and 66 % of registered voters ended up voting .	-4.5957
“ I chose because of my children – our place is in Europe , ” said Gjose Tanevski , 62 , a voter in the capital Skopje .	-2.7881
Macedonia ’ s Prime Minister Zoran Zaev , his wife Zorica , and his son Dushko have voted in favour of the referendum in Macedonia on the change in the country ’ s name , which would pave the way for accession to NATO and the European Union in Strucica , Macedonia , on 30 September 2018 .	-4.5213
In front of the parliament in Skopje , Vladimir Kavardarkov , 54 , prepared a small stage and put chairs in front of the tents that were set up by those who will boycott the referendum .	-5.1243
" We are for NATO and the EU , but we want to participate with the heads up , not through the service door , " said Kavadarkov .	-3.4122
“ We live in a poor country , but we also have our dignity .	-2.0364
If you do not want to welcome us as Macedonia , we can turn to others , such as China and Russia , to join us in Euro-Asian integration . ”	-3.8515
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia , a country with an unemployment rate of more than 20 % .	-2.3078
“ I believe a large majority will vote in favour , because more than 80 % of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO , ” Zaev declared after his vote .	-3.7069
According to him , the outcome would be “ Yes , ” a “ endorsement of our future . ”	-3.8928
Last Monday , the Macedonian Institute of Political Research published the results of a survey : between 30 and 43 % of voters would thus vote – less than necessary .	-3.2150
Another survey conducted by Macedonia ’ s Telma TV found that 57 % of respondents will vote on Sunday .	-3.0569
Of those who want to participate , 70 % voted yes .	-3.1089
The referendum is only accepted if the turnout is over 50 % .	-3.6907
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to pro-Western government policy since it took office last May .	-3.1501
Watch : Sergio Agüero of Manchester City overcomes the entire Brighton defense on his way to the gate .	-5.1346
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling completed Brighton ’ s defense at Manchester City 2-0 victory on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester , England .	-4.9584
Aguero made his 65th minute look incredibly simple .	-2.9537
At the beginning of the game , the Argentine midfield striker received a pass .	-3.9449
He tricked three defenders of Brighton to free himself .	-4.2713
Then Agüero saw himself surrounded by three green shirts .	-2.4093
He passed a defender before running several players on the edge of the Brighton Penalty .	-5.1099
Then he made a passport to the left and gave it to Sterling .	-3.8469
The English striker used his first contact to play the ball back to Agüero , who then shot right – past Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan to the right side of the gate .	-5.2188
“ Aguero has foot problems , ” said City Manager Pep Guardiola to reporters .	-2.6377
" We talked about it ; he played 55 , 60 minutes .	-2.2014
That has happened .	-1.2940
Fortunately , he shot a gate right now . ”	-3.2685
However , it was Sterling who initially led the Sky Blues at the Premier League-duel :	-5.3299
The gate came in the 29th minute .	-2.4445
In the game Aguero was played deep in the territory of Brighton .	-3.4580
with a beautiful steep pass to Leroy Sané along the left side .	-1.6664
Sane made a few touches before leading Sterling to the distant post .	-2.8589
Sky Blues played the ball forward in the net before slipping out of the field .	-4.0523

Scherzer wants to play Flanders vs. Rockies	-4.8439
Since the national games were excluded from the Playoff competition , there was not much reason to force another start .	-4.3836
But the hard-fought Scherzer hopes to be able to climb the hill on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies , but only if there are still playoff implications for the Rockies , which have a lead from a game in front of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West .	-8.5200
The Rockies secured at least one place ahead with a 5-2 victory over the national on Friday evening , but the title win in the first league is still not sure .	-5.6357
" Even if we play for free , we can at least get involved because we know that the atmosphere here in Denver with the people and the other team will probably be the best we have to offer this year .	-5.0728
Why should I not try ? '	-3.4090
The National have not yet announced a start for Sunday , but are supposedly inclined to let Scherzer throw in such a situation .	-4.1651
Scherzer , who would make his 34th start , threw an uphill tour on Thursday and threw his normal day of rest .	-4.2849

Five weeks to one of the most important elections in our lives .	-2.6911
This is one of the big ones - I am not running , but I am really running , so I fight everywhere for great candidates , he said .	-4.3950
Trump continues : “ You see this terrible , radical group of democrats , you see that it is happening right now .	-4.6848
And they are determined to regain power with all the necessary means , and they do not stop from malice and malice .	-6.5341
They do not care about who they hurt , whom they have to cross to gain power and control , that is what they want , power and control , we will not give them .	-4.8204
“ The Democrats ’ goal is to resist and block , ” he said .	-2.1744
" And you see this in the last four days , " he said and called the democrats " angry and common , evil and untrue . "	-3.8062
“ He referred in particular to the Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein , senior member of the Senate ’ s Committee on Legal Affairs , and thus picked up loud cries from the audience .	-5.6776
" Do you remember their answer ?	-1.9216
Have you read the document ?	-1.1291
No , what .	-1.1480
No , oh no , I , moment – that was really bad body language – the worst body language I have ever seen . ”	-2.9732
The Labour Party is no longer a broad community .	-1.9740
It is intolerant of those who say what they think .	-0.9178
When momentum activists in my local party voted to criticize me , it was hardly a surprise .	-2.4348
Finally , I am the last in a number of Labour MEPs to say that we are not welcome - just because we have said our opinion .	-3.9101
My group colleague , Joan Ryan , has been treated in a similar way because she has resolutely opposed anti-Semitism .	-4.1505
In my case , I have been criticised by the motion of censure because I do not agree with Jeremy Corbyn .	-2.2232
On the importance of a responsible economic policy , on national security , on Europe , ironically similar issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders .	-4.3219
The communication for the East Labour meeting in Nottingham on Friday states : ' We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive ' .	-3.4120
Most of my time in the eight years as a local Labour MEP , the GC meetings on Friday evening were exactly the same .	-4.0018
Unfortunately , it is not the tone of many meetings today , and the promise of a more ' friendly , gentler ' policy has long been forgotten , if it ever started .	-4.4553
It has become increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party , and any opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to party leaders .	-4.4561
This began shortly after Jeremy took office , because the colleagues with whom I had previously thought I had a similar political attitude expected me to make a U-turn and adopt positions with which I would never otherwise have been in agreement , whether in relation to national security or the EU internal market .	-6.6855
Whenever I speak out publicly – and it does not matter what I say – there is a tirade of abuse in the social media that calls for diselection , denounces the center ’ s policy , and tells me that I should not be in the Labour Party .	-6.2106
Not only I have experienced this experience .	-4.1581
Indeed , I know that there is more happiness than some of my colleagues , because the comments that are directed to me tend to be political .	-4.6405
I appreciate the professionalism and determination of my colleagues , who are exposed every day to a flood of sexist or racist abuse , but never shy away .	-3.9811
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the extent of abuse has normalized .	-2.1157
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance .	-1.4294
The reality is that we are no longer the broad church , and with every motion of censure or amendment of the selection rules the party is getting smaller .	-4.2825
I have received a lot of advice over the last two years to pull my neck down , not to be so vocal , and then I would be “ right . ”	-5.8107
But for that reason I did not come into politics .	-3.2813
32 years ago , as a student , I joined Labour because of the neglect of the Thatcher government , which had caused my classroom to literally collapse , so I tried to work for better public services for those who need it most , whether as a municipal council or minister .	-6.2727
I have never hidden my political views , even in the last election .	-4.9425
As far as my political positions are concerned , no one in Nottingham East should have been confused in any way , as in areas where I disagree with the current leadership .	-4.2931
To those who supported the request on Friday , I would just like to say that I do not understand why they are wasting time and energy to remain loyal to me and the Labour Party when the country is heading towards Brexit , which is damaging to households , businesses , and our public services .	-5.4629
But the only message I have is not to Nottingham 's momentum , but to my constituents , whether Labour members or not : I am proud to serve you , and I promise you that I will not stop threats of diselection or political opportunism from working in what I believe is the best interest of all of you .	-6.4937

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose : Ayr Asat the Top	-2.6426
Two late Trier may have distorted the final result , but there is no doubt that Ayr deserves to win in this wonderfully entertaining Tennent 's premier match of the day .	-4.0913
They are now the only unruly of the ten teams to table .	-4.8057
In the end , it was due to the host ’ s superior defense , but also to the fact that opportunities were better exploited .	-8.6884
" We have been tested so far by our games , and we are still unhealthy , so I must be happy , " he said .	-3.3042
Robyn Christie of Melrose said , “ Thanks to Ayr , they have made better use of their opportunities . ”	-2.5729
Grant Anderson ’ s attempt at the 14th minute , converted by Frazier Climo , brought Ayr forward , but a yellow card for Scotland ’ s Captain Rory Hughes , given for the game of Warriors , allowed Melrose to speak numbers , and Jason Baggot to get an unaltered attempt .	-6.0225
Climo put Ayr ’ s leadership in a penalty , before he scored a hit right at half point , and then went on to pursue a solo trial , with which he succeeded in winning the 17 : 5 break for Ayr .	-12.6358
However , Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson 's attempt , transformed by Baggot , reduced the lag to five points .	-3.7195
Ayr was born in New York City , New York .	-9.3700
Ayr 's current captain , Blair Macpherson , then got the yellow card , and again Melrose let the additional man pay with a non-converted Bruce Colvine trial , at the end of a curse of intense pressure .	-4.6730
However , the home side came back , and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card from Climo for a ball without a ball , MacPherson made a touchdown , the advancing Ayr in the back .	-6.1322
Climo converted , as almost after rebooting , after Kyle Rowe David Armstrongs caught Boxkick and sent the wingstorm Gregor Henry by pass to Try number five .	-6.3526

Throughout Bolivia , the memory of a coast lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the nineteenth century is still alive , as is the desire to return to the Pacific .	-4.6671
These hopes may be at their peak in decades , as Bolivia is awaiting a judgment by the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of deliberations .	-6.8733
" Bolivia has the dynamism , the spirit of unity and the serenity and naturally expects with positive view the result " , said Roberto Calzadilla , a Bolivian diplomat .	-5.6818
Many Bolivians will follow the judgment of the International Court of Justice on large screens throughout the country , and hope that the Tribunal in The Hague will favor Bolivia ’ s claim that , after decades of troubled talks , Chile will have to negotiate to grant Bolivia sovereign access to the sea .	-4.8398
For Evo Morales , Bolivia ’ s charismatic indigenous president – who will face a controversial re-election struggle next year – much depends on Monday ’ s decision .	-3.7030
“ We are about to regain access to the Pacific Ocean , ” he vowed at the end of August .	-2.2713
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to decide in favor of Bolivia , and believe that even a positive decision will not change Bolivia .	-4.2915
The Dutch UN body has no power to grant Chilean territory and has stated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks .	-4.2481
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice came into being only six months after hearing the final arguments shows that the case was ' not complicated ' , said Paz Zárate , a Chilean expert on international law .	-4.7961
Far from pushing Bolivia ’ s cause , the last four years may have postponed it .	-3.2789
“ The question of access to the sea is being used by the current Bolivian government for its purposes , ” said Zárate .	-3.6988
Morales ’ bellicose rhetoric destroyed every remaining Chilean goodwill , suggested it .	-2.8310
Bolivia and Chile will resume negotiations at some point , but it will be difficult to continue the subsequent talks .	-3.6792
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962 .	-1.2522
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé , Bolivia ’ s representative in The Hague , rejected the idea that the court had ruled unusually quickly .	-3.0544
Monday will offer Bolivia “ an exceptional opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile , ” and an opportunity to “ put an end to 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefit , ” he said .	-3.6879
Calzadilla also denied that Morales , who remains one of Latin America ’ s most popular presidents , is using the issue of sea access politically for his purposes .	-3.6847
“ Bolivia will never give up the right to access the Pacific Ocean , ” he added .	-1.4560

Very impractical hats have flooded Instagram this summer , and these designers have sent their striking creations over the catwalk .	-4.5632
The most outstanding piece of Valentino was an exaggerated beige hat decorated with a feathered wide edge that flooded the heads of the models .	-5.3674
Other oversized accessories were watermelons with jewelry , a magic hat and even a pineapple , but they are not intended to keep their heads warm .	-4.1573
Thom Browne showed a number of bizarre masks - and just in time for Halloween .	-1.4063
Many of the colorful masks had egenähte lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter rather than Haute Couture .	-4.5512
A creature resembled the diving equipment with snorkel and glasses , while another one looked like a molten ice cream .	-4.4234
And if you like this incredible fashion trend , you are lucky .	-2.7568
Stylists predict that the giant hats could make their way to the main roads near you .	-4.4438
The oversized hats are glued to the heels of " La Bomba " , the straw hat with a 60 cm wide edge , which can be seen in each of them from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski .	-5.2495
The cult label behind the highly impractical hat sprayed over social media sent another great creation on the catwalk - a straw bag that was almost as large as the bathing suit model it wore .	-5.5568
The orange velvet bag , filled with Raffia hem and a white leather handle , was the most outstanding piece in Jacquemus ' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week .	-5.7060

Independent schools in Scotland have a track record of excellence in academic excellence , which continued in 2018 with excellent results , plus individual and group successes in sports , art , music , and other collaborative ventures .	-5.8971
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland , these schools , represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools ( SCIS ) , are committed to providing the best level of service to their pupils and parents .	-4.3499
Independent schools are designed to prepare students – for further education , including at universities , for their desired careers , and for their role as a global citizen .	-5.0338
In the education sector , we have the opportunity to develop and implement a tailor-made school curriculum , while recognizing that modern languages are still popular and desirable in schools .	-5.2234
Nelson Mandela once said , “ When you talk to a person in the language he understands , you get his mind . ”	-4.0290
When you talk to him in his own language , he is heartened . ”	-4.9653
This impressively demonstrates that we cannot rely only on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries .	-3.8330
This year ’ s audit results show that languages are at the top of the tables with the highest attendance rates in independent schools .	-3.7531
68 percent of students who have studied foreign languages have achieved the so-called “ Higher grade A ” higher grade A .	-5.0951
The data collected by the SCIS ’ s 74 member schools showed that 72 % of the students reached a “ Higher grade A ” in Mandarin , while among the students learning German , French , and Spanish , they reached a grade A in 72 , 69 and 63 .	-7.0543
This shows that independent schools in Scotland promote foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future .	-2.7015
Language subjects have the same rank in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere as MINT subjects ( mathematics , information technology , science and technology ) .	-4.6404
A 2014 survey by the UK Employment and Qualifications Commission found that 17 % of the reasons why employers were struggling to fill vacancies are attributable to a lack of language skills .	-4.6832
Therefore , language skills are becoming increasingly necessary to prepare young people for their professional future .	-3.5196
These skills are essential in a globalised world , given the prospect of more jobs that languages require .	-4.7259
Regardless of the career that someone chooses when he has learned a second language , he will have a real advantage in the future with a lifelong ability like this .	-4.7778
By enabling people from abroad to communicate directly , a multilingual person will automatically be ahead of the competition .	-3.9614
According to a YouGov survey with more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013 , 75 % were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to talk , and French is the only language spoken at a two-digit percentage , namely 15 % .	-7.1349
That is why the current investment in language teaching is important for today 's children .	-3.4267
When children learn to speak several languages – especially those of developing countries – they will have a better chance of finding meaningful employment in the labor market .	-4.5332
The schools in Scotland are different in terms of their language .	-3.3547
Some schools focus on the classic modern languages , while other languages that are most important for the UK in 2020 , such as Mandarin or Japanese .	-7.6404
Whatever your child 's interests , there will always be a number of languages available in independent schools , with teachers specialized in this field .	-4.1136
Independent schools in Scotland want to provide a learning environment that prepares children well , and they want to have the necessary tools for their success , whatever the future may bring .	-5.6073
In today ’ s global business world , languages remain undeniably important for the country ’ s future , and this must also be reflected in education .	-3.9118
Indeed , modern languages should really be regarded as “ international communication skills . ”	-2.6080
Independent schools will continue to offer young people in Scotland this choice , diversity and excellence .	-2.7478
He is doing well .	-3.0055

Lakers-Trainer Luke Walton announced that James will play against the Denver nuggets in the opening season in San Diego on Sunday .	-4.5726
But how many minutes he will spend in the place is not yet decided .	-3.7308
Walton said on the official website of the Lakers : " It will be more than one and less than 48 " .	-2.1995

After the training at the beginning of this week , James was asked about his plans for the six Lakers pre-season games .	-3.9518
“ I don ’ t need pre-season games at this stage of my career to prepare me , ” he said .	-3.0282
Trump ’ s West Virginia Rally , YouTube Channel	-1.1432
President Donald Trump starts a flood of campaign events this evening in Wheeling , West Virginia .	-2.9549
It is the first of five planned election events next week , with Trump visiting the Republican-friendly states of Tennessee and Mississippi on his tour .	-4.6109
While his candidate ’ s confirmation of the vacant Supreme Court post remains pending , Trump must mobilize his electorate for the upcoming midterm elections , otherwise it is feared that the Republicans will lose a majority in Congress when elected in November .	-5.8203
When is Trump ’ s West Virginia Rally tonight and how can you view it online ?	-2.4484
Trump 's Rally in Wheeling , West Virginia , is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight , Saturday , September 29 , 2018 .	-3.6842
You can watch Trump ’ s West Virginia Rally online on YouTube via live stream .	-2.2828
Trump will certainly respond to this week ’ s hearings on allegations of sexual abuse against his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh , whose confirmation in office , which must be delivered by the Senate , has been postponed for at least one week until the FBI investigation is completed .	-6.2214
But the main objective of these election events is to mobilize the Republicans , who face a critical election in November .	-4.3946
According to Reuters , the goal of Trump ’ s campaign is to mobilize volunteers and supporters in next week ’ s five election events to defend and expand the majority of Republicans in the Senate and House of Representatives .	-4.0914
“ The majority in Congress is on the president ’ s agenda first , so he visits as many states as possible shortly before the start of the turbulent election season , ” said Reuters , a Trump campaign spokesman who does not want to be named .	-5.9919
According to the West Virginia MetroNews radio network , this evening ’ s Wesbanco Arena election event in Wheeling could attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract the attention of the Pittsburg media .	-9.4373
On Saturday , Trump will visit West Virginia , the state he won in 2016 with more than 40 percentage points , for the second time this month .	-2.5688
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for West Virginia Senate , Patrick Morrisey , who is lagging behind in the polls .	-2.6857
According to Reuters , Simon Haeder , a political scientist at the University of West Virginia , said that it was not a good sign for Morrisey that the president had to come to improve his polls .	-3.6611
Ryder Cup 2018 : Team USA is ready to fight to maintain hope for Sunday ingles .	-3.7194
After three one-sided encounters , the four-game on Saturday afternoon was probably exactly what the Ryder Cup needed .	-4.1131
The swinging pendulum is a freely invented sports concept that players have internalized , especially in competitions like this .	-4.4288
So where would they say the momentum now ?	-2.7458
“ They had a six-point lead , and now there are four , so it gives us some momentum , ” Jordan Spieth said when he withdrew for the day . ”	-4.8325
Europe is , of course , ahead with four points , and twelve more are to be played .	-8.4169
But Americans , as Spieth says , feel a little wind in their sails and there was much encouraging for them , not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas , who played all day together and each has three out of four points .	-4.6080
Spieth was superior from the outset and set a good example .	-3.4668
These keepy cheerleaders became louder when his round went on , he threw a decisive putt to win a draw in game 4 , after he and Thomas fell 2 points after 2 games .	-9.5232
His joy at the putt on the 15th hole with which they won the game was so thought that he still believed in the victory of Americans .	-7.6961
" You really have to concentrate and worry about your own game , " said Spieth .	-3.6689
This is all that remains for each of these players .	-3.4998
18 holes to leave impression .	-5.1615
In the last two days , Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood were undeniably the only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas .	-3.5104
Europe ’ s strange but admirable couple is playing faultless and simply doing everything right .	-4.7351
" Moliwood " was the only couple who did not reach a bogey on Saturday afternoon , but they also avoided it on Saturday morning , Friday afternoon and on Friday morning the back nine .	-5.4668
This course and the way in which its energy seems to flow to and from this crazy audience makes it a favorite on Sunday and when the sun goes down over Le Golf National , there would be no more popular player who seals a possible European victory than Fleetwood or Molinari .	-7.1010
Probably both at the same time at different holes .	-2.1959
To speak of a European victory would be too hasty .	-3.3471
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short trial with Sergio Garcia , who was victorious with his partner Alex Noren in the morning .	-3.1535
With a bogey and two Doubles at the first nine , the Spaniards and the Swedish dug into a hole from which they never came out again .	-7.1396
On Sunday there is no one who helps you out of your hole .	-3.5066
Because of the interactions between the pairs , the given advice , the non-given advice and the way in which a strategy can change in the blink of an eye , it is very fascinating to observe the Fourballs and Foursomes at close range .	-5.7843
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken a clear lead in the last day , but this Foursome-session has also shown that the team USA has the desire to fight , which some , especially Stateside , have doubted .	-6.5776
Europe Leads 10-6 Ryder Cup Final Day	-8.2591
Europe will use a solid advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup , having emerged from the four and four games on Saturday with a 10-6 lead over the United States .	-4.6672
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the group with two wins over a struggling Tiger Woods to score four points in the Le Golf National .	-3.3236
The European team of Thomas Bjorn , who had lost the trophy two years ago in Hazeltine , dominated an American team struggling with suspenders in the murder of Fourballs , and won the series with 3-1 .	-8.0499
The US offered more resistance in the fours and won two games , but it could not digest the deficit .	-2.6419
Jim Furyk 's team needs eight points from the 12 individual matches on Sunday to keep the trophy .	-4.7051
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four consecutive points , while Molinari and Molinari are just the second pair to win four points from their first four games in the history of the Ryder Cup .	-4.4165
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed in the Fourballs , it was considered certain that they would beat an sobering Woods and the American rookie Bryson Dechambeau by an even clearer 5 & 4 .	-4.6409
Woods , who ran through two games on Saturday , occasionally showed brilliant actions , but has now lost 19 of his 29 games in quadrilateral and fourfold , and seven in succession .	-7.1485
Justin Rose , excited for the morning Fourballs , returned to his partner Henrik Stenson in the Foursomes and beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka in a 2 & 1 defeat – place one and three in the world .	-4.4525
On a pleasant , airy day southwest of Paris , however , Europe did not have it in its own way .	-2.3888
Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the standard for Americans on Saturday with two points .	-4.0310
They won a courageous 2 : 1 victory against the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-pack , and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 : 3 in the four-pack after losing the first two holes .	-4.5974
Only twice in the Ryder Cup story a team returns from a four-point deficit to singles , although Holder Furyk 's side only needs a draw to keep the trophy .	-4.6049
After two days of second best time , however , a Sunday counter looks as if he would go beyond it .	-5.0564
North Korea says that there will be “ by no means ” unilateral disarmament without confidence .	-2.4587
North Korea ’ s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions would deepen his mistrust of the United States , and that under no circumstances would the country unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons .	-3.9234
Ri Yong Ho told the world 's annual general assembly that last year North Korea took " significant goodwill " measures , such as stopping nuclear and missile tests , dismantling the nuclear test site , and the obligation not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology .	-5.7817
" There is no such answer from the USA , " he said .	-3.2752
“ Without any confidence in the US , there will be no confidence in our national security , and in such circumstances there is no way that we can first disarm unilaterally . ”	-3.8712
While Ri retracted North Korea ’ s well-known complaints about Washington ’ s opposition to a “ gradual ” approach to denuclearization , in which North Korea would be rewarded with gradual steps , his explanation seemed important in that it did not completely reject unilateral denuclearization , as Pyongyang has done in the past .	-10.6669
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at a first summit in Singapore on June 12 , between a incumbent US president and a North Korean leader , when Kim undertook to work toward “ denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula , ” while Trump promised guarantees of North Korea ’ s security .	-4.7178
North Korea sought a formal end to the Korean War 1950-53 , but the United States said that Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons .	-3.0839
Washington has also resisted calls for a relaxation of tough international sanctions against North Korea .	-2.7196
The US insists on denuclearization first ( first denuclearization ) and increases the pressure through sanctions to achieve its purpose in a compelling way , even rejecting the " Declaration of the end of the war , " Ri said .	-5.1656
" The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a dream of the people who are ignorant of us .	-2.7742
But the problem is that continued sanctions exacerbate our mistrust . ”	-2.2921
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump , which the US president highlighted at the United Nations earlier this week .	-3.6225
Instead , the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added : " If the party were South Korea and not the US on this issue of denuclearization , the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have reached such a dead end . "	-5.4195
Nevertheless , the tone of Ri ’ s speech was dramatically different from last year ’ s report to the U.N. The General Assembly , which targeted the US mainland with North Korea ’ s missiles , was inevitable after “ Mr. Evil President ” Trump called Kim “ rocket man ” on a suicide mission .	-5.0286
This year at the United Nations , Trump , who threatened last year to “ completely destroy ” North Korea , praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm , but he also said that much work still needed to be done , and sanctions must remain in place until North Korea crushed denuclearization .	-4.2386
On Wednesday , Trump said that he had no time frame for it , saying , " It doesn 't matter whether it takes two years , three years , or five months . "	-4.2081
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken .	-1.6920
However , in the United States , Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo said to the United Nations Security Council on Thursday that ' the enforcement of Security Council sanctions must be pursued vigorously and without any shortage until we achieve complete , definitive and verified denuclearization ' .	-6.3016
Since 2006 , the Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea to prevent the financing of Pyongyang ’ s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes .	-7.8126
Pompeo met Ri on the margins of the UN General Assembly and then said that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit .	-2.9409
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year , but his last trip was not a good one .	-2.9037
He left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made , and only a few hours later North Korea condemned him for “ gang-like demands . ”	-4.0796
This month , at a meeting with Moon , North Korea promised to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the United States ' takes ' appropriate action ' .	-4.8522
He said that Kim told him that the ' appropriate measures ' he sought were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and steps to normalize relations with Washington .	-4.0272
Harvard students take part in the course to find enough rest .	-3.4644
With a new course at Harvard University this year , all students get more sleep to fight against the growing macho culture of studying caffeine " night spent " .	-4.7526
A scientist has found that students at a world leading university are often unsuspecting when it comes to helping themselves , even when it comes to very simple mechanisms .	-4.0167
Charles Czesler , a professor of sleeping medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women 's Hospital , designed the course that he thought was the first of his kind in the US .	-7.9176
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the effects of sleep deficiency on learning .	-3.5126
In the end , a girl came to me and said , " Why is this only now , in my final year , being told ?	-4.6773
She said that you never told anyone about the meaning of sleep – which surprised me , ” he told the telegraph .	-4.0725
The course , which is offered for the first time this year , explains the students how good sleeping habits promote academic and sporting performance and improve their general well-being .	-5.1656
Paul Barreira , professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School , and Managing Director of the University ’ s Health Service , said that the university decided to introduce the course after having found that students had slept extremely little during the week .	-5.1751
The 1-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks .	-2.8726
In a section , there is a picture of a sleeping bag in which students click on coffee cups , curtains , trainers and books to be informed about the effects of caffeine and light , and how sports performance is affected by lack of sleep and the importance of a sleeping routine .	-6.1925
Another section explains how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack , stroke , depression , and cancer .	-2.7355
A map of the campus with interactive symbols encourages participants to reflect on their daily lives .	-2.6992
We know that it will not change the behaviour of students immediately .	-2.4150
" But we believe that they have a right to do so - just as you have a right to know the health effects of the decision to smoke cigarettes , " Prof. Czesler added .	-9.3132
The culture of pride still exists , he said , and added that modern technology and increasing pressure on pupils and students to take sleep is a growing problem .	-5.6463
Having enough sleep of good quality should be a student 's " secret weapon " to fight stress , exhaustion , and fear , he said - also not to take away because sleep deprivation puts the brain into starvation mode and makes it constantly hungry .	-6.1098
Raymond So , a 19-year-old Californian who studied chemical and physical biology , helped Professor Czesler design the course after visiting one of his classes at Harvard last year .	-4.1169
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to push for a campus-wide course .	-2.7680
The next step , he hopes , is to ask all doctoral students to complete a similar study programme before entering the university of competition .	-4.7626
Prof. Czisler recommended that students set an alarm when they should go to bed and when they should wake up , and be aware of the harmful effects of the " blue light " broadcast by electronic screens and LED lighting that can bring their zirkadian rhythm to the beat , causing problems when they sleep .	-7.9680
Livingston 1-0 Rangers : Mengas Goal Erstet Gerrard Men	-2.4297
Further Upward problems of the Rangers : After a hit by Dolly Menga , Livingston suffered 1-to-0 defeat for the unlucky team of Steven Gerrard .	-6.5551
The Ibrox team wanted to record their first victory in St. Johnstone since the 4 : 1 triumph in February , but Gary Holt ’ s team added Gerrard ’ s second defeat in 18 games as a coach who left his team eight points behind the disappointed Ladbrokes premiership Hearts .	-6.6716
Menga landed a hit seven minutes before the midpoint , and an inspiring Rangers list did not look like it could strike a balance .	-7.2707
While the Rangers now fall back to sixth place , Livingston climbed to third rank and are only behind Hibernian because of the difference in goal .	-5.7986
New difficulties for the Rangers are emerging , as scheduled judges Calum Spence had to be given a head wound after being hit by a throwing item – apparently thrown out of the fans sector .	-8.3974
Gerrard made eight changes to the side , passing Ayr , and immediately entered the semi-final of the Betfred Cup .	-5.5159
Holt , on the other hand , raised the same Livi-Elf that took the Hearts down one point last week , and he is likely to have been thrilled by the way his well-trained team never gave the opponents room for action at any time .	-8.9762
The Rangers dominated ball ownership , but Livingston made better use of opportunities .	-4.7021
They should have met after only two minutes when Mengas sent first offshoot Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor 's goal , but the midfield player lost his big change at the gate .	-6.8292
A deep blow from Keaghan Jacobs then went to Captain Craig Halkett , but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only shoot far in the direction of the back post .	-4.8866
The Rangers took control , but it seemed to give more hope than weeping into their own game , in the last third .	-4.3413
At the end of the first quarter of an hour , Alfredo Morelos clearly believed that he had earned an penalty after colliding with Steven Lawless , but the referee Steven Thomson did not respond to the appeals of the Colombian .	-6.5402
The Rangers arrive only two shots in the first half , but the former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was hardly able to get away from the rest of Lassana Coulibalys head jump and the hit of a bisslose Ovie Ejaria .	-5.8243
Even though Livi ’ s inaugural meeting may have been contrary to the course of the game in the 34th minute , no one can deny that they deserve it alone for their efforts .	-5.8214
Again , the Rangers failed to cope with an Jacobs standard situation .	-3.8936
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher Scott Robinson played the ball , keeping the rest and picking Menga for a simple finish .	-4.0638
Gerrard acted during the break when he exchanged Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the change immediately affected the game when the wyvern player played to Morelos , but the impressive Kelly ran away from his line to block .	-4.9934
But Livingston always attracted guests to play the very kind of game they like , with Lithgow and Halkett running long balls .	-7.9876
Holt ’ s team could have expanded their leadership in the final phase , but McGregor stood up to refuse Jacobs before Lithgow headed out of the corner .	-5.4833
The Rangers ’ representative Glenn Middleton had yet another late claim to a penalty because he was hiding with Jacobs , but once again he looked away at Thomson .	-6.6784
Almanac : The Inventor of the Geiger Counter	-2.6718
And now one side from our almanac “ Sunday morning ” : 30 September 1882 , that was more than 136 years ago ... The day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm , called Hans , Geiger was born in Germany .	-3.8498
Geiger developed a method for recognizing and measuring radioactivity , an invention that eventually produced the instrument known as the Geigermeter .	-3.8605
Since then , the Geiger counter has also become a mainstream of science , as in the 1950 's of the film " Bells of Coronado " , which attracted seemingly improbable cowplay scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans :	-6.4593
Man : ' What about everything in the world is that ? '	-2.4098
Rogers : “ It is a Geiger counter that is used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium .	-5.5297
If you set up these headphones , you can actually hear the effects of the atoms released by radioactivity in the minerals . ”	-3.3769
Evans : “ Tell me , but now it ’ s huge ! ”	-6.3097
Hans Geiger died in 1945 , just a few days before his 63th birthday .	-2.0421
But the invention that bears its name continues to be used .	-2.8803
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “ see ” malignant cells .	-1.6076
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to " see " and kill malignant cells .	-1.6222
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of the treatment .	-1.8914
The procedure includes the extraction of immune cells from a patient , modification of this in the laboratory .	-3.5121
You can then see a protein that is common to many types of cancer and then inject it again .	-3.0569
A study vaccine shows promising results in patients with a number of cancers .	-2.9584
A woman treated with the vaccine that helps the immune system detect rogue cells saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months .	-2.8547
The method is to extract immune cells from a patient , modify them in the laboratory , so that a protein called HER2 becomes “ visible ” , which occurs in many cancers , and then re-inject the cells .	-4.4238
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda , Maryland said : ' Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine . '	-2.1011
HER2 “ promotes the growth of different types of cancer ” , including breast , ovarian , lung and bowel cancer , explained Prof. Berzofsky .	-3.0626
A similar approach to removing immune cells from patients and teaching them how to attack cancer cells has worked in treating some kind of leukemia .	-3.7627
After his performance on Saturday Night Live , Kanye West , dressed with MAGA cap , released a pro-Trump tirade .	-3.4339
It didn ’ t Work	-2.9074
Kanye West was featured in a Saturday Night Live broadcast in the studio after an outspoken speech praising the US , and President Donald Trump said he would in in . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-8.6298
Having performed his third night song , Ghost Town , while wearing a Make America Great cap , he attacked the Democrats and reaffirmed his support for Trump .	-3.8470
" As often as I speak to a white person , she says , “ How can you like Trump , he is a racist ? ”	-3.0407
Well , if I were concerned about racism , I would have left America a long time ago , " he said .	-3.3498
The Saturday night live show started with a sketch in which Hollywood-star Matt Damon made fun of Brett Kavanaugh 's statement to the Senate Justice Committee about Christine Blasey Ford 's allegations that Kavanaugh had sexually coerced her .	-5.0092
Although it was not broadcast , the film material by Wests Geschwätz was shared by the comedian Chris Rock in the social media .	-4.9213
It is unclear whether Rock has tried to ridicule West with the contribution .	-4.6386
West , too , complained to the audience that he had been hard behind the stage for his headdress .	-4.8283
" They harassed me behind the stage .	-1.7794
They said : ' Do not go out with your hat ' .	-4.8960
You annoyed me !	-2.3019
And then they say that I am in a given place , " he said , according to the Washington Examiner .	-2.6145
West continued : " Want to see the sunken place ? " and said that he would " attract my Superman cloak because that means you cannot tell me what to do , you want the world to move forward ?	-8.1279
Try it with love . ”	-1.4613
His comments were received at least twice by the audience with boobs , and the comedians of Saturday Night Live seemed to be embarrassed , Variety reported and quoted a person saying , “ The whole studio was totenst. ”	-5.5948
West was later replaced by singer Ariana Grande , whose former friend , rapper Mac Miller , died a few days ago .	-3.0319
West surprised many with a performance of the song " I Love it " , dressed as a Perrier Bottle .	-2.3496
West received support from the leader of the conservative group TPUSA , Candace Turner , who tweeted : " This is for one of the most courageous spirits : THANK YOU THAT YOU DICH THE MAFIA WIDERSETZT HAST . "	-5.2693
But Talkmasterin Karen Hunter tweeted that West is simply " that 's what he is , and that is absolutely wonderful " .	-5.1487
“ But I will not reward anyone ( by buying his music or clothing or supporting his art ) , who I believe will adopt and spread an ideology that is harmful to my community . ”	-4.5638
It is free .	-0.7309
We also added , " she added .	-2.9457
Before the show , the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and is now called “ the being formaly known as Kanye West ” .	-3.6154
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy , also known as Puff Daddy , Puffy and P Diddy .	-3.5042
Mitrapper Snoop Dogg had the name Snoop Lion and of course that of the later music legend Prince , changed his name into a symbol and then the artist who was formerly known as Prince .	-3.9992

" Game of Thrones " -Star Kit Harington Lives Toxic Männlichkeit	-9.9805
Kit Harington is known for his heavy swinging role as Jon Snow in the brachial medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones by HBO .	-3.0913
But the actor , 31 , has been annoyed by the stereotype of the macho and said that such roles on the screen lead to small boys often feeling that they need to be tough to be respected .	-5.7181
Kit said to " The Sunday Times Culture " , he believed that something went wrong and asked how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the <unk> MeToo era .	-3.6739
Kit , who recently married his co-star Rose Leslie , also 31 , admitted that he thought it was very important to solve the problem .	-2.8199
I personally feel quite strong at the moment - what have we done wrong with masculinity ? , he said .	-3.3054
What have we taught men in their youth about the problem we are now seeing ?	-3.5273
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for the rise of toxic mascularity through its very masculine characters .	-4.1679
He continues : What is innate and what is taught ?	-1.8095
What is taught on television and on the street gives the little boy the feeling that they must have this particular side of being a man ?	-4.4083
I think that is really one of the big questions in our time – how can we change that ?	-3.5194
It seems that something has gone wrong for young men .	-3.0321
In the interview , he also admitted that he would not make a Game of Throne ’ s predecessors or missions when the series comes to an end next summer , adding that he was finished with Battlegrounds and Horses .	-7.3572

HIV / AIDS : China reports a 14 % increase in new cases	-1.7907
China has reported an increase of 14 % among fellow citizens living with HIV and AIDS .	-2.5826
According to the health authorities , 820,000 people are affected in the country .	-2.0208
In the second quarter of 2018 alone , 40,000 new cases were reported .	-1.4140
In the vast majority of new cases , the virus has been transmitted through sexual activity , which is a change from the past .	-4.1142
Typically , HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions .	-3.1646
But the number of people affected by HIV was reduced to almost zero , Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province .	-3.6459
However , compared to last year , the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has risen by 100,000 .	-3.4464
The transmission of HIV through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community .	-1.8961
Homosexuality has not been a crime in China since 1997 , but discrimination against LGBT people is widespread .	-1.9174
Studies estimate that 70 – 90 % of men who have sex with men eventually marry women because of the country ’ s conservative values .	-2.8814
These diseases are often transmitted through unprotected sex .	-1.4431
In 2003 , China ’ s government promised universal access to HIV drugs in an attempt to contain the problem .	-2.3835
Maxine Waters denies that an employee read the data of GOP senators , criticizes the allegations as “ dangerous lies ” and “ conspiracy theories . ”	-3.5890
On Saturday , US MP Maxine Waters rejected claims that one of her employees should have published personal data from three Republican US senators on legislators ’ Wikipedia pages .	-5.6554
Los Angeles based democrat believes that the claims have been launched by members of the ultra-left wing and through websites .	-5.5445
" Lies , lies , and even more repugnant lies , " says Waters on Twitter .	-4.9445
The information published included , reportedly , the private addresses and telephone numbers of US Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina , as well as US senators Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch , both from Utah .	-4.2364
The information appeared Thursday online , posted by an unknown person on the Capitol Hill during a hearing of the Senate on allegations of sexual misconduct against the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh .	-3.6532
The data of the three senators were published shortly after the survey of Kavanaugh .	-2.5707
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with Waters ' office and the information published by an employee of Waters Hill .	-5.4358
“ This unfounded charge is completely wrong and an absolute lie , ” Waters continued .	-3.8873
“ The employee of my employees – whose identity , personal information , personal data , and security were compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false claims – was in no way responsible for the fact that this information was read .	-4.7577
This unsubstantiated claim is completely wrong and an absolute lie .	-3.5234
Waters ’ statement quickly led to online criticism , including by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer .	-4.5281
“ The fact that the matter is being denied is extremely annoying , ” Fleischer wrote .	-3.8502
“ This suggests that she is unsuitable as a member of the Congress .	-3.6896
When someone is accused of doing something , he must not be angry .	-2.8156
They must not be complacent .	-3.0112
You must not question the motives of the plaintiff .	-1.7834
They must be calm and calm . ”	-3.2491
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters ’ response to Democrats ’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh , who was accused by critics of appearing too angry during Thursday ’ s hearing .	-3.6685
Omar Navarro , a Republican candidate who ran in midterm elections alongside the waterless , also expressed his thoughts on Twitter .	-5.0220
" Big , if true " , he getweetet .	-3.3390
In her statement , Waters said that her office " informed the competent authorities and law enforcement authorities of the fraudulent claims .	-3.8150
“ We will ensure that the perpetrators are caught and held accountable for their acts , which have a destructive and dangerous effect on my staff , ” she continued .	-4.3162
Review of " Johnny English – You live only three times " – poorly occupied parody with Rowan Atkinson .	-3.4677
It is tradition to seek clues in any new film with a British tendency to Brexit , and that seems to be applicable to this revival of the Johnny English Action-comedy spoof franchise , which began with Johnny English in 2003 and was re-launched in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn .	-6.2781
Is the ironic self-satire about humanity on the edge of the abyss the nation ’ s new export possibility ? , , or , ? . , , , , and are . , , , and are .	-9.5894
In any case , for the second time , the glorious , rubber-loving , and incompetent Johnny English has been granted the license to redeploy things .	-7.5136
He is , of course , the stupid secret agent who , despite his bizarre claims of smoothie glamour , has received a little clouseau , a sprinter Mr. Bean and a kick from this guy , and who has contributed a single note to the firecar ’ s signature melody at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London .	-7.7102
It is also based on the traveller and international , mysterious Atkinson , who once participated in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV shows , always leaving chaos behind .	-5.2078
There are one or two beautiful moments in this latest Johnny English comedy .	-3.1343
I loved Johnny English , who , in a medieval armour , is approaching a helicopter and the main gate is beating his helmet .	-5.5306
Atkinson 's talent for body comedy is to be seen , but the humor feels rather weak and strangely superfluous , especially as the " serious " film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible self-consciously offer comedy as an ingredient .	-4.3419
The humor feels as if he is directed at children rather than adults , and for me the crazy misfortunes of Johnny English are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson ’ s Mr. Bean films .	-5.2118
The perpetual premise is that Britain is in great trouble .	-3.1093
A cyber hacker infiltrated Britain ’ s highly secret network of spies and revealed the identity of all British agents on the ground , to the horror of the serving agent – a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon .	-4.3950
It ’ s the last straw for a prime minister , who is a pompous and struggling personality , and who is already experiencing a complete meltdown of political unpopularity . Emma Thompson is doing her best with this quasi-ter, , but there is not much in the script to work with .	-7.6502
Their intelligence advisers inform them that , as each active spy has been compromised , it must take someone out of retirement .	-4.8804
And that means the rabbit Johnny English himself , who is currently employed as a school master in a noble institution , but gives unsurpassed lessons about how to operate as an undercover agent : some nice gags here , while English offers a School of Rock Academy on espionage .	-6.1920
English is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency war and is reunited with his former long-suffering mate Bough , again played by Ben Miller .	-5.0725
Bough is now a married man who meets a submarines commander , an overtired , burschikosh role in which Vicki Pepperdine is not quite prominent .	-7.5110
So , the Batman and Robin of Chaos at the Secret Service of her Majesty are back in action and meet at Olga Kurylenkos beautiful Femme Fatale Ophelia Bulletova .	-3.5130
Meanwhile , the prime minister is dangerously caught by the charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain ’ s computer problems : the sinister Jason Volta , played by Jake Lacy .	-3.3611
English and Bough start their odyssey of the colourful Highjinks : As a waiter dressed , they ignite a French flash-restaurant ; they create chaos by smuggling luxury yachts on board Voltas ; and English triggers pure anarchy when he tries to familiarize himself with a virtual reality headset with the interior of Volta 's house .	-6.2120
All the registers have certainly been drawn for this last sequence , but as adorable and neglected as it is , the whole is reminiscent of children 's television .	-7.2642
Quite moderately .	-2.1631
And , as with the other Johnny English movies , I could not fail to think : can the British film industry not give Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice to his talent ?	-5.1715
Labour denies having developed a plan for Britain for a four-day week for which five days are paid .	-3.3756
Jeremy Corbyn ’ s Labour Party is considering a radical plan in which Britons work only four days a week but are paid for five .	-3.2294
According to reports , the party wants business leaders to pass on the savings made by the artificial intelligence ( AI ) revolution to workers by giving them an extra day .	-4.4326
Staff would enjoy a three day weekend - but still bring the same money home .	-3.8092
Sources said the idea would " fit " with the party 's economic agenda and plans to tilt the country for the benefit of workers .	-3.6202
The trade union congress approved the changeover to a four-day week as an opportunity for workers to use the changing economy .	-4.1622
A senior Labour source said the Sunday Times : a policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year .	-3.7505
A four-day week is a goal that is consistent with the party ’ s approach to restoring economic balance to workers and the party ’ s general industrial strategy , but that goal will not be realisable overnight .	-5.6356
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea , as the Green Party promised a four-day working week during its campaign in 2017 .	-3.1033
However , the whole Labour Party does not currently support this move .	-4.0360
A Labour spokesman said : ' A four-day week is not party politics and is not the party 's intention ' .	-3.1914
Chancellor of the Exchequer John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to give concrete expression to his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy .	-3.8228
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to regain the power of ' faceless directors ' and ' profiteers ' in utilities .	-2.5824
The shadow Chancellor 's plans also mean that the current shareholders of water companies may not get their full share back , as a Labour government could " withdraw " because of alleged misbehavior .	-7.0457
He also confirmed the plans to call employees into company management and create inclusive ownership funds to distribute 10 % of the equity of private sector companies to employees receiving annual dividends of up to <unk> 500 .	-4.5343
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk in “ 60 Minutes ” about whether the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their mind .	-2.8053
An ongoing FBI investigation into allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote on the appeal of the judge to the Supreme Court by at least one week , and raises the question of whether the FBI ’ s findings might prompt Republican senators to give up their support for Kavanaugh .	-5.9871
In a Sunday interview , Scott Pelley , correspondent for “ 60 Minutes , ” asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI ’ s findings could persuade them to change their minds .	-3.9743
Kennedy appeared more open-minded than his colleague from South Carolina .	-1.6579
“ In any case , ” Kennedy said .	-1.4998
" I said at the beginning of the hearing that I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh .	-2.1579
I called him after it happened after that claim came out , I said : ' Have you done it ? '	-4.8511
He was determined , targeted , unequivocal . '	-2.9468
However , Graham 's voice seemed to be set in stone .	-3.6622
" I have an opinion about Brett Kavanaugh and it would need a bombing , " he said .	-2.8216
“ Dr. Ford , I don ’ t know what happened , but I know that Brett vehemently denied the charge , ” Graham added with a reference to Christine Blasey Ford .	-3.8672
" No one she called could confirm it .	-2.8266
It is 36 years ago .	-1.1098
I see nothing new that is changing . '	-2.6222
'What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done to reduce poverty ? '	-2.7297
This Saturday , the Global Citizen Festival takes place in New York , an annual music event with an impressive selection of stars and an equally impressive mission to end poverty in the world .	-3.3091
This year ’ s seventh Global Citizen Festival will bring together tens of thousands of people at the Great Lawn in Central Park to experience not only stars like Janet Jackson , Cardi B , and Shawn Mendes , but also to highlight the true goal of the event : ending extreme poverty by 2030 .	-4.2152
The Global Citizen Festival , which took place in 2012 , is an extension of the Global Poverty Project , an international interest group that aims to combat poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it .	-3.6563
In order to receive a free ticket for the event , the concert visitors had a whole series of tasks or " actions " , such as voluntary work , an e-mail to a world leader , a telephone call or other useful ways to raise the goal of poverty reduction and raise awareness of it .	-7.2587
But how successful has Global Citizen been with 12 remaining years to achieve its goal ?	-3.1170
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a real way to convince people to call for action , or simply another case of so-called " clicktivism " - people who feel as if they are making a real difference by signing an online petition or an online application or by sending a tweet ?	-5.9943
Global Citizen says that since 2011 , it has recorded more than 19 million “ actions ” from its supporters , which have pushed for a variety of different objectives . , , , and are .	-7.9114
It is said that these actions have motivated world leaders to make financial and political commitments worth more than $ 37 billion , which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion by 2030 .	-3.6130
At the beginning of 2018 , the group launched 390 stakes and announcements from its actions , with at least $ 10 billion already paid or financed .	-4.4018
The group estimates that the funds allocated so far have had a direct impact on almost 649 million people around the world .	-7.7199
One of the most important commitments is The Power of Nutrition , a UK-based partnership of investors and executive organizations committed to “ helping children develop their full potential . ” The organization has pledged to help Rwanda end domestic malnutrition with $ 35 million after Global Citizen has received more than 4,700 tweets .	-5.9314
“ With the support of the British Government , donors , other state governments , and global citizens like you , we can ensure that the social injustice of malnutrition is one day history , ” The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman announced to the crowd in a live concert in London in April 2018 .	-4.5559
The group also said that , after more than 5,000 actions in the United Kingdom aimed at improving maternal and child nutrition , the government will finance the " Power of Nutrition " project with 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions .	-4.9518
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on her website , “ Why do you think that we can end extreme poverty ? ”	-2.6074
Global citizens replied : it will be a long and difficult path - sometimes we will fall and fail .	-3.2039
Like the great civil rights and the anti-apartheid movements before us , we will succeed , because we are more powerful together .	-6.2830
will feature the stars Janet Jackson , Weakeld , Shawn Mendes , Cardi B and Janelle Monáe at this year ’ s New York event , hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman .	-4.3403
US could use the Navy to erect a “ blockade ” to impede Russian energy exports – Minister of the Interior .	-3.7674
Washington can use its navy “ if necessary ” to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets , including in the Middle East , US Secretary of the Interior , Ryan Zinke , is quoted by the Washington Examiner .	-4.3177
Zinke suggested that Russia ’ s involvement in Syria – particularly in activities at the invitation of the legitimate government – is a pretext for exploring new energy markets .	-4.5455
“ I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is as follows : they want to negotiate energy , just as they do in Eastern Europe , the southern part of Europe , ” he said .	-3.1401
And , according to officials , there are ways and means to deal with it .	-3.8761
" The United States has this ability to ensure that the sea routes are open with our navy and , if necessary , to block to ensure that their energy does not come onto the market , " he said .	-5.6651
Zinke spoke to the participants of an event of the Consumer Energy Alliance , a non-profit organization that calls itself the “ voice of energy consumers ” in the US .	-3.6297
He compared Washington ’ s approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran , and found that they are indeed the same .	-3.3129
" The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less to use and replace fuels , " he said , while calling Russia a " one-Trick Point " with an economy dependent on fossil fuels .	-4.2890
The opinions come while the Trump administration was on the mission of boosting exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe and replacing Russia , the much more favorable option for European consumers .	-4.6959
As a result , members of the Trump administration – including US President Donald Trump himself – are trying to persuade Germany to stop the “ inappropriate ” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project that , according to Trump , would turn Berlin into Moscow ’ s “ prisoner . ”	-3.9936
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $ 11 billion pipeline Nord Stream 2 , which is supposed to double existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres , is a purely economic project .	-3.3520
The Kremlin argues that Washington ’ s opposition to the project is simply economic , and an example of unfair competition .	-2.6949
“ I believe we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument for exerting pressure , and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers , ” said the Russian energy minister , Aleksandr Novak , after a meeting with US energy minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September .	-3.8087
The US stance has provoked a backlash from Germany , which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project .	-3.7986
Germany ’ s leading industrial organization , the Federal Association of German Industries ( BDI ) , has called on the US to distance itself from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow .	-3.4254
" I have a big problem when a third state intervenes in our energy supply , " said the Federal Association of German Industry ( BDI ) , Dieter Kempf , after a meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin .	-3.6790
Elizabeth Warren Will Take Hard Look At Running For President in 2020 , Massachusetts Senator Says	-1.3827
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would seriously consider running the presidency after the mid-term election .	-2.8981
During a council meeting in Holyoke , Massachusetts , Warren confirmed that she would consider running .	-2.0381
" It is time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government , and that includes a woman at the top , " she said , according to The Hill .	-2.7693
After 6 November , I will take a serious look at the presidential candidacy .	-2.8615
Warren charged President Donald Trump during his RautthausMeetings and said that he is leading " that country in the wrong direction " .	-6.1347
" I am very concerned about what Donald Trump does with our democracy , " she said .	-1.9117
Warren has not spoken a hand in criticising Trump and his Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh .	-4.1611
Warren said in a tweet on Friday : ' Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote ' .	-2.9881
However , a poll published on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren ’ s own voters do not believe that it should run in 2020 .	-3.0573
According to a poll by Suffolk University Political Research Center / Boston Globe , 58 % of the " likely " Massachusetts voters said that the senator should not stand .	-3.6398
Thirty-two per cent supported such a run .	-1.9110
The survey showed more support for a run by former Governor Deval Patrick , with 38 % for a potential run , and 48 % against .	-3.3368
Other high-profile Democrats who are being discussed with a view to a possible candidacy in 2020 are former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders .	-4.0787
The Associated Press reported that Biden would officially decide by January .	-2.1182
Sarah Palin cited Track Palins ’ PTSD in Donald Trump ’ s Campaign	-1.9234
Track Palin , 26 , spent a year in Iraq after being called in September .	-2.1261
He was arrested and accused of domestic violence on Monday evening .	-2.0639
“ Against the background of what my own son is going through , what he is going through just after he has returned , I can understand other families who feel the effects of PTSD and some of the injuries with which our soldiers return , ” she told the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa , Oklahoma .	-5.0619
Palin described his arrest as “ the elephant in the room , ” and said about her son and other veterans , “ They come a little differently ; they come back harder ; they come back and wonder whether the work of their fellow soldiers and the air force and all other military members is respected for the country . ”	-5.8156
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla , Alaska , and charged with domestic violence against a woman , obstruction of an advertisement for domestic violence and possession of a weapon in intoxicated condition , according to Dan Bennett , a spokesman for the Wasilla police .	-5.4530
18 Member States supporting the challenge of a new asylum policy	-3.2525
18 states and Washington , DC , support a legal challenge to a new US policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence .	-2.9824
According to NBC News , representatives from the 18 states and the district filed an Amicus Curiae ( Friend of the Court ) in Washington on Friday to assist an asylum seeker in challenging the law .	-4.7704
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace vs. Sessions litigation filed in August by the American Civil Liberties Union against the Federal Law is not known .	-3.2994
She said that her partner " and his violent sons of gang members " had abused them , but on July 20 , US officials refused to apply for asylum .	-3.7830
She was arrested in Texas .	-0.5861
The lawyers of the states that support Grace called El Salvador , Honduras , and Guatemala , which comprise a large number of asylum seekers in the US , nations facing deep problems with gangs and domestic violence .	-4.5214
The new US asylum policy reversed a decision by the 2014 Immigrants Complaint Chamber that undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence can seek asylum .	-5.5257
The Justice Minister of the District of Columbia Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new law ignores decades of state , federal , and international law .	-3.3453
The Amicus Curiae states that , according to federal law , all asylum applications must be judged in accordance with the circumstances of the respective complaint and such an action violates this principle .	-5.5813
Lawyers continued to argue that the policies that deny immigrants entry are damaging the US economy , because it is more likely that these immigrants will become entrepreneurs and do “ necessary work . ”	-5.2924
Attorney General Jeff Sessions instructed immigration judges in June not to grant asylum to persons fleeing from domestic or gang lawyers .	-4.7003
“ Asylum is available to those who have to leave their home country for racial , religious , nationality or affiliation to a particular social group or political opinion , ” Sessions said in his declaration of the law on 11 June .	-6.2745
Asylum was never intended to alleviate all the problems , even the serious ones that people face every day around the world .	-3.9962
Desperate rescue operations in Palu , while the number of deaths in the race against the search for survivors is doubling .	-5.0551
For the survivors , the situation has become increasingly dramatic .	-2.4019
“ The situation is very tense , ” said the 35-year-old Risa Kusuma , who , with her fiery baby , found shelter in an evacuation centre in the destroyed city of Palu .	-5.0305
" Inspiring bodies are brought .	-4.9752
Clean water is scarce ” .	-1.7568
Residents were watched as they returned to their destroyed homes , captured completely personal objects , and tried to save what can be saved .	-6.2336
Hundreds of people have been injured and the 7.5 hospitals damaged by the earthquake are completely overcrowded .	-3.5987
Some of the injured , including Dwi Haris with a injury on the back and a broken shoulder , remained outside the Palu Army Hospital , where patients were treated for prolonged severe aftershocks .	-5.7880
Tears filled his eyes when he told how the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor that he shared with his wife and daughter .	-3.3758
“ We had no time to get ourselves into safety .	-3.7729
I think I was pushed into the ruins of the wall , " said Haris opposite Associated Press .	-2.9226

US ambassador accuses China of “ bullying ” with “ propaganda advertising . ”	-2.0486
A week after an official Chinese newspaper placed a four-page ad in a US newspaper on the mutual benefit of US-China trade , the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda .	-4.3045
US President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to the China Daily ’ s paid supplement in the Des Moines Register – the state with the most sold newspaper in Iowa – after accusing China of interfering in the US congressional elections of November 6 , which China denies .	-5.8220
US officials claim to Reuters that Trump ’ s charge of meddling in the US election was a new phase in an escalating Washington campaign to put pressure on China .	-3.6402
While it is normal for foreign states to advertise to promote trade , Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an escalating trade war with several rounds of tariffs on imports .	-3.7879
At an early stage of trade war , China ’ s retaliatory tariffs on Chinese and US professionals should hit exporters in US states like Iowa , where many supporters of Trump ’ s Republican Party live .	-3.7752
Terry Branstad , an American ambassador to China and a former long-time governor of Iowa , a major exporter of agricultural products to China , said that Beijing violated American workers , farmers , and businesses .	-3.8124
China , wrote in an article by Branstad in the Des Moines Register on Sunday , “ is now vigorously pursuing this harassment through propaganda advertisements in our own free press .	-6.5437
“ By spreading propaganda as a paid ad in the Des Moines Register , China ’ s government is taking advantage of the esteemed American tradition of freedom of expression and press freedom , ” Branstad wrote .	-7.0864
" By contrast , you will find only limited dissenting voices at the newspaper stand in the streets of Beijing , and you will not see any real manifestation of differences of opinion that the Chinese people might have about China ’ s disturbing economic development , given that the media are firmly in the grip of the Chinese Communist Party , " he wrote .	-6.6361
He added that " one of China 's most prominent newspapers disagreed with the offer for publication , " although he did not say which newspaper .	-3.2896
Republicans scramble the mid-term election with the Kavanaugh debacle , analysts warn .	-4.5459
Many of the top Republicans defended Brett Kavanaugh , a nominee to vote for the Supreme Court , despite being accused of sexual assault , and analysts warn that they will see a backlash , especially from women , in the upcoming elections .	-5.5777
Emotions were high , most Republicans have already said they want to vote for him .	-4.5367
These things cannot be returned , said Grant Reeher , professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University , on Saturday in an article published by The Hill .	-3.0422
Reeher said that , at the last minute , his last-minute support for the FBI ’ s investigations by Jeff Flake ( Republican Member for the State of Arizona ) was enough to reconcile angry voters .	-7.0751
“ Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow nor in November , ” said Karine Jean-Pierre , senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday , as a Washington newspaper reported .	-4.5652
On Friday morning , the protesters sang “ November comes ! ” while demonstrating in the Senate ’ s hallway , when the Republicans who control the Justice Committee decided to continue Kavanaugh ’ s nomination despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford ’ s statement , Mic reported .	-5.0582
“ Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be immeasurable , ” said Stu Rothenberg , an impartial political analyst , the journalist .	-1.9234
" People say that it is already quite advanced , that is true .	-4.8989
But the number could be higher , especially among suburban voters and younger voters , 18-29 , who may not suffer the president but often do not vote . ”	-4.6222
Even before Ford ’ s public statement , in which she stated her charges of sexual violence against the Supreme Court candidate , analysts noted that a backlash could follow if Republicans pushed the candidacy forward .	-5.4654
“ This has become a chaotic mess for the GOP , ” said Michael Steele , former Chairman of the Republican National Committee , at the beginning of last week , according to NBC News .	-3.8937
“ It ’ s not just about the committee election or the final election , or whether Kavanaugh is being placed on the replacement bank , it ’ s about how the Republicans have handled it , and how they have treated it , ” says Guy Cecil , Director of US Priorities , a group that helps to elect the Democrats .	-10.9425
The Americans , however , are divided over what Ford and Kavanaugh said .	-2.7129
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 % of respondents believed Ford ’ s testimony definitive or likely , while 35 % said that they believed definitively or probably Kavanaugh .	-3.5138
In addition , 38 % said that they thought Kavanaugh was probably or definitely lying during his statement , while only 30 % said the same thing about Ford .	-3.7624
At Flake ’ s initiative , the FBI is currently investigating the allegations of Ford and at least one more prosecutor , Deborah Ramirez , reported The Guardian .	-3.7316
Ford said last week before the Senate Justice Committee under oath that Kavanaugh had attacked them drunk at the age of 17 .	-3.0507
Ramirez accuses the highest judge of having exposed his genitals to her during her studies in Yale in the 1980s .	-4.9445
The Inventor of the World Wide Web is planning a new Internet to challenge Google and Facebook .	-2.5506
Tim Berners-Lee , the inventor of the Internet , establishes a startup company to compete with Facebook , Amazon , and Google .	-3.1426
The current project of the technology legend , Inrupt , is a company based on the open source platform “ Solid ” by Berners-Lee .	-3.9145
With Solid , users can define where their data is stored and which people can access what information .	-3.9582
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company , Berners-Lee joked that the aim of Inrupt was to take over world domination .	-3.9887
“ We must do it now , ” he said about the startup .	-2.2800
“ It is a historic moment . ”	-1.3672
The App uses Solid technology to allow users to create their own personal online data storage or POD .	-4.5055
The database can contain contact lists , task lists , calendars , music libraries and other personal or professional tools .	-2.8342
It is like Google Drive , Microsoft Outlook , Slack and Spotify all available on a browser and all at the same time .	-2.2805
The special thing about the personal online data storage is that it is entirely up to the user what access to what kind of information is possible .	-4.2415
The company calls it “ enabling people through data . ”	-3.0567
According to the CEO of John Bruce , Inrupt will provide resources , processes and appropriate know-how to make solid available to a broad audience .	-4.3808
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee , Bruce , a security platform acquired by IBM , some employees involved in the project and a community of voluntary programmers .	-3.3790
As of this week , technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website .	-4.7626
Berners-Lee said that neither his team nor himself will talk to Facebook and Google about the major changes that will turn all previous business models upside down overnight .	-3.9646
“ We will not ask for permission ” .	-2.6510
In a media article published on Saturday , Berners-Lee wrote that Inrits ' mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new solid web ' .	-3.5091
In 1994 , Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .	-2.1605
Berners-Lee has strongly influenced the debate on net neutrality in recent months .	-2.4843
Also during the start of Inrupt , Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium , the Web Foundation , and the Open Data Institute .	-8.4990
“ I am incredibly optimistic about the next era of the Internet , ” Berners-Lee noted .	-2.8903

The Lieutenant Colonel and Reverend Bernard Vann earned the distinction on 29 September 1918 during the attack in Bellengise and Lehaucourt .	-5.5680
However , he was killed four days later by a sniper and did not know that he had won the highest British military award .	-3.6403
A memorial stone was unveiled on Saturday at a parade in Rushden , Northhamtonshire , by his two grandchildren .	-2.4875
One of his grandchildren , Michael Vann , said that it was “ incredibly symbolic ” that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after the heroism of his grandfather .	-3.1192
According to the London Gazette , Lieutenant Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin canal in September 1918 , “ with very dense fog and under heavy attack by field protection and machine guns . ”	-5.5886
He later stormed to the firing line , leading the line forward with the “ largest gala battery ” , before moving one hand a field gun and pressing three times the withdrawal .	-7.9175
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4 , 1918 – just under a month before the end of the war .	-3.0776
Michael Vann , 72 , said the actions of his grandfather were ' something I know I could never do justice to , something that instils humility . '	-4.0347
He and his brother , Dr. James Vann , also set a wreath after the parade , led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band .	-4.0659
Michael Vann said that he “ feels very honoured to take part in the parade , ” adding : “ The bravery of a real hero is reflected in the support he receives from many people . ”	-3.8979
MMA fans stayed awake all night to see Bellator 206 , instead they got Peppa Pig .	-2.1113
Imagine that you stayed awake all night to watch the complete Bellator 206 event , just to not see the main event .	-4.3488
The plan in San Jose had 13 fights , including six main fights , and was shown live on Channel 5 during the night in Britain .	-5.4095
At 6 o 'clock in the morning , just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared to face each other , the audience in Britain could watch the news change to Peppa Pig .	-6.4459
Some were unimpressed after they woke up to the early hours of the morning , especially for the fight .	-5.0847
A fan on Twitter described the change to the child cartoon as " some sick joke " .	-4.4522
" It is a state regulation that at 6 a.m. these contents were not suitable so they had to switch to children 's programs , " said Dave Schwartz , Bellator Senior Vice President of Marketing and Communication when asked for the transfer .	-5.4814
'Peppa the pipe , ' yes ' .	-2.6139
Bellator ’ s managing director , Scott Coker , said that they will work on their planning in the future to involve British viewers .	-4.7800
" If I think about the repetition , we will somehow get it , " said Cocker .	-3.7856
" But it is 6 o 'clock in the morning on a Sunday there and we will be able to fix it only on Sunday of our time , Monday of their time .	-4.4407
But we are working on it .	-1.5629
Believe me , when it was turned around , a lot was written and the content was not friendly .	-3.8238
We tried to fix it , we thought it was a technical error .	-1.8317
But it was not , it was a problem for the government .	-2.3587
I can promise you that it will not happen next time .	-2.1094
We will reduce it to five instead of six fights - as we usually do - and we have tried to beat the fans and just passed over .	-4.4770
It is an unfavourable situation . '	-1.9583
Desert Island Discs : Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality .	-1.9113
The olympic diver Tom Daley says that he grew up with the feeling of being inferior to everyone because of his sexuality - but that gave him the motivation to become a success .	-4.8643
The 24-year-old said that he first became aware at secondary school that “ not everyone is like me . ”	-3.5447
In the first edition of Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 presented by Lauren Laverne , he said that he spoke publicly about the rights of homosexuals in order to give others “ hope . ”	-3.5833
He also said that victory in the Olympic Games after the birth of his first child would have become less important to him .	-2.4943
The regular presenter of the long-running show , Kristy Young , has taken off for several months due to a disease .	-8.0025
Daley appeared in Lavernes ’ first program , saying that he felt “ less worth ” as a grower than the others , because “ society did not accept being on men and women . ”	-5.0544
He said , “ To this day , these feelings of Weniger Wert and Andersen have given me the strength and strength I needed to succeed . ”	-4.7458
He wanted to prove that he was “ something , ” he said , in order to disappoint no one if he knew of his sexual orientation .	-4.4757
The two bronze medal winner has become a top-class LGBT activist and used his appearance at this year ’ s Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality .	-4.2944
He said that he spoke out because he was lucky enough to be able to live openly and without consequences , and because he wanted to give others ' hope ' .	-4.7579
Three times the world champion said he fell in love with a man , US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black , whom he met in 2013 , which he was very surprised about .	-3.6999
Daley married the Oscar winner , 20 years older than him , last year , but the age difference was never a problem .	-3.7601
“ If you go through so much at such a young age ” – he first took part in the Olympic Games at the age of 14 , and three years later his father died of cancer – was it hard to find someone of the same age who experienced similar highs and lows .	-6.4261
The couple was born in June parents of a son called Robert Ray Black-Daley , and Daley said his " whole perspective " has changed .	-5.2990
“ Last year I was all about winning a gold medal , ” he said .	-3.4665
“ But you know what , there are more important than Olympic gold .	-2.2610
My gold medal is Robbie . ”	-0.5627
His son is named after his father , Robert , who died in 2011 at only 40 years after a cancer diagnosis .	-3.1121
Daley said that his father did not accept that he would die , and one of the last things he asked was whether they had their tickets for London in 2012 - because he wanted to be in the first row .	-2.8026
“ I couldn ’ t tell him : ‘ You won ’ t experience sitting in the front row , Dad ’ , ” he said .	-4.4343
“ I kept his hand when his breathing was suspended , and only when he was really no longer breathed and dead did I realize that he was not invincible , ” he said .	-6.2922
The following year , Daley joined the 2012 Olympic Games and won bronze .	-3.1766
“ I had dreamed of this all my life – diving into the water in front of the local audience at the Olympic Games – there is no better feeling , ” he said .	-4.5398
This is what inspired his first selection of songs – Proud by Heather Small .	-4.7641

The Weform Mickelson sat on the Ryder Cup Saturday in the Bank	-4.2720
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game , but he needs to dramatically improve his shape so that it does not become a sad milestone .	-5.0254
Mickelson , who played for the 12th time at the event which takes place every two years , was put on the bench by Captain Jim Furyk for the Fourballs and Foursomes on Saturday .	-3.8698
Instead of being at the center of events , as is so often the case for the US , the five-time Major Winner announced his day between fires and rounds of practice on the golf course , hoping to overcome his low .	-7.0363
Even at the peak of his career , the 48-year-old is never the most straightforward driver and is not suitable for the narrow Le Golf National Square , where the long Rough regularly punishes failures .	-4.9436
And as if the place was not challenging enough , Mickelson will meet the British-Open Champion Francesco Molinari in the ninth match on Sunday , who won all four matches together with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood this week .	-7.2617
If Americans lag four points behind in the start of the 12 individual games and have a hot start , Mickelson ’ s match could be absolutely crucial .	-5.0312
Furyk expressed his trust in his husband ; what else was left to him .	-5.6113
" He fully understood the role he had today , gave me a slap on my back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow , " Furyk said .	-3.3660
" He has a lot of self-confidence .	-2.0472
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has done so much in the past for these teams , and this week .	-2.2079
I probably wouldn 't have thought he was playing two games .	-5.0433
I wanted to do more , but that is the way we felt we had to deal with it .	-6.6938
He wants to be out there , just like everyone else .	-2.2299
So far , Nick Faldo has the record for most played matches at the Ryder Cup , which Mickelson will break on Sunday .	-5.3591
This could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career , which has never fully matched the heights of its individual record .	-5.1028
Mickelson won 18 times , lost 20 times and played seven times in a tie , but Furyk said that his presence was invaluable to the team .	-5.6582
" He 's funny , he 's sarcastic , funny , he loves to entertain people , and he 's a great guy he can have in the team room , " he explained .	-3.6978
I think the younger players also enjoyed watching him this week , which was nice to see . ”	-4.8136
It offers much more than just the game . ”	-1.5689
The European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a big lead can soon disappear again .	-3.7302
Thomas Bjorn , the European captain , knows from experience that a big lead in the individual matches of the last day at the Ryder Cup can quickly become an uncomfortable ride .	-4.8631
The Dane debuted in the game in Valderrama in 1997 , where a team trained by Seve Ballesteros had a five point lead over the Americans , but just crossed the finish line and won with a rough margin of $ 14 to $ 13 .	-6.5420
" We remember that we were in the lead in Valderrama ; we had a big lead in Brookline , where we lost ; and in Valderrama we won , but only narrowly , " said Bjorn , after seeing the class of 2018 , now leading at 10-6 in the Le Golf National , Friday and yesterday at a 5-3 victory .	-7.3899
History will show me and everyone in this team that it is not over yet .	-2.9718
You will be absolutely bored tomorrow .	-1.8920
Go out and do the right things .	-1.8935
It is not over until the points are displayed on the board .	-4.0621
Our goal is to win this Cup , and that is what we are focusing on . is . is . is . is .	-9.6700
I have always said that I firmly believe in the 12 players in our team , but we are faced with a strong opponent , the best players in the world . ”	-3.0019
Inspired by how his players played on a hard golf course , Björn added : " I would never be too fast .	-4.4698
Tomorrow is also another day .	-1.9249
Tomorrow are the personal performances , and that is another thing .	-3.3317
It is great to be out there with a partner if things are going well , but if you are out there alone , your own skills as a golf player will be tested .	-6.1067
This is the message you have to give players : get the best out of them tomorrow .	-5.5359
Now you are handing over to your partner and he has to make full use , just like you . ”	-5.4760
Unlike Björn , the opponent Jim Furyk will strive for his players to perform better than they do as partners , with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas , who won three out of four points .	-4.8254
Furyk himself has experienced such a sensational turn at the end of the day , when he was part of the winning team in Brookline , now he is one of the losers after the European team has accomplished the “ Miracle of Medinah . ”	-8.9105
" I remember every damned word , " he said on the question how Ben Crenshaw , the 1999 captain , had gathered his players on the way to the last day .	-4.2756
We have 12 important games tomorrow , but we want to get started as soon as possible , as we saw in Brookline , Medinah .	-4.2666
Once a dynamic has developed , the pressure on the middle matches exerts .	-5.3758
We have built up our list accordingly and brought the boys out as we felt , you know , we are trying to create something special tomorrow . ”	-5.5968
Thomas , along with Paul Casey , Justin Rose , Jon Rahm , Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter , the other European in the top ranking , should lead the counterattack against Rory McIlroy in the top game .	-4.8064
I put this group of guys in this order because I think it covers the whole way , " said Bjorn about his individual selection .	-3.7536
Revisited the timetable for Germany ’ s New Warship	-2.2144
The German Navy ’ s latest frigate should have been in service as early as 2014 to replace the aging warships of the Cold War era , but , according to reports from local media , it will take at least until next year , owing to flawed systems and escalating costs .	-6.9155
The commissioning of the “ Rhineland-Palatinate ” , the flagship ship of the brand new Baden-Württemberg frigates , has now been postponed to the first half of 2019 , according to the newspaper “ Die Zeit ” , calling on a military spokesman .	-5.9218
The navy was supposed to have launched the ships in 2014 , but serious problems after the first delivery tarnished the ambitious project .	-5.7943
The four frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the older ships of the Bremen class .	-4.1740
They are expected to have a powerful cannon , a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles , and some stealth technologies , such as reduced radar , infrared and acoustic signatures .	-4.2780
Another important advantage is longer maintenance intervals : the newest frigates should be used for up to two years without entering the home port .	-4.7233
However , the constant delays will make the ultra-modern warships , which are supposed to enable Germany to project power overseas , obsolete when they are finally put into service , as the weekly newspaper “ Die Zeit ” notes .	-7.1786
The unfortunate F125 frigate made headlines last year , when the German navy officially refused to take the ship into operation and returned it to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg .	-4.3156
This was the first time that the navy returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery .	-3.1102
Little was known about the reasons for the return of ships ; German media mentioned a number of critical “ software and hardware defects ” that would render the warship useless in combat operations .	-4.4712
Software defects were particularly important , as the ships of the Baden-Württemberg-Class are operated by a crew of around 120 sailors - only half of the crew on older frigates of the Bremen class .	-7.1101
It also became apparent that the ship is overweight , which would limit performance and make future upgrades more difficult for the navy .	-6.4630
It is believed that the 7,000-ton “ Rhineland-Palatinate ” is twice as heavy as ships of the same class used by Germans during World War II .	-3.6802
In addition to faulty hardware , the price tag of the entire project - including training of the crew - will also be discussed .	-4.7217
Instead of the initially estimated € 2.2 billion , the cost now seems to have reached the staggering amount of € 3.1 billion ( roughly $ 3.6 billion ) .	-4.6048
The problems with the latest frigates are particularly important in light of recent warnings that Germany ’ s naval power is sinking .	-4.9737
Earlier this year , Hans-Peter Bartels , Chairman of the German Parliament ’ s Defense Committee , admitted that the war fleet actually “ went out of operation ships . ”	-4.9199
The official said that the problem grew in a blinkered fashion over time , as old ships were put out of service without any replacement .	-6.9623
He lamented that none of the Baden-Württemberg frigates were put into service by the Navy .	-3.9269
The National Trust is covering the secret lives of bats .	-3.0212
New research on a property in the Highlands of Scotland is trying to find out how bats use the landscape to search for food .	-9.1211
It is hoped that this will provide new insights into the behaviour of the unique flying mammals that can provide guidance for future measures to protect animals .	-5.0219
The study by scientists of the National Trust for Scotland will be followed by common and soprano stallions as well as brown long-eared and Daubenton bats in the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross .	-5.9429
Special recording devices are placed at the main points of the accommodation to track bats activity throughout the year .	-5.3237
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys with manual detectors .	-3.2003
An expert sound analysis of all recordings determines the frequency of bat levels and assigns the calls to the species .	-5.0707
The habitat map to be created and the corresponding report should give a detailed overview of the behaviour .	-4.8454
Rob Dewar , National Trust for Scotland ( NTS ) conservation adviser , hopes to find out which areas of the habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by the species .	-4.7557
This information will help identify the benefits of living space management as to how to best preserve meadow formation and forests for bats and other related species .	-5.5799
There has been a sharp decline in bats in Scotland and across the UK over the past hundred years .	-4.6089
They are threatened by building works that affect their sleeping places and the loss of living space .	-3.5732
Windpower plants and lighting can also pose a risk , as well as fly-by-traps and some chemical treatments of building materials .	-6.2581
In fact , bats are not blind .	-2.6361
According to their nocturnal hunting activities , the ears are more useful when they catch prey than the eyes .	-5.4284
They use sophisticated echo-positioning techniques to locate errors and obstacles in their flight path .	-4.5187
The NTS , which is responsible for maintaining more than 270 historic buildings , 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country , takes the bats very seriously .	-3.2393
There are ten trained experts who regularly carry out surveys , inspect sleeping places , and sometimes also perform rescues .	-4.8285
The organization has even set up Scotland 's first and only dedicated bat reserve at the Threade estate in Dumfries and Galloway , home to eight of Scotland 's ten bat species .	-4.5424
According to manager David Thompson , the property is an ideal habitat for them :	-2.1891
“ Here in Threave we have a great area for bats . ”	-2.2698
“ We have the old buildings , many old trees and all the good living space .	-2.3296
But there is still much unknown about bats and the work we do here and on other plots helps us to understand better what they need to live . ”	-3.6666
He stresses that it is important to check whether bats are there before maintenance work in buildings , so it is possible to kill up to 400 females and boys in the unintentional destruction of a single sleeping place – an entire local population may be wiped out .	-8.2644
bats are protected ; it is forbidden to kill , harass or disturb them and destroy their sleeping places .	-3.7245
Elisabeth Ferrell , Scottish employee of the Bat Conservation Trust , has encouraged the public to help .	-2.1963
She said , “ We still have much to learn about our bats , and for many of our species , we simply do not know what their populations are . ”	-5.9319
Ronaldo rejects rape claims when lawyers sued the German magazine	-3.6832
Cristiano Ronaldo has branded rape claims against him as " fake news " and claims that people " want to promote themselves " by using his name .	-2.7838
His lawyers will sue the German news magazine “ Der Spiegel ” , which published the accusations .	-2.5953
The Portuguese and Juventus striker was accused of raping an American woman named Kathyn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009 .	-4.3366
He is said to have paid her $ 375,000 to keep quiet about the incident , reported Der Spiegel on Friday .	-3.7048
Hours after the allegations were reported , Ronaldo , 33 , posted live video to his 142 million followers in an Instagram , reporting the as “ fake news . ” , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-7.4511
No , no , no , no .	-0.7001
What they say today , fake news , ” said the five-time Ballon D 'Or winner in the camera .	-2.5112
" You want to apply by using my name .	-2.3140
“ That is normal .	-1.8575
They want to draw attention to themselves when they say my name , but it is part of the job .	-2.3387
I am a happy person , and everything is good , ” the player added smiling .	-2.8854
Ronaldo ’ s lawyers have filed a lawsuit against the magazine “ Der Spiegel ” because of the allegations ; according to Reuters , you spoke of “ impermissible reporting of suspicions in the area of privacy . ”	-6.5291
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player will demand compensation for “ immaterial damages to the extent of the severity of the violation , which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years ” .	-4.7848
The alleged incident was reported to have taken place in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in June 2009 .	-3.4488
According to documents submitted to the District Court of Clark County in Nevada , Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player 's room after getting to know them in a nightclub , where he raped them anal .	-6.4970
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo had fallen to her knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was “ 99 % ” a “ good guy ” who was let down by the “ one percent . ”	-4.9123
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex , but it was consensual .	-1.7739
Mayorga also claims that she had gone to the police and made photos of her injuries in a hospital , but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was " afraid of retribution " and worried about " being humiliated publicly " .	-5.3606
The 34-year-old says that she is now trying to invalidate the agreement , as she continues to be traumatised by the alleged incident .	-4.0666
Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack and this summer he moved to the Italian giant Juve with a € 100 million deal .	-6.4651
Brexit – Britain would forever regret losing car manufacturers	-2.6798
“ The UK would regret it for a lifetime if it lost its position as the world ’ s leading automobile manufacturer after Brexit , ” said Minister of Economics Greg Clark .	-5.1021
He added that it was " worrying " that Toyota UK told the BBC that they would temporarily stop production at their plant in Burnaston , near Derby , if Great Britain left the EU without a deal .	-4.0012
" We need an agreement , " Clark said .	-1.6168
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of cross-border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs .	-3.4903
The plant in Burnaston , which produces Auris and Avensis for Toyota , produced almost 150,000 cars last year , 90 % of which were exported to the rest of the European Union .	-3.0787
“ If Britain leaves the EU without an agreement at the end of March , I believe that our plant will stop production , ” said Marvin Cooke , CEO of Toyota in Burnaston .	-5.0101
Other British car manufacturers have expressed fears of leaving the EU without agreement on the modalities of cross-border trade , including Honda , BMW and Jaguar Land Rover .	-3.1599
For example , BMW has already announced that it will close its Oxford plant for a month after Brexit .	-2.7054
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers say about the risks of the supply chain in the event of a ' no deal Brexit ' .	-3.7032
Toyota ’ s production facilities are based on need-based production , meaning that the parts are delivered every 37 minutes by UK and EU suppliers for custom production .	-5.6108
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without an agreement , there may be delays at the border , which , according to industry information , may lead to shortages and shortages .	-4.9447
It would be impossible for Toyota to hold more than a day of stock in its Derbyshire plant , said the company , and so production would be stopped .	-3.4215
Mr Clark said that Theresa May ’ s Chequers Plan for future relations with the EU was “ calibrated precisely to avoid these border controls . ”	-3.6774
We must have a deal ; we want the best deal that not only allows us to succeed today , we want to seize this opportunity , ” he said to BBC Radio 4 ’ s Today program .	-6.1709
“ The reference not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers is that we absolutely must be able to continue with what has become a very successful series of supply chains . ”	-4.3942
Toyota did not specify how long the production stop might take , but warned that the cost increase would eventually hurt the factory ’ s competitiveness and eventually lose jobs .	-7.1474
Peter Tsouvallaris , trade union representative , and employed in Burnaston for 24 years , said that the trade union members are increasingly worried : “ In my experience , once they have been eliminated , jobs are lost forever . ”	-5.3673
A government spokesman said : ' We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU ' .	-3.1158
Trump ’ s Rosenstein meeting may be postponed again , says the White House	-3.8169
Donald Trump ’ s high-profile meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could “ be postponed another week , ” as the battle for the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues , the White House announced on Sunday .	-3.5761
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller , who is investigating Russian interventions in the elections , the links between Trump and Russia , and the president ’ s possible obstruction of justice .	-4.6903
Whether or not Trump will fire the deputy prosecutor , and thus threaten Müller ’ s independence , has given Washington a lot of gossip for months .	-7.2813
Earlier this month , the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed wearing a cable to record talks with Trump , thereby making it possible to remove the president from the 25th Amendment .	-4.6591
Rosenstein rejected an opinion .	-1.8437
But last Monday he went to the White House , while there were reports that he was about to resign .	-3.7832
Instead , Thursday announced a meeting with Trump at the United Nations in New York .	-2.5134
Trump said he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein , but then the session was delayed to avoid a clash with the Senate ’ s Justice Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women , Dr. Christine Blasey Ford , who accused him of sexual misconduct .	-4.4789
On Friday , Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into Kavanaugh ’ s claims , further delaying a full Senate vote .	-3.5220
Donald Trump ’ s press spokeswoman Sarah Sanders was on Fox News on Sunday .	-4.2533
When asked about the Rosenstein-meeting , she said : " A date has not yet been set , it could be this week , I could see that I have returned another week , in view of all the other things that are going on with the Supreme Court . is . is . is . are . are are	-10.9456
But we will see and I keep the press always up to date . '	-3.2247
Some reporters would challenge this claim : Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September .	-2.3228
Chris Wallace asked why .	-4.8731
Sanders said that the lack of briefings is not due to a distaste for television reporters who behave like self-actors , but she also said : ' I will not be against them being in the gallery ' .	-6.5322
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase .	-1.9091
" The President carries out more questions and answers than any president before him , " she said and added , without giving evidence : " We have looked at these figures . "	-4.8152
Briefings will still take place , Sanders said , but if the press has the chance to put the questions directly to the President of the United States , it would be infinitely better than to talk to her .	-5.3652
We are trying to do much of that , and you have seen how we have done it in recent weeks , and it will replace a press conversation if you can speak to the President of the United States himself . ”	-4.4339
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends public meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries .	-2.6312
Press conferences with one person are rare .	-1.1533
In New York this week , the president perhaps showed why by making a frank and sometimes bizarre appearance before assembled reporters .	-4.5562
Brexit Fears : Health Minister ’ s Letter to EU Workers in NHS Scotland	-2.8919
The health minister has written EU staff in Scotland ’ s NHS to express the country ’ s gratitude and the desire to remain after Brexit .	-4.5624
MEPs from the Scottish Parliament , Jane Freeman , wrote their letter less than 6 months before Britain left the EU .	-3.6231
The Scottish Government has agreed to pay for the agreed status applications for EU citizens working in its decentralised public service .	-3.4714
In her letter , Mrs Freeman wrote : “ During the summer , negotiations between the UK and the EU on exit continued , heading for expected decisions in the autumn .	-5.2669
But the British government , too , has intensified its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario .	-5.6695
I know that this must be a very worrying time for all of you .	-2.0076
That is why I now wanted to repeat how much I would appreciate the contribution of every employee , regardless of nationality .	-4.4247

Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when buying property in Britain - the extra money will be used for homeless people , Theresa May today announces .	-4.7780
This move is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn ’ s effort to attract young voters with promises , offer more affordable housing , and seek high incomes .	-3.7862
The stamp fee is levied on people and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK , and the additional money will help the government to combat homelessness .	-4.5161
The surcharge - which is levied in addition to the current stamp tax , including the higher rates for two-houses and rents introduced two years ago - could be up to three percent .	-6.0974

The new policy comes only a few weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a stamp cut to help more young people own their first house .	-3.4431
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices high by buying land cheaply but not cultivating it , and also called on Ms May to abolish affordable housing quotas to end the housing mess in Britain .	-7.3428

The former manager of Alloa Athletic says that he was not afraid to follow the footsteps of these established managers in such a large club before rejecting offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town .	-5.1032
" The success for me is currently defined by the question " Can I bring this club back to the Premier League ? "	-3.6855
With its structure and facilities , this club undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League , ” he said .	-2.7884
" Creating it there is no easy task , but I would probably only consider myself successful if I could bring the club back there . "	-5.1362
Ross is only three years in his management career , after a time as a co-trainer at Dumbarton and a 15-month spell for Hearts ' coaching staff .	-2.8544
He then helped Alloa to recover from the relegation to the third class , and helped St. Mirren to become the champion in the following season .	-9.1475
Ross also says that during his career as a player at Clyde , Hartlepool , Falkirk , St Mirren and Hamilton Academic he never felt as comfortable as he did now .	-4.6481
" It was probably a real crossroads , " he remembered when he took over the leadership of Alloa .	-2.8174

The summer heat wave has increased revenue for the battered British pubs , but increased pressure on restaurant chains .	-7.4174
Pub and bar groups experienced a sales increase of 2.7 percent in July - but revenue in restaurants decreased 4.8 percent , according to figures .	-5.1430
Peter Martin , from the company consultancy CGA , who compiled the figures , said : " Sustained sunshine and England 's continued participation in the World Cup more than expected resulted in July following a similar pattern than in June last year , when the pub visits increased by 2.8 % , only that the restaurants were even more affected .	-8.2617
The 1.8 % decline in the catering business in June only worsened in July .	-3.4600
Bars and pubs dominated by drinks were by far the strongest , with Like-for-Like numbers rising more than restaurants fell .	-5.2249
Food dominated pubs also suffered from the sun , though not as dramatically as restaurants .	-3.1604
It seems that people only wanted to go out for a drink .	-2.6305
In managed pubs and bars , sales of drinks increased by 6.6 % this month , while food fell by 3 % . '	-3.0694
Paul Newman , an RSM analyst for leisure and hospitality , said : " These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April .	-3.0011
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to selling in the out-of-home market .	-4.0570
It is not surprising that restaurant groups are still under pressure , although a 4.8 % decline in sales compared to the previous year will be particularly painful , along with the continuing cost pressures .	-6.5043
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food operators , and time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will provide the much-needed break .	-4.6795

Milk pump advertising comparing mothers to cows has led to controversial online discussions .	-2.8981
A milk pump company has provoked controversial online discussions , owing to an ad comparing breastfeeding mothers with suckler cows .	-5.3443
On the occasion of the launch of the supposedly " world 's first smoked and portable milk pump " , the consumer tech company Elvie published an ironic advertising inspired by music videos to show what freedoms mothers are offered with this new pump .	-4.9731
Four real mothers dance in a hayloft in the midst of cows to a number with the following song text : ' Yes , I am milking , but you do not see a tail ' and ' If you have not noticed that there is no udder , it is my breasts ' .	-6.3980
The slogan goes on : ' Pump off , pump off , I feed the babies , pump off , pump off , I melt my ladies ' .	-5.5012
However , the ad published on the company 's Facebook page has caused controversy online .	-3.6179
With 77,000 calls and hundreds of comments , the video has received mixed responses from viewers , many of whom say that it illuminates the " horrors " of the dairy industry .	-3.3034
'It is a very bad decision to advertise this product with cows ' .	-2.5674
Like us , they must become pregnant and bear to produce milk , except that their babies are taken away within a few days of birth , " a person wrote .	-3.7163
The Elvie milk pump fits discreetly into a Still H ( Elvie / Mother ) .	-4.2439
Another commented : " understandably traumatic for mother and baby .	-1.7227
But yes , why not use them to promote a milk pump for mothers who can keep their babies ?	-3.2021
Someone else added : ' Such an outside acquisition ' .	-3.2122
Others defended advertising , including a woman who admitted that she found the song “ hilarious . ”	-3.4111
I think that is a great idea .	-1.4868
I would have received one if I had been breasted .	-7.2673
Through the pumping I felt like a cow .	-3.6249
The ad is a bit crazy , but I took it as what it was .	-2.0699
This is a brilliant product , " wrote a person .	-1.7598
Another commented : ' This is a funny advertisement for mothers who pump off ( often at their jobs or toilets ) and feel like ' cows ' .	-4.0403
This is not advertising that praises or judges the dairy industry . '	-3.9270
At the end of the video , the group of women reveals that they all danced with the decent pumps in their heads .	-4.1252
The concept of the campaign is based on the recognition that many women who pump milk say they feel like cows .	-3.4868
The Elvie Pump , however , is completely silent , has no wires or hoses and fits discreetly into a still-BH , giving women the freedom to move , keep their babies and even go out during pumping .	-5.7671
Ana Balarin , partner and ECD at Mother commented : " The Elk pump is such a revolutionary product that deserves a bold and provocative market launch .	-3.7409
By drawing a parallel between the expression of women and dairy cows , we wanted to focus on the chest pumps and all its challenges , while at the same time demonstrating in an entertaining and comparable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring .	-10.8728
This is not the first time that the Elk pump is getting into the headlines .	-4.4065

Hundreds of migrant children moved quietly to a tent camp on the Texan border .	-2.7710
The number of migrant children arrested rose , even though the monthly border crossings remained relatively unchanged , partly because the Trump administration ’ s harsh rhetoric and policies made it harder to find sponsors for children .	-4.1495
Traditionally , most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves , and fear that they risk being expelled when they commit to a child .	-4.0294
The risk increased in June , when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to hand in fingerprints and that the data would be passed on to immigration authorities .	-3.9749
Last week , Matthew Albence , a senior official within the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Authority , testified to Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to support unaccompanied minors .	-3.2711
The agency later confirmed that 70 % of those arrested had no previous criminal records .	-2.3318
" Almost 80 percent of people who are either sponsors or budget members of sponsors are illegal in the country , and a large part of them are criminal aliens .	-4.7296
" So we continue to pursue these people , " says Albence .	-7.0208
In an effort to speed up the processing of applications for children , officials introduced new rules that require some of them to appear in court within a month of detention , and not after 60 days , which was the previous standard , according to the accommodation staff .	-5.7904
Many will not appear personally , but via a video telephone conference to argue with an immigration judge for legal status .	-4.9716
Those who are not eligible for discharge are quickly deported .	-3.1386
The longer children remain in prison , the more likely it is that they will be frightened or depressed , which may lead to violent outbreaks or attempts to escape .	-4.1955
Advocates said that these concerns are reinforced in a larger body , such as Tornillo , where signs that a child is struggling are more likely to be overlooked because of their size .	-4.9858
They added that moving children to the tent town without having enough time to prepare them emotionally or to leave friends could exacerbate a trauma that many are already struggling with .	-4.9133
Syria calls for US , French , and Turkish “ occupying forces ” to withdraw immediately .	-2.4802
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called before the UN General Assembly for Syrian refugees to return home , even though the country ’ s war has been going on for eight years now .	-3.5187
Moualem , who is also Deputy Prime Minister , said that foreign forces are illegal on Syrian soil under the pretext of combating terrorism , and “ they will deal with it accordingly . ”	-4.5405
“ They must immediately withdraw unconditionally , ” he said to the Assembly .	-2.7723
Moualem claimed hard and firm that the “ war on terror is almost over ” in Syria . More than 360,000 people have died in the country since 2011 , and millions more have been driven out of their homes .	-4.3473
He said that Damascus will continue to “ fight this holy battle until we have liberated all Syrian territories ” from both terrorist groups and “ any illegal foreign presence . ”	-5.3778
The US has some 2,000 soldiers in Syria , mostly training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad .	-3.4351
France has more than 1,000 ground soldiers in the war-torn country .	-2.4048
On the question of refugees , Moualem said that the conditions for return were in order , and he accused “ some Western countries of stoking irrational fears ” that led refugees to stay away .	-4.6696
“ We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate their return , ” said Moualem .	-2.6385
“ They politicize a purely humanitarian issue . ”	-3.4167
The US and the European Union drew attention to the fact that there could only be reconstruction aid for Syria if there was a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war .	-6.7873
UN diplomats have said that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in Idlib , the last major rebel stronghold , provides an opportunity to advance political talks .	-4.6474
The Russian-Turkish deal prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian troops on the province where three million people live .	-3.3536
But Moualem stressed that the agreement had “ clear deadlines , ” hoping that military action would be directed against jihadists , including al-Qaeda-affiliated Nusra Front fighters , who are “ wiped out . ”	-6.3173
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections .	-3.3036
Moualem called conditions for the Syrian government ’ s participation in the committee : he said that the body ’ s work should be limited to “ reviewing the articles from the current constitution , ” and warned of interference .	-4.6324

External money is flowing into the tightest midterm race of the House of Commons	-4.8372
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania experienced a flood of cash in 17 , thanks to a realignment of a congressional district that two incumbents reached in a race around the same seat .	-5.1098
For this new district in the suburb of pittsburg , the Democrat Conor Lamb , who won a seat in another district in a special election last spring .	-4.2381
Lamb opposes another incumbent , the Republican Keith Rothfus , who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania , which is clearly overlapping with the new 17th .	-4.1375
The cards were re-shuffled after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutional , according to the Republicans .	-4.4073
The race in the new 17th has triggered a campaign financing exchange between the major party finance groups , the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee ( DCCC ) and the National Republican Campaign Committee ( NRCC ) .	-4.7792

Saipov , 30 , allegedly used a rental car from Home Depot in October for his assault on a cycle path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan , where he explored pedestrians and cyclists way .	-5.5731

Both charges can be charged with death , according to court records .	-5.2409

Paul Rowlett , Analyst at the US Department of Justice , has spent several hours as an expert in information evaluation .	-4.1549
He sketched for the jury how he combined the movements of the 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of their death with mobile phone recordings .	-6.9802
Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones , which showed that Tellis was in the evening of her death at Chambers , which contradicted his earlier claims , The Clarion Ledger reported .	-6.7071
The data on Chambers mobile had shown that he was in the company of his friend Michael Sanford , and was subsequently interrogated by the police .	-6.7852
Sanford said on Saturday and said that he was not in town that day .	-2.9204
When asked by prosecutors whether Tellis spent the night in Sanford ’ s truck , he replied that he lied because his truck was in Nashville at that time .	-4.2098
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died .	-2.4348
According to mobile phone records , they only knew themselves for a week .	-4.5044
Rowlett said that , after Chambers ’ death , Tellis deleted text messages , call and contact information from his phone .	-2.8988

Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a short notice : " Neiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiin NOCH ONE SCHWARZH<unk>UTIGE PERSON " .	-3.4201
However , instead of sending him to her husband , she sent him twice to Mrs Maurice .	-2.5113
After she noticed her patron , a " uncomfortable " Plasco-Flaxman dismissed Mrs. Maurice and explained that her outgoing nanny , who was Afro-American , had done a bad job and that she wanted to hire a Filipino instead , according to the New York Post .	-6.2600
Mrs Maurice was paid for her work on a day and then sent home for a Uber .	-3.4343
Now Maurice is suing the couple for compensation for dismissal and is demanding compensation of $ 350 per day for the six-month full-time job for which she was initially hired , albeit without a contract .	-5.7600
" I want to show them , look at them , not do anything , " she said to the post on Friday and added , " I know that discrimination is . "	-5.1704
The couple opposed the claims , saying that the decision to end Maurice 's employment relationship was reasonable and that they acted out of fear because they could not trust her after insulting her .	-5.5147
" My wife sent her something she didn 't want to say .	-3.1049
It is not racist .	-0.5441

Paddington publishers feared readers could not identify with a talking bear , which reveals a new letter .	-3.0911
Bond ’ s daughter Karen Jankel , born shortly after the book ’ s adoption , said about the letter : it ’ s hard to get someone to read it for the first time before the release .	-4.3992
“ It ’ s very amusing – now that we know about Paddington ’ s great success . ”	-4.7735
She said that her father , who had previously worked as a BBC cameraman , and was then inspired to write a children ’ s book by a small toy bear , would have remained optimistic if his work had been rejected , adding that the 60th anniversary of the book publication was “ bitten ” after his death last year .	-5.1756
To Paddington , whom she calls a “ very important family member , ” she still says that her father was quietly proud of his eventual success .	-4.6460
" He was a pretty quiet man , and he was not a bossy person , " she said .	-3.0022
" But because Paddington was so real for him , it was almost like having a child who achieved something : you are proud of the child , although it is not really your act .	-5.5293
I think he saw Paddington 's success a little like that .	-3.4666
Although it was his creation and imagination , he always paid tribute to Paddington himself . ”	-3.0864

The FBI investigation has begun , and Brett Kavanaugh ’ s future is at stake .	-2.1280
“ I thought that if we could actually get something like what he called for - an investigation limited in time and scope - we could perhaps reach some agreement , ” said Mr Flake on Saturday , adding that he fears that the committee will “ fall apart amid a deeply entrenched party political blockade . ”	-6.9161
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate ?	-1.9716
Their restraint is simply due to the timing .	-2.1868
It is only five weeks until the midterm elections ; on November 6 , when Republicans fail badly , as expected , they will be severely weakened in an attempt to advance the man who wants to go to the country ’ s highest court .	-7.4295

Based on data from the South Department of unification , Park Byeong-seug announced that there had been 1,127 of Treuebürchen last year – compared to 2,706 in 2011 .	-5.7234
Park said that stricter border controls between North Korea and China and an increase in the price of human traffickers play an essential role in this .	-3.9794
Pyongyang did not speak out publicly .	-2.0609
After all , the majority of North Korean refugees receive South Korean citizenship .	-3.3956
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953 .	-1.8832
Most are fleeing China , which has the longest border with North Korea , which is easier to cross than the heavily guarded demilitarized zone between North and South Korea .	-2.9249
China regards the transgressors as illegal migrants , not refugees , and often forcibly rejects them .	-3.8171
Relations between the North and the South , which are still formally at war , have improved significantly in recent months .	-2.6861
Earlier this month , leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang for talks about stalled negotiations on denuclearization .	-3.1553
This happened after the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore , when they largely agreed on the nuclear-free Korean Peninsula .	-3.1896

Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh hysterical and says that he is unsuitable for serving the Supreme Court .	-2.6720
The leader of the democratic minority group , Nancy Pelosi , called Brett Kavanaugh , the candidate for a seat at the Supreme Court “ hysterical ” and said that he was temperamental incapable of serving at the Supreme Court .	-5.0580
Pelosi made the comments at an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin , Texas .	-1.1444
“ I could not but think that if a woman had ever done so , they would have called it “ hysterical , ” Pelosi said about her response to Kavanaugh ’ s statement before the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday .	-4.4909
Kavanaugh denied the claims that he had sexually attacked Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers .	-4.6304
During his opening speech , Kavanaugh was very emotional , sometimes he almost shouted and fought with tears when he spoke about his family and his high school years .	-4.3146
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the committee and called the charges against him a “ grotesque and coordinated campaign of reputation ” organized by liberals angry at Clinton ’ s loss of the 2016 presidential election .	-5.0489
Pelosi said that she believed that Kavanaugh ’ s statement proved that he could not serve before the Supreme Court , because he showed that he was biased against Democrats .	-4.0534
“ I believe that he is disqualified by such statements and the way in which he can be influenced by the Clintons and Democrats , ” she said .	-4.5485
When asked whether she would seek an impeachment against Kavanaugh in the event of confirmation and a democratic majority in the House of Representatives , Pelosi hesitated .	-5.0042
“ I want to say this : if he does not tell the truth to Congress or to the FBI , he is not only unsuitable for serving the Supreme Court , but also for serving the court at which he is currently employed , ” Pelosi said .	-5.7335
Kavanaugh is currently a District Judge in the District Court of Appeals .	-4.2705
Pelosi added that , as a democrat , she is concerned about possible Kavanaugh judgments against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade , because he stands for conservative justice .	-3.9136
In his confirmation hearings , Kavanaugh dodged questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions .	-4.0176
“ It is not time for a hysterical , prejudiced person to go to court and expect us to say , “ Is this not wonderful , ” Pelosi said .	-3.3974
And women must stand by it .	-3.3121
It is a real hate speech , months and years of anger , and it cannot get it out without crying .	-4.5783
" We cry when we become angry , " said Mrs Steinem 45 years later .	-2.7049
'I do not think this is unusual , is it ? '	-2.4369
She continued : “ I was helped by a woman in the executive , who told me that she also wept when she was angry , but she developed a technique in which , every time she became angry and began to cry , she said to the person with whom she spoke : “ You may think I am sad because I am crying .	-13.2775
I am angry . '	-1.4803
And then she just went on .	-2.5847
And I thought that was brilliant . ”	-1.2285
Tears are allowed as a valve for anger because they are fundamentally misunderstood .	-3.1474
One of my strongest memories of an early job in a male-dominated office , where I once wept with indescribable anger , was that I was packed at my neck by an older woman , a disgusting manager before whom I was always slightly scared - who dragged me into a stairway .	-7.1397
" Never let her see you cry , " she told me .	-2.7421
" They do not know that you are angry .	-2.0241
They think you are sad and will be happy because they caught you . '	-3.9009
Patricia Schroeder , then a Democratic Congressman from Colorado , supported Gary Hart in his presidential election campaign .	-2.9658
In 1987 , when it became known that Mr. Hart had an extra-marital affair on board a boat called “ Monkey Business ” , he was out of the race .	-4.1991
“ It was not a well thought-out decision , ” she told me with a laugh 30 years later .	-3.0488
" There were seven more candidates in the race , and the last thing they needed was another .	-3.0301
Someone called it ' Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs ' .	-2.4666
Because the campaign has been in progress for a long time , it has been behind in raising funds , and so it vowed that it would not participate in the race unless it collected $ 2 million .	-6.6772
It was a lost battle .	-1.2757
She found that some of her supporters , who gave $ 1,000 to men , would give her only $ 250 .	-2.7127
“ Think that , I get a sucrose ? ” she wondered .	-7.9171
When she made her speech and announced that she would not launch a formal campaign , she was so overwhelmed by emotions - gratitude to the people who supported her , frustration with the system that made it so difficult to collect money and raise voters instead of delegates , and rage at sexism - that she was stifled .	-4.3845
“ One might think I had a nervous breakdown , ” Schroeder recalls how the press reacted to it .	-4.1037
" Kleenex was thought to be my corporate sponsor .	-2.4087

How China ’ s US-US Trade War Can Be Good for Beijing	-4.3061
The opening salves of the US-China trade war have been deafening , and no end to the conflict is in sight . A gap between the two countries can be beneficial to Beijing in the long term , experts say .	-6.0819
US President Donald Trump launched the first warning earlier this year by taxing important Chinese exports , such as solar panels , steel , and aluminum .	-3.0991
The introduction of new tariffs on Chinese products imported into the US , worth $ 200 billion ( GBP 150 billion ) , has led to a dramatic escalation this week .	-3.6466
Beijing has reciprocated each time in the form of non-cash benefits , most recently imposing tariffs of 5 to 10 % on US goods worth $ 60 billion .	-6.6613
China will respond to every blow by the US , and it is unlikely that the world ’ s second-largest economy will yield in the near future .	-4.7033
Bringing Washington to the fore means giving in to demands , but publicly bowing to the United States would be far too embarrassing for Xi Jinping , the president of China .	-5.7369
But if Beijing makes good use of its opportunities , the trade war with the US can have a positive impact on China in the long run by reducing the mutual dependencies of the two economies , experts say .	-5.3611
“ The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing can create the conditions for economic turmoil in one of the two countries is much more dangerous than observers previously assumed , ” said Abigail Grace , a researcher at the Center for New American Security , a think-tank focused on Asia .	-4.3031

Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country .	-2.4475
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional support or assistance from countries that financed the insurgency .	-2.6133
