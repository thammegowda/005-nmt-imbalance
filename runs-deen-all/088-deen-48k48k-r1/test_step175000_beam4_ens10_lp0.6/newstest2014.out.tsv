More pedestrian safety	-4.3551
You are not 100 meters from each other : on Tuesday the new B 33 pedestrian light was put into operation at the village car park - within sight of the older Town Hall lights .	-7.5710
Two plants so close to each other : intention or plot of shields ?	-4.8284
This question was clearly answered by Gutach ’ s mayor yesterday .	-3.5623
" The Rathausampel was installed at the time because it secured the way to school , " Eckert explained yesterday .	-4.8122
The Club traffic lights are safe for cyclists , bus passengers and mountain residents .	-5.4494
The facility which was officially operational yesterday is important for the crossing area Sulzbachweg / Kirchstra<unk>e .	-4.1552
We have the museum , two churches , spa park , bus stop , doctor and bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area <unk> Grub <unk> .	-4.2478
" With the high volume of traffic and pedestrians , another traffic light had to be created for safety , " Eckert says .	-6.0583
This is also confirmed by Peter Arnold of the Offenburg State Council .	-7.1470
" According to current measurements , around 12 000 vehicles pass through the municipality of Gutach every day on the B 33 , about ten percent of which are heavy goods vehicles , " says Arnold .	-5.8375
That is why the construction of another traffic light is more than necessary : " Safety is simple here " , says Arnold .	-5.6072
There were four traffic viewings in total , a roundabout was also thought up , but due to the narrowness of the crossing area Sulzbachweg / Kirchstra<unk>e again discarded .	-8.5974
According to Arnold , everything was tested before the Ampelmasts were selected : " By means of an extra van loaded for us with particularly long wooden trunks , we have checked out whether these vehicles can depart from the Sulzbachweg to the B 33 without changing the traffic lights " .	-9.4678
The approximately € 15,000 traffic light system itself is the " most modern on the market , " said Arnold .	-5.5190
The system is equipped with coloured LEDs , which shine so strongly that the lights can be easily seen by car drivers , for example , even in the low sun .	-7.9484
And it is also economical : the older lighting systems consume about 100 watts , the new just eight watts .	-4.0373
There are three lighting systems per travel direction .	-3.1383
Arnold explained the technique of the new plant : this is equipped with two radar sensors .	-3.1812
If the pedestrian pushes the traffic button , the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation .	-4.3979
If the road is free , comes directly green for the pedestrian , if not , it takes about 15 seconds .	-2.9933
Another radar sensor checks whether the pedestrian green phase can be finished .	-4.1968
" If a group or people with disabilities take to the streets , the green phase will be extended , so everyone will get safely across the road , " said Arnold .	-7.1256
Of course the driver has to think along as a partner here and watch the road .	-6.1827
This was not the case yesterday : as soon as the traffic light for pedestrians showed green , a first-class vehicle ran through - at bright red .	-6.2282
For more than 30 years Josef Winkler has been writing the needs of his childhood and youth from the soul .	-4.0551
The disasters of his Catholic village childhood - the speechlessness , the tendency to brute force and blunt sexuality , the narrowness and disaffection - have often been described by the Carinthian poet .	-7.1286
The recipient of the Bühner Prize is known primarily as a prose writer , and theatre texts are rare in his work .	-6.8642
Collage from Prosatextend Gerhard Fresacher presents for his performance " Wetterlichten auf der Zungsspitze " , which can now be seen in garage X on Petersplatz , a collage of Prosatextend .	-7.1787
The theatre maker combines elements from the autobiographical novel " Der Leibeigene " ( 1987 ) with prosaic works from " Leichnam , his family besieging " ( 2003 ) .	-6.6895
On the largely empty stage - important Requirement : a scratched sofa , on which alluring is copied and crushed - the eight-person ensemble hangs through the text material .	-9.0271
Director Fresacher seems to have little faith in the text .	-3.5069
The 70-minute performance overcomes the presentation with a wealth of register cases , known from the repertoire of post-dramatic forms of play .	-5.5118
Especially the actresses get involved in the sometimes somewhat questionable scenic implementations .	-6.2164
They are hard touched , dipped with their heads under water , softened with their evening robs to the wall .	-5.0686
Embedded in cellophane or bodice , they stack on dangerously high sticks through the staging , either monologize them loudly or lie completely muted on the stage floor .	-6.4262
However , the text is hardly conveyed in this hard way .	-4.9710
The best moments is the evening when sung - the bandwidth ranges from Deep Purple to popular songs .	-5.2882
Only towards the end does the overdone performance come to rest , and Winklern ’ s somewhat absurd humour flares up .	-7.8006
A black box in the car ?	-1.5944
American road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the decaying Highway-system , and believe they have found the solution in a small black box that can be found on the dashboard of any car .	-5.7607
The devices that record each kilometre travelled and report the information to the authorities are at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and the state planning offices to revise the outdated system for financing US roads .	-5.7999
The usually rather boring area of road planning has suddenly sparked intense debate with colourful alliances .	-4.3873
Libertarians have allied themselves with environmental groups , arguing that the government can use the small boxes to record the kilometres travelled – and perhaps also where they were driven – and then use the information to calculate tax rents .	-6.5344
The Tea Party is appalled .	-0.9862
The American Civil Rights Association ( ACLU ) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of data protection concerns .	-2.7270
But , while Congress cannot agree on how to proceed , several states are no longer waiting .	-3.2938
They are currently examining how they can switch over the next ten years to a system where drivers pay per mile .	-4.2516
Thousands of motorists have already tested the tachographs , some of which are equipped with GPS surveillance .	-3.0107
This is really a must for our country .	-2.0588
“ It ’ s not something we ’ ll only possibly use , ” said Hasan Ikhrata , Managing Director of Southern California Assn of Governments , who plans to record miles for all California car drivers in the state from 2025 onwards .	-6.0892
The way we pay these taxes will change .	-1.6711
The technology is there .	-1.3535
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund , financed from taxes paid to Americans at the fuel dispenser , is bankrupt .	-4.7446
But there is no longer as much dancing in America as it used to be . is . is . , , , , , , , ,	-7.0008
Cars use less petrol .	-1.1629
The state oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon ( less than 4 cents per litre ) has not increased for 20 years .	-3.0981
Politicians do not dare to raise the tax by one cent at high fuel prices .	-3.4358
“ The fuel tax is simply not sustainable , ” Lee Munnich , an expert in traffic legislation at the University of Minnesota .	-3.8491
His state has recently equipped 500 cars with tachographs to test a meile-based payment system .	-4.3162
“ This is the most sensible long-term option , ” he said .	-2.9953
Bureaucrats call it a meile-based user fee .	-3.2003
Not surprisingly , the idea resonates with urban liberals , for example , because the tax could be used to influence driving behaviour in such a way as to reduce congestion and climate-damaging emissions .	-4.4259
California planners rely on the system to develop strategies to achieve the ambitious , legally-anchored goals of the federal state on climate change .	-5.4142
But the Republican Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania , Chairman of the House Transportation Committee , has also stated that he sees it as the most viable long-term alternative .	-4.0828
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are also inspired by the idea of having drivers pay after a short distance .	-6.5351
“ This is not a tax that disappears in a black hole , ” says Adrian Moore , Vice President for Reason Guidelines .	-3.0409
People pay directly for what they get .	-1.8037
The movement is also supported by two former US transport ministers , who , in a 2011 report , called on Congress to move toward meile-based accounting .	-4.7367
Last year , the US Senate approved a $ 90 million pilot project involving 10,000 cars .	-2.8055
But the majority in the House of Representatives blocked the move , responding to the concerns of rural MPs representing people who often have to travel many miles to work or to the city in their daily lives .	-6.5180
Several states and major cities are nevertheless moving in this direction on their own .	-3.7329
The most committed is Oregon , which is currently recruiting 5,000 drivers for the country ’ s largest experiment .	-4.3522
These drivers will soon pay the mileage tax to the state instead of the mineral oil tax .	-4.0651
Nevada has already completed a pilot project .	-1.0242
New York City is also considering this .	-2.7572
Illinois tests it to a limited extent with trucks .	-2.4168
And the I-95 coalition , which includes the transport ministries of 17 states on the east coast ( including Maryland , Pennsylvania , Virginia , and Florida ) , is currently investigating how to introduce the change .	-3.6069
The concept is not a universal hit .	-0.9646
In Nevada , where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with the equipment , drivers were skeptical that the government could follow any of its movements .	-4.0506
“ Concerns about Big Brother and such things were a major problem , ” says Alauddin Khan , Head of Strategy and Results Management at the Department of Transportation of Nevada .	-3.6632
People did not want it .	-1.3469
When the test started , the Nevada ACLU on its website warned : “ It would be relatively easy to turn tachographs into full-fledged surveillance devices . ”	-4.4105
There is no need to build a gigantic , bulky technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data about the daily movements of individuals .	-2.8995
Nevada is part of a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology to enable the state to capture miles travelled , but not exactly when and where .	-4.8899
Thus , Khan said , the public would also be more reassured .	-4.1932
Hunting for this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California .	-2.8130
The company was originally not set up to help states tax drivers .	-4.9998
Rather , it was its goal to enter an emerging market for car insurance , where drivers are to pay on the basis of the mileage travelled .	-6.6116
But the devices tested by them are also interesting for road planners , because they do not work with GPS and provide only limited information that is regularly uploaded via modem .	-5.5381
“ People are more willing to participate if their speed and locations are not recorded , ” said Ryan Morrison , CEO of True Mileage .	-3.5447
Major mistakes have been made in some of these public pilot programmes .	-2.6732
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways of doing this .	-2.7722
In Oregon , planners experiment with giving drivers a range of choices .	-3.1367
You can choose a device with or without GPS .	-1.7988
Or they do not choose a unit at all and instead pay a flat rate based on the miles travelled on average by all residents of the state .	-5.4132
Others hope to be able to sell the concept of a suspicious public by providing the equipment with more functions than with less .	-4.8436
In New York City , traffic officials want to develop a tax device that can also pay parking fees , pay insurance only for miles travelled , and collect speed data from other vehicles in real time , allowing drivers to avoid congestion .	-6.2619
“ Drivers would be motivated to participate through the added value of the benefits offered by the system , ” says a city planning document .	-4.3142
Some road planners , however , wonder whether all the talk of paying per mile is not just a huge distraction .	-4.1128
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the area of San Francisco Bay , officials said that Congress could simply solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund by raising fuel taxes .	-4.7417
An additional one-time fee or annual levy could be imposed on drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume little petrol , so that they , too , pay a fair share .	-5.1293
‘ There is no reason for an operation if an aspirin is sufficient ’ , says Randy Rentschler , the Commission ’ s head of legislation and public affairs .	-4.8815
If we do that , hundreds of millions of motorists worry about their privacy and many other things .	-2.5585
The King ’ s Field : Small Crew	-4.1899
The volunteer fire brigade handled their autumn main test with flying colours despite lack of staff .	-5.6467
Only eleven men took part in the exercise .	-1.9613
Abteilungskommandant Hans Kammerer had chosen the premises of the Burgberger Stra<unk>e in his training acceptance .	-6.8719
A short circuit is supposed to have emerged during sawing .	-5.1994
Two people were injured by the fire and the development of smoke , but one of them could send an emergency call .	-5.2716
After the first examination of the situation by Hans Kammerer , two Wehrmacht guards prepared to enter the building .	-6.5668
After a short period of time , the first person was able to find and guide him to the outside world .	-6.0039
The second person had to be worn .	-1.5887
This was not so easy as a narrow staircase was also to be overcome .	-4.5310
The building , a workshop with integrated stables for two horses , was not easy to secure .	-2.7305
It stored a lot of wood and also straw balls in it .	-5.1701
There were also electrical machines for woodworking .	-3.0906
The first extinguishing attack was carried out via the tank in the vehicle .	-2.6190
A further line was taken by an abundance hydrant about 100 meters away .	-6.2355
Now three extinguishing attacks have been designed .	-3.5595
A hollow tube was also used in the building .	-3.3387
Hans Kammerer was also interested in showing what can be done with little staff available .	-5.3324
In case of emergency , support is provided via the Königsfeld Day Operations Group .	-4.9550
The commander was satisfied with the course of the exercise .	-2.5635
Connecting universities and firms	-2.9615
On his visit to the Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald district , Landtag president Guido Wolf was also informed in Titisee-Neustadt about where the workers of tomorrow come from .	-5.7110
In the Hochschwarzwald Förderzentrum he studied this important issue together with the managing directors of the vocational schools and the upper school of the Kreisgymnasium and the chairman of the parental advisory board .	-7.4016
" Education is an important location factor , " Claudia Standing , Director of the Hans-Thoma School , who presented the networked school project " Education Centre Hochschwarzwald " .	-5.5939
Wolf was impressed by the model projects for training .	-3.3805
Since 2011 , there has been a successful cooperation between the Förderzentrum , the Kreisgymnasium and the Berufsschulzentrum .	-4.9529
He also praised the family-friendly nature of the district .	-3.5563
" It is important not only to have a look at the family phase , but also at the period of care for family members due to demographic change , " said Wolf .	-5.6848
He also suggested that more and more employees care for the care and care of their loved ones .	-4.5040
" Without the support of employers , the resulting burden on employees could lead to an end to the employment relationship , " said Wolf .	-3.9562
But no one can afford to lose skilled workers , he continued .	-2.1760
Another particularly important factor is the networking of universities and companies .	-3.1115
" After all , those who have experienced the benefits of the region during their studies often maintain the regional economy with their acquired knowledge and skills , which helps to strengthen the region , " the Landtag president was convinced .	-7.9150
Only if sufficient training places were offered can the demand for skilled workers be met .	-4.3098
In his opinion , the geographical advantage of the district is its favourable location in the south-west of Germany , close to France and Switzerland .	-4.4482
In addition , during his rail journey from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg , he experienced the efforts already made to develop local public transport .	-6.3380
" Keep up the momentum and make public transport better , " he said to the local politicians present .	-6.2531
Experience an entertaining afternoon with music	-3.0697
For 15 years the Kaul family has been inviting the Dietinger Seniors to coffee , cake and afterwards to a Vesper .	-5.0139
In the past , the elderly were promoted to a rest place .	-5.9842
In the meantime , the St. Josef nursing home takes place this afternoon .	-4.0134
The residents were happy with the delicious cakes and cakes .	-4.8065
Later , there was a sausage salad .	-3.3656
With popular melodies , Silvia kept Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich .	-5.3112
The more than 100 years old natural stone wall as the front line of the old school yard to the Kirchstra<unk>e , which is to be renovated , is to be put back on the city ’ s plans for redevelopment .	-9.6727
In the days before Kilbig a small brick wall with balustrade was built in the first works of the restoration of the front school yard .	-6.7071
According to Alexander Misok of the Brännlinger Stadtbauamt , the plan is to include the National Monument Office in the planning and to create a redevelopment concept for the old wall .	-7.6388
After that , a cost calculation will be carried out by experts , which will then be put on the table for the municipal council to decide and determine how to proceed .	-6.8447
A decision on this is expected to be taken next year .	-2.8494
After the restoration , pavement and tree planting of the old school interior within the two wings of the school built in 1912 , the restoration wall in need of renovation must be reconstructed from scratch and placed on new substructures in the foreseeable future .	-7.9627
The historic , 100-year-old boundary wall of the old school yard to the Kirchstra<unk>e , is particularly in need of redevelopment due to damage to water and frost , since there is no drainage , and has a tendency to arch forward .	-7.9845
Deep cracks in individual stones are evidence of weather damage , but the wall is not currently in danger of collapse .	-5.3791
A stable wall is a prerequisite for one of the students to use the Schulhof , which has been done by the current fixing work .	-6.8997
Originally , the school courtyard refurbishment was planned even in 2008 / 2009 , but high unscheduled expenditure resulted in a shift .	-6.6804
An important word in the historical reconstruction of the school wall , which has even been used for film recordings , will be spoken by the National Monument Office .	-6.9188
The town of Brännlingen hopes to receive grants from the conservation authorities .	-6.4558
The students of the Bräunlinger Primary School , who are now taught in a well renovated old school building with new Aula , can soon use the old school courtyard .	-6.3526
<unk>zdemir wants to receive jazz training in Stuttgart	-2.3711
In the ongoing discussions about the future of music schools in Baden-Württemberg , Cem <unk>zdemir , Federal Chairman of the Greens , has now also taken part .	-5.0079
" I think it is wrong to give up holistic training at the Musikhochschule Stuttgart " , said <unk>zdemir the " Stuttgarter Nachricht " .	-3.5027
Jazz and classical are currently together at the jazz location Stuttgart .	-4.8080
Thus , <unk>zdemir , who is regarded in Stuttgart as a favorite for a direct mandate in the federal election on 22 September , contradicts the Green Red state government .	-6.4759
On the basis of an expert study , this forces a reorganisation of the five music schools in Baden-Württemberg .	-8.6693
The study programme Jazz and Pop will be transferred from the Musikhochschule Stuttgart to the Musikhochschule Mannheim .	-4.7470
discovered ' super-tunnel ' to drug smuggling	-10.0763
On the border between Mexico and the US , investigators have discovered and shut down a ' super tunnel ' to drug smuggling .	-3.4513
As US customs officials pointed out , the 500 meter long tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity , rail tracks , and a ventilation system .	-4.3872
Three suspects were thus arrested , eight tonnes of marijuana and almost 150 kilograms of cocaine seized .	-2.8684
According to data , the tunnel had not yet been used .	-2.7509
" These cartels are stupid if they think they could get through under the radar , " said the Attorney General of the US District of Southern California , Laura Duffy , at a press conference in front of a warehouse in San Diego , where one end of the tunnel had been discovered .	-5.4385
" If you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them , we are determined to make that a huge waste of your dirty money " .	-5.3065
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a permanent battle against the drug cartels .	-2.7552
Since 2006 , more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug crime .	-2.0682
Constructed by Experts	-1.4155
Due to the extensive equipment of the tunnel , investigators assume that it was constructed by architects and engineers and that it took about a year .	-5.4049
The track system was equipped so that electric cars could be used there .	-4.3016
On the Mexican side , access is in a building 80 metres from the border .	-4.2938
According to the authorities , a ladder leads 20 metres into the depth to the actual entrance to the tunnel .	-4.6361
The tunnel has a cross section of 1.20 m height and 90 cm wide .	-3.3290
He would also have been able to promote illegal immigration towards the US .	-4.1888
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with cocaine .	-2.1420
The third , a Mexican , was caught for confiscated marijuana .	-2.7942
All three face the threat of life imprisonment , as officials have said .	-3.6766
Eight such tunnels have been discovered since 2006 , and the press conference in San Diego continued .	-2.6372
However , this is the first time that cocaine has been found in such a tunnel .	-7.0343
Normally , cocaine is smuggled in small quantities , not through tunnels .	-2.9570
This shows the " despair " of drug gangs whose traditional routes are now cut off , Bill Sherman said of the DEA drug addiction in San Diego .	-4.1139
They would do everything they can to get to the US .	-2.7722
The detainees were not given details , at least one being Mexicans , it was said .	-4.4830
They have to expect prison sentences of up to ten years .	-2.8817
In 2014 , Geising-Year	-5.0314
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of 1250 .	-2.6762
The return of the first documented mention is getting closer .	-4.4615
The anniversary year is coming to an end when the year is over eight weeks .	-5.2806
Geisingen and Kirchen-Hausen were first documented together in 794 .	-3.3433
A certificate was produced in churches , in which both places are mentioned .	-5.2801
On 15 March there will be an official start to the anniversary year , and since Geisingen currently does not have a hall , this kick-off event will take place in the place where both were mentioned for the first time 1250 years ago , in church houses .	-6.0143
A number of events are planned in Geisingen as well as in Kirchen-Hausen .	-4.3947
Church houses will be the 1250 during a festival weekend from July 18th to 20th .	-5.2699
Celebrate the return .	-3.4237
On Friday with a festival , on Saturday and Sunday with a festival around the Kirchtalhalle .	-3.6071
At the end of the festival there is also the church festival .	-6.0913
The City Music Director Rudolf Barth has written a contract composition for the city on the occasion of the anniversary , which will be performed on three dates .	-4.8486
On the 21st of June , together with the Schwarzwaldverein ’ s Sunday celebration , on the 12th of July in the Arena with fireworks and on the 13th of December as the first concert of city music in the new Festhalle .	-9.7599
This will be completed and inaugurated in the anniversary year , the official date will be on the last weekend of September , 27 and 28 September .	-4.7257
A new chronicle will be published on the occasion of the Geisinger city anniversary .	-4.7217
" But it is not just a chronicle of violin singing itself , but a printed work about the violin of today , which consists of violin singing , church houses , Leipferdingen , Aulfingen and Gutmaddingen " , says Mayor Walter Hengstler .	-6.6988
Today ’ s vulture is also celebrating its birthday in 2014 , and today ’ s space was completed in 1974 with the contributions .	-6.6356
The new chronicle will be presented on 21 or 22 November at the new Festhalle in Geisingen .	-2.9891
But 2014 is another year of many anniversaries .	-3.1442
The Narrenzuft Strohglonki begins on 8 February with a traditional evening on the occasion of its 60-year existence , the Harmonie Gutmadingen becomes 90 years and has the Festbankett on 29 March and then celebrates the District Music Festival from 1 to 4 May .	-6.3634
The Altenwerk Leipferdingen ( Altenwerk Leipferdingen ) is 40 years old , the Geisinger school has been in its new location for 50 years and celebrates it on 10 May , the Musikverein Polyhymnia Leipferdingen ( Musikverein Polyhymnia Leipferdingen ) is 150 years old and is celebrating it as part of the Brunnenfest from 4 to 7 July .	-7.0750
The town of Geisingen was first mentioned in records in 764 in a gift certificate owned by the St. Gallen Monastery .	-8.1481
The document was produced in churches ( houses ) , which was a court place at the time .	-4.8361
Both communities are thus mentioned in the same document .	-2.2785
The reason for celebrating this 1250 year in 2014 is , in addition , the municipal reform has been 40 years .	-5.8806
The Council is targeting rail installations	-4.4498
Should the railway crossing " Am Hirschen " be rebuilt in order to increase road safety ?	-4.7053
Yes , the local councils have decided .	-2.5912
For this , it must be EUR 220 000 .	-4.5189
The German Railway intends to improve the Kinzigtal railway line next year .	-4.2264
In particular , safety at railway crossings is to be increased - there are regular collisions of trains with other vehicles throughout Germany .	-6.5957
If the municipalities agree to redevelopment measures , they will have to contribute by a third to the costs , while the rest share the line and the federal government .	-8.2141
Schiltach 's master builder Roland Grie<unk>haber explained to the municipal council the peculiarities of the Bahrübergang " Am Hirschen " .	-5.6938
There , the city plans to build an outflow to the west of the railway tracks .	-6.6359
Large vehicles , such as those that transport longwood , could also be used for counter-traffic without having to block the tracks .	-6.5331
Grie<unk>haber therefore proposed to construct a necessary support wall in such a way that the city could widen the subsequent road in due course in order to ensure a smooth flow of traffic .	-5.9418
This was a controversial debate in the municipal council , as some councils doubted the need for road traffic : Thomas Kipp , in his statement , brought to the point the critics ' mood : ' Do we have to take so much money in the hands of so few vehicles ? '	-8.6863
Mayor Thomas Haas refuted : The railway crossing " Hirschen " is regularly used for longwood transports .	-5.2327
Even wood from the " Kuhbach " area is sometimes transported over this route because the vehicles up to 20 meters long could not use the route at the Häberlesbrücke because they could not turn into the main road .	-6.2044
Moreover , the route serves as a diversion for those vehicles that cannot use the tunnel when the main road is closed , Haas argued .	-3.8625
It is clear that the Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnels would have to be rebuilt and renovated , as is currently the case in Wolfach , that the railway crossing " Am " on " Hirschen " could also have an important traffic significance for a longer period .	-8.2707
The councils agreed to investigate the costs of the planned extension of the road .	-3.9763
Despite this , the reconstruction of the railway crossing was approved by a majority with the proviso that the necessary support wall is built in such a way that the city can extend the subsequent road towards " Bahnhofstra<unk>e " to approximately 5.5 metres for meeting traffic .	-7.8168
By contrast , the conversion of the railway crossing at Gerient Trautwein could lead to a quite different problem , which concerns access to the strongly increasing " Geroltzhäuser Weg " .	-7.5998
The administration had examined the conversion plans of the railway from the engineering company Breinlinger , as it had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhäuser Wege was still possible .	-7.3467
The investigation concluded that it was not possible to rule out the fact that the slope conditions of the road could lead to longer cars sitting .	-10.6066
The responsibility for this is borne by the city as a road-building contractor .	-4.5979
The reconstruction can therefore lead to liability disputes .	-4.9675
Haas argued that since both logging and bending worked in the current condition , the reconstruction of the railway crossing should not be agreed .	-7.1539
At this point , the risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle on the transition is significantly lower than at the other railway crossings , because there is a good visual connection right next to the center stop .	-8.0853
Even trains from the main railway station would have to be held back to the point where there is no danger of collision .	-6.3320
In many cases , the reconstruction of this railway crossing was refused permission , as the city of Schiltach had to " take out " the problem of sedentary vehicles , according to the councils , as the railway could withdraw from its responsibility after the construction work had been completed .	-13.8737
The panel considers the changes at the railway crossings " Vor Heubach " and " Vor Kuhbach " , for which cross-arrangements with the railway have already been made .	-6.3180
Esa decides on major space missions : Missions for Billions	-3.4085
Remote planets , gravitational waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects that they want to launch in the coming years .	-4.6018
30 proposals were available , five are still in the race .	-3.6977
Far worlds .	-1.1415
More than 1000 planets at other stars have already found astronomers .	-2.3342
No one knows whether there is life in at least some of them .	-4.2848
The choice is difficult : should you search for gravitational waves ?	-3.8522
Or rather explore the origin of the cosmos ?	-1.7711
Or search for earth-like planets and discover alien life with it ?	-6.1370
These are the questions raised by those responsible for the European Space Agency , Esa .	-4.1870
For their " Cosmic Vision " programme , they are looking for ideas for two major space projects that are designed to drive research forward .	-6.1234
The budget for such " L missions " is approximately EUR 1 billion each .	-3.2143
The start is expected to be 2028 and 2034 .	-2.3039
In early September , the elite of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions .	-2.0988
30 ideas were under discussion , five of which were now shortlisted .	-4.9548
Many bodies examine the proposals and look at the researchers .	-5.1048
A final decision will be taken by the scientific programme committee in the next few days .	-3.3115
In total , four big questions have been selected by the Esa , to which the missions of the program " Cosmic Vision " launched in 2007 will find answers .	-5.9319
What are the conditions for the emergence of planets and lives ?	-1.9056
The exact processes of the formation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus the formation of planets surrounding these stars - are still in the proverbial dark .	-5.6577
A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this dark .	-1.8369
And if a star has a planet , under what circumstances can life develop there ?	-3.4577
To address this issue , the " Cheops " space telescope will be launched in 2017 , which will examine more closely 500 known planetary systems in our vicinity .	-15.6585
The possibilities are limited , but Cheops is a small mission with a budget of EUR 150 million .	-3.1104
With larger instruments , astronomers could map Earth like planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres , thus searching for " biomarkers " : gases that are considered as an indicator of biological activity .	-5.1932
How does the solar system work ?	-1.2082
This question , too , is ultimately intended to shed light on the conditions for the emergence of life .	-5.1406
The magnetic activity of a star plays an important role and the interaction of its magnetic field and the particle radiation emitted by it with the planetary system .	-4.4915
In our solar system these processes can be investigated in an exemplary manner .	-3.6501
With the Solar Orbiter , the Esa has already approved a M-class mission ( there the budget is around half a billion euros ) for this issue .	-4.4398
The probe is scheduled to launch in 2017 and monitor the surface and activity of the sun .	-4.5291
Jupiter and its moons are of great interest to the researchers .	-2.9194
You want to find out what role the giant planet played in the development of the solar system .	-3.1118
The Esa is the first of the three L missions of the Cosmic Vision program .	-4.5676
The probe " Juice " ( Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer ) starts its journey probably 2022 .	-4.0795
Eight years later , she reaches Jupiter and is to study the atmosphere of the planet as well as the icy moons of Europe , Kallisto and Ganymed .	-5.2064
What are the basic physical laws of the universe ?	-1.0204
The universe offers many possibilities to study matter under extreme conditions and to examine whether the laws of nature we know are still valid there .	-4.8721
Perhaps there are also deviations that might lead the physicists to a new theory under which all known laws of nature can be united .	-5.5864
How did the universe come into being and what is it ?	-5.2493
13.7 billion years ago our cosmos was created by the big bang .	-3.2122
In addition to the material we are familiar with , from the stars , planets , and living beings like us , there are dark matter , whose gravity holds galaxies and galaxy clusters together , and dark energy , through which the expansion of space accelerates .	-6.5651
So far , researchers do not know which physical laws were valid in the first fractions of the Big Bang , nor what dark matter and dark energy exist .	-5.7845
With " Euclid " Esa has already approved an M mission here , which is scheduled to start in 2020 .	-4.4808
With a special telescope , the probe is supposed to investigate the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time in the entire sky , thus enabling conclusions on the nature of dark matter and dark energy .	-6.5505
Who Can Race	-1.6440
Of the 30 proposals , only two will be left at the end of the selection procedure .	-2.0237
According to many experts , the best chances of being approved as an L-mission are " E-Lisa " , a sophisticated concept for the detection of gravitational waves .	-5.3472
These are physicists ’ changes in the structure of space time that Albert Einstein predicted almost 100 years ago .	-4.1350
They have not been shown up to now .	-3.2901
Elisa could do that , the scientists hope behind the project .	-3.1116
The mission provides for a detector consisting of two or three probes that will be deployed in space .	-5.0571
In contrast to plants on Earth , it could also prove gravitational waves created by the Big Bang , thus providing new insights into the formation of the cosmos .	-6.5598
Four more proposals compete for the second L mission : a large X-ray telescope called " Athena " , which is to explore black holes , " Icy Planets " , another mission to the outer planets of the solar system , " Prism " , a mission to measure cosmic background radiation , and the " Exopplanet Finder " , which is to explore and explore similar planets .	-5.8151
There are already proposals for sample return transport from Mars , for research into moon , Venus and asteroids and for solar physics .	-7.0584
Snowden ready to “ cooperate ” with Germany on US surveillance	-2.6572
Edward Snowden , the US intelligence officer ’ s whistleblower , has said that he is willing to go to Berlin and say to the German Bundestag if the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander do not provide answers about their activities .	-6.0295
German MEP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden on Thursday in Russia , where he received asylum to discuss with him the statement in Germany .	-3.6814
In a letter from Snowden , presented by Ströbele to the media in Berlin on Friday , he writes : “ Even though the result of my efforts has been demonstrably positive , my government continues to treat dissent as a breach of trust and seeks to criminalize political expression with a threat of punishment , in which no defence is possible . ”	-5.8984
But telling the truth is not a crime .	-1.7419
In the letter , Snowden writes that he believes that the international community ’ s support can convince the American government to drop the charge .	-4.1471
The indictment by the US Department of Justice includes espionage and theft of state property .	-2.9828
German Minister of the Interior , Hans-Peter Friedrich , told Time Online , “ If Mr Snowden is prepared to speak to German representatives , we will find ways to make that possible . ”	-5.2455
Relations between the US and Germany are strained by claims that the NSA has listened to Chancellor Angela Merkel ’ s mobile phone .	-3.1276
Thomas Oppermann , the MEP who heads the parliamentary committee responsible for the secret service , said that it should seize the opportunity to listen to Snowden as a witness , if possible , “ without endangering him and completely destroying relations with the US . ”	-6.1414
Ströbele , a member of the Greens , published a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed .	-2.3975
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia .	-1.7150
Ströbele explained that , according to the lawyer of former NSA employee Snowden , he cannot return to Russia if he leaves the country .	-3.8974
If Snowden speaks in Germany , he needs an assurance that he is “ safe , ” he said .	-4.3915
Snowden stated in his letter that he was exposed to a “ serious and ongoing ” campaign of persecution that drove him out of his homeland .	-4.1899
But it is touched by the global response to “ my act of political expression . ”	-2.7232
Citizens around the world , as well as senior politicians – including in the United States – have described the revelations about an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance as a public credit .	-5.3275
In his letter , Snowden makes an offer of cooperation to the German authorities , “ if the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation have been solved . ”	-7.4862
Frontier Airlines charges for hand baggage	-1.1999
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $ 100 for passengers who wish to pack their hand baggage on their flight .	-3.7731
Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to $ 100 for one piece of hand baggage and $ 2 for coffee or lemonade , even if the announcement on Wednesday was read that passengers should keep all cans .	-4.8728
The new charge applies to hand baggage in the baggage compartment above the seat , and small bags under the seat remain free of charge .	-4.2811
Frontier explained that you will be charged $ 25 if the fee is paid in advance , and $ 100 for travellers who paid at the gate .	-5.2619
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O 'Malley said the charge of $ 100 targets to move travelers to take care of the payment in advance .	-4.5179
“ We don ’ t want to calculate this sum , ” she explained .	-3.0139
Airlines began charging for the first and second piece of baggage in 2008 .	-2.7806
Passengers who tried to avoid them therefore took as much as possible into their hand baggage , which means that the baggage compartments above the seat are often overfilled .	-6.4779
Charges are a way of getting passengers to take less on board .	-3.3635
O 'Malley said that the new fee is not really about making money .	-1.8576
It concerns Frontier ’ s most loyal customers , who would have made it clear that it would be increasingly difficult to find room above the seat .	-6.2139
Passengers who buy their tickets on the airline ’ s website do not have to pay .	-3.1722
This means that a passenger may be allowed to take a piece of baggage free of charge at Frontier 's boarding gate , but the next person may have to pay $ 100 for a comparable piece of baggage .	-5.5610
O 'Malley explained that the Frontier website and the check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers were informed about the fee before they came to the gate .	-4.1740
Frontier 's new hand baggage allowance will not enter into force until the summer , but there is no exact date yet .	-5.4281
Passengers often complain about baggage charges and other charges , but airlines like to resort to them .	-4.5294
They argue that the transportation of baggage should cost money and passengers should pay this service if they wish .	-4.2868
Many on Wall Street see the new baggage charges as a sign that airlines are taking enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of loss .	-3.7847
However , most of them have left their finger on charges for hand baggage .	-9.0142
Spirit Airlines Inc. was the first to charge hand baggage three years ago and later , Allegiant Air , also a low-cost carrier , followed .	-5.2573
The only other airline with such a charge is the Hungarian Wizz Air , explained the airline adviser Jay Sorensen , who is following the additional fees closely .	-4.7196
He estimated in a report in December 2011 that Spirit ’ s hand baggage fee would be $ 50 million annually .	-5.1436
Sorensen , who previously held a leading position at Midwest Airlines , recently flown with Spirit and was curious about what would be expected of him at the boarding gate if passengers were confronted with the company ’ s unusual hand baggage charge .	-6.2686
“ The boarding process was one of the most smooth I experienced in my career in aviation , ” he said .	-3.7366
I expected to see gnomes and tangible discussions at the boarding gate .	-3.1380
“ The plane was full , ” he said , “ and boarding was running like smelled . ”	-3.9700
Frontier also follows Spirit in the 2 dollars required for coffee , tea , lemonade or juice .	-3.8572
The company explained that people who bought lemonade or juice should keep all cans and coffee free of charge .	-4.7050
Water is still free .	-1.0154
US Airways had briefly tried to demand money for soft drinks in 2008 , but reversed it seven months later after passengers complained and no other large company moved .	-5.7429
Frontier ’ s move to charge for hand baggage if passengers do not buy directly from the airline is the latest initiative to guide customers to their own website .	-5.1362
Airlines pay online travel agencies like Orbitz 10 to 25 US dollars per sold ticket .	-3.0982
This provides an incentive for all companies to move passengers to purchase them directly , rather than through an online travel agency .	-5.7982
Frontier has gone furthest in this area .	-2.3039
In September , the company started to award only half as many frequent flyer miles when booking through an online travel agency .	-3.3322
On Wednesday , miles were once again reduced to 25 % of the route .	-3.4480
For this reason , a flight booked with a third party carrier with a frontier over 1,000 miles will only accrue customers 250 miles .	-6.9091
Passengers can also reserve seats on the Frontier site only when directly purchased .	-4.9927
Frontier has a loyal client base in Denver , but the business is shrinking and the company is losing money .	-3.4734
Revenues declined by 9 percent , and flight capacity declined by just under 13 percent in the first quarter , as reported in the financial report published on Wednesday by the parent company , Republic Airways Holdings Inc .	-8.7593
Republic has tried to control Frontier 's finances as part of the sale of the company . is .	-13.0907
Words from the Bible	-2.8067
About 40 women visited this year 's last women 's breakfast in the evangelical parish of Bisingen .	-4.3495
The theme of the day in the town hall were " Bible sayings " and " Middle Ages idioms " .	-5.9631
After breakfast , Zita Köhler , the chairman of the Council of Churches , gave a lecture on biblical sayings .	-5.4653
" Talk contains wisdom , rules , or warnings , " she explained .	-4.3026
She compared several sayings with the corresponding Bible posts and explained the meaning .	-3.5901
She called sayings such as : Woodeye is vigilant as scales fall from the eyes , cast an eye on someone who gives his own in sleep , wash his hands of it .	-10.0479
On several occasions , the speaker also advised their listeners what the saying was .	-4.9669
In the Middle Ages , the Church Mayor , Christel Dehner , took up the phrase : all good things are three , make blue , look a little bit .	-8.0882
She explained the meaning and origin of the expressions she called ' bridges to the past ' .	-3.2377
Finally , a raffle was announced .	-3.8966
The prizes were covered on a table and described humorously before being handed over to the winners .	-4.5657
Among the visitors to the breakfast round was also Mayor Roman Waizenegger .	-5.6377
Learning rather than unemployed : Pilot project for Unlearned Tourism	-3.9653
Today , a pilot project for the tourism industry starts at the Mecklenburg Lake District .	-4.2893
Under the leadership of the Federal Employment Agency , 49 women and men who are already working as unskilled workers in the industry are to be qualified for hotels and restaurants over three winters .	-6.0119
" What is new is that the six-month courses end with degrees , " said Carmen Wiechert of the Arbeitsagentur Neubrandenburg .	-3.8174
The benefits are manifold : the participants would not be unemployed , firms would receive skilled workers who were increasingly lacking in hotels and restaurants , and the agency would not have to finance unemployment .	-6.1597
The project also involves the Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Neubrandenburg and the German Hotel and Restaurant Association ( Dehega ) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern .	-4.2557
NSA says that an “ internal error , ” not hackers , is to blame for the crash of the website .	-4.5960
The shadowy National Security Agency explained on late Friday that a bug has crippled their public website for a few hours , not hackers , as was claimed online .	-5.3846
“ NSALOG was unreachable for a few hours this night , as an internal error occurred during a planned update , ” the spy agency explained in an email message .	-6.4066
The problem will be fixed this evening .	-1.7591
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed denial of service attack ( DDoS ) is not true .	-2.0418
In the early evening , online server trackers noticed that the NSA website was unavailable for at least six hours and that this is still not available for some users .	-5.5172
Previously , a NSA spokesman said to ABC News that the authority ’ s sensitive internal network was “ in no way compromised . ”	-3.1724
Secret information is not in danger , the speaker said .	-2.5447
At least one group of hackers claimed to have paralysed the NSA website with a DDoS attack .	-2.5790
In the event of such attacks , the target website is flooded with page calls until the servers are overloaded and the website collapses .	-5.3708
Cybertactics are relatively simple , and the attacks do not serve to invade the target system ’ s internal network .	-4.3784
The former super-secret NSA , whose nickname was once No Search Agency ( no such agency ) , is now in the bright light of the public and faces harsh criticism after revelations about its extensive domestic and foreign surveillance program in recent months – a result of the secret NSA data stolen and released by the disillusioned former NSA employee Edward Snowden .	-11.8610
The growing controversy surrounding the secret service fueled initial speculation that the incident today was the result of a targeted Cyperoperation .	-4.5189
The number of people without jobs fell slightly in October by 22 to 1.307 .	-3.6625
Although the 3.1 % ratio was better than last year and better than in September , " we would have hoped for more , " says Monika Felder-Bauer , deputy head of the agency for work in Sonthofen .	-5.3366
Many companies have so far reacted with regard to attitudes .	-3.9548
One reason for this is , according to Felder-Bauer , ' We have few skilled workers in the craft , health care and care for the elderly ' .	-5.5074
Due to the years of the year , new job opportunities for staff in the hotel and restaurant industry have been opened since September .	-8.1990
The winter season begins here in mid-December .	-2.9273

Bombardier ’ s profit loss following the decline in supply numbers and orders	-5.2351
On Thursday , the Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15 % decline in net profit after falling orders and deliveries of third quarter aircraft and contract problems in the rail sector .	-5.8769
Based in Montreal , Bombardier also did not publish flight test data for his brand new CSeries aircraft , and did not provide any further information on whether the aircraft could be used for commercial purposes in accordance with the ambitious timetable next September .	-6.2239
One and a half months ago , only three further launches followed the maiden flight of the test aircraft , making it questionable whether the test phase is proceeding as planned .	-6.5269
The results fell short of the forecasts and led to a decline of more than eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange .	-5.2585
Cameron Doerksen , an analyst at National Bank Financial , lowered his assessment of “ outperform ” to “ sector perform ” on Thursday , with a view to a limited share price potential in the next quarter or two .	-6.0622
“ Although weaker deliveries on aircraft were expected as much as possible , we are clearly disappointed by the increase in margins in the transport sector , ” says Doerksen in a customer letter .	-5.5658
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries if the aircraft test programme goes ahead .	-4.2515
However , if no new orders are announced in the coming months , we expect the market to become more sceptical about the programme .	-3.4755
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft range can catapult the company into the lower market segment currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus .	-3.0460
The first test aircraft was presented to the public in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delays . were . and were .	-5.1091
But , so far , binding orders for the CSeries have been moderate , with 177 potential buyers waiting for the results of the flight tests to see whether the company ’ s claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost-saving potential for the new jet aircraft are correct .	-6.2261
There are currently a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies .	-2.4363
Chief Executive Officer Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will reach its target of 300 binding orders at the start of commercial use .	-3.6652
On Thursday , the company ’ s management also assured analysts and the media that the programme was on schedule .	-4.2057
“ The test aircraft was no longer grounded than expected , ” Beaudoin said at a telephone conference and added that ground tests and software updates were scheduled during the aircraft ’ s service life .	-5.1692
Each manufacturer plans differently .	-2.1057
We have decided to take a first flight and then set up a revision period , as we have done .	-4.8349
This is done throughout the programme .	-2.9644
The second of five test aircraft is expected to start in the next few weeks , and the remaining one shortly thereafter , it was announced by the company .	-6.8763
Nevertheless , analysts remain sceptical as to whether the first customer can take a CSeries aircraft 12 months after the maiden flight .	-4.9063
Bombardier explained that it is reviewing the planning for commissioning ( EIS ) and will update it in the coming months .	-3.8891
“ The slow progress of the flight test – even if it appears to be in line with bombing internal planning – reinforces our view that commissioning is shifting to the first quarter of 2015 , ” says Doerksen .	-5.3671
In the third quarter at the end of September 30 , Bombardier ’ s net profit fell to $ 147 million , or 8 cents per share of $ 172 million , or 9 cents per share a year earlier .	-3.8267
The adjusted profit per share is unchanged at 9 cents .	-1.9339
Sales decreased slightly , down from $ 4.2 billion to $ 4.1 billion .	-2.3152
Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and a turnover of 4.56 billion dollars , according to Thomson Reuters I / B / E / S.	-2.7814
The world ’ s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer states that it delivered 45 aircraft this quarter , a decline of 57 last year .	-3.5472
Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26 .	-1.1886
The order book for the aerospace sector stood at $ 32.9 billion on September 30 , unchanged from December 31 .	-4.2726
“ In the aerospace sector , the results were in line with our targets , but the low order intake and overall market conditions were disappointing , ” said Beaudoin .	-4.3499
Revenues in the aerospace sector fell by 13 percent to $ 2 billion .	-2.6116
Bombardier , the world ’ s largest railway manufacturer , announced that sales in this sector rose by just under 11 % to $ 2.1 billion .	-3.4408
The order book for the transport segment was USD 32.6 billion on 30 September , slightly higher than 31 December .	-4.6782
The profit margin in the transport sector was affected by settlement problems in some major contracts .	-4.3395
According to the management , there will be new targets for the fourth quarter .	-3.5781
In the afternoon trading on Thursday , the Bombardier stock decreased by 8.5 percent and stood at 4.83 Canadian dollars after it was announced that Google ’ s Chief Financial Officer Patrick Pichette will change to the Board .	-7.7737
The Brazilian Embraer SA , the world ’ s third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and the bombing of the closest rival , reported a 10 % decline in quarterly profits on Thursday .	-4.2536

Coke dependent Lawyer , who warned drug bosses against police investigation , must be imprisoned .	-5.3115
Basharat Ditta , 42 , gave information to the underworld , Neil Scarborough .	-3.7428
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction could come to light .	-2.8393
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Crown Court .	-1.8484
A well-known criminal defender , who warned a drug barons of a large police investigation because he was afraid that his secret drug addiction could be revealed , was sentenced to three years in prison .	-5.3518
Basharat Ditta , 42 , provided Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about his drug trafficking activities after being compromised by his own cocaine addiction .	-3.8205
The criminalist lawyer , dubbed “ first-class , ” with the nickname “ Bash , ” was arrested in his house in 2011 after police surveillance Scarborough , who he had represented in a previous drug trial .	-7.2617
Officials watched Scarborough ( 32 ) deliver three bags of cocaine to the lawyer 's house in Blackburn , Lancashire , while he was with colleagues at a bar meal .	-5.3506
The investigation revealed that Ditta regularly used Class A drugs after tests found traces of cocaine in his hair , his wallet , and credit cards .	-4.1347
For a period of eight months between January and August 2011 , he tried to obtain illicit information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners .	-3.4081
All four suspects were then monitored by the police in a major investigation into the heroin and cocaine trade in Lancashire , Cumbria , Merseyside , Berkshire and West Yorkshire .	-3.3532
Together with 32 other people , they were later arrested after the police secured heroin and cocaine worth <unk> 1.5 million in a series of house searches , and <unk> 200,000 in cash . and were . were . were . were . were . are , ,	-10.0196
Ditta , 42 , gave information to the criminals because he feared that his drug addiction could be publicised .	-3.3464
Today , Ditta , who works for Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn , was found guilty and convicted at Liverpooler Crown Court after a three-week trial on two counts of obstruction to the judiciary .	-5.1689
In an earlier survey , he admitted cocaine ownership .	-3.4247
The lawyer was convicted after the police found out in their investigation of Scarborough that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011 .	-3.4222
Two investigators followed the suspect and saw how he went to Ditta ’ s house and put drugs under the bar ’ s dustbin with a purity of 60 % in a black golf glove .	-5.3024
Shortly after receiving the drugs , Scarborough regularly telephoned Ditta , who was at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park at dinner .	-5.3586
The lawyer returned home , picked up the drugs and then exchanged nine communications between the two .	-3.4987
In court , it became known that Ditta was a “ regular consumer ” of cocaine after tests of class A had been discovered in his hair , his wallet , and on his credit cards .	-4.7498
Ditta was later arrested , but refused to take cocaine and said that he had spoken to the alleged dealer because he was his client , claiming that her discussion was subject to “ legal secrecy . ”	-5.4948
During his arrest , Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards , but they were secured and taken a hair sample .	-4.4197
In police interrogation , he said that he would operate an office at his private address as well as at the workplace , and clients would call him home for legal matters .	-7.9104
In court , it became known that he had called on important drug trafficking actors , some of whom he had previously represented , after significant arrests and informed investigators of what they knew .	-6.8113
Attorney Anne Whyte said , “ A criminal law lawyer should know better than anyone else that the law is not broken . ”	-3.7150
Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal defender because he has engaged too much with certain clients .	-4.1880
The relationship in question is not simply that of a drug dealer , but of a drug dealer who supplies his lawyer with drugs .	-3.9585
Part of his communications was undoubtedly legitimate , because he was the lawyer for these people .	-4.0924
But that went far beyond the bounds of a normal relationship between lawyer and client .	-2.7188
He acted as far as possible to counter the police investigation so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities .	-5.4988
In doing so , Mr Ditta discredited his profession .	-3.2594
He was too close to certain clients , particularly Scarborough , and allowed his independence to be compromised .	-2.4109
Ditta dismissed any wrongdoing and claimed , “ If I were a corrupt lawyer , which I am not , and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough , I would not wait 15 hours , but do so immediately . ”	-4.4909
But , after the hearing , Superintendent Lee Halstead of the police in Lancashire said , “ Mr Ditta has taken the step from a criminal defender to a criminal at the moment he began acquiring drugs from organized criminals . ”	-4.9582
His cocaine addiction led to a hopeless compromise and made him susceptible to the motives of leading members of organized crime who asked him to obtain valuable information about police investigations .	-4.4748
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure public confidence and confidence .	-2.6124
Ditta betrayed this trust and tried to hide behind the fa<unk>ade of his profession .	-3.1897
The Serious and Organized Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigation of Ditta , which also led to a conviction in three cases on the ownership of cocaine and the obstruction of justice , which underlines our determination to bring criminals to justice .	-5.9067
This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that no one can escape the arm of the law .	-2.8928
We will find you and bring you to court .	-2.1376
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after having declared himself guilty of conspiracy involving heroin , cocaine and cannabis .	-5.9515
Thirty-five others involved in drug trafficking were sentenced to a total of 153 years for drug offences .	-4.1699
On his website , Ditta published an area of questions and answers about himself in which he indicated that his dream job was to represent clients on death row in America , his ultimate guest at dinner was Mohammed Ali and inequality of opportunity was the motivation for his work .	-5.1212
The Revolutionary Works of Church Music	-2.3112
At the end of the celebrations on the occasion of its 160-year existence , the Dunningen Liederkranz will frame two services of worship with the " Deutsche Messe " by Franz Schubert .	-5.8654
After the great success of the musical " Rock my Life " , which attracted the audience in the spring of this year , at the end of the anniversary year the Liederkranz will enrich two services of worship with the performance of the German fair by Franz Schubert .	-6.1182
On Saturday , October 26 , this extraordinary fair will be held from 19 during the evening fair in the St. Martinus Church Dunningen and on Sunday , October 27 , from 10.15 a.m. at the church in St. John Baptist Church in Lacendorf .	-7.3049
The so-called German Fair with the original title " Liege zur Festung des heiliges Herbstoffs der Messe " , D 872 , is a sacred music work by Franz Schubert from 1826 and was almost revolutionary at the time of its creation .	-8.1296
The exhibition will be performed within the framework of the services provided by Johann Philipp Neumann .	-4.7345
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider , the choir is accompanied by the brass group of the Musikverein Frohsinn Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi .	-3.6234
Haslach ’ s Skepticism is increasingly Confidential	-5.0932
For example , the 2015 parish election will change fundamental principles in the Haslach ( SE ) maritime welfare unit .	-6.0577
There is only one common parish for all six parishes .	-3.9229
At a joint meeting on Saturday , the bodies from Haslach , Hofstetten , Mühlenbach , Fischerbach , Steinach and Welschensteinach prepared for the changes .	-3.8599
Because the basic decisions of the diocese cannot be changed any more and it is up to the parishes to implement them as satisfactorily as possible .	-6.0034
Over the course of the day , it became particularly clear that skepticism about the new is slowly giving way to confidence .	-5.0187
From the ideas and expectations of the innovations in 2015 to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the parish council , the highly constructive discussions between the six bodies with the main members of the maritime service team have taken place .	-7.6531
Regional Dekan Georg Schmitt presented the new guidelines for maritime care in the Archdiocese of Freiburg .	-5.4738
After that , the SE Haslach as a parish will in future form a body of public law that will enter into the rights and duties of the six individual church communities .	-6.6553
There will only be a common parish council and an endowment council in which the pastor is represented .	-5.1311
At least two elected members are to be represented from each parish , and so-called local teams are to be formed in the six parishes .	-4.8551
Their task will in future be to promote church life in the place .	-4.2575
When asked about the finances of the individual parish , there was considerable need for dialogue .	-5.1484
The new rules provide that the accumulated funds will be retained in the parishes .	-8.3213
The liabilities , on the other hand , transfer to the entire community .	-3.8839
It was particularly with regard to the large planned investments , which all parishes were obliged to make , that there were concerns .	-6.3267
" In the past , too , only projects were invested that could be managed by the individual parishes alone " , relativized Haslach 's parish chairman Bruno Prinzbach .	-6.6827
Barbar Ritter , chairman of the committee in the county council of Schutterwald-Neuied , described practical experience with a joint body for five parishes .	-7.2300
They set themselves the task of " becoming one , remaining five " in 2006 and found that this is not so easy .	-6.0431
The councils of the Haslacher ministry of the sea were then prepared to answer questions about the future composition and size of the common parish council and the practical work of the community teams .	-6.8183
The work will be fleshed out in further meetings and decided at another joint meeting of all six bodies next spring .	-5.7124
In the end , parish priest Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the maritime care unit , which was approved by a clear majority .	-5.2598
Electricity in Pfullendorf Will Cost	-4.2063
The citizens of Pfulendorfs must anticipate higher electricity costs .	-4.2379
As the managing director of the Stadtwerke , Jörg-Arne Bias , confirmed to the S<unk>DKURIER , a four-person Pfullendorf family receives 70 to 90 euros extra per year .	-5.9791
Main reason for the upcoming price increase is the rise in the so-called EEG levy from 5,277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt-hour .	-9.0149
This levy is fixed every year in October by the four operators of the large electricity routes .	-5.0546
They quantify the additional costs arising from the energy transition , which they can charge through a levy above the electricity price .	-6.7602
The Pfullendorf Stadtwerke is the last link in this chain .	-2.5329
In its forecasts , the Supervisory Board of the energy company even assumed a higher levy , as Jörg-Arne Bias reported .	-3.5209
Now the concrete figures would have to be calculated before the Stadtwerke next week could inform their customers about the exact price increase .	-5.0401
" We are starting from an increase of 1 cent plus x , " Bias said , with the figure more close to 2 cent .	-5.3361
Stop the traffic lights and wait .	-6.3426
Sometimes a traffic light simply does not turn green .	-2.4839
The contact loop in the street does not react , or the sign of light is broken .	-3.0476
What should you do - drive at red ?	-4.6633
If a person has waited long enough at a red light and the crossing is free , he can continue , explained the Stuttgarter Rechtsanwalt Ralf Becker in the magazine " Motorrad " .	-5.2314
However , the waiting time must be ' reasonable ' , which can be interpreted differently from case to case .	-4.3825
Becker advises to wait at least five minutes before the traffic lights can be expected to be disrupted .	-6.4537
However , if you continue the journey despite the red light , you must be aware that it is entirely responsible for an accident caused by it .	-6.3630
Anyone who tolerates less than five minutes may not wait long enough , warns Becker and refers to a decision of the Supreme Court of Hamm .	-3.8093
In this case , a driver had ignored the traffic lights after about three minutes of continuous red light and had to answer for a negligent red light breach .	-5.2060
The traffic light was not broken , but turned to green a little later .	-5.0281
He was spared a driving ban because of the special situation - but not the fine .	-4.4817
municipal council is pleased with a solid budget	-9.0358
Whenever municipal council meetings are about the budget , mayor Ralph Gerster has a good laugh .	-5.0893
The town hall in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and the administration no longer knows about debt since 2005 .	-5.1831
In this sense , the 2012 financial year can also be counted as a complete success .	-3.9203
This became clear at the presentation of the 2012 annual accounts .	-3.8516
As Andrea Rothmund pointed out , the administrative budget , at around EUR 7.6 million , was more than EUR 1 million higher than planned .	-7.9065
The surplus of the administrative budget , at around EUR 1.8 million , is also around EUR 1 million above the approach .	-5.3438
The surplus is mainly due to higher commercial tax revenue and the community share of income tax .	-5.8357
The asset budget , too , was clearly above the planned values .	-4.6795
It was EUR 2.5 million last year instead of the EUR 1.5 million envisaged .	-3.6271
" This is essentially due to the higher contribution from the administrative budget , " says Rothmund .	-4.4018
Since less investment was made in the 2012 financial year than planned , the transfer of data has also been higher .	-5.1471
Overall , the overall reserve has been increased by around EUR 2.1 million to a total of EUR 4.9 million now .	-5.0025
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for their good work .	-2.0438
" Such a work is not just shaking out of its sleeve , " Gerster praised with regard to the annual accounts .	-5.5251
He and the local councils visibly enjoyed the good figures .	-3.4326
It may sound paradoxical , but it is precisely these good figures that could cost citizens dearly .	-4.6700
Due to its good financial position , the community has been able to avoid high leverage in the past .	-5.9890
According to Gerster , however , subsidies have often been cut by the country .	-4.9196
There are conditions for these subsidies from various compensatory stocks .	-4.0320
Amongst other things , the cities and communities applying for grants must have certain leverage .	-4.9854
" We need to look at the issue of leverage , as investment is needed in the coming years , for which we would like to receive subsidies , " Gerster announced in this context .	-6.3949
Nagold : Hugo Werten im Chor	-2.7254
At the age of 60 , Hubert Wermter ’ s story at the Cäcilia men ’ s singing club is almost twice as long as that of the Herb Festival , during which he was solemnly honored .	-6.9583
Hubert Wertplatten was on stage as usual in the colours of his men ’ s singers .	-4.7203
After 60 years , singing with the choir is still a great pleasure .	-6.1301
The association was also active as a member of the committee for 28 years .	-4.0350
He received several awards for his commitment and loyalty to the association : Jörg Kohr , Pastoralreferent on behalf of the Cäcilienverband Rottenburg-Stuttgart , presented him - since the choir is also a church choir - a certificate of the association and a letter of honour signed by Bishop Gebhard .	-4.8543
His singers handed him the certificate of the German Choral Association and a engraved tin plate .	-4.9022
In addition to the award , the 31st autumn festival took its usual course : With the MGV View , the Liederkranz Salzstetten , the singer ’ s department of Bainingen and the local Musikverein , the Vollmaringer had loaded a colourful mix of different choirs and vocal styles , which were held by around 400 visitors .	-9.3404
The MGV Vollmaringen opened with atmospheric songs like " Im Weinparadies " and " Lustig , her brothers " .	-3.7024
Her honorary singer Hubert Wertplatten prepared a small stand - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart 's " Bundeslied " .	-5.9672
The men 's singing association Beu also sang classical choral songs such as " Jägerwerten " by Julius Wengert , " Far , Far " by Hubert Goisern and the folk song " When you go through the valley " .	-5.4104
The Liederkranz Salzstetten , with its mixed choir and its women 's group - the " Impulschor " - ensured the attendance of the festival .	-6.9978
The mixed choir , with the Neapolitan folk style " Santa Lucia " and " Eviva Espana " , led by Antonio Gus to foreign countries , while the " Impuls Choir " also resorted to foreign languages : " Liberatio " and " Hey Jude " were part of their program .	-6.6237
The singers ' department of the Baininger Sportverein came back to the local community with " What is gay ? " by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Papperts " Bierlied " , where the Vollmaringer Musikverein offered the crowning musical conclusion .	-7.6009
For the children there was a small side program - " Grandma Hanne " alias Hannelore Stollstein performed a Kaspertheater and read a few stories about the children at noon .	-6.4418

Bauhaus provides the material with the support of Sparkasse Zollernalb .	-2.9898
It will be delivered to the kindergarten on the agreed day and will then be processed directly by the helpers .	-3.6232
Helpers can be parents , grandparents , friends , clubs and , of course , educators and children themselves .	-7.3402
Kenyan press outraged by controversial media law	-3.0708
‘ We are in a frightening situation , and one might ask : what is Parliament ’ s view of simply abolishing judicial independence tomorrow ? ’ was read in the newspaper , which considers the draft law not constitutional ?	-10.9305
“ The law is draconian and very criminal and we reject it , ” said Cyrus Kamau , Managing Director of Capital Group , which includes CapitalFM , one of Kenya ’ s most respected independent radio stations and news sites .	-4.1969
He said that the new media tribunal “ will always be biased , because it is an extended arm of government , ” and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya ’ s position in the global economy .	-2.8309
‘ I hope the President will listen to us and we appeal to him to reject this draft law and send it back to Parliament ’ , he said .	-3.4236
According to The Star , Kenya ’ s new law “ effectively strangles the media , ” whereas The Standard , Democracy , and Freedom of Speech in Kenya have “ suffered a severe blow , ” and dubbed the draft “ draconian . ”	-5.9503
The adoption of the law is part of a series of measures designed to strengthen national security following the attacks by armed Islamists on the West Gate shopping centre in September .	-4.2840
Kenya ’ s media caught the authorities ’ anger by publishing images of security cameras showing how the units sent to the scene supposedly stole the luxury shopping mall .	-7.0355
Police chief David Kimaiyo responded by ordering two journalists and a leading media representative , even if the charge was withdrawn after a media outcry .	-4.9606
According to the new law , media houses can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists with up to a million and the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation .	-8.1670
The Tribunal also has the right to confiscate the property of those affected if a penalty is not paid .	-3.9238
According to the Daily Nation , “ a single penalty can push most radio stations into bankruptcy . ”	-3.0400
Moreover , the newspaper believes that these measures could have a devastating impact on Kenya ’ s “ vibrant blogosphere . ”	-2.8456
If they silence the media , politicians could do whatever they want with impunity .	-2.7494
“ No one will ever know , ” wrote Mutuma Mathiu , a national journalist who calls Kenyan media a decisive factor in public life .	-4.4733
“ Leave politicians to themselves , bankrupt the country , and back to the time of hunters and collectors , ” he commented .	-5.2115
Kenyan legislators have been plagued by public anger in the past .	-3.5285
In May , they voted to reverse the cuts imposed by the National Compensation Commission , and put their defaulted salaries of about 5332.000 shillings into effect tax free per month – among the highest in the world .	-6.6364
Bad-Dürrheim : A Dream for the FC	-3.1106
In spite of the cold weather and rain , the official inauguration ceremony for the artificial grass pitch lost its importance to the city and the football club .	-6.0639
I think everyone wanted a more pleasant holiday last Saturday , but Peter didn 't want to play with .	-5.3142
So all those who came without an umbrella or could not hold one for any reason had that .	-7.1846
This was done by musicians who framed the festival , as well as by many speakers .	-5.9146
Nass also became FC-Chairman Albrecht Schlenker , who spoke of fulfilling a dream .	-4.6345
His thanks were mainly due to Mayor Walter Klumpp , who was very committed to the implementation of the project , the municipal council , the companies and association members involved .	-6.5916
Especially Lothar Held , Paul Weizenegger , Heiner Gail and Peter Graf .	-1.6049
The armed pensioners laid 400 square meters of paving stones for the new routes .	-4.6373
This remarkable voluntary commitment was also appreciated by the member of parliament , Karl Rombach .	-4.4939
Other words of greetings were given to Hubert Baier , the district chairman of the South Baden Football Association , Kuno Kayan , and Friedrich Knorr of the Planning Office , who announced a donation to the Club ’ s youth department .	-6.2536
Mayor Klumpp reminded us that recurring weather-related influences in spring and autumn set the original pitch so that it could not be played .	-5.7810
15 years ago , there was the first consideration of solving the problem when it was thought of building a third place at the site of the football club or at the real school on the Salinensee .	-7.4335
Both were rejected .	-2.0330
Six years ago , ideas emerged to create an artificial turf pitch , which was generally considered the ultimate solution .	-4.9704
Specific plans were launched two years ago , when the FC took over the Schabelstube in Erdpacht , pledged a cost contribution of EUR 100 000 for the construction of the place and approved funding of EUR 104 000 .	-6.6580
In October 2012 , the municipal council decided to take over the remaining 356 000 euros at the total cost of EUR 560 000 , summarized Klumpp .	-4.1086
The construction of the artificial grass pitch , 68 m x 108 m , began on June .	-6.1987
During the construction phase lasting more than three months , 3000 cubic meters of earth were carried away , half of which was used for the creation of a Dirt bike track .	-5.7070
The Union and the SPD have continued their coalition negotiations on internal affairs and justice .	-2.5786

Among other things , it is about direct democracy , Members ' union and the Federal Police .	-5.4285
The working group on migration and integration also wanted to continue its work this morning .	-3.5937
This should include the issue of dual citizenship , on which both sides have conflicting ideas .	-4.9294
The SPD wants to end the forced immigrant children born in Germany to choose one - the Union rejects a double passport .	-4.5858
On the subject of transport , which is not on the agenda this Friday , the SPD supported its rejection of a car toll requested by the CSU .	-4.8750
A Vignette was a " flag for frequent driving and thus environmentally counterproductive " , explained the SPD negotiator for transport , Florian Pronold , in a letter to his group .	-6.5741
It threatened to cross country roads , which are already accident areas .	-6.9765
Furthermore , the introduction of a toll for all cars would be a first step from the perspective of Pronolds .	-4.9785
" There is a risk that compensation for Germans will be deleted at a later date , " he said .	-3.3456
Dieter Thomas Kuhn in Stuttgart : The Singing Föhn Wave on the Open-Stage	-3.3670

Vienna Airport Cancels Passenger Calls	-3.1343
Mr. Max Maier , please come to Gate 24 .	-1.7147
In future , there will be no announcements of this kind at the Vienna Schwechat airport .	-6.0733
A large part of the speaker ’ s announcements are thus dropped - the noise level is to be reduced significantly .	-7.0821
The aim of this innovation is to create a more relaxed atmosphere .	-2.7775
As Airport-Sprecher Peter Kleemann announced to Radio Vienna , Vienna Airport follows an international trend by hiring announcements concerning individual persons .	-5.4724
For example , airports in Copenhagen , Frankfurt or Dubai , among others , refrain from noisy calls .	-4.3685
With the elimination of these announcements - on average , around 200 personal calls by the speakers on a day - it is planned to make things more quiet at the airport in the future .	-8.3201
" It has also been demonstrated in the experience that these individual announcements have been relatively little noticed , but at the same time all other information on changed flight rates or departure times is going down a bit here , " says Kleemann in conversation with the radio station .	-8.6022

Also 50 grams of apple or a tablespoon of ground linen plus three tablespoons of water are suitable .	-5.1397
They become more flexible instead of egg , for example , with a mixture of a teaspoon of baking powder , a tablespoon of food intensity and three tablespoons of mineral water .	-6.8169
However , 50 grams of soy yogurt or silk tofu can also serve this purpose .	-4.8319
According to the Vebu , some 800 000 people currently feed vegan in Germany , i.e. purely .	-4.6936
Sleeping in New York	-1.5267
On their way to their host families in Weymouth , Massachusetts , students from the Black Forest Gymnasium met the American city of New York .	-4.2965
After eight hours of flight , the Brooklyn Bridge was immediately off , reaching the heart of the city , Manhattan , on foot .	-4.9995
It has a fascinating view of the world-famous skyline , which is a special attraction in the evening light .	-5.9057

After a short flight from New York to Boston , students have now arrived in their host families and experience the daily school life at Weymouth High School .	-4.7231
This year another Hubertus Fair will be celebrated in the parish church of St. Marien on Hüsbergstra<unk>e .	-5.3405

The Jagdhorn Blausgroup of the Jagdreiter Westfalen under the direction of Brigitte Kluth is playing on Performers ( natural horns in the mood Es ) according to old , originally French melodies .	-7.8080

The new Opschlag shines with a new café .	-3.3893
One that invites you to stay and come back .	-3.6194
One that wants to make the name of the program .	-2.6365
According to Lexikon , Déjà Vu is a psychological phenomenon that expresses itself in the sense of having experienced or seen a new situation before .	-4.2307
In the case of a visit by the café of the same name at the Opschlag in the district town of Kleve within sight of the Rhein-Waal University , it does not have to remain the pure sense of déjà Vu .	-6.8832
After all , the café , with its beautiful name , has the aim of making a real stay not only memorable , but also memorable .	-7.8947
Because it 's fun and simply beautiful .	-2.9913
A look into the inner life of the Opschlag 8 gives the viewer a good feeling at first glance .	-5.5419
The ultra-modern but not cool café atmosphere looks like a place to feel good .	-3.9161
Here the team , with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the top , will spoil the guest with a variety of coffee and cocktail options .	-5.6070
There are delicious cakes or individually prepared fresh baguettes .	-4.3104
The owners , both 33 years old , made a name for themselves before the opening of the pretty café at the Opschlag as a restaurant : in Kranenburg they led the " Art Lounge " .	-5.8022
From the move to Kleve to the Opschlag , the friendly café lovers are looking forward to more audience . will . will .	-12.7122
Not least through the university .	-2.6071
" Where we do not have a specific target group , " Daniel Büttner stresses .	-3.6682
Instead , the two students here want to address young students in the same way as seniors and all ages in between .	-4.9087
Speaking of cafe lovers .	-1.7749
The likeable pair of owners stands behind the coffee pleasure .	-3.7904
Enjoy the fragrant hot brew in a variety of variations .	-3.6196
Expressofan	-0.9302
Daniel Büttner is the Expresso-fan and Mirjam van der Stelt the Cappuccino drinker .	-3.5273
" For this a baguette - that 's my thing " , she tells the NRZ .	-4.6866
Two events already took place in the bright café .	-3.6422
Better said , one thing .	-2.3299
The port festival took place rather outside - Café Déjà Vu did not benefit from it .	-4.0871
But there was also the Ringelnatzand .	-3.2852
" Nice , successful and funny " , the two 33-year-olds found .	-3.9461
But not Jedermann ’ s thing .	-3.3615
Perhaps that 's why Daniel Büttner is not an outspoken fan of event evenings : " You can 't make it all right " .	-6.0880
And with an event I only speak to those who are interested in the special event .	-4.0952
Therefore events will be the exception .	-6.0907
" We want to disrupt the normal operation as little as possible " .	-2.8555
Let us say : Déjà Vu also stands for reliability .	-2.5862
In terms of the quality of the products offered here , as well as the team and the beautiful surroundings at the Opschlag in Kleve .	-4.6282
The road , which is becoming more and more a gastronomic mile . , , , , and are . are . are , ,	-7.2463

UN Announces New Poverty Goals	-3.7172
The United Nations is starting to draw up a series of new objectives to replace the Millennium Development Goals , announced 12 years ago , to combat poverty .	-4.8753
In the run-up to the UN Sustainable Development Summit , which began in Rio de Janeiro this evening , Australian diplomats played a key role in pushing for “ Sustainable Development Goals ” to replace the Millennium Goals , which expire in 2015 .	-3.9092
They were included in the final draft of the document which will be adopted by world leaders , including Mrs Gillard , at the summit .	-2.8606
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at the summit the evening that the time had come to “ think beyond national interests . ”	-3.2261
“ I am pleased that member states have agreed to start a process to agree on universal , sustainable development goals , ” he said .	-3.7467
“ These goals will build on our progress in the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the post-2015 framework for development .	-3.3725
I will spare no effort to implement this mandate given to me by member states to realize our vision of the SDGs , which are built on the success of the Millennium Goals . ”	-4.4273
Although the SG Achim / Baden has been without victory for four days , the Handball Oberligist still enjoys a good mood .	-5.7407
Trainer Tomasz Malmon leaves no doubt about this .	-3.5747
All of them are still fully motivated .	-7.1690
Nevertheless , I hope that we will finally win again .	-3.0622
" Because I don 't know how such a victory tastes " , Malmon expects a successful experience from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II .	-4.9132
Even though the 3rd league reserve from Fredenbeck has not yet pulled out trees , Malmon raises the index finger in advance .	-6.6213
Many players I have trained myself in the A-Youth .	-5.6171
Therefore , they will certainly be particularly motivated against their former coach .	-3.6366
" In addition , it is important to wait and see if there will be some reinforcements from the first , " explains the SG coach .	-6.5375
In order to finally return to the track of success , the Malmon team must definitely increase compared to the previous performances .	-5.5351
Especially in the deckwork and the shift game , the last thing that happened was huge .	-8.1651
The use of opportunities must definitely improve .	-13.0726
So I hope my players have finally got their heads free during the short break .	-4.3123
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing in the face of clashes between influential personalities .	-3.3099
Thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputos , under the watchful eyes of the statue of Samora Machel , the founder of state and first president of Mozambique , to make peace calls in a rare public demonstration .	-4.6167
“ We want peace again , we want stability , ” said Vanessa de Sousa , Managing Director of an investment company .	-2.0860
For fear of the future of the country , she has exchanged her business clothes for a T-shirt with the inscription “ We demand security ” in Portuguese and joined the crowd on Thursday in the capital ’ s Independence Square .	-5.9784
For two weeks , there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo , among the worst fighting since the peace agreement over 20 years ago .	-4.4003
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement , initially supported by the White ruled Rhodesia and later by South Africa ’ s apartheid government in an effort to destabilize the country ’ s independent government .	-4.3598
After the 1992 peace treaty , it became an opposition party .	-2.1979
Analysts believe that the country is unlikely to fall back into a full-blown conflict , but recent events have worried foreign investors and locals .	-3.9937
Much is at stake for the rapidly growing economy , because the discovery of huge offshore gas deposits and coal storage in the northwest could generate more than $ 50 billion in investment from firms like Rio Tinto , Vale from Brazil , Eni from Italy , and Anaborko from the US over the next few years .	-6.5324
The ruling Frelimo party , since 1975 the dominant force , and Renamo blame each other for the tensions .	-2.5033
Renamo claims that the government provoked the recent clashes by attacking its members in the province of Sofala , a traditional stronghold of Renamos , on 17 October .	-3.2274
The attacks on the former rebels escalated when government forces attacked Renamo-Straat and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama , the group ’ s leader , Renamos spokesman to the Financial Times .	-4.9244
The government blamed Renamo for the clashes and accused the organization of attacking soldiers .	-2.7347
President Armando Guebuza has tried to play down concerns about instability .	-2.0709
To AFP , the French news agency , he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama regards himself as a “ loser ” who wants to “ use all his remaining forces to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government . ”	-5.0326
Both Frelimo and Renamo emphasize that they want to avoid war .	-2.2612
But the concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted as saying that Renamo gave up the 1992 peace agreement .	-3.4109
He said to the FT that he meant that Frelimo no longer respect the agreement .	-5.0064
“ Our vision is to resume negotiations seriously , ” said Mazanga .	-2.6166
Previous talks between the parties have done little to resolve the tensions fueled by a series of clashes this year .	-3.5250
“ We have two grown-up men ( Guebuza and Dhlakama ) who are meeting heads , ” says Joseph Hanlon , Open University lecturer , and Mozambique expert .	-5.5118
None of them are good at negotiating , and none is prepared to make the necessary concessions .	-7.4952
Renamo , who is pressing for electoral reform , has already said that she will boycott the local elections in November .	-3.2736
Presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for next year .	-1.7231
Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as an attempt by a ailing movement to obtain concessions and financial benefits from the government .	-3.6971
Renamos ’ s electoral success has been shrinking since 1992 , while a newer party , the Movement Democrático de Mo<unk>ambique ( MDM ) , founded by a former Renamo-member , is likely to improve in the elections .	-5.2787
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – whose resignation is due when his second term ends next year – wants to destroy the country ’ s democracy .	-3.1733
" He does not want multi-party democracy , he does not want transparent elections , he does not want peace because he does not want to give up the presidency , " said Mazanga .	-3.3484
It is not clear what Renamo has , but it has attacked police stations and vehicles on important north-south routes .	-5.3713
Most of the battles took place in the province of Sofala , which is located a few hundred kilometres north of Maputo , but in which Beira is located , the port , the mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale are used to export coal .	-8.8090
In June , Rio suspended its use of the railway for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the track .	-4.6272
Mazanga responded cautiously to the question of whether Renamo would repeat this threat .	-3.6037
Renamo wanted “ to warn the international community that things are not good in Mozambique , ” said Mazanga .	-2.4115
Instability has increased frustration with the government , says Fernando Lima , head of Mediacoop , an independent media company , because many people were already worried about corruption , slow development , and a recent wave of abduction .	-4.2873
“ People think that the government and the president are responsible for the country ’ s future , and he should be the one who finds solutions to the problems , ” he explains .	-3.6294
Omar Sultane , a demonstrator , said people just wanted stability .	-2.9041
" Renamo and Frelimo are not interested in anyone , they simply want peace and usable roads , " he said .	-4.7322
Children should be taught myths and legends as “ role models for life , ” says an author .	-3.9725
Thor ’ s stories showed that “ brutal force has no chance against clever tricks , ” and the Arthur legend demonstrates how important it is to have a dream .	-4.1321
But many of the myths are “ far too wild , too offensive , and , in some cases , too dirty to be taught in schools , ” which is why Crossley-Holland advocated a “ careful selection ” of age-appropriate works .	-4.6631
“ I find it wonderful that myths and folklore are already part of education in America , ” he said .	-2.6830
I have proposed this as a plan for twenty years .	-2.4646
He added that authors and teachers who are “ excessively didactic ” would “ shut down ” children completely , because entertaining stories would convey messages “ subliminal . ”	-4.9293
Crossley-Holland , who translated Beowulf from the Anglo-Saxon and is the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales , said : “ You can pursue certain intentions , but you should keep them in the background if possible . ”	-4.6245
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an author writing for children is the need to convey hope .	-3.0369
Not everything must be simplified or lead to happy ending , but there is an immanent sense of good and evil .	-5.7220
This must be understated , revealed by history and not explained .	-3.6098
This is the old story of showing rather than telling .	-2.1097
Hansjakob Trips Again to Freihof	-6.8549

Not only was he received with much applause from the audience , but his sister Philippine also welcomed him .	-4.4372
Billy Sum-Hermann thought it was incredibly good to get into the role of her sister , and gave her her the role of mimic and gesture of outrageous life .	-9.2415
Between the individual play scenes , the Mühlenbach farmers ' band played appropriately selected music pieces and rounded off the performance .	-5.9738
Haslach ’ s mayor , Heinz Winkler , was honoured to be awarded the honorary citizen , who , representing the then mayor of Hättich and a part of the town council , made his appearance .	-10.0857
Their anticipation then made the tri-king singer , who caused Hansjakob to exclaim : " Oh how beautiful , there again youth memories of my own three-king age are alive " .	-8.6743
With their song " O Jesus " they enjoyed the audience in the Freihof as well as the Storchentagskinder with their loud " Out , Out " .	-5.2561
His criticism of the Municipal Church was expressed at the time by Hansjakob as well as his concerns about the excesses in agriculture , the consequences of industrialisation or the effects of war .	-6.1409
In his home soil , behind his grave chapel on the fire near Hofstetten , he found his resting place .	-4.0270
" A restless spirit had finally found its peace and had come home forever " , it was said at the end of the scene game .	-5.2181
There was a lot of applause and many laudatory words from the audience for the performance .	-3.6179

" We did not deal with the Wildcard procedure until it was established that Düsseldorf did not receive a licence , " said Neckar Giant ossus Alexander Reil of our newspaper .	-6.2994
By May 23 , the rising Düsseldorf Basket will be able to submit documents to the arbitral court and prove its suitability for the economic Bundesliga .	-7.7331
So far , however , the Rheinland licence has been refused twice .	-4.4641
The Court of Arbitration is the last instance .	-2.2797

Schmeres Piepsen Disrupts Residents	-4.0621
Rhenus Midgard has also invested heavily in land .	-2.0803
They are distributing the coal coming from the ships over the .	-4.1657
The company has at its site several iron in the fire .	-3.4799
Besides the import of coal , Rhenus Midgard also relies on wind farm logistics .	-3.4154
Black shimmers the coal on the site in front of the dike .	-4.1349
Two massive blue halogen and return chargers either distribute or load coal as needed .	-7.2169
In every movement of the handling devices , a shrill warning sound sounds across the terrain .	-7.7768
" The signals serve safety and are prescribed by law , " says Matthias Schrell , Managing Director of Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven .	-4.0046
Unfortunately , this can be heard from a lot of people in the northern part of the city .	-7.4048

" No one can forbid us to believe that we can also win against the best team in Europe over the past two years , " said Bayern-Coach Sveteslav Pesic after the unfortunate 83 : 88 ( 39 : 47 ) on Thursday evening at the title defender Olympiakos Piraeus .	-6.3880
We sent the message : Basketball also exists in Munich !	-2.8724
At their third appearance in the European premier class , the Munich team sold themselves very well , but were simply not clear enough in the decisive stages .	-7.4184
The guests first managed to convert a 15-point lag 13 minutes before the end into a lead before Piraeus gave the game another turn .	-5.4777
" We fought back incredibly against the two times Euroleague champion , but then again made reckless mistakes , " said Bayer pro Yassin Idbihi .	-6.7969

Ben Greenman : Ten Years New York Comedy Festival : The New Yorkers	-1.3570
One might say that New York City is the birthplace of Stand-up Comedy in America : almost a hundred years ago , the Varietekünster Frank Fay , who worked as a collaborator at the Palace Theatre on Broadway , began to tell the crowd directly jokes in the form of a conversation .	-6.1382
Over the years , Fay ’ s innovation has been expanded , as was the latest at the New York Comedy Festival .	-4.6084
Founded and managed by Caroline Hirsch , the founder of the stand-up institution Caroline , this year the festival celebrates its 10th anniversary with over sixty shows in small clubs and big theaters .	-5.2043
“ Most of these headliners began with Caroline and then became ever more successful until they became too well known to perform in a club , ” Hirsch said .	-4.9567
We designed this festival so that we can continue working with them .	-5.3728
This year ’ s event features performances by Wanda Sykes , Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher as well as “ Stand Up for Heroes ” , an annual music and comedy benefit event for army veterans at Madison Square Garden , with Bruce Springsteen , Jon Stewart , Roger Waters and Bill Cosby among others .	-4.5953
With the festival the world of comedy has also grown .	-2.8097
A number of the Comedians who take part in the festival this year have become known through more unconventional ways , such as television shows on smaller channels such as Comedy Central , FX and Spike .	-6.9244
Nick Kroll became famous with a sitcom on cable TV ( the ironic schlüpfiy fantasy football series " The League " on FXX ) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central .	-5.9575
Jenny Slate was part of the cast at both Saturday Night Live and Park and Recreation , though she is best known for her viral video series , Marcel the Shell with Shoes On .	-4.1987
Both Kroll and Slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices ( the surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik , the ironic W. Kaumau Bell focused on racial themes ) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy .	-3.2700
One of the biggest visitors of the festival is an interview : David Steinberg talks to Larry David .	-3.5070
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian , but has become a respected television and film director and an unofficial comedy historian .	-3.9697
From 2005 to 2007 , he hosted a television show entitled " Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg " at TV Land .	-3.7945
The meeting will take place in the Town Hall in the heart of Manhattan .	-2.8533
“ The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry ’ s entire work , ” said Steinberg .	-5.6213
He told me when he is here , then he sometimes goes through the alley between two buildings and thinks : Hey , if I lose all my money , then perhaps I live here .	-4.0806

Two children admitted in Uruguay the murder of an 11-year-old .	-2.2815
The two 14 and 12 years old boys had invited their victims to go hunting birds with them .	-4.3166
Armed with machetes and knives , they made the 11 year old on Tuesday and threw the corpse into a fountain , reported the newspaper " El País " on Thursday .	-4.4043
Then they would have played soccer in front of their homes in a working-class neighborhood .	-2.8192
The body was found the following night in Cerro Pelado , 15 km north of the exclusive beach resort Punta del Este .	-7.1735
As an alibi , a five-year-old half-sister of the younger , who had taken her , was supposed to say that she had been sexually assaulted by the boy .	-6.1390
But when the girl described the crime before the police without mentioning an attack on her , the two boys admitted the deliberate killing of the 11-year-old .	-4.9604
The elderly , among other reasons , called a rivalry in the football game .	-4.5205
He was temporarily admitted to a psychiatric youth institution .	-2.9976
Ties to Prison	-4.6932
The District Court of Konstanz has sentenced a 33-year-old St. Georgen man to three and a half years in prison for exploitative human trafficking , piety , threat , insult and dangerous bodily injury .	-5.0575

In five cases , he met women through Internet or telephone contacts , which he sent to the bar after a few weeks against their will .	-6.5932
Resistance used to break with violence and threats .	-2.2328
He retained the income of women , some of whom were raised for him for years .	-5.0853
By confiscating mobile phones and SIM cards , he kept women ’ s contacts with the outside world .	-3.6404
Together with a colleague who taught the women , he brought them to different brothels in the southwest .	-4.0076
There , he had them partly monitored to control their revenue .	-5.4670
In court , the accused initially claimed that he was suffering a severe trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan died alongside him in an explosion .	-5.2384
After a psychiatric expert hinted at great doubts about mental restraint and thus about limited guilt , the 33-year-old issued a comprehensive confession .	-7.0867
The court no longer had to hear any of the injured women .	-3.0115
As one of the Kripo officials reported , at least four more cases of exploitative human trafficking were identified after a first ad by telephone surveillance measures .	-5.6191
The talks that have been heard have been marked by high aggression .	-5.4124
In subsequent hearings , the injured parties would have confirmed their martyrdom .	-3.6414
Another witness , in which one of the women discovered blue spots on the whole body , has not yet made a statement .	-5.6870

Oil Goes Beyond $ 96 per barrel	-4.2246
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday , as concerns about high supply overshadowed a report that China ’ s energy-hungry manufacturing sector is growing .	-3.4687
The reference crude oil for supplies in December fell late in Europe in electronic commerce on the New York Mercantile Exchange by 14 cents to USD 96.24 per barrel .	-4.8574
The contract fell by 39 cents on Thursday , which meant a 5.8 % fall in October .	-3.1948
The large crude oil supply has impacted prices in recent weeks .	-4.1118
The US Department of Energy said on Wednesday that US supply increased by 4.1 million barrels last week .	-3.0604
Over five weeks , the supply increased by 25 million barrels .	-2.6446
But , on Friday , there were indications of increased demand through two reports of increased activity in Chinese manufacturing .	-4.0450
This suggests a continued recovery in China ’ s economy , which had grown to 7.8 % in the third quarter , after reaching its lowest level in two decades in the previous quarter .	-4.4033
Brent crude oil , a reference value for international crude oil , also used by US refineries , fell at the ICE exchange in London by 26 cents to $ 108.58 per barrel .	-3.8910
Court Blocks Decision on the NYPD ’ s Stop-and-Frisk Directive	-2.9594
On Thursday , a federal court in the US blocked the order of a judge demanding changes to the stop and hairdresser program of the New York Police Department , and dismissed the judge .	-9.6056
The 2nd US Supreme Court declared that Judge Shira Scheindlin ’ s decisions would be suspended until a decision was made on the city ’ s appeal .	-5.3961
In August , the judge judged that the city was violating the Constitution with the way in which the programme for the detention and custody of persons was implemented .	-6.4321
The city appealed against its assessment and the ordered remedies , including the decision to set up a monitoring body to assist the police in amending their directive and the appropriate training program .	-6.1271
The appeal court heard the arguments on Tuesday about the request for suspension .	-3.1370
The appeal report stated that the judge should be relieved of the case , since it violated the code of conduct for US judges by stating that a judge should avoid the appearance of partisanship , partly based on a series of media interviews and public statements in which she publicly responded to the Court ’ s critique .	-6.7588
The judge judged that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people because they target inappropriately black and Latin American men with the stop-and-hairstyle program .	-4.3502
She appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of significant changes , including policy reforms , training , and service supervision , and ordered a pilot program of body-held cameras in quarters where most controls were carried out .	-6.0220
In August , the city of New York agreed to end the practice of storing names and addresses of people released after police control .	-3.8759
An oral hearing on the city ’ s vocation is scheduled after 14 March 2014 .	-3.0600
The stop-and-hairstyle tactics have been criticized by a number of civil rights defenders .	-3.5653
Such controls have been in various forms for decades , but the number of recorded controls during the term of office of the party-less mayor Michael Bloomberg rose to an all-time high of 684,330 in 2011 , most of them black and Latin American men .	-4.5755
In 2004 , four men belonging to all minorities filed a lawsuit which became a collective action .	-4.1750
Advocates of changes to the NYPD ’ s stop-and-hairstyle program say that the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trustworthy and effective police force , and influence the way other police officers use the scheme .	-5.6341
Opponents believe that the changes will dampen the morale of the police , but not crime ; money will also be wasted and the broader problem of a police force that is under pressure after thousands of jobs have been lost in the last decade .	-6.3798
The judge pointed out that she did not end the stop-and-hairstyle practice that was constitutional , but merely reformed the way in which checks were carried out by the NYPD .	-4.2908
The Happiness of the Dreaming	-2.9365
Happiness is an oasis that can only be reached by dreaming camels .	-4.8696
The first chairman , Wolfgang Henne , described the history and fascination of the association " Helping Hands " with this truism .	-4.8468
On Saturday afternoon the tenth birthday of the association was celebrated , which can already have considerable successes .	-4.9404
The first chairperson Henne reported in detail about the work of the association .	-2.7958
He himself was in Mauritania for the first time in 2004 at the Cheijk-Zajed hospital in Nouakchott .	-2.6707
As a result , a further cooperation developed , and the gynaecologist Henne performed numerous operations on the spot on several trips .	-6.6121
During the speeches , pictures of the interventions were shown on a large canvas , so that the guests of the anniversary event could get a picture of the actions mentioned .	-6.6242
The desert vehicle of the association was also shown .	-2.2903
It is a former Federal Border Protection Vehicle .	-3.0679
Rainer Prewo , former OB of Nagold , proposed to equip this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and , according to Henne , plans to work with the club in a consultative role .	-5.4188
In 2008 , Zimmerei Schleeh from Baiersbronn made a voluntary hospital in Socogim , a district of misery on the outskirts of the capital in record time of almost a week .	-7.1753
Henne also mentioned a new maternal child hospital in Nouakchott .	-1.6503
Especially interesting in times when the birth clinic is to be rationalized in Nagold .	-3.8174
There is a lot to be learned in Africa as a medical practitioner , according to Henne , for example , deceleration against burn-out .	-7.7852
As a result of the political unrest in the country , it was not possible to make as many journeys as planned , but many medical practitioners came to Germany to hospitate in various areas .	-6.4768
In addition , containers containing material are regularly sent to Africa , such as medical equipment , medicines , association materials , hospital beds and glasses in March of this year .	-9.8672
Co-initiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself supplied plenty of local colour by telling from Mauritania about Mercedes vehicles converted to the mobile goat stable and describing the experiences of the regular musicians who traditionally support the club during their journey to Mauritania .	-7.6750
As his personal motivation , he called his work on auditing as a young MEP .	-3.9220
When he realized how much money was lost on the way , he decided to help Africans control a budget by the people .	-3.3888
He also stressed that the global economy is also calling for global human love .	-5.4229
Nor should we forget that Africa is closer than some think .	-2.2239
From Gran Canaria it is not far to Africa .	-2.3333
Coulson used telephone hacking to check a tips	-4.1240
Former News of the Word editor Andy Coulson reportedly used “ telephone hacking , surveillance , and confrontation ” to try to confirm a false tip about an affair by then-interior minister Charles Clarke .	-5.0718
Public prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the court in the Old Bailey that News of the World heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with his “ attractive special adviser ” Hannah Pawlby .	-4.1188
The newspaper ordered the private investigator Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlby ’ s voicemails , and pursued them , but Coulson also called them and left messages , as the court learned .	-4.6573
“ According to the Public Prosecutor , Coulson , who is now the editor of the NotW , is no one standing in front of the apartment of people hoping to grab it for fresh action , but one who likes to face people with a story to see their reaction , ” Edis said .	-6.4429
He said that NotW uses three methods to investigate stories : telephone hacking , surveillance and confrontation .	-2.9701
The publisher is personally involved in the third method .	-1.3094
Obviously he knows of the second , the monitoring , otherwise it can not be .	-3.1308
What about the first ?	-1.0656
Does he know about telephone hacking ?	-2.5814
He denies this , but we say , “ And whether he knew it . ”	-3.5835
Rumours about a Clarke affair were first picked up by NotW ’ s feature editorial staff , when a source who was sexually interested in Pawlby was said : “ Don ’ t waste your time , it ’ s with Charles . ”	-4.8293
A band with voicemail from their phone of at least three occasions was secured in August 2006 in Mulcaires apartment .	-3.8591
The investigators also found entries on the computer of the detective where Pawlby and her sister were saved as “ projects ” .	-3.2297
At the time when the research was running , the grandparents of Pawlby received anonymous calls asking for information about them , Edis explained .	-4.8589
Meanwhile , former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup have overseen the monitoring of Pawlby ’ s movements .	-2.7191
On 18 June 2005 , Coulson left her a voicemail with the following content : “ I have a story we want to bring out tomorrow , which I would like to talk to Charles . ”	-3.8674
Edi explained that Coulson ’ s activities in this story followed the same pattern as other important personalities , such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett .	-4.9950
The jurors heard on Thursday that Coulson Blunkett faced an affair with a married woman when he himself was liaising with the co-defendants Rebekah Brooks , who had been married at the time .	-4.5161
Coulson and Brooks argue that they have conspired to hack phones between October 3 , 2000 and August 9 , 2006 .	-2.3513
Mulcaire , Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted the phone hacking .	-1.9720
In protest against the planned Reichensteuer , the French football will indeed go through the first strike since 1972 .	-3.7200
A conciliation meeting comes to an end without any result .	-3.5305
In the Reichensteuer conflict , the government and professional football in France have managed to reach a dead end after a failed conciliation meeting .	-8.9676
President Fran<unk>ois Hollande received club and association representatives in the Paris <unk>lysée Palace on Thursday and listened to their complaints .	-6.7884
But he refused to spare the football from the planned 75 % levy on income of more than EUR 1 million per year , which all firms in the country are to pay for two years from 2014 .	-5.6908
The other side was also tough .	-3.1938
The strike announced for the end of November will now also be carried out , announced by the head association of the professional clubs ( UCPF ) , Jean-Pierre Louvel .	-6.0959
The match days in Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 , scheduled between November 29th and December 2nd , are therefore out .	-5.8534
No absolute protection possible	-2.6104
" We want to involve the inhabitants in the planning at an early stage " , Mayor Jens Häusler opened the civic information event for the flood protection concept in Gechingen .	-5.3588
Around 80 participants had come to the municipal hall to explain the planned measures , ask questions , express concerns and introduce ideas .	-5.5583
Local leaders made it clear : " The final decisions are made by the members of the council " .	-5.4865
The floods that hit Gechingen on 15 May 2009 , unprepared , had been a serious event that raised the question of protection measures for the future , says Häusler .	-5.0523
A river basin survey was commissioned with the neighbouring municipality of Aidlingen , which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen .	-3.3591
" The protection of as many sites as possible is the goal " , says Häusler .	-4.2352
The planning of the protection against a flood , according to German weather service , is statistically expected every 100 years .	-5.4249
Climate change is taken into account by a 15 % supplement .	-2.5834
In technical circles this is called " HQ 100aKlima " .	-3.1501
The water masses , which caused considerable damage in Gechingen in 2009 , resulted in a flood of 1000 years .	-5.4084
" There is no absolute protection , but a relative improvement can be achieved " , says Häusler .	-3.1095
In order to achieve the protection HQ 100aKlima , approximately EUR 4 million will have to be invested in Gechingen , with the local government receiving approximately 70 percent of the country 's subsidies .	-7.5819
More often , however , pointed out that support only exists if an overall concept is implemented .	-4.7287
In this respect , the community must rely on the participation of its citizens .	-4.9623
An elaborate planning and approval process must be completed .	-2.9488
At best , implementation could begin in 2016 .	-2.7140
Among other things , the protection concept , which was already presented in the municipal council last week ( we reported ) , provides for local measures in the inflow of the river Irm from the Stammheimer Valley .	-5.6319
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept , participants took the opportunity to contribute their concerns .	-3.5415
Among other things , it was questioned why no more dams and reservoirs were planned to protect the site .	-5.2786
Gregor Kühn , technical planner of the commissioned engineering office Wald and Corbe from Hütsheim , who presented the concept , stressed that it required the interaction of all the measures presented in order to achieve the desired goal in total .	-7.5909
In addition , the most economical solution should be found , according to Joachim Wald von Wald and Corbe .	-4.4731
There was resentment among the inhabitants of the old town , who , even in normal thunderstorms , suffer from overcrowding of the canal network .	-9.7262
The problem is well known in the administration and the first measures have already been taken .	-3.3093
However , Häusler pointed out that the guidelines for channel systems are different from those for flood protection and should not be confused .	-6.0439
The municipality is obliged to design the canal network in such a way that two to three years of regeneration can be absorbed .	-6.6420
Larger sewers would devour millions .	-2.4162
Severe Shock	-5.0519
In the early Friday afternoon , two drivers were seriously injured in a frontal collision on the main road 44 near Revensdorf .	-5.1837
The police immediately blocked the road completely , but could not say much at first about the incident .	-5.7832
However , there are several testimonies that should be evaluated first .	-3.8276
It is certain that the 19-year-old driver of a VW Golf drove in the direction of Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf met her with his Hyundai .	-5.2147
Both vehicles collided , with the woman being so difficult to put in place that the fire brigade needed almost half an hour to get them out of the vehicle wreck .	-6.7569
The actual cause of the accident initially remained unresolved .	-3.6150
Both of them came to nearby hospitals .	-2.9522
The track remained closed for about two hours .	-2.8307

Blending the kinship in the outside : the piercing eyes , the beard , the high forehead .	-4.3691
And just as Fjodor M. Dostoevsky , with his massive oeuvre , is to be understood as the founder and apologist of the Russian soul , Philip K. Dick is read as an American prophet , who is true in his own country .	-6.0441
Some titles have been published by Heyne Verlag , the Haffmann cassette with its 118 stories is selling second editions .	-7.6355
Dick explains America - the realm of breathtaking technological progress , coupled with paranoia , security mania , and the belief that he is chosen .	-4.2093
Dick had experiences of God , his late books read like a mixture of the revelation of John and a computer manual .	-3.6984
Perhaps he was crazy , had drugs added to his brain .	-3.4870
He has captured , early already , that the calculators are divisions .	-5.6550
He wrote a theology of the computer and asked what distinguishes a man from a machine the creator of his being .	-5.0355

On instructions from the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection and Counter-Terrorism ( BVT ) , the German Internal Intelligence Service , he should photograph the roof of the US External Relations Office , located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank .	-5.2882
According to the German media , the BVT wanted to prove the presence of surveillance antennas and the action resulted in a change of words between the USA and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin .	-4.8122
James Clapper , America ’ s Director of National Intelligence , insisted again in September that the US did not use foreign espionage “ to steal foreign companies ’ operating secrets on behalf of US firms to enhance their international competitiveness or profits . ”	-5.1756
But , since Edward Snowden , the former whistleblower , began publishing his gaping horn of US surveillance secrets , European governments and business leaders have become unsure whether they can take the director ’ s word .	-6.8587
Reports that the US National Security Agency has been spying on Brazil ’ s oil company Petrobas and acquiring data from American cloud providers , including Google and Yahoo , have brought the company ’ s paranoia to a new peak for state surveillance .	-6.1593
The straw could have been the revelation that German Chancellor Angela Merkel ’ s phone had been orphaned for ten years .	-5.4577
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted , business leaders are certainly potential targets .	-3.7851
Snowden has made intensive cooperation between US intelligence services and companies transparent .	-2.5176
I believe it is conceivable that these data may be used for mutual benefit .	-3.0561
“ Germany must wake up , ” explains Oliver Grün , President of BITMi , who represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany .	-3.6284
German companies believe that the US is now almost as risky as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft , according to a survey published in July by the consultant EY .	-5.2207
In the documents leaked by Snowden , however , there has been no evidence that the US has passed the trade secrets of foreign companies to its own companies .	-4.6205
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU should lack certain IT and Internet opportunities and reduce its dependence on the US .	-3.6165

Yet the scope and technical sophistication of US spy agencies exposed by Snowden revelations have shocked firms that had previously seen China ’ s biggest espionage risk .	-5.0472
Cloud Computing is undergoing a major change , because European business leaders are now more aware that data stored in the US is subject to jurisdiction and therefore potentially endangered .	-5.3728

Parents of a Georgia-born teenager who died in tragic accident believe in murder	-6.6556
The parents of the teenager , whose corpse was found in a gathered wrestling debate in the gymnasium of his high school , are convinced that their son was murdered , explained the attorney of the family on Thursday .	-5.8974
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta in the US state of Georgia was found on 11 January in a upright mat standing behind the grandstand in the school tower hall .	-4.0817
The Sheriff of Lownde County investigators concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident , but that the 17-year-old family doubted .	-5.5059
“ They are convinced that their son was murdered , ” said Benjamin Crump , the lawyer of Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson , to FoxNews.com.	-3.4038
They would never have believed that he had died as the Sheriff concluded .	-4.1795
“ They believe that there is no logic to violate the laws of physics and common sense , ” concludes Crump .	-5.0596
Instead , they are convinced that the truth is covered up to protect the person or person responsible for the death of their son .	-3.4870
" Her son went to school to learn and came back in the bag of corpses , " he commented .	-4.5390
US prosecutor Michael Moore said on Thursday that there will be a formal investigation into Johnson ’ s death , because a number of important issues remain unresolved .	-4.2793
What was the cause of death ?	-0.7102
Is his death due to a crime ?	-1.6050
Moore explained this at a press conference on Thursday afternoon .	-1.8386
I follow the facts in whatever direction they lead .	-3.0853
My aim is to find out the truth .	-1.5659
“ I believe that there is a sufficient basis for a formal investigation , ” he said .	-2.7704
Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy suggests that Johnson had died of the consequences of a “ position-induced suffocation . ”	-4.5500
A second autopsy , however , caused another cause of death , Moore said .	-3.9146
“ There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed , ” he said .	-2.2135
Moore added that if there is sufficient evidence for a criminal or civil investigation to Johnson ’ s death , he will commission the FBI to carry out the investigation .	-3.9696

CDC Publish Allergic Directives for Schools	-3.4140
On Wednesday , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) published a series of guidelines for dealing with food allergies for children in schools .	-2.8903
These are the first such guidelines issued by the US government , as the number of children with food allergies in school is increasing .	-4.3501
One in 20 children in the United States now have food allergies .	-1.9254
According to the CDC , the spread of food allergies among children has increased by 18 % between 1997 and 2007 .	-2.7255
The guidelines contain information for schools to raise awareness of food allergies to teachers and staff and how to deal with children who have allergic reactions .	-5.1667
It is also recommended that schools have Epipunchrin in stock – the car injection of the Epipen brand is used most often – to counter a potentially deadly hypersensitivity response .	-5.6202
State legislators have recently changed the rules to make it easier for schools to keep epinephrine in stock .	-4.1175
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms mentioned by children with an allergic reaction .	-3.2152
Children may say , ‘ It feels like something is pushing my tongue ’ , ‘ My tongue feels like a hair lying on it ’ or ‘ My tongue is tickling ’ .	-5.8200
Parents of sexual children can choose “ Gender Unvote ”	-3.7197
Germany is the first European nation to recognise a third gender for children born with non-unique genitals .	-3.1679
Newborns are no longer starr male or female .	-4.4899
According to the new law , parents no longer have to declare sex for such children , but can specify “ indecent ” or “ not fixed ” on the birth certificate .	-4.7353
The aim of the law is to take the pressure from parents so that they do not have to take hasty decisions regarding operations for sexual allocation in newborns and to combat discrimination against intersexual people .	-6.1772
According to the BBC , an intersexual person said years later , “ I am neither a man nor a woman . ”	-2.9986
I remain the patchwork created by doctors mutilated and full of scars .	-2.4019
It is estimated that one in 2,000 children is born each year neither as a boy nor as a girl .	-3.8362
They belong to the Intersexual , a group that is diagnosed with “ sexual differentiation disorder ” ( DSD ) , a generic term for people with atypical chromosomes , germs ( ovaries or testicles ) , or unusually developed genitals .	-5.9638
Wallis Simpson was possibly intersexual .	-2.0975
Understanding gender identification is still not very well developed , but most experts in the US suggest using the best available information on gender allocation if a provision is not possible , rather than waiting for the child ’ s psychological and physical development before deciding , if any , for an operation .	-6.0082
The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher , who specializes in gender identification , said that the new German law “ clinging to a good cause . ”	-7.9150
Intersexual children pose an ethical dilemma .	-1.7208
“ Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgery , but most children do not , ” he said .	-3.6288
You can do a sexual assignment without surgery and then wait for the identity to develop .	-4.3963
The scientific data on how a child develops its gender identity at all is not very accurate .	-2.9486
Nobody knows why it is happening .	-1.7802
It is like the secret why people are homosexual .	-1.9563
A report to the European Commission in 2011 states that intersexual people are differentiated from transgender or transgender persons , because their status is not gender-related , but is determined by their biological constitution , which is neither exclusively male nor female , but is typically defined simultaneously or not clearly as one of them .	-6.4172
These characteristics were shown in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle mass , hair , breasts and stature , primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals , or chromosomal structures and hormones .	-5.3370
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination that intersexual and transgender people face in working life , as well as the extent of harassment , violence and prejudice crime .	-4.3438
Young people who do not match the gender picture now have a special camp .	-2.9978
It is now possible in Australia and Nepal for adults to indicate male , female or “ third sex ” on official documents .	-3.7235
In June , Australians accepted Norrie May-Welby ( 52 ) as the world ’ s first “ sexless ” person , after a court granted lifelong retention of “ unspecified ” sexual status .	-5.1597
In addition to M and W , German ID cards will have a third assignment , X for intersexual , according to the Ministry of the Interior .	-5.2304
In neighboring France , gender issues are still controversial , as reported on France 24 .	-4.8056
In 2011 , dozens of French MPs from the highly Catholic country signed a petition to remove “ gender theory ” from schoolbooks .	-2.9039
The US website , Catholic Online , has also spoken out against German law , on the grounds that , “ If the world is dragged into a new state , where gender is a choice , but sexual activity is not , then we are twisting two other pillars of civilization . ”	-6.2286
The mother of a newborn from Maryland explained to Baby Zone that it would be better if babies were given a gender at birth .	-3.8855
“ The parent ’ s existence is already stressful enough , even without further restrictions , especially when one does not know the sex of one ’ s own child , ” she said on the parent ’ s website .	-5.9548
Children need stability and security .	-0.6170
Historically , children born with both male and female gender were called hermaphrodites , according to the attractive Greek god who had both sexes .	-3.4597
Ten years ago , medicine regarded gender as something that can be extinguished and then rebuilt .	-3.9115
But the ethical foundations of an operation are now being questioned after it is known how complex the gender identity is , and that doctors can also be wrong because they do not know how the child feels when it grows up with the sex they allocate .	-6.4600
“ In the middle of the 20th century this was called a psychiatric emergency , ” Drescher said .	-3.5209
When such a child was born , it was not the psychiatrist , but the surgeon .	-3.1502
The ruling theory on the treatment of children with non-unique genitals is based on Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University , who argued that the sex was malleable .	-5.3909
He coined the term “ gender identity , ” arguing that social and environmental incentives – as parents educate a child – interacted with a child ’ s genes and hormones , shaping whether a person considers himself to be male or female .	-4.5597
But his theories became controversial in a case known as “ John / Joan . ”	-3.0343
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been cut off in a botched circumcision to caste the child completely and also remove his testicles and then raise him up as a girl .	-5.9920
“ Money presented this case as a successful example of a transformation , but it was not , ” Drescher said .	-4.0547
When the boy was about 15 , he moved back to the male sex and married a woman .	-2.7878
With 38 but he committed suicide .	-2.7588
According to Drescher , there are still doctors who would practice this model .	-2.6997
But , in the 1990 ’ s , with the advent of the Internet , survivors of these sex operations entered the public , who are “ not happy with the outcome . ”	-4.1812
For example , Jim Bruce , a 36-year-old Montana author born with XY male chromosomes , but with ambiguous genitals .	-4.2397
The doctors were not clear whether he had a big clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a “ satisfying life ” as a man .	-3.9812
So his external organ and testicles were removed in surgery shortly after birth in 1976 , and he was raised as a girl .	-6.1372
At the age of 12 he received female hormones .	-1.6763
“ I knew I am not a girl , ” he told ABCNews.com .	-2.6478
I was unhappy , but it was really difficult to ask questions .	-1.8346
At the age of 18 he should receive a vaginal plasty .	-3.5819
But , because he was depressed and knew that something was wrong , he demanded his medical files .	-3.3436
What he found out was shocking .	-0.9765
I was sterilized at my birth – and none ever told me .	-5.1583
Bruce was born with a DSD through which his body could not produce enough testosterone to develop the genitals .	-2.5974
After learning the truth , he moved back to the male identity , received testosterone injections and had his breasts removed .	-4.1418
It has become infertile as a result of the operation .	-3.9968
Today , he is fighting for others in an organization called Interface Project to see intersexual people as normal .	-5.0831
But Anne Tamar-Mattis , managing director of California ’ s Advocates for Informed Choice , is worried that German law can “ encourage stamping and stigmatizing . ”	-4.3245
“ Many activists worry that Germany ’ s decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and “ allocate ” to the child , she explained .	-5.0156
We fear that this will encourage intervention .	-2.7123
We think it would be better to allocate the male or female sex and then wait .	-3.1320
However , we do not yet know what the impact of the law will be , so we can only .	-3.2819
Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports the Australian law , because “ it allows adults to recognize as the third sex . ”	-3.8148
“ Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal sex , ” she explained .	-2.6318
The German law is about giving birth .	-3.0925
This is not a fight to which small children should be forced at this time .	-3.3687
When they grow up , they can decide their own bodies .	-3.4977
But Dr. Arlene Baratz , a breast radiologist from pittsburg , who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group , says the German law “ empowered ” both parents and children .	-4.5569
Katie , the daughter of Baratz , was born with male chromosomes , but has a DSD called complete androgenresistance .	-9.3769
Due to the defective receptor of the target cells for testosterone , Katie developed female characteristics .	-3.4590
She has a vagina , but no uterus and no ovaries .	-2.3535
Today , Katie is 29 and married ; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as a child psychiatrist .	-3.9979
Although it is infertile , it hopes to be able to get a child through adoption or surrogacy .	-4.0080
“ The law provides room for parents to make decisions quickly , ” Baratz said .	-4.4765
It gives them the time to make different tests and clarify things , giving them time before they write “ male ” or “ female . ”	-4.6256
In this way , everything is fine – you move the child big and you love it .	-5.7695
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy your parents ' happiness .	-3.5684
And you do not need to rush into an operation that cannot be undone .	-4.0731
“ This includes children in the decision and eliminates the fear that parents fear because they believe they are not doing the right thing , ” she explained .	-4.8863
In the end , the child decides on the sex that suits him better – and that is wonderful .	-4.6038
This will enable children to make the decision themselves .	-3.0019
Unknown Violent Girls by Shot from Auto	-3.0453
Unknown people injured a twelve-year-old in Saxony-Anhalt when shooting from a car .	-4.6752
The perpetrators had presumably fired a group of children on Thursday evening in Genthin with an air gun .	-4.9127
That informed the police into castle .	-3.3199
The girl was slightly injured on the left wade .	-2.6846
Bailiffs brought the girl to the hospital .	-2.9805
The shot came from a small car that had passed a group of six children and suddenly stopped .	-3.3969
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car .	-0.8570
The perpetrators also shot at a bus stop .	-2.0101
One disc broke .	-2.4716
Then they drove away .	-3.6240
The criminal police were investigated , it was said on Friday .	-4.0343
Until now the police inspectorate Kempten can look back on a quiet Halloween night .	-3.0634
The officials were called only twice to age children , who threw them against house facades .	-5.4696
As the owners recognized this in good time and removed the remains of the eggs immediately , no material damage should have arisen .	-6.8952
There are also some New Year ’ s Oil in the city , but no material damage has been caused here either .	-9.3739
A resident in the Bischof-Freundorfer way reported that his car was wrapped in a toilet paper and his bicycle blinders were stolen .	-8.3929
Until the police arrived , however , the man found his bicycle blinders in the immediate vicinity all again , so the police did not have to take any further action .	-7.2447
Living with a Future	-2.6296
Waltraud Ries actually lives dreamfully .	-3.5623
Your house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with lots of green , an old tree population , nice neighbours and not too much traffic .	-4.2216
The city is only a few minutes away by public transport .	-2.9167
" You are not afraid of spiders ? " asks Waltraud Ries and points to a fat spider on the door frame .	-4.4212
I have been looking for a new flat for my husband and myself for some time .	-8.0086
But you know how difficult this is in Stuttgart .	-2.0243
The reason , however , is not a spider phobia , but the concern to be unable to cope with the many stairs to the house and the apartment at age , she explains .	-7.2458
In addition , since a Meniskus operation , the mid-fifties woman has had to learn what it means to move from floor to floor with a handicap .	-10.2940
Recently , a book of her has appeared on the subject of ' Happy living in old age - Which type of living is the best for me ? ' .	-6.5456
'Our apartment is the best example of what is not possible in old age ' , she begins to tell .	-4.1537
When she moved with her husband to the duplex apartment more than 20 years ago , it was simply a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green .	-4.8722
Today , in the middle of fifty , Waltraud Ries thinks differently .	-2.4245
She also knows , however , that she is one of the few people who even deal with the subject of ' living in old age ' .	-5.0361
Most crowd it out as long as it goes .	-2.5717
Old are always only the others ' , she says grumbling .	-4.9940
Only when the pressure of suffering is really great are you concerned .	-5.0171
" But then it may be too late , " says Ries .	-5.4927
In her book , interior designers present 17 home models for a self-determined home of old age .	-5.7596
'Which type of housing you choose is always an individual decision ' , she explains .	-4.2766
D i e solution does not exist for age .	-2.3553
Even those who can afford retirement in Tuscany or Brittany should always consider getting sick .	-4.3063
And : ' Without a good knowledge of the national language , one can also unite in the Dolce Vita , ' the specialist book author gives permission to consider persons who wish to move abroad .	-9.2268
Their models include classic care models , alternative living forms or the often cited Rentner-WG .	-5.2749
At age , everyone has his or her ticks and macs .	-6.1611
" For me , such a community would be nothing , " she says with a wink .	-4.9584
Not at all like a student toilet with a shared bathroom and a kitchen .	-3.5827
'At age , you simply need your retreat rooms ' , says Ries .	-5.1368
However , the authors do not want to rule out the possibility that a senior home community can function .	-5.2093
But that must be different than in the classical student WG .	-5.3713
And sometimes you just want to rest , ' she believes .	-3.8850
It is not alone in this view , at least in the capital .	-4.5249
'Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own home as long as possible ' , is also the experience of Theresa Rütten , the head of the civil service life at the age of the provincial capital . is . is . is . is . is , , ,	-9.9924
Your service advises people around the topic ' becoming an elder ' .	-5.0254
That is why it is older people in particular who would often accept inconveniences and restrictions in order to stay in their usual environment , that is also the experience of the Stiftung Warentest .	-6.6145
Today , there are many ways to make the house or the apartment accessible .	-7.7977
Ries recommends to all those who are involved in renovating their house or apartment according to their age , to inform themselves thoroughly and not to hire the first best craftsman .	-8.8701
Today there are also specialists for renovation according to age .	-4.6570
Even in the rental apartment one or two things can be realized , and if it is only the increase in the toilet seats , the interior architects clarify .	-7.8271
However , it is not always possible to transform the existing apartment in a way that is adapted to the age and therefore accessible , even if it is still so beautiful .	-8.5139
Waltraud Ries had to make this experience .	-2.5995
The room was very small and the bed was very comfortable .	-8.6779
She will continue searching until she finds the ideal object for herself and her husband .	-8.3038
Before moving , she greets her more than before the spider on her home door .	-5.0890
The US wants to prosecute Snowden	-3.0978
The US has not changed its stance on former US intelligence contractor Edward Snowden .	-2.4390
He is also accused of having passed on confidential information .	-5.2377
As a result , he had to face criminal proceedings in the US , said Jennifer Psaki , Secretary of the US State Department , in Washington .	-5.0332
Snowden ’ s recent remarks would not change that either .	-3.9344
Previously , German Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele , after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow , appealed to the US not to continue threatening him with punishment .	-4.1644
Psaki stressed that Ströbele ’ s remarks are those of a parliamentarian , not of a German government member .	-4.3124
Edward Snowden , the intelligence officer , is generally ready to talk to German authorities .	-4.0563
First of all , however , he wants to clarify his situation .	-5.4242
This was made clear by former NSA employees , who were looking for the US , in a non-addressed letter published by Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwarded to the Federal Government , the Bundestag and the Advocate General .	-7.1930
According to a widely used translation , the letter reads as follows :	-4.5839
The Responsible	-2.1748
I have been asked to write to you about your inquiry into mass surveillance .	-3.0495
My name is Edward Joseph Snowden , and I was previously contracted or directly employed as a technical expert at the National Security Agency ( NSA ) , the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) , and the Defense Intelligence Agency ( DIA ) of the United States .	-4.1924
As I worked in these institutions , I witnessed systematic violations of the law of my government , which led me to act out of a moral duty .	-5.1833
As a result of the publication of these concerns , I saw myself exposed to a serious and persistent agitation that forced me to leave my family and my home .	-5.2067
I currently live in exile and enjoy temporary asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation under international law .	-2.1058
I am encouraged by the response to my political action , both in the US and elsewhere .	-2.4320
Citizens around the world , and also senior officials - including the United States - have judged the revelations of a system of all-encompassing surveillance that is accountable to no one as a service to the public .	-5.0588
These espionage revelations resulted in many proposals for new laws and policies aimed at the previously hidden abuse of public trust .	-4.6190
The benefits for society from these gains are becoming increasingly clear , while the risks that have been taken have been visibly reduced .	-5.7209
Although the result of my efforts has been demonstrably positive , my government continues to treat dissent as a breach of good faith and seeks to criminalise and prosecute political expression .	-4.6026
Yet saying the truth is not a crime .	-2.3391
I am confident that the United States Government , with the support of the international community , will abandon this damaging attitude .	-3.7849
I hope that , if the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved , I will be able to participate appropriately and legally in the responsible investigation of the facts relating to the statements made in the media , particularly with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports .	-5.8069
I look forward to a conversation with you in your country as soon as the situation is resolved and thank you for your efforts to uphold the international law that protects us all .	-4.0861

Kindergarten has found a private buyer	-6.7383
" The building is in good hands , " says Winterlingens Mayor Michael Maier .	-1.8253
The community sold the former kindergarten in the garden street to a private person .	-3.6358
The sale was agreed by the Municipal Council in its recent meeting in the non-public section .	-4.3232
The building changed its owner at a " reasonable " price .	-2.3346
" The community is satisfied , " Maier stresses .	-3.1371
The budget has been allocated EUR 100 000 .	-3.1162
It is not yet clear how the new owner wants to use the former kindergarten .	-2.7442
The mayor is right that Winterlingen has handed over responsibility for the building to someone else before the winter and thus no longer has to pay for the maintenance of the house , how to heat , look at the garden and clear the way .	-7.2836

The Musikverein Hammereinsbach gives a place concert on the terrace of the guest house Hammer .	-3.9177
As conductor Bianca Willmann lifts the clock at 7.30 p.m. , the thermometer still shows 25 degrees .	-2.9005
About 50 listeners enjoy the sounds of the Hammrich musicians .	-2.8659
The chairman Manuela Honeck explains the music .	-3.0193
In this context , Honeck thanked all those who had helped to successfully manage the first music store .	-6.0768
Report : Obama Campaign considered replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton	-2.5201
President Barack Obama ’ s closest advisers have secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton in the 2012 election campaign , according to the New York Times .	-2.6555
The revelation is the most notable surprise of the long-awaited work by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann about the 2012 election campaign , “ Double Down : Game Change 2012 . ”	-3.6902
The Times has a copy of the forthcoming book , and it reported on Thursday evening that the president ’ s top advisers had conducted “ extensive group meetings and polls at the end of 2011 , ” to find out whether Obama ’ s waning hope of re-election would be better off if he dropped Biden .	-9.2385
According to Jonathan Martin , the Times ’ National Policy Correspondent , the book thoroughly traces the history of the efforts of leading campaign and White House officials , notably the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley , to measure the effect of replacing former Secretary of State Clinton with the Vice President on the poll values .	-6.9893
The potential shift was a strictly guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office .	-2.9341
Only half a dozen of the president ’ s closest advisers – including Daley , Obama ’ s former campaign leader , Jim Messina , and the former senior White House adviser , David Axelrod , and David Plouffe – knew about the planned shift .	-3.6610
“ Double Down ” claims that Daley led the effort to exchange Biden despite her “ close , personal relationship , ” before finally deciding against such a move , after the data showed that Clinton ’ s candidacy “ would not significantly improve Obama ’ s chances . ”	-5.6140
In an interview with Martin , Daley confirmed that the government actually considered replacing Biden with Clinton .	-2.2496
“ I said a lot of things to consider , and that was one of them , ” Daley told the magazine .	-3.4548
It must be remembered that the president had terrible poll values at the time , so we thought , “ For God ’ s sake , what are we doing ? ”	-4.8659
While Daley described the investigation as “ due diligence , ” Martin told CNN ’ s Anderson Cooper that considerable effort had been made during the re-election campaign to determine whether such a move would pay off in terms of the ballot box .	-5.0913
“ Campaigns do not spend as much money on surveys and focus groups if you don ’ t think seriously about something , ” Martin said on AC360 .	-4.3945
But it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team thought about an exchange .	-4.2105
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his then boss knew about the potential change .	-3.0462
While Daley stated that he did not believe that the president was “ aware ” of the possible change , the former chief of staff admitted that it was “ possible ” for Obama to know about it .	-4.1394
Martin added that “ double down ” does not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether the political soundings of Obama ’ s desk have reached .	-3.3146
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought that Obama did not know about the investigation into whether Biden should be dropped in the elections .	-4.6100
“ Possible , ” Martin replied .	-3.0855
What happens on the go with my email ?	-2.8426
After all , e-mail is actually an electronic letter .	-6.7100
In the design of the Internet service , has e-mail been technically implemented as in the case of traditional mail ?	-7.1915
In the conception of the early Internet services the emphasis was on making communication possible .	-3.8465
For this reason , the basic technical protocols have not been designed to provide a stable basis for listening to correspondence .	-6.7768
Therefore , a conventional email is more like an open postcard than a sealed letter .	-3.8311
If the user " Anna " sends an email to " Benni " , are the computers connected ?	-4.6128
In the first step , the e-mail program or the browser of Anna sends the mail to the mail server of her service provider . is . is . is . is . are . are .	-8.3260
For example , if it has a GMail account , it would be Google .	-2.3803
This mail server sends the content to the provider Benni uses .	-2.2911
On the route the mail can run over several other servers on the Internet .	-4.6214
Bennie can then call the content from his provider .	-2.9294
Are traditional e-mails being read through the internet ?	-4.8284
Most mails are read several times by software robots on the go . is . are . are , , , , , , , , , , ,	-6.3793
The sender 's provider usually checks whether the mail contains a malicious program as an attachment .	-4.6242
A virus check is also carried out on the receiver systems .	-2.6147
In addition , providers check if it is an annoying and unwanted spam mail that is deleted immediately or at least sorted away in a spam folder .	-6.1258
Do the robots have another task ?	-2.2316
For systems like GMail , the robot also determines the information Google needs to place context advertising .	-3.1094
If Anna and Benni communicate via GMail about their upcoming holiday trip , Google can provide appropriate links to holiday offers .	-4.9072
Do unknown people also read the emails ?	-4.1604
The probability that unauthorized people will read a mail is very low .	-4.9783
In theory , however , this is possible .	-2.1513
In companies , administrators often have the ability to read electronic mail .	-3.3874
Law enforcement agencies and secret services also have legal opportunities to intercept or take note of e-mails .	-4.3624
Then there are possible illegal lockouts .	-4.0878
Is it possible to protect emails from reading ?	-2.8215
An email can be effectively encrypted against read .	-4.8051
With great technical effort , it is also possible to obscure the metadata of email communication , so that it is not possible to easily identify who has communicated with whom .	-6.8755
How important are Yahoo and Google on the email market in Germany ?	-2.0650
According to a study by Convios Consulting from August 2013 , Yahoo and Google play only a minor role in the mainly private mailboxes .	-5.7551
While the shares of Yahoo Mail had last fallen , Gmail could increase significantly .	-4.1463
Mother locked up in the forest and retiring	-5.7041
When his praying mother died , a man from Wolfsburg forged a plan .	-3.3252
He committed the deaths in a forest and continued to receive their pensions and care money .	-5.8443
A 67-year-old Wolfsburg buried his dead mother in the forest after police investigations .	-7.4685
First of all , he covered up the death of the 89-year-old , and then he saved the money for more than a year and a half .	-4.5872
Now , as one speaker said on Friday , the 67-year-old has to answer for fraud .	-3.6297
So the man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt .	-2.3617
The man was suspected as early as May : at the time , it appeared that no medication was needed for the nursing mother .	-5.3711
The pensioner told the investigators that his mother had travelled to Spain .	-2.7453
Because the officials were curiously aware of this , they continued .	-4.6420
It came out that the two had lived in a common apartment for more than 15 years and he had last cared for them .	-5.7945
The 67-year-old finally admitted the death of his mother .	-2.3261
According to the police , an obscenity showed no evidence of a capital crime .	-4.8199
Do you want ice cream shining in the dark ?	-3.2552
A British entrepreneur has developed the first ice shining in the dark , using jellyfish .	-5.9493
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescence properties of marine animals and created a luminous leak .	-4.7015
The idea came to him after reading a research on jellyfish and convincing Chinese scientists to artificially produce the luminous protein .	-4.5950
The ice cream reacts when consumed with the tongue , raising the pH in the protein and triggering the glow .	-4.4997
Chris explains that the ice cream responds to the heat in the mouth and shines – so the more you lick , the brighter it becomes .	-4.9132
Charlie , the founder of the ice cream company “ Lick Me I 'm Delicious ” , says , “ The product is incredible , but still in a very early stage of production , and you get two grams of it for 200 pounds . ”	-7.2810
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH value .	-2.2871
When the mouth warms the protein , the pH-value increases and the ice is lit .	-7.6023
We have tested it in recent months and it seemed to us ideal to put it on the market at Halloween because it has this wonderful light effect .	-4.7028
It is probably the most expensive ice cream I have ever produced , because the smoke light is four times more expensive than gold .	-3.3961
Each ball costs me about 140 pounds .	-2.8216
But it tastes delicious .	-1.8351
Charlies experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual flavors , including beer , cheese , beef and leaf gold .	-2.9101
But his latest creation is to become even more ambitious .	-2.7514
He says , “ I would like to develop an invisible ice cream . ”	-2.2551
This is , in itself , impossible because of the refraction caused by the ice crystals that make up ice cream ; but I suspect that we find a way of doing it .	-5.8679
The ice cream uses the fluorescence properties of a jellyfish artificially produced by Chinese scientists .	-3.2213
After six days of playing , TSV Morsum still has no point in the Handball Association League .	-4.5662
Now , for the team of Ingo Ehlers tomorrow , the Derby against the TSV Daverden , who celebrated his first victory last weekend .	-6.2317
With this game the season starts again for us .	-2.5211
" I hope that we finally have our heads free , " Ehlers is cautiously optimistic .	-4.9035
At last , with the exception of the permanently injured Hendrik Blohme , he has his entire cadre available .	-5.8061
Also Daverden counts as we do on speed game .	-4.7827
We must therefore keep our error rate low .	-2.1924
In the first place , however , we need to increase our coverage , which has left anything but a certain impression .	-6.4575
Daverden ’ s coach Thomas Panitz is more relaxed after the first season win against Nordhorn .	-4.6410
The game was of course a house number .	-1.7381
But that ’ s why we ’ re not the favorite , because everything can happen at the Derby .	-5.5855
Nevertheless , Panitz now wants to add in Morsum to start a series .	-4.6137
Missing is Jan-Malte Jodat .	-2.9471
The A-Jugend Joost Windssu<unk> , who is active with double play right at the A-Jugend-Bundigolistist HC Bremen , celebrates his season debut .	-6.8707
Those who are not hot in such a game should stay at home .	-3.3608
Halloween 2013 : Figures	-1.6065
When I was small , Halloween had something magic .	-4.4564
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets , stay late and dress up for the neighborhood .	-2.3015
Today I have become more of a Halloween muffle .	-5.2218
Over the last two years , I have not agreed to distribute sweets from my home , and I do not think I will do so this year either .	-4.9465
But , according to statistics , I am a black sheep when it comes to Halloween .	-2.3821
The majority of Americans – 158 million , to be precise – celebrate Halloween this year , spending a total of $ 6.9 billion on sweets , costumes , and decorations , according to the US Confederation of Retailers ( NRF ) .	-3.7572
One thing I look forward to every Halloween is the trend .	-3.4300
The costumes will represent about 1.2 billion of the $ 6.9 billion spent , according to the NRF .	-3.4775
This year , exciting , uninhabited objects are the last cry .	-4.4890
Women no longer need to dress in sexy clothes , they can now also embody seductive food such as pizza , hamburgers or carrots .	-4.3695
As for men , I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead , and I bet the Daft Punk space men will make it into the Instagram feeds this year .	-4.4157
According to Google , the most popular costumes are Zombies , Batman , pirates and witches .	-2.5661
I suspect there is nothing wrong with tradition .	-6.1900
We dressed our dogs last year and were not alone to my astonishment .	-3.1090
Indeed , Americans spend $ 330 million this year on costumes for their pets , according to the NRF .	-2.1204
These are a lot of hot dogs .	-2.1064
As far as sweets are concerned , we are not squeami.	-3.3376
Americans will spend $ 1.9 billion this year , The Nielsen Company said .	-2.5076
These are about 270 million kilograms of chocolate seals , lugs , candies and rubber bears .	-4.6352
So good news for the US Department of Commerce for 41 million people who move around with the slogan “ Sweet or Saures . ”	-5.3856
Indeed , we will buy more than 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and – let us not fool ourselves – eat .	-3.4430
The only thing we do not want to consume is the sugar-sweet Candy Corn ; yet 15 million kilograms of it are sold around Halloween , according to the National Association of confectionery manufacturers .	-4.4623
That is about nine billion corn grains .	-2.2861
It is a mystery that I have not yet been able to solve .	-2.8673
Nothing belongs more to Halloween than houses where it spits .	-3.7850
They have great names like “ Terror Behind the Walls ” ( which , incidentally , is in a real prison ) , “ Howl-O-Scream ” and “ The House of Shock ” .	-3.4463
There are , in fact , 1,200 officially recognized Spukhäuser in the United States , earning $ 500 million , America Haunts said , and that includes the wonderful photos you are pinning into the pants and then putting your friends on Facebook , where they are not getting rid of , and then leaving a comment like “ nice facial expression . ”	-9.1451
But finally we come to the pumpkins .	-2.6307
Charlie Brown made us familiar with the Great pumpkin when we were children , and carving a pumpkin lamp is like the pruning of the Christmas tree – something we made from small to small .	-5.4303
Fortunately , the “ baby in pumpkin ” trend began only last year thanks to Pinterest , so most of us grew up carving the pumpkin and not sitting in it .	-5.3243
This year , Americans will spend about $ 106 million on pumpkins , according to the US Census Bureau .	-1.6522
The pumpkin laterns , which slowly rotates into the garden , are probably from Illinois , where 245 million kilograms of pumpkins were harvested this year .	-5.5211
If you want to score points , call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa , California and carve something pretty out of their 921 kilo pumpkin .	-4.1432
Assassination in Helmberg ’ s Gun	-10.7495
The fire brigade had to leave in Helmstedt on late Thursday evening .	-5.1789
A three-family house in the district of Hof catches fire at night .	-4.8718
The rescue forces are carrying a stolen corpse from the house .	-4.9669
Bailiffs found a burnt corpse in a three-family house at a fire in Helmbrechts .	-6.3002
As a police spokesman said in Bayreuth , it is still unclear whether it is a resident .	-4.7816
On late Thursday evening it had been burnt on the ground floor of the house .	-3.9722
When the fire brigade arrived , the flames were already out of a window .	-4.2790
The forces went to the apartment and found the corpse in a room .	-3.2268
This and another room completely burned out .	-3.0917
The entire ground floor was damaged .	-1.9842
All other residents were not at home during the fire , the police officer continued .	-3.9287
The building was not habitable for the time being .	-3.6151
The exact cause of the fire was not clear at first .	-2.0390
Germany ’ s largest church has an offensive position to promote the profession of a pastor .	-4.6819
The background is a possible parish angel : the Evangelic-Lutheran Church of Hannover expects that the number of its currently around 1,800 pastors and pastors will be halved by 2030 .	-6.8308
Pastor Mathis Burfien ( 43 ) said in conversation with the Evangelical Press Service .	-4.6306
It is attractive to be able to determine the working and daily workflow itself .	-4.6203
For the first time , the Landeskirche commissioned a pastor in a full place to inspire young people to study theology .	-5.6399
Currently , fewer and fewer young people choose to study theology after graduation .	-3.3509
Burfien leads this back to the process of secularization : " God 's voice is quiet , the world is loud " .	-4.2217
The profession is characterised by great freedom and diversity .	-2.6881
I am the master of my calendar and can focus on where I think it is important .	-5.4074
Pastors may be close to people as a sea saver .	-4.8210
They earned as much as teachers and could live well .	-3.2362
To be sure , more is paid in the free economy , but theologians would have a safe employer for that .	-3.8183
This is to meet today ’ s young people , who are not only concerned with careers , but also with meaningful work .	-6.6818
According to the Landeskirche , which comprises three quarters of Lower Saxony , about 60 pastors are currently retiring each year .	-4.4315
At the same time , about 40 graduates of a university of theology start their degree at the same time .	-5.9230
In sparsely populated peripheral areas such as the Harz , the Emsland and the Wendland , it could be difficult to fill jobs in the future .	-4.6447
Burfien wants to organize study days for young people and also to invite celebrities who have studied theology .	-5.4293
Theological studies offer broad training .	-3.3815
It can even become the Federal President .	-4.4828
Land Rover Rally Series Announced	-0.7411
In the interior there are race seats and six-point belts as well as a hands-free system .	-3.6895
The options range from reinforced brakes , a service package with support for Bowler workshop mechanics and logistical support to vehicle storage between events .	-5.6428
Drew Bowler , Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport , explains : “ The rally customers who come to Bowler have changed . ”	-2.8297
They are not all experienced racers , but people who are looking for excitement and adventure as well as an achievable way to world-class events .	-4.5144
We are happy to open this way in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format opens up new opportunities to experience the various rally disciplines in the UK and abroad and to prepare newcomers for the stresses and realities of Rally Raid .	-5.7316
We really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge car – this will be an entertaining championship .	-3.9965
There is also a training and test day at the Defender Challenge in February as well as an option to participate in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East .	-7.2595
A fire brigade called to rescue a bitch who was stuck 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rock outcrop in a quarry .	-6.4916
Rudy Cockerspaniel had escaped after a minor road accident .	-5.5527
Three days later she was discovered by a stroller in the quarry in her predicament .	-3.5651
Fire fighters roiled themselves on a cliff and saved the dog from safe death .	-5.9343
The fire brigade managed to secure a dog which was stuck on a 15 meter high lead in a rock face .	-6.1948
The nine-month-old Cockerspaniel-bitch Ruby ran away after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before she was rescued from a quarry on Wednesday .	-5.4884
Scott Alderson , 25 , and his girlfriend Becky Hall , 20 of whom the dog belongs , came to the quarry Flappit in Denholm , West Yorkshire to welcome Ruby back and thank the firefighters of West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service .	-3.8215
They had desperately searched for their missing bitch and published calls for help in social networks when they escaped into the quarry after the small traffic accident .	-5.7799
About 2 : 15 pm on Wednesday , a walkers who executed his dog saw the stranded Ruby on the 15 meter high quarry .	-6.4447
The technical rescue team at the Cleckheaton Fire Station ran out and slid off to rescue Ruby , which was then transported up in a dog box .	-5.7009
Andy Clayton , specialist in the technical rescue team , said : “ She was in a dangerous situation .	-2.7040
It was located in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and the bottom .	-3.9598
She did not move a muscle during her rescue – she was like frozen .	-4.4179
But now she is doing well .	-1.9946
She then eaten some dog cakes .	-3.2272
This was a rather unusual use .	-2.9454
The fact that the dog has been discovered is incredible .	-2.3086
Peter Lau , a specialist in the technical rescue team , said , “ Ruby had a huge luck . ”	-4.0312
There was a possibility that she was very seriously injured or worse .	-3.2487
Ruby was taken to the veterinarian but did not notice anything except fatigue and dehydration .	-5.4743
Becky Hall of Halifax , West Yorkshire , said : “ To watch the rescue was scary . ”	-3.4598
I couldn 't believe she was really up there .	-3.1237
It was wonderful to keep them in the poor again .	-2.0491
The veterinarian explained that if the exhaustion had become too big and it had collapsed , it would probably have crashed .	-4.3532
Firemen have done a great job .	-2.7931
What they did was really courageous .	-2.3010
We are simply so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible .	-2.5230
Scott Alderson from Keighley added : “ We were afraid that it would fall down , but it remained above . ”	-3.7222
The firefighters were great .	-1.6469
I can hardly believe where it was .	-1.5071
Mick Jagger explains that he never remembered Katy Perry when she was 18 .	-2.6387
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week , the pop star said that she worked as a background singer on Jagger ’ s song “ Old Habits Die Hard ” from 2004 .	-4.4262
Perry explained that she had dinner with the old rocker , and that “ he went up with me when I was 18 ” .	-5.7839
She added , “ This has been long ago and he was very nice to me . ”	-3.7030
In a statement , a representative of Jagger , 70 , said on Thursday that he “ categorically denied that he had ever attempted to approach Katy Perry . ”	-3.5997
The representative added : “ Perhaps she confused him with someone else . ”	-2.8254
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest appearance at the Rolling Stones tour this year .	-3.3184
Her new album “ Prism ” landed first place this week .	-3.8696
George Kerevan : European unbundling gives the Scots the choice .	-3.2613
A new day , a new story of terror about independence .	-1.9566
This time , we are being warned that an independent Scotland is necessary to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership .	-7.2282
This is the key word for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a border secured by barbed wire along the Hadrian Wall .	-4.0533
Indeed , the Stratclyde proposal highlighted the potential economic benefits that would bring more freedom of travel in the rest of Europe , but , as expected , it did not matter in the headlines .	-5.7088
Nor has anyone mentioned that EU member states often bend their strict rules when it is more advantageous for them .	-4.2334
Since Scotland is not currently part of the Schengen area , continuing to ignore Brussels would be a small concession in exchange for what you really want from the Scots .	-4.9900
So no story .	-2.9434
And one that has come so far in the years that it already resembles a fossil : the first time I heard the “ independence means passport controls ” -duck at least 40 years ago .	-4.1915
An interesting point is lost in the constant repetition of this ancient history .	-3.8320
Why expect an independent Scotland to dance according to the European pipe ?	-3.1592
Why exchange the London yoke for that of Brussels , especially now ?	-2.4647
These are the real European news : the great post-war plan for uniting Europe has stalled .	-3.8602
With the euro crisis , the European project has officially died .	-1.9029
Across the EU , parties that are hostile to the EU or want to throw the euro out as a common currency are gaining ground .	-3.5389
Even in Germany , the Euroskeptic Alternative for Germany – founded only this year – could win nearly five million votes in the September federal election , effectively driving out the Free Democrats ( the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats ) from the Bundestag .	-5.6884
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe .	-2.0251
The current economic crisis , however , turns out to be a turning point .	-2.0196
Because of the strict austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank , combined with the straitjacket into which the national economy is coerced by sticking to the single currency , many people believe that the European project has gone too far .	-5.5695
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments causing excessive budget deficits – only in Greece .	-3.2320
Instead , the Eurosystem has pegged its members to exchange rates , which are beneficial to German exporters – and German politicians would like to leave that way .	-4.9869
Without the possibility of devaluation of the local currency , southern Europe finds itself with a built-in productivity disadvantage vis-à-vis Germany .	-3.8939
The only way is to cut wages and public spending – spurred on by Berlin .	-4.7993
Behind the current budget and currency problems lies a deeper European productivity problem .	-2.4747
As a result of the “ green ” energy directives imposed by Brussels – a code for subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – European industry pays twice for electricity and four times for gas compared to the United States .	-3.3297
This is a crippling cost disadvantage , as we have seen in Grangemouth .	-2.9969
All wage fixing in the world does not protect the European petrochemical industry from being pushed into the corner by cheap American shale gas .	-2.6218
As a result , a revolt , especially in France , the EU ’ s former cheerleader .	-2.5260
After the war , France ’ s political elite saw the EU as a vehicle to keep Germany in check and raise Paris on an equal footing with Washington .	-3.4821
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy , and has pushed Europe through its own economic policies , which is what the battered French economy is struggling with .	-6.1084
As a result , Marine Le Pen ’ s right-wing , anti-EU National Front has just won a decisive post-election , placing the ruling Socialists in third place .	-4.2618
The National Front is now France ’ s most popular party , with 24 % of the vote – a timely warning to the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a division on the right would automatically benefit the left .	-4.7070
What does Le Pen do with her newly won popularity among the white working-class French ?	-3.1427
It wants to use the EU elections next year to forge an anti-EU , anti-Community currency bloc in the European Parliament .	-2.7384
If the anti-EU parties perform well in these elections – and this is very possible – then for the first time such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament .	-4.3195
That is the point I want to make : in the not too distant future , the growing resentment against the EU and the single currency will unite to abolish the euro .	-4.3858
The EU will not disappear , but it will become more like the “ Europe of the ( sovereign ) nations ” that General de Gaulle favored .	-2.6216
Germany and a few of its satellite economies may stick to the euro , but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies .	-2.5156
I expect Britain to distance itself from this project in the hope of being flattered with the US .	-3.6883
But Washington ’ s growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain alone will be in the Atlantic rain .	-2.3625
Where is Scotland in all this ?	-2.2242
We can decide to be a region of ( ultimately ) small England .	-2.5345
Or we can defend our own economic interests – including telling Berlin and Brussels what they can put in place .	-3.9826
I suspect that Scotland could go very well in a looser European grouping if we retain our own currency .	-4.2988
Cooperation with other similarly minded countries is easier in a non-federal Europe of nations .	-2.5293
Otherwise , we should consider matching Norway and maintaining our economic independence .	-3.1746
The SNP government in Scotland is – remarkably – the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe , and won a spectacular majority in 2011 , owing to the rejection of the proposed ( and implemented ) cuts that Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Demcoalition .	-4.2862
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to opt for independence now , only to get austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels .	-4.0630
Early Puberty : Fast	-7.6163
Afro-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white peers , as studies show .	-2.4980
Physical change does not yet imply puberty .	-3.4286
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible .	-1.4500
Experts believe that epidemic obesity is a catalyst for early puber.	-2.6286
The early puberty trend is less pronounced among boys .	-3.5094
The former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in child health and family issues .	-2.1990
Should a mother be concerned if her daughter grows breasts and pubic hair at the age of seven or eight ?	-4.1882
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics in Orlando , Florida this week , the pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and were a new norm .	-3.9769
“ I spend a lot of time reassuring parents – usually this is no sign that puberty will soon occur , ” says Kaplowitz .	-5.8327
Obvious indicators of development , such as growing breasts , chamois and armour , as well as body odor , are shown in girls earlier .	-8.1977
However , there was only a slight shift in the age of the menarch ( the first disorder ) in the last 40 years .	-6.0624
In the United States , the average age is 12.5 years , slightly less than 12.75 in 1970 .	-1.9363
“ When the development of breasts begins , it will take at least two to three years to go until the menarch , ” says Kaplowitz , also author of the book “ Early adolescence in girls : The essential guide to dealing with this frequently occurring problem ” .	-7.0758
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty progresses .	-1.6974
It is controversial what is actually the beginning of puberty , but it is “ premature ” when breast augmentation is accompanied by a growth spurt before an age of eight .	-5.0556
In most cases , the process slows or stagnates – something that a pediatrician can monitor closely .	-2.4590
With faster progress , tests by an endocronologist could be displayed to prevent serious problems such as tumours or cysts .	-6.6300
There are treatments for delaying early menstruation and preventing another consequence : premature aging of the bones , which can ultimately lead to growth inhibition and therefore a small body growth in adults .	-6.9502
The recommendations for medication or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child , development speed , growth rate and emotional maturity .	-3.5824
Psychosocial aspects are also important .	-0.8121
Kaplowitz is cautious about drugs , but he admits : “ The suppression of puberty can mitigate behavioral problems and girls ’ feelings , unlike their peers . ”	-5.1328
The other big problem is understandable : parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have the period .	-2.1806
“ They are concerned about the risk of pregnancy or how they handle the hygienic side , ” said Kaplowitz .	-4.0944
“ It was a shock , ” recalls a woman whose daughter got her day with ten .	-3.8595
Even though there were first signs and we had talked about menstruation , it was emotionally unprepared .	-5.6170
She came scared and excited from school home because she was the first in her circle of friends .	-3.3340
There are many widely published theories about the causes of early puberty .	-2.1286
But there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other foods , chemicals in the environment , or sexual messages in the media are the cause .	-3.3956
Girls , like girls , enter puberty earlier .	-4.4985
Kaplowitz believes that the most compelling premise is the epidemic of obesity .	-2.8471
He supported the implementation of a study in 2001 on girls aged six to nine , which establishes a connection between body fat and puberty .	-5.2074
Other studies support this conclusion , but there are many other factors that played a role .	-5.9305
In this country , African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white peers .	-2.3998
There are different explanations for this .	-1.9549
Globally , early puberty seems to be influenced by all kinds of things , from economic conditions to climate to genes .	-3.3774
Another mystery : Although boys are already growing face and shame , the trend toward full previous puberty is not as pronounced as in girls .	-5.9152
Other doctors at the AAP conference underlined the complexity of the issue .	-3.1291
The emergence of acne and pubic hair is common even in babies and infants .	-4.2524
“ We must be careful about identifying the true beginning of puberty , ” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman , a pediatric endocrinologist at the Goryeb Children 's Hospital in Morristown , New Jersey .	-3.0702
Parents should not hesitate to ask their pediatrician how to talk to their child .	-2.9484
“ This can mean that you have to talk earlier than expected , ” says Kaplowitz .	-4.7874
If you remain calm , the child usually reacts well .	-3.1096
Girls who bloom early need the insurance that the process is a normal part of life , even if it occurs earlier than intended .	-4.2586
Jumbo manufacturers argue over seat widths in the face of large orders .	-2.8479
Between leading aircraft manufacturers , there has been a dispute over the width of seats in the tourist class on long-haul flights , which sets the tone for a bitter collision at the Dubai Airshow this month .	-4.9986
The dispute revolves around the seat width offered to passengers on long flights in the tourist class – not always those that airlines are most concerned about , but this designated space is the key to efficiency claims on the latest aircraft from Airbus SAS and Boeing Co .	-12.3256
This week , Airbus called for an industry standard requiring a seat width of at least 46 cm ( 18 inches ) in the tourist class , but the US arch-rival Boeing says that the airlines should decide .	-5.4415
The dispute comes at a time when aircraft manufacturers are competing to sell even larger versions of their twin-engine long-range aircraft , and record orders are expected at the event from 17 to 21 November .	-5.6734
How the rear part of the aircraft is shaped – especially if there are nine or ten rows – is crucial to the economic results indicated by the new “ mini jumbo ” design .	-5.4339
Boeing claims that its modernized “ 777X ” holds 406 people in tourist class seats that are more than 17 inches wide , allowing ten per row .	-5.5589
Airbus declares that the competing version of the A350 will carry 350 people in 18 inch wide tourist seats , with nine per row .	-5.9148
Aircraft giants often report technical details through advertising in the trade press .	-5.0898
Now Airbus is appealing directly to the public at the Dubai Airshow , where the 777X , with more than 100 orders , is expected to take place .	-4.5971
Recently , the company presented an advertisement that could be the beginning of a new ad war , showing donors a picture of three people squatting together in a restaurant , with the title : “ Would you accept that ? ”	-5.3372
“ Boeing is proposing long-haul seats that are closer than regional turbo-props , ” says Airbus CEO John Leahy .	-4.6232
People are getting fatter with changing dietary habits , but aircraft seats have not changed radically .	-4.5369
Between the early 1970 ’ s , when the Boeing 747 defined modern long-distance travel , and by the end of the century , the weight of the average male American between 40 and 49 increased by 10 % , according to data from the US Department of Health .	-5.3915
The circumference of the average male American in the 21st century , according to US health statistics , is 100.8 cm .	-3.4823
Airbus says that its rival is in line with a 1950s seat concept when the average body size of the freshly baptized “ Jet Set ” was narrower .	-5.9104
According to Airbus , studies have been carried out that an additional inch ( 2.54 cm ) per seat increases sleeping quality by 53 % .	-4.9922
Boeing denies the Airbus figures on the seats and says that it is not up to manufacturers to decide how airlines can balance the balance between fares and equipment .	-7.0845
The company also explains , according to research , the experience of the aircraft depends on more than the seat width .	-4.9713
“ It really is about giving airlines flexibility so that they can do what they think they need to succeed , ” explains Boeing ’ s flight cabin expert Kent Craver .	-5.0123
They do not want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable .	-1.1471
They know their business better than anyone else .	-1.2490
For passengers , this is about more elbow freedom , but for manufacturers it will increasingly be an issue that can have an impact on sales .	-5.6409
Behind the controversy is a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least $ 700 billion at list prices in the coming decades , which could have a lasting impact on the US or Europe ’ s export balance .	-4.8466
As Reuters reported for the first time in July , the seating layout is the driving force behind the dispute over the new jets .	-3.3230
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest twin-engine long-range designs than the market leader in this segment , the 365-seat Boeing 77-300ER .	-3.3551
The results of Boeings partly depend on the 777X being compared to the original design of nine seats in the 777 with its ten seats per row .	-5.1547
The increased cost per unit is still lower than the current ten seat machine per line .	-4.0629
“ Boeing is squeezing more seats in its aircraft to make it more competitive with our products , ” says Kevin Keniston , Head of Passenger Comfort at European Airbus .	-4.4695
On the other hand , analysts say that full cabins with ten seats per row at existing 777s indicated that many passengers opted for a tighter arrangement , which could be accompanied by cheaper fares .	-5.1946
“ Eighteen inches of seats would be great for passengers , but the reality is that , from an economic point of view , the Airbus offer is controlled by the 777 threat , ” says Mary Kirby , cabin operator , founder and editor of Runway Girl Network .	-4.5083
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats , but a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose .	-3.0225
The world ’ s traveling jet sellers even wear bandages to measure the equipment to the competition .	-7.2273
Even if they offer comfort , all manufacturers also offer jets with highly condensed design for low-cost airlines and regional flights .	-5.5357
Airbus offers a ten-seater A350 , but has not yet sold it .	-5.2904
Until recently , Airbus has stressed the importance of adapting the cabins and offering wide seats on the corridors for some jets .	-5.5910
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets , experts say that the call for a new industry standard is likely to evaporate , but could distract from the wave of 777X sales .	-4.0588
New Anti-nicotine Vaccine Could Kill Smoking Pleasure	-3.7028
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could spoil the fun of smoking .	-1.8271
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for a lifetime .	-2.4263
Other trials are needed before human testing , which may take a few years , but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said that the first results were good .	-4.7013
“ We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can help once millions of smokers who have tried to stop and tried out all the methods available on the market , but have experienced that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches , ” says Cornell .	-10.5914
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to contain genetic information on the production of nicotine antibodies .	-3.3104
The virus selectively infects liver cells , which then produce a permanent stream of antibodies .	-2.6022
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain , which means that a smoker does not experience a nicotine high .	-3.9710
In trials , vaccinated mice administered by nicotine maintained their normal level of activity .	-4.0263
By contrast , mice without vaccination would have taken a “ time-out , ” the researchers explained , a sign that nicotine has reached their brain .	-4.7724
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine .	-2.4345
Earlier tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies .	-1.4620
Vaccines had to be given so often to maintain the antibody level that they were expensive and impractical .	-3.5884
But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be significantly lower , as it turns liver cells into antibody factories .	-3.1114
As Professor Crystal said , a future vaccine for people , if it is safe , could be administered to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette , thereby preventing nicotine addiction .	-4.4169
But it is more likely that smokers would use it to stop .	-2.4824
“ They then know that when they start smoking again , they no longer enjoy smoking because of the nicotine vaccine , and that helps them to leave the habit , ” he explains .	-5.2838
British scientists said that the results were interesting , but at the same time warned that further research was needed .	-3.2094
Tripoli denies having been influenced by Obeid	-2.8613
The former minister of the New South Wales Labor Party , Joe Trinodi , is being investigated by the state ’ s corruption supervisor .	-7.3918
The former NSW minister denies that he has changed the rules on maritime lease at the request of his political mentor , Eddie Obeid , who owned covert holdings in three land holdings in state-controlled land .	-6.6791
On Friday , the Independent Commission Against Corruption ( ICAC Independent Commission on Corruption ) expanded its investigations into whether Obeid has influenced various State Ministers to extend lease contracts at the Circular Quay , where the Obeids operated two restaurants and a café without any calls for tender after their expiry in August 2005 .	-7.6100
It is now being investigated for the accusation that Tripoli had known Obeids ' hidden interest in the land , after Tripoli 's former deputy chief secretary , Lynne Ashpole , said so on Thursday .	-9.1680
In years of talks that began in 2005 , the government had pushed for public tenders for lease contracts .	-4.1960
The tenants were opposed to this and wanted longer maturities .	-6.2014
In 2009 , the lease contracts for companies at the Circular Quay , which brought $ 2.5 million annually to the Obeids , were extended without public tender .	-5.1465
Tripoli , which was the port minister from February 2006 to November 2009 , originally advocated public tenders .	-4.9764
But he refused to make the changes at the request of Obeid , who , as Trinodi confirmed , had pushed for a reform of the government ’ s rent arrangements .	-5.4225
A telephone note submitted to the ICAC showed talks from August to September 2007 between Obeid , Tripodi and Steve Dunn , a senior official who had moved to the port ministry after working under Obeid in the fishing authority .	-5.9496
‘ Was the issue discussed in these telephone conversations about drawing up commercial interdiction arrangements ? ’ , asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy Trinodi .	-6.9774
“ No , ” Trinodi replied .	-3.2192
I cannot remember what was discussed , but that was definitely not .	-2.2273
Definitely not between me and Mr Obeid .	-1.4678
Israeli warplanes attack Syria , official sources say .	-4.2734
Israeli fighter planes had attacked a target in the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday night , a senior government official confirmed to Fox News .	-3.5424
The official did not explain what the goal was , but said it was at least one .	-2.8575
According to the Associated Press , the target was Russian SA-125 missiles .	-1.4349
At least twice this year , Israel has already carried out air strikes on missile deliveries in Syria .	-3.1815
Foreign workers with 457 visas could be subjected to “ test of authenticity ”	-3.6492
The government is considering a “ authenticity test ” for foreign workers with a 457 visa as part of extended measures .	-4.7652
If the test were to be introduced , it would use a criterion to prevent the 457 from being used to fill unskilled jobs or as a back door to move family and friends to Australia .	-5.1553
Today , a government proposal for discussion was published after former Labor Party MPs , Maxine McKew , had condemned the government ’ s comments on foreign workers because they could be perceived as an insult by Australia ’ s neighbors .	-5.9996
“ Loud statements like that foreigners are to backstop — and , Australians first stop — are a very unpleasant relapse in times when unions were demanding a protected labor market , ” she said to Australia India Institute today .	-7.3849
Historically , that meant protecting white workers – and if some in the region were to hear an echo of this historical artefact , I would not be surprised .	-4.4205
The proposal for a debate outlines twelve measures once envisaged by former immigration minister Chris Bowen .	-3.7746
Immigration Minister Brendan O 'Connor , who was yesterday in talks about human trafficking in Sri Lanka , has implemented five of the proposed amendments , while the others are still being considered .	-4.9033
If the “ criterion of authenticity ” is adopted , someone applying for a visa could be checked to see whether “ the application is genuine in cases where the applicant is related or personally connected to the holder or relevant person of the supporting company . ”	-6.1508
Companies could also be required to account for the number of 457 visa holders after , in the past , companies that initially wanted to support only a small number of workers finally stopped hundreds .	-5.1048
Meanwhile , a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum probably died of a heart attack after arriving this week with a refugee boat on Christmas Island .	-4.0688
The disturbing nine-year-old son of the man who came to Australia with him has been supervised by an adult cousin since the death of his father on Wednesday .	-4.5432
Australian authorities brought the man to the Christmas Island Hospital where he died .	-1.5276
The British Government has announced a study to increase the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland .	-2.6596
HS2 Ltd is proposing to establish high-speed links between Scotland and the North of England from the start of phase 1 in 2026 .	-5.4892
Minister of Transport , Baroness Kramer , said that the project ‘ will bring Britain closer together ’ .	-2.4841
The Scottish Transport Minister , Keith Brown , said that he was very pleased to work with the British Government on this plan .	-3.0165
Phase 1 is a new high-speed rail link between London and the West Midlands .	-2.5933
After the completion of phase 2 , there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds .	-3.6155
In June , the government revised the estimated cost of building the high-speed road between London and the North of England from GBP 32.7 billion to GBP 42.6 billion .	-3.5754
The UK Government , which is in talks with Transport Scotland , has commissioned HS2 Ltd to look for further route capacities and travel time improvements for Northern England and Scotland .	-4.9376
This includes the possibility of travelling three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London .	-3.5041
Baroness Kramer said : ‘ Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network that brings Britain and its cities closer together ’ .	-3.0174
We are making progress with HS2 because it brings enormous benefits .	-3.0301
Without it , we are facing a capacity crisis in our rail network .	-2.4141
But there is also the link between 18 British cities , including Glasgow and Edinburgh , which is improved thanks to HS2 .	-3.4424
As Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael commented , “ Today ’ s announcement is good news for Scotland . ”	-2.8316
On behalf of the Scottish Government , Keith Brown Carmichael called for “ unambiguous ” Scottish involvement in the HS2 network .	-3.7528
Brown said , “ The high-speed rail link holds the potential for enormous economic benefits for Scotland , but at the same time , Scottish economic power also provides an argument for fast rail links across the UK . ”	-5.4495
We are therefore pleased to work as a partner of the British Government and to examine the options for a high-speed rail link in Scotland , which creates benefits for all and complements the link between Glasgow and Edinburgh , which the Scottish Government is already planning .	-5.4935
I look forward to examining the investigation report with the British ministers next year and to taking the next steps together .	-3.4359
Provisions on electronic equipment in Australia are provisionally in force .	-4.3028
Australian air passengers must continue to shut down tablets and smartphones at launch and landing , despite efforts in the US to relax regulations on such devices .	-4.5843
The US Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) allows US airlines to change their specifications so that passengers can read , watch , or play e-books on their equipment during critical flight phases , provided they are in “ flight mode . ”	-4.7599
Passengers are already allowed to do so during most of the flight , but many people find it annoying that they are not allowed to read their e-books when they start and land .	-5.0534
Australian companies , however , do not have immediate plans to change their rules to comply with agreements .	-7.0515
The Aviation Safety Authority ( CASA ) also stated that it would look at the announcement , but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic equipment in critical flight phases in Australia still apply .	-6.2300
“ The CASA does not currently have any specific regulations regarding the use of electronic equipment in the aircraft ” , was published .	-4.9814
This subject is subject to provisions requiring airlines to maintain safety at all times and passengers to comply with the safety instructions given by cabin crew .	-4.6805
Virgin has already had discussions with the CASA on extending the use of his Wi-Fi entertainment system on flights and said that one is open to change , but that they should be initiated by the legislator .	-6.7919
“ We would like to see CASA ’ s review of the approval of electronic devices , because we are convinced that this would improve the customer ’ s experience , now that we offer ( wireless entertainment ) during the flight , ” said a speaker . is . is . is , , , , , , , , , ,	-11.5912
Qantas said that the current rules will remain in place until further notice .	-3.7983
“ Our current guidelines stipulate that electronic devices must not be used at the start and landing stage , and we currently have no plans to change that , ” the company explained .	-5.1568
The FAA regulations apply to US airlines .	-2.1113
However , we are always interested in developments in regulations that can benefit passengers and will certainly look closely at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it .	-4.7762
The decision varies from one US company to another depending on the age of the fleet .	-3.9914
They must prove that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from mobile devices and change manuals , training materials , hand baggage programmes and customer instructions .	-4.9721
“ Once an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet , it can allow passengers to use portable , light electronic devices such as tablets , e-book readers , and smartphones at all levels , ” said the FAA .	-5.2467
In rare cases , with poor visibility , the crew will instruct passengers to switch off the equipment during landing .	-4.9370
The group also recommended that heavier equipment should be safely stowed under the seat or in the compartments above the seats when starting and landing .	-5.4843
Prior to the rematch against Schalke , the most mature BVB fans with light missiles had created ugly scenes in the Veltins-Arena .	-9.3009
Borussia Dortmund announced severe consequences .	-2.8155
Before the Friday game of the Bundesliga against the VfB Stuttgart , the Ultras responded with a silence - initially .	-5.6287
It was an unusual , almost speechical acoustics , which was offered to the viewer in the signal Iduna Park just before the German vice minister Borussia Dortmund was .	-8.5791
Most of them were guest fans with their singing .	-4.9419
The South Stand , on the other hand , where the most loyal - and loudest - BVB fans stand , was exceptionally quiet : no songs , no slaughter calls .	-7.4745
The pedestal of Capo , which otherwise coordinates the joint fire , remained undamaged .	-4.9413
And in front of the grandstand a big flag was flying with the inscription " section stadium ban " .	-7.0730
Only as goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller , as always , entered the place as the first BVB player , fired short time jubilation .	-6.4899
When his team colleagues followed , there were vocal vocals and waving shawls - but far from everywhere .	-5.3984
Nothing was raining in the central blocks of 12 and 13 of the south gallery .	-3.6195
Even that Stadionsbacher Norbert Dickel once again enumerated the positive experiences of the last few days - DerbySiege , Siege over Arsenal , contract extension of coach Jürgen Klopp - did not cause celebration .	-7.2118
Only five minutes before the whistle the Capo will climb his podium - and until then the tangible tension was unleashed in a loud scream , when Dickel , as usual , broke the mood at the stadium .	-11.4969
Finally , as always , it was the turn of the South Stand - and finally the loudest place in the stadium was once again as usual .	-6.7806
And at the latest when the loud call for ' Derbysieger stands on ' came from the South Stand , everything was as usual .	-7.2292
The previous silence was probably a response to what has happened in recent days .	-3.2823
Just before Revierderby at FC Schalke 04 , some of the BVB ’ s supporters had fired light missiles into the audience and into the place – and hit almost goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller .	-8.2594
The game was delayed due to the chaotic scenes .	-1.8080
BVB-Boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had received the tips of the Dortmunder Ultras in his office - and if you think Watzke 's words , this was a rather unpleasant appointment for fan representatives .	-6.7132
" There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra-movement , " the BVB-Boss announced on a podium discussion in Frankfurt on Thursday evening .	-4.4379
As an immediate measure , Watzke banned the Ultras from a choreography for the home game against VfB Stuttgart .	-4.1506
" I banned that , " he said .	-3.3060
We cannot abandon the zero-tolerance policy on pyrotechnics .	-2.2850
In addition , the Ultras have shown different ways of punishing them - until Tuesday they have time to choose one .	-6.5111
Otherwise , according to Watzke , BVB will set a sanction by the end of next week .	-2.9507
" This will be drastic , " said Watzke .	-4.2466
We can look forward to hearing what the reactions in the South Gallery will be .	-5.4729
Houses of Habitats in Singapore , as the crisis in the middle class has arrived .	-4.6298
Janani Amirthabinga is exchanging a golden bracelet , a ring and a pair of earrings in a security deposit in Singapore ’ s Bendemeer shopping mall .	-6.9941
“ My husband and I have just bought a house , there is all my money in it , ” says Amirthalinga .	-4.2092
Although she earn 3,000 Singapore dollars a month ( about € 1,730 ) as an administrative worker and her husband also works , the monthly family income is not enough , she explains .	-5.7827
Indeed , in parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt is rising – demand is so high that ValueMax , where it exchanged , became the third deposit house listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week .	-4.7642
The pawning of jewelry is not only a quick way to get money – 1,300 Singapore dollars in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan .	-5.0647
Typically , deposits in Singapore require an effective 17 % annual interest rate , just above 15.4 % demanded by the United Overseas Bank , a local lender with a branch in the same shopping center .	-4.5380
However , deposit houses offer the advantage that there is no need to verify the creditworthiness or evidence of income , which is why loans are possible more quickly than in banks .	-6.4044
For this reason , millions of people in the region turn to refuges , as families feel the pressure from rising living costs and rising household and consumer debt .	-4.8361
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap credit , owing to a loose fiscal policy in developed economies , families with lower and middle-income incomes are looking for pawn houses to compensate for the difference in a sluggish economy .	-6.8185
This week , the rating agency Standard & Poor ’ s growing household debt , mainly through rising mortgages , called it a risk factor for Asian banks ’ creditworthiness .	-3.5046
According to the agency , Malaysia , Thailand and Singapore have the highest household debt in Asia relative to gross domestic product .	-3.5906
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80 % of GDP , a 60 % increase in 2008 .	-3.9520
People ’ s economists are also worried about Thailand ’ s high consumer debt , which this week has just emerged from a technical recession .	-4.1492
On Thursday , the data showed a continuing weakness in exports and a decline in consumer demand .	-3.2153
“ In effect , with rising costs , people in the middle to bottom segments ( the income scale ) will try to supplement their income wherever possible , ” says Song Seng Wun , economist at CIMB , a Malaysian bank .	-5.3412
Historical highs in gold prices over the past two years have exacerbated the trend of pledging personal items , as people seize the opportunity to turn family jewelry into cash .	-5.6690
In Singapore , about 70 percent of the pledged objects are gold in the 200 municipal deposit houses .	-5.0301
People say : “ The gold price looks good , let us grandmothers pledge the gold chain and pick it up next month . ”	-5.1255
The largest Thai deposit house operator , EasyMoney , has experienced 20 % customer growth in its branches in recent months .	-4.4126
The growth in the deposit business is so strong that ValueMax , owner of the Bendemeer and 15 others in Singapore , wants to expand not only to neighboring Malaysia – where the company operates four houses – but also outside Asia , says Yeah Lee Ching , Managing Director of ValueMax .	-4.6738
The company finances this with 60 % of the 66 million Singapore dollars it received this week with the IPO in Singapore .	-4.7136
While some lenders have been caught in the crossfire because of high interest rates , Yeah explains that deposit houses offer not only lower interest rates than other lenders , but also do not directly increase the debt .	-5.8199

According to the Green MEP Hans-Christian Ströbele , his surprising meeting with Snowden in Russia was about the conditions under which the ex-intelligence staff would testify to a German public prosecutor or to a committee of inquiry .	-5.9355

Australian Health Bailout of $ 325 million	-2.8382
The Australian government insists on the harsh conditions associated with the rescue package of $ 325 million in Australian health care to ensure that the state government cannot waste the money .	-4.8126
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take “ immediate action ” to avert a crisis caused by an aging population of the island state , a higher rate of chronic diseases and system restrictions .	-4.0358
The funding for a four-year period was decided after government consultations with the independent Tasmanian MEP Andrew Wilkie .	-4.4243
“ The government has put together an emergency rescue package that , in our view , addresses the unique challenges facing the federal state , ” said Plibersek today .	-3.8034
The $ 325 million package includes $ 31 million in emergency aid for election benefits .	-3.2628
Further 2600 operations , including orthopaedic surgery and treatment for gray star , are to eliminate residues .	-5.4741
In addition , there is money for day clinics in Hobart and Launceston , better aftercare after stationary stays , specialist training , mental health services and the introduction of a system for electronic recording of health data in local hospitals .	-5.3158
“ These investments are in line with the ideas that affected clinic staff have told me that they are the best way to improve the Tasman health system , ” said Tanya Plibersek .	-4.9911
The minister insisted on strict reporting and accountability by the Tasman government .	-5.8278
The state must maintain the current level of funding to receive money from the Commonwealth and report monthly on where the additional money was spent .	-4.6670
A three-member commission will be set up to ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible .	-3.2057
As Wilkie said today , the $ 325 million would be of little use unless “ they are accompanied by real reforms that put the public Tasman health-care system on a more sustainable path . ”	-4.0983
Nevertheless , he praised the government for responding to its request for urgent help , which he first expressed to the Prime Minister in early May .	-3.9274
“ I am confident that federal aid will make a major contribution to eliminating the state ’ s public health system , ” Wilkie said .	-3.6100
According to the state government , these election benefits will largely offset recent cuts .	-3.3128
But the federal opposition ’ s public-health spokesman , Peter Dutton , believes that today ’ s announcement is only a “ cobblestone solution . ”	-4.8120
“ We are in today ’ s situation because the lab state government has withdrawn $ 430 million from the health system , ” he said to ABC TV .	-4.1354
It cannot be that a government pulls almost $ half a billion out of the system and pushes the Commonwealth into $ 300 million and then pretend to be good news .	-5.7096
Dutton asked Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the rescue package would be spent on extra bureaucracy .	-3.1232

Syria has destroyed its ability to manufacture chemical weapons , according to a monitoring group .	-3.4182
Syria has destroyed important facilities for the manufacture of chemical weapons and gas ammunition , the global chemical weapons surveillance group declared Thursday , while serious clashes occurred in the north of the country near one of the sites where suspected toxic substances are stored .	-7.6822
Also on Thursday , a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people had been killed almost three years ago since the civil war began .	-3.5368
The announcement of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons ( OPCW ) came one day before the date .	-2.9819
November 1 , which the Hague based organisation Damascus had set up to destroy or make “ inoperable ” all chemical weapons manufacturing facilities , including all chemical mixing machines for toxic gas and the filling of ammunition .	-5.4432
The completion of this process , which is essentially the first stage of destruction , is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable aimed at destroying all Syria ’ s chemical weapons by mid-2014 .	-6.8661
Destruction means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons .	-1.9713
Damascus , however , must begin to destroy the existing weapons and supplies .	-3.7661
According to assumptions , there are about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons in the country , including mustard gas and sarin nerve gas .	-3.4455
The announcement came at a time when fighting took place in the city of Safira on Thursday , where experts say that there is a chemical weapons and storage facility , as the British resident Syrian Human Rights Observatory announced .	-5.4321
The activist group , which is pursuing the number of deaths through a network of activists in Syria , declared on Thursday that 120,296 people died .	-4.1217
Of these , 61,067 civilians , including 6,365 children .	-2.3133
On the government side , 29.954 of them belonged to the army of President Bashar Assad , 18.678 were pro-government fighters , and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militias .	-3.7107
Also among the dead are 2,202 dead army soldiers and 5,375 opposition fighters , many of them foreigners .	-3.5413
On July 25 , the UN estimated the number of deaths in this conflict since March 2011 to 100,000 .	-2.4712
This number has not been updated yet .	-7.4893
The conflict has forced about two million people to flee the country .	-1.8876
Assad ’ s troops have been fighting the rebels in Safira for weeks , many of whom have links with al-Qaeda groups .	-2.5864
The observatory said that there were losses on both sides on Thursday , but did not mention details .	-2.9096
The fighting highlights the danger posed by the chemical weapons inspectors , because their mission to free Syria from its toxic arsenal is a race against time in the midst of a raging civil war .	-4.7825
According to the OPCW , which works closely with the United Nations , the team is “ now convinced that it has seen and witnessed all of Syria ’ s important production and mixing / filling facilities . ”	-4.7447
Therefore , ‘ no further inspection activities are currently planned ’ .	-3.3268
At the beginning of the week , the inspectors said that they had completed the first round of checks and visited 21 out of 23 of the sites indicated in Damascus .	-6.6918
Because of security concerns , it was not possible to visit two facilities , the inspectors said .	-3.7875
On Thursday , the OPWC declared that the two sites had been “ abandoned ... and the chemical weapons program ’ s objects there had been moved to other entities that were inspected . ”	-6.4366
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two institutions that the OPCW inspectors could not visit .	-2.9629
Syria has presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons , which must be approved by the Executive Committee of the OPWC next month .	-3.3460
“ I salute the bravery and courage that you have all shown in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever carried out by this organization , ” said Ahmed Uzumcu , Director General of the Supervisory Organization in a commentary published by OPCW .	-5.2533
For three years now , the mostly Sunni Muslim rebels in this civil war have been fighting Assad ’ s government and its security forces , which include many Alawites , to secede Shia Islam .	-3.6585

The cause of the explosion was unknown , he explained .	-2.3787
Wrath on Bali ’ s Bombing	-3.7140
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who died in the 2002 Bali bomb attack were angered by the ruling of the last of the instigators who were tried because they believed Umar Patek should be shot by law .	-6.9489
Patek , who was in flight for almost ten years as one of Southeast Asia ’ s most wanted people , was sentenced yesterday to 20 years in prison for his role in building explosives for the bombing .	-5.4358
He could be released after 15 years with a moratorium .	-3.2530
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder because of the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta , where 202 people died , including 88 Australians , and many others were injured .	-3.6681
A condemnation was also made in a series of terrorist charges , including a wave of explosive attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000 .	-3.8136
The prosecution had called for a life sentence , even if it could have applied for the death penalty for the man , who is also called “ Demolision Man ” because of his reputation as a masterful bomber .	-6.3785
The decision has raised painful memories of June Corteeen , a mother from Perth who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the devastation caused by Patek and his fellow conspirators almost ten years ago .	-4.8514
Fighting with tears she said that Patek should have been sentenced to death .	-2.8287
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys .	-2.2772
" He should be placed in front of a firing squad , " said Corteeen against AAP .	-5.2138
I have to live every day with the fact that I will not get any more grandchildren and I will never see my daughters again .	-4.6937
The Sari Club was razed to the ground when , on 12 October 2002 , shortly after 23 : 00 , a huge bomb exploded in a small patch parked in front of the nightclub .	-5.0397
Peter Hughes was in Paddy 's Bar , where only 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber exploded a explosive backpack .	-3.7853
He fell into coma for a month after the attack , and “ died ” three times as he depended on a conservation system .	-4.5832
Hughes said that Patek deserved the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cell Jemaah Islamiah – Amrozi , Mukhlas , and Imam Samandra – who were responsible for the bloodbath and were executed four years ago .	-3.2782
In fact , this type should be given the death penalty above all else .	-3.5435
To keep him alive – no , there is no reason to keep him alive .	-2.7876
Getting 20 years after killing 202 people and injuring many hundreds is not much .	-3.0896
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers to be tried .	-3.4583
He escaped almost a decade of arrest , but was eventually seized in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad , where US forces killed former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden just four months later .	-4.2453
During the trial , an FBI agent said that intelligence reports had indicated that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of reconstructing the link between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda .	-3.9412
“ He has not stood up , ” Corteen said .	-3.7308
Until recently , he has shown no remorse for how much suffering he has inflicted on other people .	-3.0225
The verdict took place before the ten-year anniversary of this year ’ s attack , which is celebrated in Bali and Australia .	-5.0584
“ There will be many tears this year , ” Corteeen said .	-2.9086
Patek may appeal against his judgment .	-2.1599
FAA : Passengers can now use electronic devices on aircraft ( but do not make mobile phone calls )	-3.1445
Air passengers can now use their electronic equipment to read , work , play , listen to music and watch films from departure to landing , but not to make mobile calls , according to the new guidelines issued on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) in the United States .	-5.8198
But passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately .	-1.2623
At a press conference , FAA employee Michael Huerta explained how quickly they would be implemented .	-3.9737
The airlines must prove to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new directives and that they have updated the flight crew training manuals and the regulations on the stowage of the equipment in accordance with the new regulations .	-6.9652
The FAA has stated that it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic equipment in aircraft .	-3.5384
Among these airlines were also Delta and JetBlue .	-2.0817
“ Depending on the condition of the plan , we could approve the extended use of electronic devices very soon , ” said FAA in a statement .	-4.8664
At present , passengers need to turn off smart phones , tablets , and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed .	-3.5019
You are only allowed to start them again once the aircraft reaches a height of three kilometres and the captain gives the green light .	-5.4423
When entering the landing , passengers must turn them off again and not start them again before the aircraft has landed .	-6.9145
According to the new guidelines , airlines whose aircraft are protected against electronic interference could allow their passengers to use the equipment even at launch , landing , and in the field of rolling stock , the FAA stated .	-10.6372
Most new aircraft and other aircraft that have been converted to higher heights for the use of Wi-Fi should meet the criteria .	-4.4246
Laura Glading , President of the Professional Flight Agent Association , welcomed the changes .	-3.1795
“ If the new scheme is implemented securely – and we work closely with the airline in this respect – both sides will benefit from it , ” commented Glading .	-4.6108
To be honest , we are tired of having to feel like a backer on this issue .	-5.8824
Nevertheless , Internet connections for surfing , exchanging emails , text messages or downloading data under three kilometres remained prohibited , explained the authority .	-4.5184
Passengers are asked to put smartphones , tablets and other devices into flight mode .	-3.7089
So there is still no “ Words With Friends ” , the Scrabble -like online game played by actor Alec Baldwin on his smartphone in 2011 , when he had to leave a jet of American Airlines publicly because he refused to turn off the device while the plane was parked at the gate .	-5.6112
And heavier equipment such as laptops must continue to be stowed , as there is a risk of injury if they fly through the cabin .	-5.2511
Mobile phone calls during the flight remain prohibited as well .	-3.8216
The regulatory authority for telephone calls lies with the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) , not with the FAA .	-2.3818
FAA may lift a ban on certain electronic devices at launch and landing .	-3.4659
Last month , Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board , a safety expert on national transport issues , told CBS News that mobile phones are still considered a risk .	-3.7226
“ Mobile phones are really a problem , not only because they could potentially cause problems with navigation devices , but because we know from the FCC that transmission from the air can also disrupt transmitter masts , ” says Rosenker .	-5.1813
A industry advisory committee , set up by the FAA to investigate this issue , recommended last month that the government allow for a broader use of personal electronic devices .	-5.6652
In recent years , pressure on the FAA has increased to ease restrictions on use .	-3.3569
Critics such as Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri argue that there are no valid grounds for the ban .	-3.8801
The restrictions are also becoming increasingly difficult to enforce , because the use of equipment has become ubiquitous .	-4.7876
Some studies have mentioned that up to a third of the passengers forget or ignore switching off the device .	-5.3039
The FAA began to restrict the use of electronic equipment by air passengers in 1966 , after reports of disruption of navigation and communication equipment by passenger guided FM radios , which were then the latest technological trend .	-7.1335
New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft , but they are also designed and approved by the FAA that they are not affected by electronic interferences .	-4.4205
Airlines have been offering passengers Wi-Fi for several years when the flight is up .	-4.7899
The planes adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also less sensitive to interference .	-3.6683
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for greater use of electronic equipment under the new directives , Huerta said .	-3.7495
Today ’ s electronic devices generally emit far less radio radiation than previous generations .	-3.7457
E-readers , for example , emit only minimal radiation when you flip over .	-3.4261
However , when downloading or sending data , the transmission values are stronger .	-3.1292
Amazon.com.	-2.0060
In 2011 , company employees flew a passenger aircraft full of Kindle E-Reader and made a test flight to identify problems , but could not detect them .	-5.4878
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using equipment .	-2.7971
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said that he believed that the equipment was faulty , even if the risk was minimal .	-5.2988
Other committee members said that there are only isolated reports of pilots who speak for equipment disruption of aircraft systems , and most of them are very old .	-5.1387
However , the committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to arrange switching off the equipment by passengers in poor visibility conditions .	-7.0333
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and described them as a sensible adjustment for travellers who are now heavily equipped with technology .	-5.3123
“ We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience does not conflict with security , ” said Roger Dow , CEO of the U.S. Travel Association .	-2.9828
Bird recovered by air rescue service from North Sea Drill Island .	-4.8099
A bird flown by air rescue service to the coast , exhausted on a North Sea drilling island , was released back into nature .	-4.4245
The water ralle was flown last month with a helicopter to Aberdeen , where it was picked up by the Scottish animal welfare organisation SPCA at their rescue centre in Alloa .	-5.6783
Colin Seddon , head of the center , said : “ This water ralle was probably a winter bird from northern Europe , stopped by the strong winds over the North Sea . ”	-5.8969
It seems that the exhausted bird sought refuge on the drilling island .	-6.2844
He added , “ He could no longer fly further , which is why we were contacted with the request for help . ” was .	-4.3558
When they were released , the water ralle was fit and healthy .	-6.7103
Is Europe ’ s elite ready to do business with Britain ?	-1.6927
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy to a table and defining what those who care for prosperity and work in Britain want to change in our relations with the EU .	-4.6652
To this end , we have commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey among UK business leaders , asking them what they think about Britain , the economy , and the EU .	-3.4828
YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 business leaders , representing roughly the UK business sizes , sectors , and regions .	-4.3578
The results of the survey will surprise many .	-1.5379
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now exporting outside Europe and concentrating on countries that are modernising and growing , while the states in the EU are stagnating .	-4.2788
They want governments to favor new trade links with countries like China , India , and Brazil , rather than stem from the long and exhausting process of reforming the obscure EU institutions .	-4.0391
In their view , on certain legal issues – from antitrust to product legislation – the majority of economic leaders believe that control of these key competences should be brought back to Westminster .	-4.7889
There was general dissatisfaction with the internal market , because companies said that the costs of the Brussels rules would now outweigh the benefits of being part of Europe ’ s trade zone – even 40 % of large companies agreed that , traditionally , they are the most pro-European .	-6.2657
Finally , and this probably says the most , our consultation with business leaders found that a clear majority of the UK wanted a course to change the agreement , and a relationship with the EU based on trade , not politics .	-6.9824
This insight , found among companies of all sizes and leading corporations , shows that the economy is pushing for a “ meaningful change ” that brings the drive of action back to Britain .	-6.1528
Much is at stake – a change in the agreement and better conditions for Britain would lead to a change of opinion in favor of remaining in the EU in a referendum , at 16 % .	-5.5427
The Prime Minister should have no doubt : this survey shows that the British economy is behind his plan to renegotiate Britain ’ s terms of EU membership .	-3.6873
It also shows that companies expect a renegotiation to see a significant shift in power back to Britain .	-4.0541
A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary , as the eurozone moves toward a closer economic and fiscal union .	-3.1027
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK , as the result of our survey shows , which means increased attention to trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels regulatory approach .	-4.7079
Alexei Miller of Gazprom calls pipeline in Bulgaria the start of a new gas .	-2.7745
The construction of the South Stream Pipeline in Bulgaria is the start of one of the largest European energy projects , the Gazprom Board explained .	-4.7329
“ Today ’ s event is a milestone : construction on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline , the largest and most important project in Europe , has begun , ” said Gazprom ’ s CEO , Alexei Miller , in a statement on Thursday .	-4.0819
The project is a key element in the energy security of the entire European continent .	-1.7784
South Stream is supposed to provide more diversity in Russia ’ s export routes across Europe .	-3.6373
A contract dispute between Gazprom and its Ukrainian counterparts , in which most of Russia ’ s gas is stored for Europe , raises the risk of conventional routes , as officials have said .	-4.8776
Miller said that the direct link with Bulgaria , a member of the European Union , means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are “ off forever . ”	-2.8648
Bulgarian consumers receive gas from South Stream at discounted rates when the entire project goes into operation in 2015 .	-3.2318
According to Gazprom , construction in other downstream countries is to begin on the planned route at the end of the year .	-3.4877
The pipeline has an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic meters of natural gas .	-7.0816

In the first three quarters of this year , it increased by 31 % compared to the same period last year .	-3.3166
In the UK , the increase was only 6 % , and in France it was 19 % .	-3.3825
" Real estate investments offer an attractive interest , " said Ulbrich .	-2.6203

Hearing the Royal Commission : Two YMCA officials charged Jonathan Lord for sex offences .	-3.8072
Two YMCA workers from New South Wales ( NSW ) had been charged with sexual crimes related to children before charges were made against child care provider Jonathan Lord from Caringbah in 2011 , as the Royal Commission for Child Sexual Abuse .	-5.8419
But , in the opening statement to the Commission , the YMCA said that ‘ there has never been an incident of sexual child abuse in the organisation ’ .	-5.2856
Chief Phillip Hare was interviewed about a case in which a YMCA employee had been charged with child pornography offences , and another in which a sports teacher at YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted in 1991 for abusing his children .	-6.2930
Hare said Gail Furness , a lawyer assisting the Commission , that he knew of the first case but did not know the second .	-3.7795
He acknowledged that the YMCA ’ s opening statement to the Commission was also inaccurate in claiming that ‘ there have been external YMCA checks in which the YMCA has been recognised as being at the forefront of child safety ’ .	-4.9386
Evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA was informed that it received the second lowest rating of four possible in a quality audit by the Department of Education and Communities ( Ministry of Education ) in August of the year .	-4.3716
Hare , who started with 21 at the YMCA , admitted that the management “ from me downwards ” failed to hire Lord and did not ensure that employees were aware of their obligations to report violations of the guidelines on child safety .	-6.2134
Lord had been sentenced at the beginning of the year for sex offences against twelve boys during his two-year work for the YMCA .	-4.7949
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison .	-1.3554
However , Hare denied that the YMCA had a cultural problem that prevented employees from reporting Lord ’ s violations of children ’ s safety .	-5.0252
The staff said that they had observed violations , including that Lord was alone with children , kept them privately as a babysitter , let them sit on his lap , said that he loved it , and let children play with his mobile phone .	-5.8131
Danielle Ockwell , whose chief was Lord and who had asked for a child protection training because she was concerned about his behavior , said that the child service manager , Jacqui Barnat , who was the chief of Lords at YMCA Caringbah , was “ very intimidating and most of the time very inimitable . ”	-7.8490
The manager explained that he would not accept statements from employees that they would not have dared to report back to their superiors .	-4.4164
Instead , he said , their friendship with Lord has affected their judgment , which is why they would not have notified him .	-5.4318
Hare explained that he told the board of YMCA NSW that the lesson to be learned from the “ Jonathan-Lord incident ” “ does not affect the report ” by staff members , and the Board agreed to it .	-7.1839
Hare said that the decision to urge employees to sign confidentiality obligations shortly after the allegations were made was taken by the director of YMCA 's Children 's Services , Liam Whitley .	-5.2271
He said that this should prevent the evidence from being contaminated , which was “ overzealous ” and poorly implemented .	-4.1041
The YMCA NSW , at the time when Jonathan Lord was employed there between 2009 and 2011 , was not a child-safe organization , Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University , an expert on sexual child abuse , told the Commission .	-4.9797
He explained that there were “ serious problems ” with recruitment , review , recruitment , training and supervision of employees .	-3.9962
The hearing was postponed until 20 December .	-0.9736
Tony Blair said he would seize the opportunity to return as British Prime Minister – but admits that a comeback is unlikely .	-3.5906
In an interview tonight on the fifth anniversary of his departure from office , the 59-year-old announced his views on various domestic issues .	-3.1565
Since his resignation in June 2007 , after a decade as Head of State , Blair has largely avoided commenting on British politics , and his comments have mostly been limited to foreign policy and his role as envoy to the Quartet of Middle East peacemakers .	-5.1092
When asked whether he would like to return to Prime Minister , the Evening Standard in London quoted Blair as saying , “ Yes , safe , but it is unlikely that this will happen , so ... ”	-4.5257

But none was prepared for the three years old Fenton Kirkland .	-3.1599
The Knirps , who is not even in the kindergarten and did his first steps only a few months ago , and his Shetland Pony toffee easily trailed through the three rounds and won the first prize – leaving 30 adult opponents behind .	-6.6747
The couple , both equally large , were praised for their appearance , behavior , and style at the annual competition organized by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff .	-5.2036
During his performance in competition with men and women with elegant melons , he had set his plate fatigue in a cheeky angle and led the two-year-old toffee through the ring .	-6.7657
Fenton was praised by the jurors for his natural abilities in dealing with the pony , which were well above his age .	-3.2301
And toffee received top marks for his appearance and personality .	-2.5762
Fenton had gotten toffee as a gift for his third birthday last March and since then trained with the Shetland Pony every day .	-3.6230
His mother , Donna , 30 , said , “ Fenton and toffee are a great bunch . ”	-2.3173
They had to compete against the whole of the competition and went out of place with gold chips and rosettes .	-7.1745
It was only the second time he took part in a competition with toffee , and we were all delighted when he won .	-3.5913
Full strangers in the arena thought him to be so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him .	-4.2089
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale , South Wales follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells , who has been performing horses for over ten years .	-3.8493
Howells said , “ The whole audience was as electrified , and everyone fired and clashed . ”	-5.8350
He ran on sand all the length of the arena and , although he looked so tiny , he did fantastic work .	-4.0482
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses , tractors and farms , and has two chickens he cares about .	-6.4032
As it has started , it will not take long for it to be on the “ horse of the year ” bonnet – and I am sure it will do well .	-5.3263
A spokesman for the annual horse show said , “ Fenton is only three , but he knows how to deal with his pony . ”	-2.8451
Together they are a great team .	-1.2296
The jurors judged Fenton and Toffee how well they would have done and presented themselves in the demonstration ring .	-4.8278
They pay attention to good cooperation between pony and leaders – and Fenton and toffee were the best in the ring .	-4.2747
I am sure that Fenton 's sweet clothes helped her part , which was perfect for the occasion .	-4.8350
“ Reform ” Chinese Newspaper	-7.5063
A Chinese newspaper on the front page called for the release of a reporter accused of defamation should be reformed , declared a press regulator .	-4.8763
Located in Guangzhou , the New Express had printed a rare public call for the release of the journalist Chen Yongzhou .	-3.6486
But Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to falsify reports of a ruling company .	-4.2582
Now the New Express is undergoing a “ comprehensive rectification , ” the regulatory authority declared .	-4.3063
The “ Rectifications Order ” was issued by the authority for press and publications , radio , film and television in Guangdong .	-5.2858
Preliminary investigations revealed that the New Express , which belongs to the Yangcheng Evening News Group , had published several inaccurate reports about the publicly listed company Zollio between September 2012 and August 2013 .	-5.1646
“ The editorial management of the New Express was disordered , ” the regulatory authority announced in a statement .	-3.3275
She said that she had decided to “ impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou and cut his reporting license . ”	-5.4953
In addition , “ the Yangcheng Evening News Group has been instructed to complete the rectification of the New Express and recommended that the relevant officers be identified at the New Express and immediately review the New Express leadership team . ”	-7.5175
Chen had written several articles for the New Express , in which he reported alleged financial irregularities at a manufacturer of construction machinery called Zoomlion .	-3.8530
After being arrested , the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and stood behind his journalistic work .	-2.8697
But then Chen appeared in state television and admitted that he had published false reports for payment .	-5.3961
“ In this case , I have damaged Zollion as well as the entire news industry and its ability to win public confidence , ” he told the state news channel CCTV .	-5.4526
I did it primarily because I was looking for money and glory .	-3.2209
I realised that I was wrong .	-3.3024
Following Chen ’ s apology , the New Express issued an apology on the front page , declaring that it failed to check the reports correctly .	-3.8939
Several well-known suspects have recently taken confessions on television .	-2.8833
Experts say that confessions are still routinely enforced , despite a legislative amendment at the beginning of the year that prohibited the authorities from forcing anyone to accuse themselves .	-4.1436
Detected by the US-Mexico Drug Tunnel	-5.9599
One of the most sophisticated tunnels for drug smuggling between the US and Mexico , fully equipped with lighting , ventilation and electric railway , has now been discovered .	-4.0913
The US authorities described the 120 times 90 centimetres tunnel as one of the most sophisticated passages they have ever found .	-3.7850
The tunnel , which runs in the zigzag pattern over a length of almost six football fields , connects warehouses near Tijuana , Mexico , and San Diego , USA .	-3.7368
In the area there are countless unsightly warehouses , making it easier to hide drug-laden trucks .	-5.4054
The authorities explained that the tunnel had been closed before drugs could be transported unexplored .	-4.5891
In the discovery of the tunnel , eight and a half tonnes of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were secured , according to the Court 's records .	-4.2733
Three men who , according to the authorities , worked as drivers were accused of owning and selling marijuana and cocaine .	-3.2753
They face prison sentences of between ten years and life long when they are guilty .	-4.7940
In Nogales , Arizona , smugglers rely on an extensive underground network of drainage canals .	-2.4521
The tunnel is the eighth large passage that has been discovered in San Diego since 2006 . is . is , , , and . are , , , ,	-5.8885
Some of the biggest tunnels were discovered after the marijuana harvest in central Mexico in October , which challenges the drug cartels to bring their product quickly to consumers .	-5.1705
In 2010 , authorities found a nearly 640 m long passage with rails , which ran from a kitchen in a residential house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego .	-5.1153
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love each other .	-1.0562
Actors Orlando Bloom and Model Miranda Kerr want to go separate ways in the future .	-4.0485
In an interview , Bloom said that he and Kerr still love each other .	-4.3933
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents of two-year Flynn .	-1.6546
Actor Orlando Bloom has spoken about the separation from his wife , Topmodel Miranda Kerr .	-3.6640
In an interview with US journalist Katie Couric , who was supposed to be broadcast on Friday ( local time ) , Bloom said , " life is sometimes not exactly as we plan or expect . "	-4.4337
Kerr and he still loved himself , stressed the 36-year-old .	-2.8400
" We will support and love each other as Flynn 's parents " .	-2.7954
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010 , and in 2011 their wife Flynn was born .	-4.7460
According to Lexika , veganism is subordinate to vegetarianism , but it differs in a very significant way .	-5.5991
While vegetarians allow themselves to eat cream , ice or a powerful Edam , these delicacies are not on the menu of a vegan .	-6.7064
Milk , cheese , egg , besides the abandonment of meat and fish , the vegans refrain from eating all animal products - honey is also denied .	-6.8007
What remains , one might wonder , but on closer inspection , the vegan world is characterized by a remarkable ingenuity .	-7.6102
" Bread spreads are very popular , " explains Ute Henkelmann , the owner of the local Reform House , which offers a variety of special products for vegans .	-4.5236
Reuben Proctor is also happy to visit the store in Domgasse .	-2.7975
The native New Zealand vegan has been living for 13 years , and in Lammerheim he ( almost ) finds everything he needs to live . " In 1997 I became and . . , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-10.5980
At the turn of the century the next step was taken and I became a vegan .	-2.6478
" The conviction came not only because of the diet , but also because of the choice of shoes " , says Proctor , who prefers artificial leather to normal leather .	-9.2328
He realized that other everyday things without animal products are also possible .	-4.9155
In the first place , vegan is his ethics .	-6.2534
" I don 't want animals to die for me , " Proctor says the maxim of vegans , which covers all consumption patterns .	-5.2158
Instead of marrying burgers , stirrers or rubberbears , the vegan quickly discovered new products , and enthusiasm grew .	-6.6052
" It 's a double bonus , " Proctor says today , " in fact , vegan is not a renunciation , it is an enrichment , " and the is , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-11.3199
And it was precisely these conditions that led to the failure of some , even so well-intentioned , attempts .	-6.9779
" The addiction factor is a very important factor that lets many quit quickly , similar to smoking , " Proctor makes a comparison .	-5.4889
And applies : " Certain tastes cannot be determined by animals " .	-5.4920
It is often the spices or the type of preparation that make up the taste .	-3.8210
" You can also create the same effect in other ways , " explains the vegan .	-4.2637
For example , Proctor brings eggplants , mushrooms and a few vegan sausages .	-4.5383
It pays attention to a balanced , varied diet , where it should taste good .	-5.8266
Of course , one wants something between the teeth , that is legitimate .	-3.1996
" It should taste , but that is not only to reduce to animal food , " Proctor said .	-4.1853
Health damage up to eating disorders , another widespread assumption , he did not suffer .	-4.4841
For me , the changeover had a positive aspect .	-3.4484
I do not take any foreign cholesterol and I have an increased vitamin content .	-4.1262
There are high performance athletes who only feed vegan .	-2.8115
" My blood values are excellent , I let myself check often , " says Proctor .	-4.5994
In particular , many vegan critics warn of the lack of vitamin B12 .	-3.9308
" Because animals are fed with feed rather than grazing on the pasture , it is questionable whether the vitamin B12 proportion is high in the meat you buy in the refrigerator , " Proctor finds .	-5.4017
For vegans , it is also possible to take the coenzyme in the form of tablets .	-3.4549
" My B12 values are fine , " he explains .	-1.8678
Proctor does not have to go a long way to get food .	-4.6024
After all , there are basic foodstuffs everywhere and every supermarket now has soya milk and other products .	-4.3712
I find everything I need on the ground .	-2.5810
Only occasionally I buy something special .	-2.6903
" Many people overlook the fact that only finished products are expensive , but that is how things stand for " ordinary " finished products .	-4.9998
In any case , the preparation of vegan dishes is much cheaper and less time consuming than is generally believed .	-4.8200
" There is a lot to discover in the home kitchen , with a few small tweaks you can achieve good , if not partly better results , " says Proctor .	-8.5748
margarine instead of butter , a little more baking powder and carbon dioxide instead of egg , with his vegan cheese cake , Proctor was able to jam his sweating eggs .	-10.3288
Family celebrations give the vegan a new flavour .	-2.9265
This has a new meaning when cooking together .	-5.0228
" The situations that can arise are as different as the people themselves , " Proctor says .	-2.8922
Of course , he has already received scepticism .	-3.4413
Is my food no longer attractive to you ?	-3.5379
" Should I feel bad now because I drink milk ? " - if you have questions like this , you have to act as a vegan with a sense of .	-7.1456
" I am not opposed to the people , I am part of this society , " Proctor does not want to make an enclaves .	-5.0807
And , more precisely , everyday life does not seem as vegan as expected - and vegans are not as restricted in everyday life as they are commonly believed .	-7.9923
Fast food is also allowed .	-1.5000
Pommes are everywhere !	-2.8224
" Many Döner villages offer falafel , or even a vegetarian yufka , " says Proctor .	-3.3518
In a pizzeria he switches to pasta dishes , or orders a pizza without cheese , all a matter of habit .	-4.8675
The restaurants are so slow down .	-5.4377
" When I started to feed vegan 13 years ago , everything was even more difficult , " the New Zealanders can identify a development : " You have to talk to the people , make them aware of it " .	-6.4847
" If there are enough questions , they may be inclined to supplement the menu , " he hopes .	-3.7616
Vegan restaurants are developing , such as the combobase in Mannheim or the Café Vogelfrei .	-3.9356
Proctor wants other restaurants to have at least one vegan dish on the menu .	-3.7926
Basically , vegan dishes are available for everyone .	-2.6803
Everyone can eat them , so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive .	-2.2054
" Meat dishes , on the other hand , are exclusive , and in the truest sense of the word , because they exclude others , " Proctor notes .	-9.5995
" If you want to avoid food scandals , veganism is a safe way to make the most of them impossible from the outset , " Proctor says .	-4.0168
But buying vegan products can be a bit difficult at the beginning .	-4.4046
In particular , when one learns to understand that it can also contain in peanuts animal additives as a dyer , one seems to have to abandon the courage to follow ethics in so many hurdles and traps .	-8.9841
This is not the only reason why Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen have written a book : " Veganissimo - Animal Nutrients and their Alternatives " explains the many ingredients that are added to food and also detergents .	-4.7477
" Gradually you develop a scanner view and know which signs and logos you have to pay attention to " It is sometimes better to do small steps than to stop or stumble " , Proctor knows .	-5.6760
Veganism is an important moral finger pointing to the mind .	-4.7489
He may not quite manage to manage his habits , but at least he can teach consumers to critically question their habits .	-4.7058
The stock exchange operator Nasdaq OMX keeps its customers in breath .	-3.5791
Trading at Nasdaq Options Market was suspended on Friday afternoon of German time .	-2.6984
In a communication the operator caused technical problems .	-2.3537
The other eleven US options markets , including two of Nasdaq OMX , continued their business unhindered .	-2.6216
The most recent incident continues a series of minor and major failures with the stock exchange operator .	-4.4835
Only on Tuesday the Nasdaq indices were not calculated for an hour due to errors in data transport .	-3.9782
In August of this year , there were two failures in one week alone .	-4.2955
First , the US investment bank Goldman Sachs had sent bulk defective orders to the option markets because of technical problems .	-4.8229
As a result , the stock exchange operators needed almost a whole day to look through and delete the orders .	-4.5102
Two days later , half of all US stock trade came to a standstill for several hours due to a computer panel at the Nasdaq exchange .	-5.4402
In addition , the last year of Facebook ’ s IPO caused a stir .	-5.3275

Konstanz : Radler is 63 years old	-3.2175
According to the police , the accident occurred when a 26 year-old man on Thursday evening , at around 22 o 'clock , was on the left foot of the railway station towards the market town .	-8.5217
When a 63 year-old man suddenly walked from a pub , the police said that the cyclist could not stop in time .	-6.6067

Assange has received an extradition certificate from the British police .	-6.0397
Today , the British police handed over a extradition document to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange , who sought refuge and asylum in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London .	-4.2478
Scotland Yard declared that a “ call to stand up ” was sent to 40-year-old Australians , urging him to appear in a police station , and added that if he fails to do so , he would be threatened with arrest .	-7.1232
Assange is threatening to extradite him to Sweden for the charge in a sex crime after his options have been exhausted under British law since the Supreme Court rejected his appeal to extradition earlier this month .	-5.7543
As he fears that Stockholm will extradite him to the US , on 19 June he had sought refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London and asked the South American country for political asylum .	-4.8393
Scotland Yard has “ sent a 40-year-old man a call to join a police force at a time we chose , ” said a spokesman .	-6.3808
He continues to violate the conditions of his release on bail .	-1.6613
The message did not comment on the delivery of the police request .	-3.3684

He received seven points and a six-month driving ban .	-2.2094
Howie has also been sentenced to $ 90 and a $ 100 victim surcharge .	-5.1348
Tax Foreign Property Owners Against London ’ s Speculative Bu	-2.6307
The Ministry of Finance has provisionally calculated the CGT measure , but is still waiting for the final decision of Chancellor George Osborne , who imposed a 7 % Stamp Tax in the 2012 budget on homes costing more than <unk> 2 million , and annual fees for buyers who hold homes as a company , not as individuals .	-7.3870
Already , income from the Stamp Tax for residential property in Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea , which was <unk> 708 million in the fiscal year 2012 / 13 , exceeds revenues for Northern Ireland , Wales , Scotland , the northeast , northwest , Yorkshire and the Humber region .	-6.8802
Cook said , “ After increases in the stamp tax on high-priced homes and the introduction of associated legislation against a bypass , it is hard to say that high-quality homes are taxed too low , regardless of the impact of the obsolete community tax system . ”	-7.4710
“ But this move could make some foreign investors more reluctant to buy property in London , or prevent owners from selling , ” he added .	-4.5746
First-class real estate – the top five to ten per cent of the price home market – in London ’ s wealthy southwest belt , stretching from Fulham to Wimbledon , has increased by a record 11.8 % last year .	-5.4349
Central London prices showed an even 5.6 % annual growth , but were overshadowed by an emerging “ domestic market , ” where the southwestern part of the city , the north ( 7.4 % ) , and the east ( 6.5 % ) experienced an upward trend , according to a study by Savills .	-5.0373
Scientists have been able to shed more light on the connection between a dog ’ s tail twisting and mood .	-5.2993
Earlier research had shown that happy dogs stroked to the right more ( from the point of view of the dog ) , while in nervous dogs it was the left side . was . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-8.7217
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive and respond to these subtle differences .	-2.5678
Professor Georgio Vallorgara , a neuroscientist at the University of Trento , said : “ People are well aware that the left and right halves of the brain respond differently to stimuli that cause positive or negative emotions . ”	-5.5050
Here we tried to look at this with other species .	-3.4520
He also noted that in dogs , just as in humans , the right half of the brain is responsible for the left side movement and vice versa , and that the two hemispheres played different roles in emotions .	-4.7468
In order to learn more about how dogs react to the lateral swallowing of their fellow species , researchers monitored the animals while watching the films of other dogs .	-6.6581
They measured the heart rate of the four-legged legs and analyzed the behavior . are . are . are . are , , , , , , , ,	-7.2001
We will probably soon understand why the tail is moving in one direction or another .	-4.2222
Professor Vallortgara said : “ We have shown dogs films – either a natural version or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects , and we have managed to control the movement of the tail more to the left or right . ”	-7.1143
When the animals saw how an otherwise expressive dog moved the tail to the right ( seen from the perspective of the weaning dog ) , they remained completely relaxed .	-4.6485
But if the tail was mainly left ( again from the perspective of the dog who weaves ) , their heart rate rose and they looked restless .	-6.5623
In the opinion of Professor Vallorgara , the dogs do not deliberately communicate with each other through these movements .	-6.9647
He is convinced that the dogs had learned from experience in which movements they should worry about and when not .	-5.0950
He said , “ If you have different encounters with other dogs , and if the tail is more associated with friendly behavior in one direction , and the right side produces a less friendly behavior , you respond on the basis of that experience . ”	-6.3223
The researchers say that the findings could help dog owners , veterinarians and trainers understand the emotions of their animals better .	-4.5755
John Bradshaw , an expert on dog behavior and gastric donation at the Faculty of Animal Health at the University of Bristol , explained that this was not the first study to examine whether left and right is important for dogs .	-5.7612
Last year , a team at the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their heads to the left when they see an aggressive dog , and to the right when it is a satisfied dog .	-4.7889
In another research at the University of Victoria in Canada , the following was : “ Dogs tend to go to a robotic dog when their tail <unk> is waving on the left , not on the right , rather than becoming restless – exactly the other way round than in the Italian study . ”	-7.3881
According to his statement , the differences may be due to the fact that the dogs in the various studies did not interpret the animals in the films or the robotic dogs as dogs .	-6.2424
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could help , he explained .	-2.0620
“ While there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two halves of the brain are used for different purposes , many of the details still need to be determined – and dogs are no exception , ” Bradshaw said .	-4.0832
As their behavior is easy to record , it will probably not take long for us to understand why the tail sometimes moves in one direction , sometimes in the other .	-5.6477

Pope Francis appoints First Cardinals in February	-1.1026
Pope Francis was appointed for the first time on 22 February , as the Vatican announced on Thursday .	-3.1561
Cardinals are the highest clerics in the Catholic Church after the Pope , and they are also the ones who elect a Pope , so that Francis will appoint the first group of men who will ultimately participate in the election of his successor .	-4.3934
There are currently 201 cardinals .	-1.1102
However , a cardinal who has reached an age of 80 can no longer participate in the Pope ’ s election – a group of 120 “ eligible cardinals . ”	-5.1022
In a statement announcing the news , Father Federico Lombardi , a Vatican spokesman , said that there will be a meeting of all the cardinals before the ceremony for the appointment of the new cardinals , which is also known as the Council .	-5.0962
“ Pope Francis has decided to announce in advance his decision to convene the Constitution in February so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from all over the world can be planned , ” Lombardi said .	-4.8483
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of eligible cardinals will probably have fallen by February .	-4.0666
He explained that a pope usually sown as many cardinals as necessary to allow the number of eligible cardinals to rise again to 120 , and as many cardinals over 80 as he would like .	-6.3361
The Council is important next year because it is the first since the election of Francis in March of this year , Valero says .	-5.3556
There is currently a certain overhang on the part of Europe and , in particular , Italy .	-3.6588
“ It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance , ” he said .	-2.3959
Forty per cent of Catholics live in South America , but they have only a tiny number of cardinals .	-2.0076
The Cardinals will also be the first to be called since the formation of the Council of the Cardinals , founded by Francis , a group of eight cardinals from all over the world who have the task of finding ways of reforming the Church .	-4.8193
In the past , the Pope chose everything alone .	-2.8470
“ Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him , ” Valero said .	-2.8303
He said that it was “ well possible ” for Francis to ask the Cardinals for advice .	-9.3745
But , so far , we have not been in this position – all of this is new .	-5.1111
Valero said that the bishops would typically be called cardinals from large places , but Francis “ filled with surprises – so we don ’ t know who he appoints . ”	-4.9818
GM Recalls New Pickup Trucks in the US	-1.7226
General Motors recall just under 19,000 of its brand new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra Pickup Trucks built in 2014 to fix a problem with the manually adjustable seat backrest , according to a Friday announcement from the US automotive safety regulator .	-5.9460
Some of the cars may have a defect in the mechanism for the front seat backrest .	-4.0841
For this reason , they do not comply with the Federal Safety Regulations for Headrests .	-4.0711
“ When driving from the rear onto the vehicle , it is possible that the headrest does not protect passengers properly , so there is an increased risk of injury , ” the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ( NHTSA ) website reported .	-6.9555
The recalled models were manufactured between 1 August and 10 September .	-3.2829
The GM-Trucks were delivered in June and represent the most important model start of the leading US car manufacturer since the insolvency restructuring in 2009 .	-6.7290
GM informed car owners about the defect in the first half of October .	-2.6155
The NHTSA was unable to check the notification letter due to the 16-day government shutdown , which had a negative impact on car sales in October .	-4.2250
The sale of Silverado and Sierra trucks , which were newly developed for the 2014 model year , increased by 20 % in the first ten months of the year , GM declared on Friday .	-5.1654

Desperate an Obama Voter	-1.9728
I have elected President Obama twice in the hope that change is possible .	-2.2008
He says that Obama has made commendable efforts that have been thwarted by the Republican blocking tactics .	-3.6933
Blockade Policy Don ’ t Apologize Obamacare ’ s Website Problems , Drone Attacks	-3.6696
Obama ’ s memoirs of the 2008 election campaign are a sad reminder of what might have been possible .	-2.4936
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second year student at Harvard Medical School .	-2.4606
I am reading a terribly sad book .	-2.6102
It is a book that I thought would brighten up during the deceptively second year of my medical studies and give me hope .	-5.8533
It is called “ The Audacity to Win ” and describes Barack Obama ’ s memoirs of the 2008 presidential election .	-3.1004
When I finish the evening with my patients ' writings and go to bed , the book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions and could take my breath away .	-8.4274
The election was a landslide victory , and news spokesmen held to reflect the historic significance of this hour .	-4.4816
My classmates wept with joy , and my parents collected all the newspapers that they could find .	-4.9289
A young team of visionaries was on the way to the White House and the nation was ready for change .	-1.8000
When Obama took office in 2008 , he had an approval rating of 82 % .	-2.9554
And then I close the book .	-1.3559
Switching back to the present is a bad awakening as if you were torn out of a dream .	-4.5891
It is hard to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague memory , a sad reminder of missed opportunities .	-2.5479
In the years since I first voted , something has actually changed .	-3.4161
But it is simply nothing I could have imagined .	-2.1230
I acknowledge the great and varied things Obama has achieved , from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for Health Insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq , the end of forced disappearances of homosexuality in the army , and the killing of Osama bin Laden .	-4.1959
I , too , believe that party political blocking tactics have overstepped efforts to bring our nation forward : immigration reform , a public health insurance option , and the closure of Guantanamo Bay , to name but a few .	-6.0512
But , having defended the Obama administration countless times against colleagues and acquaintances , I have come to the end of my attempts to explain .	-4.5226
I have reached a point of political despair .	-1.2306
Republican blockade policy cannot explain why foreign leaders are allowed to listen or the killing of innocent children by drones overseas .	-4.4780
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data about Americans ’ private lives , and why whistleblowers are punished for exposing government misconduct .	-3.2612
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki , an American citizen , was murdered without trial , nor why public funding and spending limits are being circumvented during the presidential election .	-3.3361
It does not justify the results of a report that says that the White House ’ s efforts to calm the media are the “ most aggressive ... since the Nixon administration . ”	-3.3752
And , more recently , it cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website in more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act .	-6.9859
I do not know if that is what I should have expected .	-1.8508
Whether I should have understood at the age of 18 that government work could contradict the previous political campaigns .	-4.4906
Obviously , the Office of Deputies is not a predictable course , as an opposition party and random events such as the Newtown-Massacre shape public debate .	-5.0070
But if I look at the above examples , they seem to be largely elected by the government itself .	-3.3595
And that bothers me most .	-2.5691
I re-elected Obama in 2012 , not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy .	-2.1263
Mitt Romney was a confusing and half-baked alternative that he seemed unable to determine his direction and positions .	-4.8177
I had the impression that a second term for Obama , free of pressure from future elections , would fulfil the hope that we have heard about for so long .	-3.8709
But , with Obama ’ s approval ratings down to below 45 % this week , the 2008 return through this book has become all the harder .	-4.3319
It awakens in me the yearning for the many promises that have broken up .	-4.3385
This week , I read a section in the book describing how Obama had to absorb a severe loss against Clinton in the primary elections in Pennsylvania .	-4.0603
In a meeting with the election workers after the decision , he told his staff that they would have to come back on track and follow the purpose of their cause .	-5.7722
" I want us to find our magic , " he said .	-2.7396
We must remember who we are .	-1.0555

Clive Palmer claims that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest on parental leave .	-2.5090
The billionaire and MEP Clive Palmer says that Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in a conflict of interest in his parental leave plans , because his daughters could become pregnant and thus benefit from it .	-4.3088
The mining tycoon , in a court dispute over the payment of $ 6 million in carbon taxes , made the claim when he wanted to clear questions about whether he was in conflict .	-5.8092
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate that are important for deciding whether CO2 and mining taxes will be cut or cut .	-4.1850
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and that Abbott ’ s daughters would personally benefit from the laws .	-2.9953
“ He is in a great conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave , because when one of his daughters becomes pregnant , he has a direct interest in whether or not she receives holiday , ” said Palmer .	-4.6415
Two months after the election , the Palmer Electoral Commission , with 53 votes in advance after the recount , officially declared the winner of the Sunshine Coast-seat of Fairfax .	-5.3446
Palmer called for a review of the process of counting votes to be carried out more quickly .	-4.1191
Tony Abbott 's daughters Frances and Bridget .	-2.2213
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of the vote ?	-1.7511
“ We need a better system , ” he said .	-1.0486
Why should we not have a system in which to march in , enter the data into a computer , vote immediately and then have the result at 6 : 30 in the evening ?	-5.7564
Palmer also criticized the use of pencils when marking the ballot papers .	-2.6523
Is it used because you can erase the results if you don 't like them ?	-3.5781
Coating with pencils today is incredible .	-4.2813
The Electoral Commission examined the options for an electronic election and recently published a joint legislative proposal with New Zealand .	-2.8397

RBS suspends Two Currency Dealers	-2.4947
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange department , such as two people who are familiar with the situation ; this is another indication that the worldwide regulatory investigation into the alleged manipulation of the currency market is gaining momentum .	-5.9746
Some of the world ’ s largest banks , including UBS , Barclays , Deutsche Bank , and RBS , have confirmed that they are cooperating with the authorities in investigations in the world ’ s largest financial market , where USD 5.3 trillion are exchanged daily .	-4.4773
The two traders would be the first RBS staff to be suspended in the widening investigation that led to the Libor Interbank scandal .	-4.2743
The Bank , which did not comment on the suspensions , confirmed this month that it received information requests from authorities .	-3.2430
“ Our investigation continues and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulatory authorities , ” said the Bank two weeks ago .	-3.8016
Last month , people close to the situation said that the RBS had forwarded the records of e-mails and instant messages sent by and to a former trader to the UK Financial Conduct Authority .	-4.9869
This trader , Richard Usher , had left RBS in 2010 and has since been judged by his current position as European head of the forex spot trading at JPMorgan .	-4.9738
Rohan Ramchandani , Head of European Spot Trading at Citi , was certified this week and Matt Gardiner , formerly Head of Currency Trader at Barclays and UBS , was suspended this week at Standard Chartered .	-4.5514
None of these traders were accused of misconduct .	-7.2572
Bankers at Barclays and Citigroup were part of the Usher instant message group , saying people close to the situation .	-3.7365
UBS announced this week that it took steps against some of its employees after the Swiss regulatory authority , Finma , had declared that it was investigating a suspected manipulation of the currency market in a number of Swiss banks .	-4.8526
At least six agencies worldwide – the European Commission , Finma , the Swiss competition authority Weko , the FCA , the US Department of Justice , and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently engaged in allegations that bankers should have agreed on transactions in the currency market .	-4.4287
HSBC , Citigroup , JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from authorities , said people familiar with the situation .	-3.4150
Banks comb instant messages and emails from several years in search of cases of misconduct .	-4.1675
The news of these investigations has roiled traders in an area that has been one of the most profitable trading units in investment banks in recent years , but this year was under pressure , because low currency volatility limits opportunities for speculators .	-5.5864
Some bankers have tried to downplay the affair , saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast and highly liquid Forex market , but leading traders believe that this is not necessarily true .	-3.9176
A leading trader noted that , despite the huge daily volume of foreign exchange trading , the fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use by banks of their own internal platforms mean that “ you can influence the market with very low ticket prices . ”	-5.5313
The news came out on the same day that Credit Suisse announced that it had cancelled a dealer of its London Exchange Traded Funds office this week after causing a loss of nearly $ 6 million at the end of last year .	-5.0450
The Bank promptly informed the relevant authorities and works with them .	-2.5805
“ We are sure that the trader has acted alone and that the matter has been contained , ” said Credit Suisse .	-3.6279
Painted the fence on the Bechtle Land	-4.0113
A group of the citizens ' initiative " Schweizer Wiese " beautified the Bauzaun on the Bechtle site on the spa promenade in Bad Herrenalb .	-4.9278
She also cleaned up and widened the footpath , says in a press release .	-4.5068
The planned cover of the crumbling house at the back of the plot was not allowed for safety reasons , because the terrain is in danger of slipping .	-6.2793
Alfred Abel , who currently manages the plot , had agreed the beautification action with his colleague Reinhard Domke from the BI .	-4.1419
Before the action of the BI , a banner with the message " We are in favour " had been affixed .	-4.5092
However , that did little to disturb the 20 or so members of the citizens ' initiative in their actions .	-4.7001
Her motto on the big poster was " We are against building ruins " .	-4.1375
In doing so , she wanted to point out the danger of even larger ruins on the Swiss meadow - the giant project should one day fail .	-6.4783
In talks with many passers-by before the " construction site " it became clear that some citizens believe that the realization of the project of the city will be better for many , although not a few have the same questions to the dimension of the presented project as the BI .	-5.3214
But they are starting to resignize , because the city is further delaying these responses , it is said by the BI .	-5.6053
As we heard , the Mayor ’ s public statements also have an impact .	-4.5650
May had said at the municipal council meeting that he feared the loss of the thermal bath if the people were to vote against the plans for a bathing and wellness complex on the Swiss meadow during the referendum .	-7.0797
Some of them seem scared , others find them " crude blackmail " on the population , says the BI press release .	-7.4347
The BI thanked the donor for the color and all the helpers .	-2.5163
Rangnick Shelte for Shiris : Mane no Gaul King .	-4.2738
However satisfied Ralf Rangnick with the current high form of Bundesliga table leader Red Bull Salzburg , the sports director of the " Bulls " was disappointed by the referee .	-5.4290
" There is currently a dangerous tendency for Mane and Alan to be pushed into the category of Swabian kings , " he defended the two offensive players at a press conference in Salzburg on Thursday .	-5.7507
The latest reason for Rangnick ’ s critique was Yellow for Mane at 3 : 0 against Grödig last Sunday , where the Senegalese became a casualty of an alleged acting show - which , of course , was not , as the TV pictures showed .	-8.3227
" A gross wrong decision , " Rangnick said , the referee called Harkam " completely overstretched " .	-6.2645
Harkam also contributed " his part " to the escalation between Salzburg-Coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig-Trainer Adi Hütter after the match .	-3.2727
He strongly defended his German fellow countryman : ' I would have behaved the same way in every single situation as Roger Schmidt ' .	-4.6336
Schmidt himself does not want to have had contact with his colleague after the skirmishing .	-3.9018
I do not know why .	-1.0697
" For I am the one who was insulted , " said the 46-year-old .	-3.1505
However , in view of the success , Rangnick approved a song of praise .	-5.2162
" There are only two words for this : good , " he noted .	-4.6475
There is not much wrong .	-2.6528
Especially the way the team plays is impressive .	-1.9851
Let this continue .	-2.8287
There will hardly be any cadastral changes during the winter transit .	-4.9377
There are no great reasons to change something .	-2.0687
" In addition to a player , Rangnick made it clear that he wanted to leave the club .	-6.0623
Supreme Court Confirmed Obama ’ s Health Act	-3.3211
It is a big victory for the Obama administration : the US Supreme Court today ruled that the health law closely linked to Barack Obama is constitutional .	-3.9034
With five to four votes , the judges judged that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ’ s single mandate – forcing US citizens to take out health insurance or pay a penalty by 2014 – is constitutional under the government ’ s tax authority .	-5.1286
The Supreme Judge John Roberts sided with the four more liberal members of the Chamber , while the judges Scalia , Thomas , Alito , and Kennedy decided against it .	-4.3013
The Court also upheld the remaining sections of the 2700 pages of law , and also argued that the health law ’ s requirement that states should either expand access requirements for Medicaid or otherwise delete all state Medicaid subsidies was not unconstitutional .	-6.8438
The lawsuit against the law had been filed by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business .	-2.3854
The law had been decisively rejected by all leading Republican presidential candidates , including the eventual challenger , Mitt Romney , in the 2012 pre-election campaign .	-3.3037
Norway ’ s Big Mirror of Light	-2.3660
With huge mirrors , the inhabitants of a Norwegian village brought light to their gloomy valley .	-3.5271
Due to the low level of sunshine , the Rjukan , situated in the Vestfjord valley , is normally submerged in the shadows of the surrounding mountains from autumn to spring .	-5.8892
With three gigantic reflectors at an altitude of 45 metres , a space of the century was realised on Wednesday .	-5.6240
" Finally ! " , mayor Steinar Bergsland festered at the start ceremony in the channel TV2 .	-4.7096
Some people in the valley used sun chairs , while others used sunglasses for safety .	-6.3633
So far , sun-worshippers had to take a cable car to a nearby summit in winter .	-4.4575
Ten years ago , local artist Martin Andersen presented the proposal to steer the rays into the valley with mirrors .	-3.9603
This basic idea has existed in the village since 1913 .	-4.1365
After several years of debate , the City Council finally approved the project of 5 million kroner ( around 615 000 euros ) .	-5.3303
A similar construction has given the Italian Alpine village Viganella winter sunshine for a few years .	-7.4089
Post Leets Hardly On Sunday	-6.3311
" Many citizens will not have noticed , the red dots for Sunday leaching are still on various postboxes in the city centre and the districts , but if you read the small print on the yellow boxes of the Post AG , you quickly find out that there is no longer a vacancy on Sundays and holidays , " the FDP informs .	-9.5816
A request from the FDP confirmed this .	-1.8352
On Sundays and public holidays only before the post office building is emptied in Ernst-Ludwig-Stra<unk>e 36 and in Jakob-Müller-Stra<unk>e 1 in Hüttenfeld .	-4.0335
Whether it will be emptied in Hofheim and Rosengarten on Sunday will not be answered in the answer to the FDP question .	-4.9006
The Socialist and Youth Speaker of the FDP , Fritz Röhrenbeck , wants to follow suit here .	-5.0060
Sunday leaching is an important postal service especially in the case of an appointment post .	-6.7136
" Despite the increase in the price of letters in January 2013 , this undertaking is radically and unacceptably diluting " .	-5.4839
Thomas Bittner , leader of the Liberal Group and the City Council , supports his group colleagues : ' What annoys me is the fact that the time spent here is secretly changed or even deleted ' .	-6.7580
The post office is far from being close to the citizens .	-4.7577
" At least the postboxes in the districts of Neuschlo<unk> and Rosengarten need to be emptied again on Sundays , " said Bittner and Röhrenbeck unisono .	-4.0380
Even for the city centre , especially non-mobile citizens would have to be able to reach a post box with Sunday lights within walking distance .	-7.0764
Röhrenbeck asked the town parliament whether the city administration is planning talks with the post office on this matter .	-5.4390
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the post did not communicate with Lammerheim .	-2.6413
In Hofheim , however , his knowledge is also on Sunday .	-5.6947
Your party has called for privatisation .	-3.1035
" Then decisions are taken elsewhere , " Maier said .	-2.1302
Frankfurt ’ s parking fees are to rise sharply .	-4.8390
The room was a bit small and the is .	-8.1070
This morning , the City Council will be discussing the presentation of the transport company Stefan Majer ( Green ) .	-6.4718
This means that parking fees will be increased by 50 percent .	-4.3021
Instead of raising prices , the time interval of parking watches and parking ticket machines should be reduced from 30 minutes to 20 minutes .	-5.2605
In December , the municipal assembly will have to decide .	-3.8461
The retail committee of the IHK Frankfurt considers this " not a good idea " .	-3.0882
The room was clean and comfortable .	-6.3348
The German Transport Club believes that an increase after two decades is ' quite reasonable and , in fact , long overdue ' .	-4.1729
Public transport also becomes more expensive .	-2.0734
The City of Happiness : Overhyping the Host ’ s Fast	-6.5406
The men I of the TSV Freudenstadt had to compete against the TG Gönningen from the Swabian Alb with a narrow cadres in the Schiller-Schulturnhalle in Reutlingen .	-4.5870
Although the elders had an experienced team on the other side of the net .	-4.2050
Soon , however , it became apparent that they were not able to keep up with the fast actions of the Freudenstadt , also due to their age .	-13.1755
With the hard and bursting blows , the patrons were extremely hard .	-7.3176
On several occasions , they missed the passports and attacks that Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz neatly played over the middle of the grid and were not in place when they were against the block .	-9.1637
Two high first sentence wins clearly expressed the superiority of the Freudenstädter in all matters .	-6.0472
In view of this suffocating and game-determining performance , the third set was somewhat lax and lustless at the 3 : 0 final ( 25 : 13 , 25 : 14 , 25 : 22 ) .	-7.4775
On 2 November , TV Baiersbronn , which was able to make its way through Nagold , will be a much more powerful opponent in the field .	-7.0711
TSV Freudenstadt I : Dominik Bäuerle , Yannik Büchle , Sebastian Dölker , Felix Pälchen , Stefan Rüller , Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz .	-1.8507
In the B-class , the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt stood in front of the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn .	-4.1426
They made a hard-fought 2-hour match .	-3.6644
Nerviousness on both sides caused mistakes and points ; precision was sometimes lacking in passports , and in some critical game scenes the overseer prevented a view of possible spot wins .	-10.2251
During this highly balanced meeting , the TSV team of Marcus Blasutto consistently agreed on the great physical effort and the positive commitment of both teams .	-7.3569
Nursing Day at the Small Engländerhütte	-4.5237
For the fifth maintenance day following the Natura 2000 project at the top of the Hotzenwald , a group of dedicated participants met at the small Engländerhütte in Ibach .	-6.4107
Due to suggestions from the population should be released on this day in the area of the hut 's view to the valley , said Mayor Helmut Kaiser .	-4.6335
Many hikers described this area as the jewel of the Schluchtensteig , on which the landscape offers the ideal setting for magnificent views .	-6.4807
He thanked those present for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the day of care is an appropriate instrument for strengthening the connection between man and nature .	-5.3609
It offers every citizen the opportunity to set a course in nature itself .	-5.2554
At the same time , environmental considerations can also be taken into account with regard to tourism .	-4.9445
This ecological aspect was explained by Friederike Triukait of the Department of Conservation of the Regional Government of Freiburg following the welcome of the Landrat Tilman Bollacher , who had taken over the patronage and wished the action to be successful .	-7.5357
According to Triukait , the tourist goal of the forward view is to preserve the old allmendweidfeld , which has grown considerably since then , with its specific protected habitats , by opening and connecting to the remaining pastures .	-8.2613
Certain species , such as rare butterflies and grasshoppers , cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest areas .	-2.5700
You need these free connections to keep your eye on the eye free .	-5.8796
Triukait said she would not miss the opportunity to break a lance for the planned biosphere .	-5.2606
The current measure does not only integrate seamlessly into this planning .	-3.6440
A Biosphere Area also offers an opportunity for sustainable economic and ecological development on the basis of the internationally recognised Unesco status and thus a continuous addition to the achievements achieved with the Life Project and the previous nursing days for the future .	-6.7613
After these various presentations , refectors Christoph Wehle and life project manager Cornelia Bischoff divided the helpers into groups .	-6.2223
The larger trees had already been beaten in the run-up , the forestry tractor could be called up .	-6.6379
A group of helpers should take care of the removal of juniper bushes and the maintenance of a dry stone bar .	-4.3762
The aim was to have a free view at the vantage point .	-4.2559
Löffingen : Köhler still Only Candidate	-4.4489
Information on the Internet : Although the Baarstadt Löffingen , with its 7514 inhabitants , an intact infrastructure , a forward-looking school , children 's , youth and senior citizens policy , as well as its own urban structures , can be described as an attractive city , no second mayor candidate has yet registered .	-6.4431
The only candidate to succeed Norbert Brugger , who is no longer a candidate for old age , is currently the 46-year-old bank clerk and business manager Dieter Köfler from Löffingen .	-7.4967
The application deadline expires on Monday , November 11 , at 6 p.m.	-3.2398
Google , Samsung , Huawei sued for Nord patents	-2.3717
On Thursday , the group , which owns thousands of previous Nord patents , launched an avalanche of claims for patent infringement against mobile phone manufacturers , including Google , the company that was outbid by Northel in the insolvency auction .	-6.6390
Rockstar , the consortium that had bought the Norton patents for $ 4.5 billion , sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd , HTC Corp , Huawei , and four other companies for patent infringement at the US Patent Court in Texas .	-3.4754
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple , Microsoft , BlackBerry , Ericsson and Sony .	-1.8611
Google is accused of patent infringement in seven cases .	-1.2114
Patents affect technology that matches search terms on the Internet with relevant advertising , so the lawsuit that goes to the heart of Google ’ s search engine business .	-5.3434
Representatives of Samsung , Huawei , HTC and Rockstar were not directly available .	-2.4785
Samsung , Huawei and HTC are making mobile phones that work with Google ’ s operating system Android , which is in sharp competition with Apple and Microsoft ’ s mobile products .	-4.2961
In 2011 , Google offered an initial bid of over $ 900 million for the north patents .	-3.5400
Google increased its offer several times and last offered $ 4.4 billion .	-2.6617
After being outbid by Rockstar ’ s northern patents , Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $ 12.5 billion , a deal that was also motivated by some of Motorola ’ s library ’ s patents .	-5.5681
“ Although Google has failed in its attempt to acquire the right of action at the auction , Google has violated the patents and continues to do so , ” the jury said .	-6.3125
Rockstar claims that Google 's patent infringement is intentional , he claims .	-4.1054
sworn in Egypt ’ s First freely elected President	-6.2646
Mohamed Morsi abdicates power , but his day of triumph is unlikely to mark the end of Egypt ’ s political disputes .	-4.2759
Islamicist Mohamed Morsi promised a “ new Egypt , ” when he was sworn as the country ’ s first freely elected president , and thus succeeded Hosni Mubarak , who had been expelled from office 16 months earlier .	-4.0459
With his inauguration to the Supreme Constitutional Court , Morsi became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and Egypt ’ s fifth head of state since the fall of the monarchy some 60 years ago .	-3.4275
He placed the oath before the 18 judges of the court , dressed in black robes , with his seat on the Nile , modelled on an ancient Egyptian temple .	-4.9952
“ We strive for a better future , a new Egypt and a second republic , ” Morsi said at the solemn ceremony broadcast live on state television .	-3.6593
“ Today , the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom , a true democracy and stability , ” said the 60-year-old Morsi , an US-trained engineer and member of the Muslim Brotherhood , a fundamentalist group that , since its creation 84 years ago , had been targeted by the government in particular as a banned organization .	-6.6089
Hundreds of soldiers and police were guarding the building when Morsi arrived in a small autoconvoi shortly after 11 o 'clock in local time .	-7.5584
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered in the court to cheer the new president , and , unlike Mubarak ’ s presidential fief , transport was only temporarily stopped so that the autoconvoi could cross the usually busy road connecting the city centre to the southern suburbs .	-5.6799
Assured as an uncharismatic “ replacement wheel ” by the Brotherhood , his personal prestige has increased since his victory and a Friday speech , presenting himself not only as a candidate for Islamists , but also as a candidate for all those who wanted to target the 2011 uprising against authoritarian Mubarak .	-6.9874
“ Egypt is now a civilian , national , constitutional , and modern state , ” Morsi , dressed in a blue suit with red tie , declared to judges in the wood-panelled chamber in which he took office .	-4.6865
Later , Morsi drove to Cairo University , where he was supposed to make his inaugural address .	-5.6075
He was officially welcomed by an army coupe who played the national anthem , which he listened to in Habachtstelle .	-7.3681
The military leader , Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi , was present .	-2.5608
On his arrival , he was greeted by hundreds of people present in the largest lecture hall of the university with spokespersons from “ The Army and the People are a Hand ” .	-6.0823
Built in 1908 as a bastion of secular education , the University of Cairo developed into a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s .	-2.8288
Morsi issued a symbolic oath in Tahir Square on Friday , the birthplace of the insurrection that ended Mubarak ’ s authoritarian rule last year , and vowed to reclaim presidential powers that the military council had assumed from the ousted leader .	-4.9168
But , by submitting the official oath to the court , not as usual before Parliament , he is bowing to the will of the military , indicating that the power struggle will continue .	-5.7792
Morsi ’ s speech in Tahir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures .	-1.6985

Rapes in South Africa : twice life imprisonment	-3.1096
Nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa , the perpetrator was sentenced on Friday to two life sentences .	-2.8358
The transmitter SABC reported this .	-2.3384
The victim had died later as a result of serious injuries .	-3.2071
Johannes Kana was found guilty at the beginning of the week of the crime .	-2.2748
The act had caused horror across the country .	-4.0139
The then 21-year-old had raped Anene Booysen in February at an industrial site in Bredadorp near Cape Town .	-4.0044
The doctors fought for the victim 's survival for 14 hours , but in vain .	-2.6138
The sight of the young people was so appalling that carers and nurses needed psychological assistance .	-6.0641
Kana admitted during the trial that he had been in a bar during the night with boosters .	-5.0047
He also confess to having beaten and raped them , but he refused to be responsible for the death of the girl .	-4.0598
The police had initially run from several perpetrators , but left two suspects out of detention because the evidence against them was insufficient .	-4.7063
The prosecution also stressed during the trial that she was convinced that Kana was alone at the time of the attack .	-3.2997
Rape is almost a part of everyday life in South Africa : there are about 64 000 ads every year for sexual violence .	-5.6199
This is almost ten times as much as in Germany , but with 82 million people it has far more inhabitants than South Africa ( 50 million ) .	-4.0963
Police and women ’ s associations in South Africa estimate the incidence of sexual violence to be 10-25 times higher .	-7.3535
Jumbo Visit the Black Forest Ham	-3.1019
Jumbo in search of the " best hams of the world " : For the TV broadcast " Galileo " visited the Pro7-Star Bonndorf .	-4.5443

Can ham be a quality product in any supermarket ?	-4.1289
As head of the large ham factory in the Black Forest , Jumbo explains how the company " Adler " works in Bonndorf .	-4.0194
" Germany 's most sweet ham " , as Jumbo announces the Black Forest ham .	-4.5941

Most pigs are slaughtered at six months .	-1.6573
TV with a level ?	-3.0752
Also details such as the Ph value of the meat play a role .	-2.8272
The darker the meat , the higher the ph-value .	-1.9471
" I am curious when you tell Roberto Blanco what happens then , " Jumbo cynically says .	-4.5892
Here the level of private television is presented in pure culture .	-3.2064
But watching is worth it anyway .	-3.0926
The viewer sees that the disfiguring of the clubs is still manual .	-5.8960
After all , it is traditional to find ham without bones on the shelf .	-5.6206
The secret of ham is the spice mix with salt .	-2.5504
The smoke tower and smoke fireplace remind Jumbo of a " submarine " .	-3.6961
The trick : Tannzweige provide the special taste of the Black Forest ham in the smoke .	-5.7619
20 days in smoke make the ham finally almost black .	-2.5305
" Now the disc disappears in the Jumbo " , he announces the test authentication .	-3.5379
" The is really delicious " , so the conclusion of the TV star .	-4.6040
This will enable all parties involved to live with it .	-3.8958
You thought travel agencies belong to the past thanks to the Internet ?	-2.4531
Flight Centre seems to be resisting the trend .	-1.8973
The company has increased its profit prospects for the whole year and expects record revenues from Australian and UK holidaymakers .	-5.1811
The airline now expects an adjusted annual profit before taxes between $ 325 and $ 340 million , compared to $ 305 million in its earlier forecast .	-9.2235
If the current targets are met , this will mean growth of 12 to 17 % compared to the record profit of $ 290.4 million in the period 2011 / 12 .	-5.8788
As CEO Graham Turner announced , Flight Centre achieved eight per cent profit in the first half of the year and made a strong start to the second half of the year , especially in Australian and British private business .	-5.5794
“ Our ten countries have been profitable since the beginning of the year , and some of them are well on their way to record revenue before interest and taxes , ” he said .	-4.4150
These include Australia and the UK , which are typically among our strongest winners .	-2.9758
In Australia , the leisure industry recovered in the second half of the year , providing a slightly weaker market for business travel .	-3.8295
It was similarly good for the leisure business of Flight Centre in the UK , while business customers were also spending less .	-6.7085
The US business recovered from the seasonally weaker first half of the year , so the third consecutive year is expected to see a profit for the full year .	-6.1217
The shares of Flight Centre rose yesterday by 3 cents to 38.20 dollars .	-2.7588
Schools are being encouraged to focus more on mathematics , spelling , and grammar .	-3.3073
In courses on English literature , students will have to deal with at least one piece of Shakespeare , a 19th century novel , romantic poetry , and contemporary British novels from 1914 .	-7.0406
The examination also includes “ unread texts ” to encourage broader reading .	-6.3600
The combined course of English literature and language will be abolished .	-2.5090
From 2015 , students will have to pass an independent GCSE exam for language , with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification .	-4.6303
Tomorrow , the Ministry of Education will publish the new English and math curricula – the first subjects that have been radically redesigned .	-4.5953
Other core subjects will be changed next year .	-2.7099
In a separate initiative , Ofqual , the supervisory authority for audits , will announce a reorganization of the GCSE structures , including a new system of use and less course work .	-5.2000
In a summer speech , Education Minister Michael Gove said that there is a “ broad consensus that we need to reform our audit system to restore public confidence , ” emphasizing that the GCSEs would become “ more challenging , ambitious , and rigorous . ”	-4.4559
Studies show that less time is spent on mathematics in English schools – 116 hours a year , or three hours a week per school year – than in most other countries .	-3.5226
By contrast , Australian schools teach an average of 143 hours a year and students in Singapore receive 138 hours .	-4.1366
While there will be no formal requirement to spend more time on mathematics in the timetable , coalition circles say that comprehensive math testing – combined with a stronger ranking – will probably encourage schools to spend more hours .	-5.9752
The curriculum focuses more on “ problems from the right life , ” including financial mathematics .	-3.4038

Salem : Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical Call Forum	-2.1015
At the next Ecumenical Call Forum on Monday , October 21 , at the New Museum of the Castle , the theme is " The Hell with Hell - Theological Reasons on Today 's Dealing with the Last Things " .	-7.4019
She is Professor Johanna Rahner .	-2.4280
The Ecumenical Dialogue Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Protestant church communities of Salem , Salem Castle and the Kulturamt Bodenseekreis .	-4.2610
Johanna Rahner wants to examine the question in the forum of how people now classify the " last things " after death .	-6.0254
If people had known too much of this over the past centuries , relying on the images of heaven and hell that " have shaped our ideas to this day , " contemporary prophetic teaching draws from the hopes of completion rather than a certain embarrassment or even a lack of language .	-8.5984
" Greater hope has been thoroughly exploited by the criticism of religion by Christians " , says the speaker .	-6.0225
She " provided us with so many question marks that the exclamation marks seem to have disappeared " .	-4.0821
Johanna Rahner goes on to say : " But the decisive challenge remains the annoyance of death .	-8.6043
This is linked to the question of the longing " which dreams of everything being good in the end " .	-5.6518
Johanna Rahner , born in Baden-Baden in 1962 , studied Catholic theology and biology from 1982 to 1989 at the Albert Ludwigs University Freiburg .	-2.5832
She received her doctorate in 1997 to Dr. theol .	-2.9015
The Habilitation of Fundamental Theology and Ecumenical Theology followed in 2003 at the Westphalian Wilhelms-University .	-3.8238
Since 2010 , Johanna Rahner has held a chair of Systematic Theology at the Institute of Catholic Theology at the University of Kassel .	-3.0902
Geislingen : More than 100 young Catholics from Kleine Heuberg reaffirm their creed in the firm .	-4.1831
In two religious services 101 15- and 16-year-old young people have been taken care of by The Kleine Heuberg .	-7.1291
The service was accompanied by the Laudato-Si group in the morning , in the afternoon the Youth Choir The Spirit .	-4.5914
With the reception of the company sacrament , the young people said yes to their baptism and inherited the power of the Holy Spirit .	-4.4744
Over the past few months , the company had prepared itself for the big day under the direction of Diakon Reiner Dehner and with the help of many community members .	-6.5433
In different projects , they met various tasks of Christian community life and shared the Youth Day in Lower Power .	-6.5389
Lake Illmensee : second mountain bike race enthuses participants .	-3.4959
In beautiful weather , 214 cyclists came to Illmensee to complete the circuit over the hills around the lake .	-5.5604
Ulrich Knogel from the sports club Illmensee .	-5.3471
Among the participants , especially on the short distance over 15 kilometres and 300 metres of altitude , were also numerous Jedermannsradler , who wanted to practise their hobby once in a competitive atmosphere .	-6.7044
Two top German junior drivers were also at the start of this competition : Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came with the recommendation for good rankings at the German Championships .	-6.0023
As expected , these two were able to leave the field .	-4.7688
As in the previous year , Felix Bader was able to save a small advance in time and defended his title as the overall winner of the short distance .	-4.6436
Pascal Treubel was once again in second place .	-4.2399
For the ladies it was Theresa Duelli of Team Nightmare who made it to the top of the podium .	-5.1301
Anne Adel from Illmensee and Leonie driver from Owingen came on place two and three .	-3.7863
An encouraging development is the increasing number of drivers who live or work in the community .	-3.5680
Not only in terms of performance , the whole range of athletes was represented .	-3.6473
The age structure also ranged from ten years for the youngest to more than 70 years for the oldest starters .	-5.3328
More top athletes were on the start this year in the main runner .	-5.3074
Four drivers were able to distinguish themselves from the top regional drivers .	-3.9946
Among them Philipp Pangerl , a mountain bike semi-professional from the Black-Tusk-Racing-Team .	-3.6956
Pangerl , together with a team mate , has twice been World Champion in 12-hour races .	-5.6010
This year he became the European champion in this special discipline .	-7.8756
Roland Ballerstedt , who already owns two German championship titles in the Duathlon .	-4.0336
After 45 kilometres and 900 metres of altitude , a victory at the finish line in front of the three lakes hall was reached .	-6.6546
Pangerl was the first to cross the finish line .	-2.3409
Only one second behind it , the Routine Ballerstedt secured second place in the overall standings .	-5.6478
At the same time Hermann and Warthmann came to the finish as a third of the overall ranking .	-4.7896
In the ladies ’ ranking , Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest time in the main runner .	-4.4198
Areane Blersch from Binverforced took second place in front of Natascha Werner from Stuttgart .	-4.2157
Athletes and helpers were very pleased with the smooth and well organized course of the event .	-3.8342
On the way through mud , rivers and jungles for free medical care	-7.4658
Dr Georges Bwelle provides free medical aid to remote villages in Cameroon	-3.5713
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend treating hundreds of patients .	-2.1471
There are not many doctors in West Africa , only one for 5,000 people .	-2.6871
Vote here or with your mobile device .	-2.0388
Dr. Georges Bwelle is among the top 10 of the “ CNN Heroes of 2013 ” .	-3.8455
You can vote for him or one of the other heroes in the Top 10 to vote for CNN Hero of the Year .	-3.4958
The winner receives $ 250,000 to continue his extraordinary work .	-2.3804
For 21 years , Georges Bwave saw his sick father repeatedly lose consciousness and traveled to hospitals that did not have the means to help him .	-5.2526
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near Yaoundé , the capital of Cameroon in 1981 .	-3.6601
At first he had only one broken arm , but then an inflammation spread to his brain , causing a hematoma that would affect him for the rest of his life .	-5.3248
“ There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon , ” according to Georges Bwave .	-5.4560
We would have brought it out of Cameroon if we had had the money .	-2.3381
Instead , he spent years accompanying his father in overcrowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer .	-4.0051
“ It is not easy ” , comments Bwave .	-3.7318
You can leave the house at five in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first , and is not the first .	-4.1895
There are many patients .	-1.4953
Some people even die because they have to wait .	-1.5404
The situation has hardly changed since Bwell ’ s father died in 2002 .	-2.3363
In Cameroon , there is only one doctor per 5,000 people , according to the World Health Organization .	-2.2349
On the other hand , the relationship in the United States is with a doctor for 413 people .	-3.2369
But even if there was a doctor for them , most of the Cameroonians could not afford to visit .	-4.5595
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line , and almost three-quarters of health spending in the country is private .	-3.2524
“ The only problem they have is poverty , ” says Bwelle .	-3.0130
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life .	-1.1656
His father and so many of his fellow countrymen suffered in Bwelle and decided to do something about it .	-4.9389
Last year , Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team carried out 700 free operations .	-7.4746
He became a doctor himself and works as a vascular surgeon at Central Hospital in Yaoundé .	-3.0644
He also founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME , which travels to rural areas on weekends and offers free medical care .	-4.0366
Since 2008 , he and his voluntary group have helped nearly 32,000 people .	-7.2387
Almost every Friday he and up to 30 people are forced into minibuses and use the snow covered medical equipment on the roof over unpaved terrain to the villages that need help .	-6.0986
It is not always smooth .	-2.2685
More than once they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud .	-2.6198
But when they arrive , they will be welcomed like heroes : a feast , singing and dance , and the best accommodation the place has to offer .	-4.4150
In these villages , free medical care is really a reason for celebration and a boon – with its broad smile and boundless energy – is happy to attend the happy celebration .	-9.5074
The next morning , the team starts investigating hundreds of patients .	-2.8612
“ We treat 500 people per ride , ” says Bwelle .	-4.2064
They are within 60 kilometres of the village – and on foot .	-4.5558
Each of these weekend clinics provides medical care in a number of areas .	-4.6889
Many people are treated for malaria , tuberculosis , malnutrition , diabetes , parasites , and sexually transmitted diseases .	-1.3000
Others receive crutches , donated glasses , or free birth certificates – a document that is needed for school , but that many poor families simply cannot afford .	-3.9442
In the evening , the team performs simple operations with local anesthesia .	-2.7679
The operations usually take place in a school , the town hall or an apartment ; after the operation the patients stand up and go to the recreation area to make room for the next .	-5.9722
The lighting for the operation and disinfectant equipment is supplied by the group generator and so the bonfire and its volunteers work until the early hours of the morning on Sunday .	-6.7852
It is an exhausting pensum , but village musicians usually help keep the team motivated .	-8.9552
“ They are drumming all night so that we can remain awake and continue our work , ” says Bwelle .	-5.3576
On Sunday the team returns to the city , tired but proud of the work done .	-3.2896
The group – a mix of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students – carried out 700 free operations last year and knows that their work makes a huge difference for the people they help .	-5.0165
A man explained that the free operation of a breach of service he received now enables him to work again .	-4.4949
“ This changes the future of my family , ” the man said .	-2.7877
Besides the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital , Bwelle also works at night in private clinics in Yaoundé .	-3.7409
With this second job , he financed 60 % of his charitable activities , according to Bwelle ; the rest come from private donations .	-5.4387
“ I really don ’ t know when he sleeps , ” says Katie O ’ Malley , who studied medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia in the second year and is working voluntarily in Bwelles Group .	-5.2958
He is always in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so that he can go to these campaigns .	-6.0603
For medical and nursing students like O 'Malley , who come from the US and Europe and support Bwelle , this is an opportunity to gain practical experience that they would never get at home .	-4.7580
“ We can be involved in operations where we help to drain blood or keep the instruments for Dr. Bwelle , ” says O 'Malley .	-5.9987
This would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year .	-2.6192
Students usually pay for their trip to Cameroon and bring often donated sanitation material .	-4.8749
But once they are in Yaoundé , Bwelle takes care of the accommodation , the transport and the instruction .	-5.9182
" He is undoubtedly a hero , " says O 'Malley .	-2.6045
He dedicates his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroonian people knows no boundaries .	-3.2067
Almost constant work is not a burden for Bwelle .	-4.5068
Helping others to live happier lives , and thus fulfilling a promise he made to his father , gives him great pleasure .	-5.2917
“ I am so happy to do this work , ” says Bwelle .	-4.1410
And I think of my father .	-1.2092
I hope he will see what I do .	-1.5919
I do it to make people laugh again and to relieve the pain .	-2.1747

Winning the Battle	-2.8402
The role of Santiago , the old man in Hemingway 's novel " The Old Man and the Sea " , is cut to the body by Horst Janson .	-3.2760
Janson himself is an old hare in his profession , acting .	-4.2036
The old man Santiago cannot fool anyone with fishing .	-4.8783
So they complement each other perfectly .	-4.6686
It is almost thought that the folds of the old man 's neck , of which the fisherman 's boy Manolo speaks , can be seen .	-6.3240
When Santiago sits tired of life bent on the chair , that is true with Janson .	-5.0045
In addition , the role of the old fisherman is through and through a character role that Janson performs excellently .	-5.1843
Hemingway told the story of a fighter , a courageous man who does not give up and ultimately wins the fight against the fish through his knowledge and his will .	-4.6956
Janson is the sole actor on stage .	-4.3072
He manages to focus the audience ’ s attention on himself , so his monologues are not boring for a moment .	-3.5491
His efforts to finally bring the fish to the surface of the water are so real that the spectators forget that the sea is only made up of blue water bottles .	-5.3909
Director Jens Hasselmann lets the old man act in the boat in front of the fishing village .	-2.2033
In the course of the performance , he highlights the active scene : the Santiago hut , the bar of singer Marie-Luise Gunst , who , with her songs and her magnificent voice , captures Cuba ’ s feeling of life .	-10.8136
The four musicians play Cuba ’ s rhythm and are also guests of the bar .	-3.3149
Tourism : Down to the Romans	-1.7433
At about 120 metres in length , a sewage channel from the Roman era is preserved below Cologne .	-5.4337
Those who visit Cologne don 't miss the cathedral .	-4.3826
The two towers rise into the sky about 157 meters and make it the second highest church building in Europe .	-4.6078
But few visitors who admire the two filigree church towers suggest that there is a lot to discover under the cathedral .	-5.7342
Rainer Schulze is an expert in the subjects of Cologne .	-3.6397
The meeting point for his tours is the Service-Center of Köln-Tourism directly at the Dom .	-4.9399
The tour starts quite unspectacular : " We start in the underground garage " , says Schulze .	-3.9880
In the 1970s , the city 's fathers wanted a city in tune with the people , and that is why the remains of the old city wall remained only that which was not too big .	-9.0230
Most of the park ’ s users now run past the Roman remains and just leave their car .	-7.8326
However , if you look more closely , a separate archaeological site is discovered in the parking deck D2 .	-5.8990
You can see about five meters high ruins of stone .	-6.0623
" These are the remains of the Roman city wall , built in the second half of the first century BC , " says Schulze .	-4.2529
Before it goes back to daylight , Schulze lets participants take a look at a dark 15 meter deep pit at the upper level .	-5.6207
This is the well of the old cathedral , which unfortunately is hardly noticed .	-3.7219
Next station of the circuit is the Prätorium , and here the participants go down again to the depth .	-6.1018
Here we experience the seat of the once most powerful man north of the Alps , the governor of the CCAA .	-4.9416
What CCAA means is what a visitor wants to know .	-2.3470
" The abbreviation stands for " Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium " , which means " the town of Roman law and the town of Agrippinenser , founded under Emperor Claudius in the place of the Altar for the emperor " .	-5.4100
And the Prätorium is the former presidential palace , the power center of the Roman Empire on the Rhine .	-3.9103
From the entrance hall of the exhibition , tunnel access to the Roman sewage channel , which is preserved here at about 120 metres in length .	-5.8860
" You can walk quietly along the so called Cloaca Maxima , if you want , " Schulze excites the guests .	-4.4483
Schulze still has one surprise .	-2.4858
After getting the key at the box office , he leads the group to a 16 meter deep , walkable pit .	-4.6715
" We are now in the Mikwe , a ritual Jewish bath , " he explains .	-2.0706
The Jewish community built its bath deep into the ground to reach the groundwater that was essential for ritual washing .	-4.4127
To this day , in the lower end of the Mikwe , whose origins date back to the eighth century , different water levels can be discerned by changing levels of the Rhine .	-5.9288
The Mikwe will be part of an archaeological area on the Town Hall Square , for which the construction work will begin shortly .	-4.9788
However , it will take a few years to complete .	-4.0278
The Rocker Process ’ s Mischwork . . . : . . : . . . . . :	-10.4473
A bloody attack in the Rockermlieu will be re-rolled after more than four years .	-5.6093
A trial for attempted manslaughter , dangerous bodily injury and damage to property for two 30-year-olds has begun before the District Court of Frankfurt ( Oder ) .	-5.1705
It is accompanied by strict security measures .	-2.2992
The defendants were silent at the start .	-3.7365
They were supposed to have been active in the rock scene and then belonged to the bandidos .	-4.5088
In June 2009 , the public prosecutor accused them of having stowed down three men in a car with unknown accomplices in Finowfurt .	-6.4895
All victims were seriously injured , a man almost lost his leg .	-7.2038
The victims are said to have belonged to the competing group Hells Angels .	-3.2945
One should have been a senior member from Berlin .	-2.8756
It would appear that a chase with several cars had taken place .	-5.6197
According to the indictment , it was about turf wars and a demonstration of power .	-5.7050

It is hard to say that , in court , Rocker almost always adheres to a law that they had in mind - and does not testify .	-9.7567
This also applies to victims .	-1.9429
In the first process , only one of the victims had escaped .	-3.3966

The Forgiving Society Don ’ t Think	-9.3381
The night was long , the music loud and the mood good , but at some point it goes home .	-3.7240
But hunger is noticeable in people ’ s bakes on the front-passenger and rear seats .	-6.3904
Sure , one or other cocktail or champagne may be responsible for this !	-4.4385
What ’ s better than to chill out to drive to the next drive-in to treat yourself a little bit ?	-6.5509
I admit , I am happy to be with you when you get fast food late at night or early in the morning .	-5.2851
A few fries , a Cola , a Burger - and then no more than home and bed !	-5.8251
But on the way home , the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco crawlers are noticeable .	-5.4945
After all , what should you miss if you throw your fast food bags out of the car window with constant regularity ? !	-6.6192
Especially on weekends , paper bags are thrown away at street edges and parking spaces .	-6.2350
'Why ? ' , I wonder .	-1.7758
Are people too doof to take the bags home or to the next garbage bin ?	-4.2900
It is not only the case that the paper dies away from the landscape .	-4.5453
Transport facilities such as control rails have already been covered and accidents caused by this .	-7.6331
But that is not what the " disposable society " thinks about , it probably doesn 't even know what this word actually means .	-6.4855
If you are travelling more often in the evening , especially with several people in the car , you know what a backbench can look like after a night spent : clothes , bottles and other rubbish are there .	-8.3170
There would not be a couple of bags - unlike the street , where nobody wants to trample around on the eating habits of others .	-8.7960
I already see the day when cities and communities are being blown away - and the fast food chains have to demand a deposit for their bags .	-7.0929
Obama ’ s Reclining in Health Policy	-3.0280
After severe criticism , President Obama backtracked on his often-repeated , clear promise , “ If you like your health insurance , you can keep it . ”	-5.1008
After hundreds of thousands of their insurers received a letter of notice , the Republicans have recently accused the president of deceiving the American public .	-4.7030
Yesterday , Obama relativized his original promise .	-2.3670
“ The vast majority of citizens who have a functioning health insurance can keep it , ” he said in a speech in Boston .	-3.4098
In response to the numerous media reports on the redundancies , Obama called on those Americans who received such notifications to look around the free market for new insurance .	-4.7000
As a result , most citizens could receive better , more comprehensive health insurance at the same price , or more cheaply than predicted .	-7.3198
“ They come a better offer , ” he said .	-2.8557
The government was not surprised that the five per cent of the population who have taken insurance themselves would have to look at another tariff , because their contract did not meet the new standards under the Affordable Care Act .	-7.4574
“ I would like to say directly to these Americans : they deserve better , ” said Sebelius at a hearing before the House ’ s Energy and Trade Committee in Washington .	-4.0555
Sebelius , who is responsible for implementing the Affordable Care Act , explained that the launch of the online platform has been “ miserable ” since October .	-3.9886
“ I am as frustrated and angry as everyone else , ” she said .	-2.6729
I am determined to regain your trust .	-1.4136
This statement by an angry Sebelius to become a backseated adviser at yesterday ’ s House hearing was accepted after a dispute with Republican MP Billy Long of Missouri , asking whether she should be required to participate in Obamacare .	-8.7408
After more than three hours of consultation , Long Sebelius repeated why the “ architect ” of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily abandon government-sponsored insurance to purchase a HealthCare.gov fare that it now wants to sell to millions of Americans .	-5.2590
Israel ’ s Government Not Confirmed Attack on Syria ’ s Air Base	-4.2892
On Thursday , an American government official who wanted to remain anonymous said to the American news channel CNN that Israeli fighter planes attacked an airbase in Syria ’ s Latakia a day earlier .	-6.1821
The objective had been ' missiles and related equipment ' , which the Israeli Government feared were intended for Lebanese Hezbollah , according to CNN .	-5.1010
Syrian and Lebanese media , as well as the Arab channel Al-Arabiya , had previously reported that the base in the port city of Latakia was fired on Thursday night from Wednesday to Thursday , and blamed the Israelis for it .	-5.1455
The Israeli TV channel Channel 2 showed satellite images of the Latakia base , where Russian S-125 Newa missiles and a SA-3 battery could be seen , which Channel 2 has a range of 35 kilometres and can transport explosive heads up to 70 kilograms .	-7.6467
Uncertain The Government of Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack .	-2.5128
But the Reuters news agency quotes an Israeli government official , also anonymous , saying that he believes that Israel has carried out the attack , but is not safe .	-5.1456
In any case , a spokesman from the Israeli Ministry of Defence said : ' We are not commenting on these reports ' .	-3.1528
The journalist Ron Ben-Yishai stressed in the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper that the Syrian regime had already tried to deliver ground air missiles to Hezbollah earlier , and in part successfully .	-4.9812
The Israeli Government had repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to supply Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons would mean crossing a ' red line ' that would follow a military response .	-6.2903
John Kerry declared in an unprecedented admission that the US espionage has “ gone too far ”	-5.9626
John Kerry , with an unexpected admission , suggested a retreat from the US ’ s defensive stance on its surveillance programs by saying that , in certain cases , espionage has gone “ too far . ”	-6.0701
The Secretary of State also admitted that he , along with Barack Obama , held responsibility for “ autopilot ” when the explosive whistleblowers Edward Snowden revealed the NSA ’ s espionage activities .	-5.6292
The leaked information has left the US government in a diplomatic storm of indignation from its allies .	-3.3883
In a video speech delivered at the London Open Government Conference , Kerry said , “ There is no question that the President and I , and others in the government , have learned of some things that have happened almost by autopilot simply because the ability to do so was due to World War II and the difficult years of the Cold War , and , of course , to September 11 . ”	-7.8352
He then admitted , as the first senior member of the US government , that US espionage had crossed a border , but also stressed that no rights had been abused .	-4.8292
He said , “ In some cases , this has gone too far . ”	-2.5611
The President is determined to create clarity and is therefore conducting a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel that there is abuse .	-4.9062
I assure you that the rights of innocent people in this process will not be affected .	-2.4647
Kerry insisted , however , that the NSA was a force of good , and that many lives were saved by their surveillance operations .	-4.8372
He added , “ We are dealing with a new world in which people are willing to blow themselves into the air . ”	-3.1567
There is radical extremism in the world that is keen to kill , blow up , and attack governments .	-2.9033
So what if we were able to intercept and stop this before it happens ?	-3.0433
We have indeed prevented aircraft crashes , attacks on buildings and the murder of people , because we have learnt about such plans in advance .	-5.5218
Meanwhile , US legislators will travel to Europe to allay concerns about the alleged American espionage , and to convince Europeans of the need to continue working with the US on counter-terrorism efforts , as the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said on Thursday .	-5.6395
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he spoke to representatives of the European Parliament and other people this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terror organisations because of the frustration with surveillance by the National Security Agency .	-5.1824
“ It is very important for US national security interests that Europeans remain on board with regard to our joint efforts against terrorism , ” Murphy , who for the first time as a democrat in the Senate and as Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Relations and European Affairs , declared in an interview in Washington .	-5.7283
I am also going to Europe to make it clear there that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism , regardless of the annoyance of the NSA programmes .	-4.7065
Media reports that the NSA has captured millions of phone data in Europe have strained relations with some US allies , even though the head of the intelligence service said this week that the reports were inaccurate and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and exchanged with the United States .	-4.6622
Other revelations cited documents passed by Snowden that the NSA had monitored German Chancellor Angela Merkel ’ s mobile phone and up to 34 other heads of state worldwide .	-4.4811
The head of the national secret services , James Clapper , defended the espionage of allies as necessary and declared that it was common on both sides .	-4.3527
In all the tumult , Murphy said that his authority was preparing the visit of the Congress to take place this year , and hoped that the delegation would include members from both parties and chambers .	-7.3278
The names of the other participating Members will be published in the coming days .	-2.8485
He said that the exact route is still being worked out .	-2.7631
While Murphy emphasized that the purpose of the journey was to improve relations , he also said that there would be some “ serious words . ”	-3.2023
He said that European governments should be honest with their people about the kind of espionage programs they have used for years .	-3.7984
“ While we can change our surveillance programs to better protect Europeans ’ rights , they must also accept the fact that we are not the only ones that spy , ” Murphy said .	-4.3521
Meanwhile , John Kerry is on a weekend trip to the Middle East and Poland to deal with the grievances over the US strategy in Syria , Egypt , and Iran , as well as US surveillance .	-4.6228

Australians Sent in Prison in Thailand	-4.0792
A 21-year-old Sydney woman sentenced in Phuket to 15 days in prison for falsely claiming to have been raped by a taxi driver appealed against the sentence and was released on bail .	-3.9190
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty by a provincial court in Phuket on 15 June to have made a misrepresentation after she told the Thai police that a local taxi driver had raped her in the morning hours on Sunday 10 June , while two other men held her .	-5.7060
Later , however , the photographs of a video camera showed that she had safely arrived at her hotel after being separated from her Australian friend .	-4.4120
The police in Phuket hated Bamford for two days until she admitted to have thought the story .	-6.8880
Until the trial , they were in police custody .	-3.9472
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a low-security prison on the edge of Phuket instead of a prison for adult women .	-4.0051
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks , a former Australian Rubgy League player , who has contacted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra to ask for help for his daughter .	-4.2521
Tunk told Sydney ’ s Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was “ extremely concerned ” about his daughter ’ s wellbeing and wanted her back to Australia .	-4.0717
“ We are of course very concerned , but we hope that it will be back home as soon as possible , ” said Tunks .	-4.1829
Bamford appealed against the verdict and is free for a bail of 50,000 Baht .	-3.8182
Australian reports have reported that she is currently on holiday in Krabi resort in southern Thailand .	-5.7129
The court heard that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and warned that the appeal could lead to the imposition of a higher sentence of up to two years in a prison for adults .	-8.0296
However , it is also possible that Thailand , following the recent murder of the tourist clerk Michelle Smith in Phuket , might seek to improve its tarnished tourist image , and that is why there is acquittal .	-7.6240
