Munich 1856 : Four cards that change your view of the city	-3.3561
It is a misleading institution where young people are to meet today .	-5.0588
A pit chapel where the S-Bahn tunnel is now being dug .	-5.8995
Small gardeners manage the former farm land .	-4.9759
The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories .	-2.6912
It is annoying if maps are not up to date .	-2.6453
This is known to anyone who had to get up because the car Navi had a green meadow instead of a bypass .	-6.9755
The historic maps of the Bavarian Digital Atlas , an offer by the German state government 's geo-portal Bayern , are anything but up-to-date - but it is precisely for this reason that they are very revealing .	-7.9816
Especially when compared to current online maps .	-2.8361
Then it becomes clear how cities and communities in Munich ’ s Merkur area have changed since the 19th century .	-3.6750
The Bayern-Atlas is a patchwork that cannot be recognized as such .	-4.3442
In the large overview map more detailed maps for cities and communities have been included .	-6.4054
According to the Bavarian survey administration , these were created between 1810 and 1864 and originated from the first survey of Bavaria .	-5.0371
Their client : Napoleon .	-1.8903
The French army leader occupied Bavaria with Austria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War .	-3.6373
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied land and commissioned a topographical recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .	-4.2022
Although the French troops finally withdrew with the peace of Lunéville on February 9 , 1801 , they were today 's neighbours who created the idea of a comprehensive map of Bavaria .	-6.0272
Elector Max IV Joseph pushed the project forward , founded the " Topographical Bureau " - and thus the Bavarian surveying department .	-5.2864
The original position sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and can be found on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek . is . is . is . are , are . are . are	-8.1285
The comparison between past and present is the most impressive example of the state capital .	-5.4015
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .	-3.4581
An example of this is sendling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856 .	-4.1130
Sendling was incorporated 21 years after the map was created , in other words in 1877 , as a district in Munich .	-5.7107
Today , Untersendling lies in the heart of the city .	-8.1219
The Untersendlings houses are concentrated around 1856 along the present-day Plinganserstrasse , which was only named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878 , a leader of the Bavarian peasant revolt against Austria in 1705 .	-4.2174
Where the West Park is today , one can see nothing but fields - at first glance : when zooming in , a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears : hand-numbered pieces from the so-called " original photograph " from which the property tax was derived .	-7.9537
Today , small plots are no longer used by farmers , but by small-scale gardeners of the " Land in Sun " plant .	-6.3638
A large green area is located north of Untersendling .	-2.5412
The Theresienwiese , the venue of the Oktoberfest since 1810 , was actually a meadow in the 19th century - not a concrete desert .	-4.2908
On the other side of Isar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine .	-2.4692
In the original position sheet , in the area of today ’ s Au-Haidhausen district , you can read not only the street name " am Gasteig " or from the height " Auf der Lünen " - but also in large letters " Missen Anstalt " .	-7.5434
Yes , here at Auerfeldstra<unk>e people were once locked in with delusions .	-4.7515
In 1858 / 59 the Munich Kreis-Irlenanstalt " Auf der Auer Lüften " was founded .	-4.6915
In 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the establishment - the psychiatrist who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .	-4.3126
" He was progressive for his time and ended , for example , the arrival of so-called astray .	-5.1107
He has also prohibited personnel from using violence against the occupants , " says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Haidhausen Museum , who has been working for an exhibition with the institution .	-10.7836
280 patients had first room and 500 places were added later .	-6.2473
At some point this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the circular implant in hair 1905 .	-6.0066
Since 2006 , the Isar-Amper hospital in Munich-Ost , one of Germany 's largest psychiatrists , has been located there .	-6.8045
In the area of the former Auer Anstalt , young people are now meeting in Salesianum , Munich .	-4.6488
The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth home with educational enterprises .	-3.2876
To the west lies the football pitch of the TSV München Ost , to the east residential houses from the 1980s .	-4.6188
In 2015 , the children 's house " Casa Don Bosco " was built , architecturally inspired by the original building of the Irideenanstalt , which had been destroyed in bomb attacks during World War II .	-7.1607
The Marienplatz square was designated " Hauptplatz " around 1856 , and the Kaufinger street was called " Kaufinger Gasse " .	-4.4888
The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .	-3.2291
In December 1944 , the Allies ' bombs broke many holes in the city centre .	-5.1099
A great remained to this day - at the Marienhof .	-3.6087
The English Institute , small business houses and a medieval pit chapel once stood at the Marienhof , where the preliminary work took place these days , and on April 5 , 2017 , the ground floor for the second S-Bahn line .	-8.4857
With the slider you can compare the old Munich-map with the aerial image of today - and fill up the hole at the Marienhof .	-4.6723
Civil Rights Group publishes Travel Warning for Missouri	-2.2064
The National Society for the Promotion of Colored Persons issued a warning to colorful people travelling to Missouri on the basis of discriminatory policies and racist attacks by the state .	-5.4486
" The NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri , which is due to enter into force by 28 August 2017 , calls on African-American travelers , visitors , and Missouri to pay particular attention to travel by the state and to exercise extreme caution , as a number of questionable racial incidents have recently occurred throughout the state and are recorded here , " says the Group .	-7.8043
A recent law by Missouri , which makes it harder for people to win discrimination , and the state ’ s law enforcement agencies , which disproportionately target minorities , prompted the group to issue the travel warning , said the NAACP .	-5.5050
" They have violations of civil rights that happen to people .	-2.5361
They are stopped because of their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , " said the president of the Missouri NAACP , Rod Chapel , the Kansas City Star .	-6.6445
'We hear complaints of this frequency , which we have not heard yet ' .	-3.0618
It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States .	-2.2321
The group cited incidents such as racist offences against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .	-2.9141
Sanders died at the beginning of the year in questionable circumstances , after he had no petrol during his journey through the state and was detained by the Missouri police without being accused of a crime .	-6.2729
The Council also draws attention to a recent report by the Bureau of the Attorney General of Missouri showing that 75 % of black drivers in the state are detained more than white .	-5.8322
" The recommendation is that people are aware of and inform their families , friends and employees about what might happen in Missouri , " Chapel said .	-3.6603
'People must be prepared to bring in bail or let relatives know that they are travelling through the state ' .	-5.4709
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FBI ’ s hate crimes report , which ranked the state 16th in terms of the number of such injuries .	-3.8466
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination .	-2.8337
Previously , the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) issued travel warnings to Texas and Arizona after the states adopted immigration laws that oblige local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for violations of immigration , which ACLU believes will contribute to further racial profiling .	-5.1980
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department to other countries , but lately , interest groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US .	-3.8876
The Weimar Project is Elemental	-3.5201
The Fischerbacher Weidezaun-Project is a successful project and will continue next year .	-3.7688
The CDU members Peter Wei<unk> and Kordula Kovac got a picture on the spot .	-4.8351
At the Schwendemann family ’ s Rechtsgrabenhof , representatives of the Fischerbach CDU-Ortsverband met together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MEPs .	-6.5542
Markus Schwendemann initially offered insights into his company , where he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , supplies 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and houses holiday guests in five apartments .	-5.0750
For him , " Black Forest Milk " is the alternative marketing channel for the milk of his cows , according to Schwendemann .	-4.2827
On the holiday guests ' table there are only regional ones .	-5.6024
Since he is also the chairman of Fischerbach 's BLHV , he called the Weidezaunprojekt " elemental important " .	-6.0441
I cannot be profitable on such steep areas .	-3.5451
The green area provides a lot of work , and much needs to be done with Motorsense .	-5.7110
" We are struggling with the conditions and the topography here , " stressed Schwendemann .	-3.5865
In 2003 he took over the parent company and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if he does not run a biofarm .	-5.4217
For Mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear : " The Commune has recognized the importance of the Weidezaunproject and is pleased with the Leader promotion " .	-5.8012
Farmers would have to be supported at the cost of EUR 3 000 to 4 000 per hectare .	-3.8104
It is hoped that this would allow the afforestation of land to be extended for a while .	-5.2856
" The greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and are concerned about how to continue their business , " said the mayor .	-5.3668
Farmers are often criticised for their support .	-2.8642
In 2013 , a total of 25 plots of land were fenced in by 11 participants through the grazing grounds .	-5.6998
The open area is therefore 40 hectares , which must not be replanted by at least 2023 .	-5.2649
Of the total cost of 71 500 euros , half of it was supported by more than Leader , and one quarter was carried by the Fischerbach community .	-6.7786
This left farmers EUR 12 610 , which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of pasture .	-3.7023
" The great advantage is the longevity of fences " , explained Schwendemann .	-2.3787
Kordula Kovac stressed : " You do a really good job , without farmers and rural women it is not possible " .	-5.0482
Peter Wei<unk> also said : " This is where best food is produced " .	-3.8926
The Landscape Care Directive ( LPR ) Baden-Württemberg enables state support for pasture fences .	-4.3613
The aim is to keep the Black Forest open .	-2.3761
A prerequisite is the existence of a support framework defined by the LPR .	-4.8482
In addition , the area to be fenced must not be drivable ( slope of more than 35 % ) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation .	-7.1427
For the Fischerbacher Weidezaunprojekt 2018 , the application is currently being made by eight participants with 24 parcels , who want to build nearly 16 kilometres of fence .	-7.4240
The open space corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than EUR 112 000 .	-8.0623
Is nothing more sacred ?	-0.8862
Now Trump ’ s White House Introduces the Statue of Liberty	-2.6965
The surest sign of regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .	-1.6921
Americans value it as much as any other – hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Firdo Square in Baghdad in 2003 .	-5.5431
Stephen Miller , one of the Trump regime ’ s key ideologues , certainly knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe to a heated dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN about the president ’ s proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration to the status of freedom .	-4.3862
To remain fair , Miller did not attack the statue himself .	-2.4297
A horde of boat owners and liberty-imitators would have lynch him if he had done so .	-3.4882
But it took on its meaning , and in particular the meaning it was attributed when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus was added to its base in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument .	-5.0901
" I don 't want to go into a complete story here , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world .	-4.5158
The poem to which you refer , which was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . '	-2.7250
Miller is factually correct , but as he himself put it , it is not really a matter of history .	-2.8876
It is about the contemporary response to the stirring words of Lazarus , the only state in which a state not only invites any old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : ' Your tired , your poor , / your oppressed masses who yearn for breathing freely / the miserable waste of your rich coasts ' .	-7.1399
There was never a time when the " miserable waste " was better to see on our screens .	-3.8258
Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump ’ s US .	-2.4118
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural dispute : it is indeed a conflict about America ’ s importance .	-3.8489
Lazarus - and her friends who campaigned to place their words at the bottom after their death - knew very well that they were doing a highly political act .	-5.3617
The sculpture was supposed to show the connections between French and American Republican nationalism by portraying in a worn classical pictorial representation the female embodiment of freedom .	-6.4009
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem , the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .	-3.3231
And she gives herself a very different name : mother of the exiles .	-3.1088
The link between the poem and the picture is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism .	-3.3106
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , the people on the right wanted to change it back a long time ago .	-4.5848
The great shrine of Rush Limbaugh , a kind of John the Baptist for Trump ’ s coming , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone , but rather be an early neo-conservative that would bring the American flame to the world that has been killed : " Lady Liberty is moving forward .	-7.1174
It is supposed to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .	-1.8911
The torch should not light up the way to the United States . '	-3.4430
Quite unusually Limbaugh has encountered something here .	-4.6085
The significance of the statue is quite a question of the position of perception .	-3.2533
The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see it as seen by the exhausted , miserable but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships .	-4.4600
It is literally a question of seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and an opportunity to improve their lives .	-2.9572
Her statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they must hear .	-2.5504
Of course , that is not the prospect that Miller and Trump would ever want to recognize .	-3.5274
Their torch is not intended to illuminate the way , but to inflame the hatred that is their only source of power .	-4.5339
World Cup 2017 : Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK Team	-3.4065
Eiwandh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots were part of the British team .	-4.3210
The performance director of United Kingdom athletics , Neil Black , says that the 16-member Scottish contingent will " make a massive contribution to the team " in the World Cup squad .	-5.0367
A record number of Scottish athletes were selected for London 2017 , which will start on Friday .	-2.3622
Black believes that ' something special is developing in Scotland ' and that the UK 's athletics needs to learn something from it .	-3.7965
" We welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find out , " said Black .	-2.6878
" I speak to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done .	-2.8270
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .	-2.7134
British athletics : it has something to do with what they have done .	-1.5655
And also with the type on the street corner .	-2.9506
Whatever the combination of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . '	-1.4737
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal contenders , including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m line , while Eiidih Doyle was elected team captain by the team .	-5.0763
" Eiidih is quite modest .	-3.5061
Her captain 's speech was incredible , " says Black .	-2.9427
" A number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and very motivated .	-3.4246
The passion and real feeling that Eiidih naturally brought was great . '	-5.4502
The Commonwealth Silver medal winner , who will compete at their fifth World Cup in the 400 m hurdles , says that it is " incredible " that 16 Scots are in the British team .	-5.9407
Scotland ’ s best total number of World Cup athletes so far was seven achieved in 1983 and 2015 .	-3.7058
The medium-haul runner Muir is leading the way and last year has set five British and two European records .	-6.1364
It will participate in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs .	-2.2550
Chris O ’ Hare , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot to watch after a great season that included winning the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games .	-5.6898
Doyle remembers her first world championships when the only other Scot in the team Lee McConnell was .	-6.3832
The team captain says that she is " immensely proud " of the fact that many of her fellow countrymen are not only part of the team , but in some cases will also be involved in the medals and the finals .	-5.7578
" The special thing about being a team captain is that she was elected by the other members of the team , so it was a great honour anyway , but knowing that my team colleagues voted for me and elected me makes it something very special for me , " she added .	-5.4977
" Obviously I am very proud of all the Scots who belong to the team .	-2.5516
It only shows how far we have come .	-2.0445
And they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to go on podium .	-3.3722
As far as my speech as a captain is concerned ?	-2.6182
Yes , I think she went well .	-1.4981
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation because we have a home World Cup .	-3.8171
So it is really important to rely on this home support and to profit from the fact that we are back in the Olympic Stadium .	-8.1625
I get a second chance to go out and compete there and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there ' .	-3.3996
Blocking critics on Facebook : Don ’ t get in for public office if you can ’ t tolerate voters ’ heating up .	-6.5643
Our country ’ s father knew something of bad press .	-2.2895
Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long for newspapers to beat him for everything , from domestic politics to political principles .	-3.1424
He flared up in criticism , certainly .	-4.7888
But he has not silenced his critics .	-1.3294
For in 1783 , Washington said : ' Free speech can be taken away - and , stupid and dumb , we are being led to slaughter like sheep ' .	-4.8636
This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan , who must work to be more like Washington .	-2.1078
Hogan 's staff blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .	-4.0295
The American Civil Liberties Union therefore sued him earlier this week .	-2.2469
The governor 's staff dismissed the complaint as frivolous , and the online comment was full of a backlash with " well , and ? " .	-3.5877
" It 's just Facebook , " many people said .	-1.7114
But it is important .	-0.7804
And it is especially important if it is a type like Hogan .	-2.7848
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state , which is surprisingly popular .	-7.1545
He has the second-highest consent of the 50 governors of the nation .	-3.2143
Hogan is not a reactionary hothead .	-2.0423
He has shown a firm hand in leading his state and strict adherence to principles .	-3.7404
He was also very adept at using Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and playing down his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side .	-5.1431
Therefore , the blocking of people who come to the side of the governor - which is a public forum called official and of employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .	-6.4021
In an interview with The Washington Post , Hogan ’ s spokesperson , Amelia Chasse , defended the governor ’ s actions and argued that blocking comments is nothing more than a moderation .	-3.7110
But it is too easy to use the image of Trolls or Spammers or hateful people who swing the whip online .	-5.2163
The post spoke to some of the real people blocked by Hogan .	-2.6024
These are only real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur and a priest , not a troll .	-4.2470
They all said that their comments were respectful , thoughtful and not profound .	-2.0793
The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan 's Catholic faith .	-2.5171
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie , Md . , was not hateful , but she asked for hate crimes .	-3.5372
" I commented politely that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other current news , " she wrote in the commentary section of the news program " The Post " .	-3.8293
" I do not value this idea , even if a number of people take a stand on the same subject , then some people disregard it as a so-called collective effort and do not recognise it as a large group of citizens concerned " .	-7.0813
What the governor ’ s staff called a “ concentrated spam attack , ” others would probably call “ advocacy . ”	-4.7991
The Facebook era makes it easy to crop a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment .	-2.5293
It is much cleaner than in the past if the same thing had been done to send staff to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials , or arrest and silence demonstrators .	-4.5820
But that is what is happening digitally .	-2.5477
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for insulting Facebook and other social media .	-2.3596
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed .	-2.2591
One of the first milestones on this issue was in Virginia last week .	-2.5643
The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County violated the First Amendment , according to US Commissioner James C. Cacheris in Alexandria , when she banned a voter from their Facebook page .	-4.3956
And in Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin ( R ) also received a visit from the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter .	-2.5568
This should not be so difficult .	-2.1905
At the time of Washington , the time of affordable portos had a similar effect to the Internet .	-3.3165
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800 , and anonymous letters appealed to his leadership .	-3.3293
Even then , Washington had anonymous trolls .	-1.2290
The people who used pseudonyms like " Juricola " , " Valerius " , " Belisarius " and " Portius " wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington 's decisions .	-3.8052
Petitions that criticized his position on the Amity Treaty , trade , and shipping with the United Kingdom overwhelmed his office , according to the historical documents collected by the Online Papers of the George Washington Project .	-7.7824
But he did not silence them .	-1.6994
Freedom of speech , disagreement , and discourse are the basis of our nation .	-3.1736
And true leadership means accepting it .	-1.7240
Ronan Rafferty hopes for comfort in the Renaissance Club	-3.0820
The former European No. 1 Ronan Raffan erty will hope for domestic comfort in the next three days , as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .	-6.6562
The Northern Ireland , which last year held links next door in the Archefield to the final , before losing Paul Eales , is linked to the new venue and serves as a tournament ambassador on behalf of the club founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi .	-6.0259

" The players will see this course from its best side , it is in a great state .	-3.7903
Jerry did a great job in fixing this place .	-3.4405
He is a keen advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here .	-3.0785
This is a great showcase for this course . '	-2.4421
The Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , although he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career .	-4.7029
" This really feels very special , " said the player based in Southport .	-3.8336
" I could not defend the Extremadura Open because it was taken out of the program in the year after I won it .	-3.4547
Returning to this part of the world is magical .	-1.7802
It is a wonderful place to play golf .	-1.8878
The memories from last year come back and it was something special for me and my wife , Sharon , to win here last year .	-3.4466
It was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . '	-2.5951
Gary Orr , who came to the European Senior Tour earlier this year after his 50th birthday , returns to the action on his home base .	-3.6624
This event will be its first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .	-2.0461
" It always means a bit more when you play at home , " said Orr , the man from Helensurgh .	-3.6176
" You want to do it well , but you also feel this extra pressure .	-2.8516
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .	-2.3187
I am glad about the way things have gone . '	-4.3371
With the trio in the field , former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and Senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst , Roger Chapman , Mark James and Mark McNulty are .	-4.8585

Less lung cancer deaths from passive smoking	-2.0289
Over the past two decades , fewer and fewer people have died from lung cancer because of passive smoking .	-2.8575
This is the result of a study by scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf ( UKE ) .	-4.2537
" According to our estimates , 167 lung cancer deaths per year are attributable to passive smoking , " said study manager Heiko Becher .	-3.5229
In comparison , he used his own 1994 study on this subject .	-4.4909
At that time , there were 400 lung cancer deaths per year in Germany due to passive smoking .	-6.9067
The new study is published in the " International Journal of Public Health " .	-6.2089
Domestic connections prove to be very complex	-3.5178
The construction works in Villinger Stra<unk>e are in full swing and " lie reasonably in time " , according to the head of the building of the Fred Heinze .	-5.2739
In the area of domestic connections , the situation is more complicated than expected , as there is a lot of hiding in the underground , which is not mentioned in the plans .	-10.4082
The traffic , which repeatedly hinders the construction of the building , is a major problem for the building contractor Stumpp .	-6.8394

In her wooden house in Enarotali , the capital of the Paniai reign in the troubled Indonesian province of Papua , the housewife usually puts a sweet potato - locally called " nota " - directly into the fireplace .	-4.9185
After half an hour , the blasted Knolle is removed and swallowed with eager , unwashed hands .	-6.2974
Degei is sitting on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also carries out her daily work , such as washing clothes with muddy water from the nearby swamp .	-6.2652

It is a rare insight into daily life in the highlands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was taken up in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,026 elders were to vote in front of the occupying forces by means of a public intervention .	-5.9090
An existing movement campaigning for independence against Dutch rule quickly turned against the Jakarta government , which maintains control of the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers .	-4.7430
In 2003 , the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua , with the independent part of Papua New Guinea covering the eastern part of the island .	-3.6411

Papua is Indonesia ’ s poorest province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst child mortality and literacy rates in Asia .	-2.5985
But it is also Indonesia 's gold land .	-4.2098
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Grasberg , owned by Freeport McMoran from Phoenix , is just 60 miles from Paniai , a high-land province in the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants .	-4.2400
In 2015 alone , freeport has reduced gold and copper to $ 3.1 billion .	-3.7971
In addition , Papua has estimated $ 78 billion in wood resources .	-3.1945
But these riches are a source of misery for the Papua , ensuring that Indonesia ’ s powerful military maintains a suffocating presence .	-3.5728
A 2005 survey in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units nearly $ 20 million between 1998 and 2004 , including up to $ 150,000 to a single officer .	-3.6157

Indonesian President Joko Widodo , popularly known as Jokowi , promised to address the inequalities and violations of the law in Papua during his 2014 campaign .	-7.4916
The former carpenter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua - including Paniai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jakarta .	-3.5383
But little has changed in Papua , and today the locals feel cheated .	-3.2595
" Our hearts have been broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014 , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , " You said .	-3.6988
Indeed , only two months after Jokowi ’ s inauguration in October , Paniai suffered a low .	-2.6275
On December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children were out and sang Christmas songs in front of a campfire in Enarotari , when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle .	-3.5013
The frightened children told them that they should turn their headlights on .	-2.8059
One of the soldiers took offence at their tone and later returned with four soldiers , according to the local Pastor Yavedt Tebai .	-4.7255
The soldiers who had drunk hunted and beat the group with their guns , said victims and witnesses .	-3.4593
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .	-1.6329
A child , the 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo , was beaten so hard that he fell into the coma .	-3.0274
A few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escalated the next day .	-2.7165
About 1,000 young Papua men , women , and children gathered at a football pitch in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice .	-3.4231
They wore ceremonial hunting bows and performed the Waita dance - constantly imitating a bird song - by Papuas Mee Pago tribe .	-4.6932
Some demonstrators started throwing stones on police and military posts .	-2.3554
When the mood was heated , a command was sent to the soldiers via an internal radio : " If the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , " says an official TME document that was not released to the local media .	-5.2163
Yemias Kayame , 56 , the head of the Kego Koto district of Enarotari , saw the imminent danger and called for rest and called for the crowd to return home .	-4.3076
Nobody was in the mood to listen .	-1.5487
" When I turned around , I was suddenly shot into my left wrist , " he said TIME on the verandah of his brightly painted wooden house . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-6.3929
Kayame still does not know who fired , but says that the ball came from the rows of soldiers gathered here .	-2.6346
" It was crowded , many shots were fired , " he adds .	-1.9529
The native man , Alfius Youw , was met three times , according to his cousin , who was witness to the shooting .	-4.7844
" I ran to him and studied his body to make sure he was , " said Yohanes , who , like many Indonesians , has only one name , the TIME in a dark mood .	-4.9315
" I saw that he was dead ... I kissed him . "	-2.4440
The chief inspector of the Papua-police , Yotje Mende , told reporters that his officers only wanted to " secure " their station because they were under attack .	-4.7899
'We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us ' , said Papua-police spokesman , Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo , in 2015 .	-3.2393
'It is about life and death ' .	-1.7956
According to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstrators were killed and many more injured .	-2.0626
The news about the killings came to Jakarta only the following day ' filtered ' .	-3.8845
Three weeks ago , Jokowi made a passionate speech in Jayapura , expressing sympathy for the families of the victims and vowing to address the historical grievances in Papua .	-6.3279
" I want this case to be resolved immediately so that it will not happen in the future , " he said .	-2.9695
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he set up an extra-judicial mechanism to resolve historic human rights violations .	-4.4516
But the excuses began almost immediately .	-1.3961
" Most injuries occurred a long time ago .	-2.0073
Some were in the 90 's and early 2000 's .	-2.3669
The point is that we have committed ourselves to addressing these violations , but there are processes that must be passed , " he said .	-3.8038
Then , when he spoke to TIMES in Jakarta on 5 June , he went back and said that he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua .	-4.6717
Instead , " everything is regulated by law , " he said .	-1.8318
Wiredu , accused by the UN of ' crimes against humanity ' , which claimed more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor 's bloody 1999 independence vote , said that 11 cases of human rights violations had already been resolved in Papua , including the Paniai incident .	-4.5120
Families of the Paniai victims received such claims with fierce infidelity .	-3.7570
" I have been interviewed four times over the last three years , but there has been no progress , " says Yohanes .	-2.4832
'I am tired ' .	-1.1814
He says that years later he still lives in fear .	-1.9238
" I am afraid , " he says .	-1.5640
'I am afraid to be arrested by the military , fear being shot . '	-5.8982
His brother Yacobus repeated the view that the people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident .	-4.8772
He says that he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims .	-2.4171
" After burying the corpses , the military searched for me , " he says .	-3.5186
The shootings have not stopped .	-1.6110
On Tuesday the Indonesian police shot on villagers in Paniai 's neighborhood Deiyai .	-3.3931
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company that refused to bring a unconscious man to hospital , one person died and 17 others were injured , including children .	-3.6146
The man , 24-year-old Ravianus Douw , drowned when he was fishing in a nearby river , died on his way to hospital .	-3.1051
Raised villagers protested in front of the company ’ s location office .	-3.7153
The police said that villagers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warning shots .	-2.6725
But locals say that the mobile brigade ( Indonesian paramilitary police ) started shooting at the crowd and killed one .	-2.6166
" We were so panicked , we are afraid that there will be revenge , " says the 29-year-old Dominiggu Badii , who lives near the hospital and witnessed the rapid arrival of the injured people here , according to the TIME .	-6.1511
'I have hidden myself in my house for two days . '	-7.1447
The Deiyai parliament has called for the officers involved to be called to account and the police mobile brigade to be withdrawn from the area .	-5.0054
Paniai has always been a source of unrest for the Indonesian Government .	-2.1329
The lack of meaningful development reinforces the discontent of the Mee , Moni , Dani and Damal tribe who live in the green highlands of Papua .	-4.1291
Many joined the " Free Papua Movement " ( OPM ) , the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of Papua by launching sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers .	-3.4837
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai , including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya .	-3.1326
In response , thousands of people have been arrested and arbitrarily detained in Paniai in recent years , under the pretext of ' safeguarding national sovereignty ' .	-3.3161
Some never recur .	-2.3819
Among the people of Papua , Paniai is known as " a tragic , forgotten place " .	-3.0955
Poverty strengthens discontent .	-1.3670
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals .	-3.1599
Bread is just as out of reach .	-1.6691
The people here are building everything they eat , especially notas and fruit and vegetables .	-5.6006
Agriculture is the job of women , who can deal with four or five fields of sweet potato .	-8.4720
They keep most of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market .	-3.0547
Ten pieces of Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees ( 75 cents ) .	-2.2113
Over time , economic inequalities have grown between indigenous Papua and the new migrants , who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new flight routes to Nabire airport .	-5.1800
The few jobs that exist in the region typically go to the better-educated and wealthier migrants .	-3.0398
Papua rarely has the capital or skills to lead its own companies competitive .	-4.2533
" Young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money , " says John Gobai , Chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council .	-3.6587
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua .	-1.1138
Moreover , restrictions on reporting by international media remain strained .	-3.4101
At the beginning of the year , French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua for lack of coordination with related institutions , although they were given rare permission to film .	-3.9505
According to Phelim Kine , Human Rights Watch ’ s deputy director of Asia , the promises made by Jokowi ’ s campaign to lift the restrictions on reporting in order to promote transparency and development have not been realized .	-4.1639
" There are new threats to foreign journalists trying to report on Indonesia 's most troubled eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua : visa refusal and a blacklist , " he said in a statement .	-3.6013
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely confined to Papua ’ s immediate neighbors .	-3.1121
In March , six Pacific states - Tonga , Nauru , Palau , Tuvalu , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate " various and widespread violations " in Papua , including the Paniai shootings .	-3.3540
The same countries have historically supported the OPM .	-2.1976
The spokesman for the Indonesian Foreign Ministry , Arrmanatha Nasir , rebuked the group 's accusations and told journalists in Jakarta : ' There is still a democratic system in Indonesia and free media , so it is difficult to conceal evidence of human rights cases ' .	-5.4872
People on the ground want more foreign governments to take note of this .	-2.0377
When an official delegation from the Netherlands , led by the human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar , Jayapura visited on 4 May , local people broke their silence and urged him " We want freedom " , according to a source that also attended the meeting but wants to remain anonymous .	-5.2733
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua states that they are unlikely to vote for Jokowi again .	-2.7441
" Jokowi is a person who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people involved in the paniai shots , " says Gobai , Chairman of the Tribal Council .	-4.2472
He wants Jokowi to know that , apart from living under the constant threat of a predatory military , the Paniai people are in poor educational and health services .	-3.3384
Gobai says that the Paniai people , like other Papua , see their voice for Jokowi as a " fault " that he must pay back .	-6.7068
" They do not need money , they just want justice , " he says .	-2.2641
Despite the threats and intimidation , families of the Paniai shooters carried out a last symbolic act of consolation : the corpse of a victim was buried on a site exactly opposite the police and the military station .	-6.3838
They know that they may never have justice , but at least they do not forget the perpetrators of their crimes .	-6.8172
" One member of our family was killed , " says Yacobus with his lowered head .	-2.9287
'What else can we do ? '	-1.4311
Fire capture the ' Torch ' skyscraper of Dubai for the second time .	-2.2725
A fire took place on Friday in one of the highest residential towers in the world in Dubai , forcing hundreds of residents to flee the 337-metre-high 79-storey building .	-4.5392
It is the second fire that will sweep through the high-rise building in just two years ' time , which is by chance called the Torch Tower .	-6.6174
The building was evacuated , injuries were not reported and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .	-2.4236
" We slept and we stood up at the fire alarm and shouting the people .	-3.5982
We ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50th floor , " said a resident who named his George angab , Reuters .	-3.6799
Dubai ’ s civil protection authorities said that fire-fighting units fired fire at 4 : 00 local time ( 00.00 GMT ) and cooled the building .	-5.7465
The government said it is working to provide shelter for those affected .	-2.7103
The incident can revive issues relating to the safety of materials used outside high-rise buildings around the world .	-4.5630
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage came from the covering , the outer covering for decoration or insulation .	-5.6673
In Britain , the police said that they believe that the system of plates to isolate and disguise the London Grenfell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died .	-5.1883
No Davies Cup Reform : Continue Best of Five	-2.7508
The president of the International Tennis Federation ( ITF ) has passed through at the General Assembly with his large Davis-Cup-Coup .	-4.1558
At the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City , the revolutionary proposal for this sport to play Davis-Cup-Eins only on two winning sets was not supported by the required two-thirds majority .	-6.3656
The five-cat classic , which is often very long , but also very appreciated for this reason , will therefore remain the traditional competition .	-7.8934
63.54 % of member states voted in favour of the reform , so the ITF President David Haggerty ’ s goal was narrowly missed .	-4.8830
" We respect this decision , but are disappointed that our member nations have not adopted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup .	-2.7423
We need a change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historical contests , " said Haggerty .	-2.5349
We will continue to work to improve the competition .	-3.6624
Not until the vote had been taken , after many objections , the proposal had already been made to hand out the final in a neutral place .	-6.8238
New from 2018 , the details are comparatively small : for example , the finalists in the Davis Cup and the Fed Cup will have the right to host the first round in the next year .	-6.3028
In order to reduce the cost of the event organizers , training places requirements and so on will be made easier and players will have to make less official media dates before the Davis Cup .	-6.9214
More than 1 out of 5 US passengers bring prohibited items onto the aircraft , a poll finds out .	-5.2017
A survey of air passengers found that more than 20 % deliberately or unconsciously prohibited items smuggled past the US Transportation Security Administration ’ s control points , including at least 6 % of those entering the aircraft while inadvertently carrying prohibited knives or other objects with blades .	-6.3828
Less than 1 % claimed that they had belatedly discovered that they had mistakenly traveled with firearms , ammunition , or explosives .	-3.4437
The survey of more than 1,000 people - carried out by a jet charter service Stratos Jet Charters Inc . - also found that younger travellers tend to disregard the rules .	-5.2492
Of the respondents who admitted that they knowingly tried to fly with something banned by the TSA , 19.7 % were millennials , compared to less than 15 % , who were members of Generation X .	-4.0552
The most common items deliberately passed by TSA agents were food and liquids .	-3.1957
More than 3 % admitted that they knowingly carried objects with blades through security control , while 2.2 % of female respondents and 3.7 % of male respondents also confirmed that they had deliberately brought banned drugs onto the aircraft .	-6.1549
The company said that it consulted travellers across the country to find out how many inadvertently smuggled goods would have been brought through airport security and how many would have done it intentionally .	-5.6785
It is no surprise that the people most likely to carry smuggled goods - knowingly or unwittingly - through safety were those who fly most frequently .	-4.9709
However , the company points out that the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing .	-2.7671
People are often unsure about which liquids they can take with them or how much of them .	-4.4546
So it is no surprise that the largest amount of liquids confiscated by TSA are prohibited .	-4.6910
For a while , people thought that the TSA could view books as smuggled goods .	-3.6353
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .	-1.6974
Elon Musk doesn 't care : Tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel order .	-2.5344
Elektro-Taustendsassa Elon Musk likes to give with the huge number of preorders for his new Tesla " Model 3 " .	-3.5792
He has so far failed to accept that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation .	-6.0631
In addition to the ever-triumphant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tesla CEO Elon Musk has for the first time revealed a different , less glittering figure in the announcement of the recent quarterly balance sheet : the cancellation of the new mass-market model 3 .	-7.0510
Over the past few months , Musk had frequently promoted the new car with more than 500,000 pre-orders , the delivery of which is just beginning .	-6.3103
Now Musk admits : Of the total 518,000 reservations , 63,000 have already been withdrawn .	-4.4702
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations .	-3.5417
In case of cancellation Tesla will pay the 1000 Euro ( $ 1000 in the United States and <unk> 1000 in the United Kingdom ) in full .	-12.1256
At the moment , 455,000 such no-obligation reservations were available , Musk admitted to a telephone conference with analysts .	-4.5821
However , the Tesla boss does not believe that cancellation of about 12 percent of all orders could be a problem .	-5.3607
His argument : the challenge in ambitious growth targets is not demand , but production .	-3.3847
Last year , Tesla supplied 84,000 vehicles .	-1.5270
In 2018 , all models will be 500,000 , one million by 2020 .	-3.8739
The demand for this is obvious .	-2.5977
According to Musk , 1800 reservations are currently being made per day .	-2.8710
If you order a " Model 3 " today , you can expect delivery in the second half of 2018 at the earliest - if Tesla manages to drive its brand-new production lines , which have never been tested in practice , with maximum load without major interruptions .	-6.5343
Many experts doubt that this is possible .	-1.6670
If there are major delays , however , the non-committal nature of reservations could become the Tesla problem .	-5.3395
After all , the company cannot prevent disaffected customers from getting away in droves .	-4.2635
Pruitt , the leader of the EPA , is withdrawing from emissions by delaying the Obama Era ’ s rules .	-6.5177
One day after being sued by 15 states , Scott Pruitt , the head of the Environmental Protection Agency , took his previous decision to delay implementation of the Obama era ’ s rules to reduce smog emissions .	-4.7519
Pruitt presented the change when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administrations .	-3.4537
He did not mention the complaint that had been filed against his previous post in a federal court of appeal .	-4.4162
It is a deadline for states to meet the 2015 standards for ground-level ozone on 1 October .	-3.4169
In June , Pruitt announced that he would delay compliance by one year to give his authority more time , study the plan , and avoid " interfering in local decisions or impeding economic growth . "	-4.4711
Pruitt , who was a public prosecutor of Oklahoma before he was appointed by President Donald Trump , has long been a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations .	-4.3279
Since its arrival in Washington , Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations that the chemical industry and fossil-fuel industry oppose .	-4.3658
Wednesday ’ s sudden reversal is the recent legal setback to the Pruitt ’ s regulatory rollback agenda .	-2.3298
Last month , a Federal Court of Appeal in Washington ruled that the EPA Manager exceeded his authority by trying to delay the implementation of an Obama administration rule requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks .	-4.9110
In a statement published on Wednesday evening , Pruitt suggested that his U-turn in ozone standards simply strengthens the EPO ’ s willingness to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely compliance with the new standards .	-4.5546
" Under previous administrations , the EPO has often failed to meet the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be accused by activist groups and others , and in an agreement to set the date for implementation , " said Pruitt , who sued the EPO more than a dozen times in his previous job .	-5.3288
" We do not believe in judicial regulation and we take deadlines seriously .	-2.7192
We also take the law and the authority that we have seriously . '	-3.0569
Nevertheless , the EPO 's opinion said that , at some point , Pruitt will use its ' late power and all other legally available powers ' to ensure that the rules are ' based on sound policies and the best available information ' .	-5.0890
Congressional Republicans are pushing for a broader rewrite of the ozone rules .	-3.7088
A bill approved last month is intended to delay implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .	-2.4389
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate .	-1.5223
The New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman , who led the coalition of the states that had sued the EPA this week , said that the group intended to maintain legal pressure .	-3.9195
" The reversal of the EPO - after our complaints - is an important benefit for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities , " said Schneiderman .	-5.2924
New York joined California , Connecticut , Delaware , Illinois , Iowa , Maine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Pennsylvania , Rhode Island , Vermont , and Washington , and the District of Columbia .	-2.0340
Soil ozone occurs when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil refineries , chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight .	-2.6624
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people and contribute to thousands of premature deaths every year .	-3.2073
Public health officials and environmentalists cheered at Pruitt ’ s surprising change of course .	-3.9392
" It is disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this sensible step from the person responsible for protecting the air we breathe , " said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity .	-3.8526
" We must continue to fight the Trump administration 's ideological crusade to pander to polluters and their particular interests . "	-2.9680
Tumlingen celebrates 750 Years of St. Hilarius Church	-3.4849
750 years of St. Hilarius Church : On the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church , the old cemetery area in Tumlingen on Sunday , July 16 , is invited to a serade at 4.30 pm .	-9.5054
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historic St. Hilarius complex is a popular place to stay .	-3.5798
Visitors to the sixth Benefit-Bernade can be enchanted by this powerful place .	-4.8550
The rescue and conservation of the oldest building in the village have made Tumlingens a priority .	-5.1024
Walter Martini stresses : " It is a unique village gem " .	-2.6406
In 1267 the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in the Württembergische Urkundenbuch : Count Hermann von Sulz sold " the mountain with the parish church of Tumlingen and the Vogtei " to Magister Eberhard von Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark of silver .	-5.3454
According to the document , apart from the former parish church , the Tumlinger Berg also had a stately farm , which belonged to the church or the Patronate Law , and not the other way round .	-8.5233
People lived there too .	-6.1765
As can be seen from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt in 1858 , next to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf , which are still visible today in the townscape of Tumlingen , the " mountain " was the third , the stately settlement centre of the village .	-6.5734
Old maps dating back to 1600 underpin this historical situation .	-4.6242
The Patronate Law was created from the early medieval right of own church .	-6.3027
A gentleman who built a church , furnished and occupied with a priest remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this own church .	-5.4184
It was connected with the right to appoint a priest or to propose a new priest to the bishop .	-4.6265
Three altars existed in the church and two bells on the tower .	-2.0145
The larger of the two smashed at Christmas 1673 .	-3.8332
The new bell sounded first in 1692 , but had to be delivered later in World War II in 1942 .	-4.9784
In the 30-year war ( 1616 to 1648 ) the windows were taken and the bells were stolen .	-4.5087
The roof was leaking .	-1.9115
In 1796 , French troops were stationed near the church .	-2.3183
They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood .	-2.9251
Remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809 .	-2.4633
Until 1869 , the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from porpoises .	-5.1076
In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Hilarius Church abandoned .	-3.4233
Only the church tower was left standing .	-2.4273
In 1834 , a storm split the church tower and half collapsed .	-3.1953
To prevent an accident , the tower was abandoned .	-3.8323
Only the tower movement still in existence today was preserved as a witness to the 750 years old church history .	-4.8658
Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem cultivate the Hilarius-Anlage from the " Schaffigen Rentner " as the successor of Dieter Dockhorn .	-4.6206
On Sunday , July 16th , the Friends and Patrons of Tumlingens invite the sixth Serenade to the old cemetery of St. Hilariuskapelle .	-5.5114
It is designed by the Combo of the Kepler Gymnasium Freudenstadt and by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis .	-4.2252
The local leader of Hartmut Romann speaks the final word .	-4.1628
The program starts at 4.30 p.m.	-1.9811
Entrance is from 3.30 p.m.	-3.3788
To finish the Serenade , a Umtrunk in the graveyard takes place .	-4.5467
" Enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows towards the forest " , the organizers point out the fantastic view .	-5.0963
The sernade takes place only in dry weather .	-2.3912
The organizers hope for many supporters to maintain the historic St. Hilarius facility , which is important for Tumlingen and Hörschweiler .	-5.5011
Friends and patrons of Tumlingens feel particularly committed to home care , as Serenade Organiser Walter Martini confirmed .	-5.5144
The Association wants to have windmills approved	-4.8419
" Boisheim opposes itself " does not see any legal condition for the construction and has therefore contacted the Landrat .	-5.4884
The association " Boisheim defects " has asked Landrat Andreas Coenen ( CDU ) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind power plants in the Boisheim Nette .	-5.1013
It was unlawful .	-1.5930
The association argues that , at the time of approval on December 30 , 2016 , no wind turbines could have been approved at the Boisheim Nette , because at the time only a wind power center existed at the city border with Schwalmtal .	-7.2458
Within this concentration zone , the construction and operation of wind turbines are basically possible , but at the same time the concentration zone prevents the use of wind energy for the rest of the city .	-6.0896
Such zones are designed to prevent the " closure " of the landscape .	-4.3096
The city of Viersen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheim Nette , just a few days before , by amending the land-use plan , which had not been approved by the district government of Düsseldorf , due to a fault of form .	-8.1929
" Due to the lack of a regulatory requirement , the approval document issued is still illegal and therefore also withdrawn , " said Christoph Erkens , Chairman of " Boisheim opposes itself " .	-7.4164
The current state of affairs : before the summer break , the town council decided again on the wind concentration zone in the Boisheim Nette ; the district government has yet to approve it .	-7.2194
Erkens : " This means that the granting of permission for the construction of wind energy plants is legally excluded " .	-6.4043
The circle confirms the receipt of the invitation .	-1.7672
" The corresponding letters have been received by Viersen since last week , " said a speaker .	-4.5121
The circle is giving them the opportunity to re-examine the matter .	-4.4888
However , they are not likely to stop the process .	-3.7674
With regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court , the circle did not wish to express its opinion on the substance of the arguments of the association " Boisheim opposes " on Thursday .	-6.6139
The NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , plans to build four 200 meter high windmills on an area at the Boisheim Nette .	-9.2099
Last year , the company , in which the city of Viersen is indirectly involved , had already concluded lease contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land .	-5.7256
With the construction of the four wind power plants , the power requirements of around 11 400 households are to be met - this corresponds to about one-fifth of the electricity requirements of all four households .	-7.8412
The NEW Re wants to invest around EUR 20 million .	-2.5686
Last summer , Viersen ’ s City Council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines in the Linnich wind farm near Aachen , as well as a stake in a wind power plant in the district of Heinsberg .	-5.8149
Car and tractor crash together : Mrs dies in terrible accident	-4.0217
A terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at around 10 a.m. on the L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel ( Rhein-Lahn district ) .	-4.4548
A woman was killed .	-2.0571
Two other people were slightly injured .	-1.8936
The highway remained closed for hours .	-2.5294
According to police data , a 17-year-old young woman from Bornich , with her car , took the L 333 in the direction of Bogel as part of the escorted journey with her 53-year-old mother .	-7.3845
City and Dealers Planning Home Shoots	-4.2294
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region are to discover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September .	-5.4050
The trade association and the city administration want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to attract the inhabitants to a shopping tour into the city centre .	-6.9379
As the chairman of the trade association Christian König announced , the " Heimat-Shoppen " weekend is intended to raise the awareness of the customers of what the city offers apart from the usual supermarket goods .	-8.2001
A market with regional providers is therefore planned , similar to the weekly market .	-3.7452
In addition , domestic companies should present themselves with their training places .	-4.4161
In addition , the shops of the city centre should invite you to " midnight shopping " .	-5.3175
In doing so , the action is not only aimed at residents of the city and the region .	-5.3368
In preparation are commercials on the radio , an internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend , according to Christian König .	-5.1195
City administration and trade association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce .	-3.5900
In this way the trade association and the city go into another stage of the project " Attractive downtown " .	-5.7496
This includes new offers , such as the first " Active Day " for the Brunnenfest and open Sunday 's sale , discussions with all traders and hosts to encourage them to participate actively .	-10.1869
Also attractive offers for Saturday and the renunciation of parking fees on that day are part of the concept .	-3.6641
In addition , customer potential should be newly or re-opened .	-3.7596
This includes spa guests and tourists .	-2.6658
But many locals would also have lost sight of the city centre when shopping .	-5.0596
In the end , everyone would have to help to revive the city centre - to landlords , the businesses of the whole city and clubs .	-6.5445
It was necessary to overcome the lethargy that had spread with a network , King said in spring .	-5.2882
Birgit Strech , head of the IHK Center in Mühlhausen , announced that five Thuringia cities will participate in the third " Heimat-Shoppen " Day , Germany .	-6.5287
Besides Bad Langensalna these are Weimar , Spierda , Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode .	-3.6941
The day was supposed to ' promote the appreciation of local trade and emphasise its importance for the common good of our cities ' , Stress said .	-5.7619
The action under the auspices of the IHK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen with his buying behaviour can influence his or her direct environment .	-6.1016
Two Dead and Several Injured After Explosion at US School	-3.5920
During construction work there was a gas explosion in the school building .	-2.9477
New people were injured .	-1.4916
In a gas explosion in the US town of Minneapolis , two people were killed and nine others injured , some of them severely .	-3.9633
According to the fire department , on Wednesday ( local time ) , an injured person was still in critical condition .	-4.7762
A person died when part of a school building collapsed during the explosion .	-2.7445
A missing person was later also born dead .	-5.0000
The dead were school employees .	-1.5918
As an unfortunate matter , the authorities suspected work on a gas pipeline .	-3.8889
During the holiday period , few people stayed in the Minnehaha Academy building .	-4.3224
Trump pressured Mexico to pay the border wall after leaked transcripts of telephone calls .	-3.5792
The Washington Post has published transcripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Trump and Mexico and Australia .	-2.9334
On January 27 , Trump called on Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall .	-2.7277
The US President insulted him because he publicly denounced the wall , and reportedly said to him : ' You cannot tell the press that ' .	-6.9982
Trump launched his presidential campaign with a promise to build a wall on the southern border of the US , and vowed to pay Mexico for the project .	-3.5367
Transcripts of his first call to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and revealed a tense exchange .	-3.4667
Mr. Trump said to Mr. Turnbull that trade for the US refugees who emigrated to Australia is " ridiculous " , " mies " , and " stupid " , and that insisting on the trade mediated by the Obama administration would make him look like a " fool " after proposing a ban on the resettlement of refugees to the US .	-6.7143
Mr Trump ended the call after saying to Mr Turnbull , ' that is the most unpleasant call for the whole day ' .	-4.4954
Moore ’ s Ford Massacre : Activists Restore racist Lynchat as a Call for Justice	-4.6111
A 1940s Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in rural Monroe , Georgia , and moved to the Ford Bridge of Moore .	-4.1664
Before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men came out with guns to block his way .	-3.8159
The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man in a pinball suit - took a long train on his cigar and looked through the windscreen under scrutiny .	-5.4903
Inside , the occupants reveled in fear .	-3.1610
" We want this n ---- r Roger ! " the man shouted .	-2.4355
'Get him out of the car ! '	-1.8244
Shrine tore the silence when a young black man was crushed by the front-passenger seat .	-3.8152
Fortunately , this terrible scene , which was played on 22 July , is only a sequel .	-4.3387
But when a noose is thrown around the neck of " Roger " , almost everyone in the audience beat out very real sighs .	-5.4741
Since 2005 , civil rights activists have returned to Moore 's Ford Bridge to imitate the night when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946 .	-4.3582
Nobody has ever been charged with the murders .	-2.7427
" It is truly incomprehensible that in all these years no single person has been arrested - although we see them in our communities , although we know who they are , " said Tyrone Brooks , who is helping to organise the follow-up .	-6.5070
'It is a stain on a story , but it is a burden on our souls ' .	-2.4673
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Georgian congressman and a lifelong civil rights activist .	-3.9751
For him , posturing serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected .	-3.9778
" We want prosecution , we want an end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we need justice , " he said .	-3.0506
'We cannot get healing and reconciliation until we get justice ' .	-3.5199
A court physician puts a blanket on the corpse of one of the victims of Moore-Ford-Lynchens on July 27 , 1946 .	-5.0238
According to the FBI files received by NBC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the lynching process .	-4.3793
But no one has ever been indicted .	-2.6197
Although the suspects have remained free for decades , civil rights campaigners say that the dual motivation for the Lynch actions throughout the city has always been known : politics and sex .	-5.3674
In April 1946 , a Supreme Court decision made it possible for Georgia ’ s black citizens to vote for the first time in the summer pre-election campaign .	-4.2391
At about the same time as the election , according to the FBI , the black farmer Roger Malcom stirred down a white landowner , Barnett Hester , during a fight - allegedly for a woman .	-4.7447
Brooks said that the rumor in the city was that Hester had slept with Malcolm 's wife Dorothy and that the baby she wore was not her husband .	-4.5520
On July 25 , 1946 , Loy Harrison , a prominent white landowner , paid $ 600 to free Malcolm from prison , according to the FBI .	-2.9888
He was imprisoned by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey .	-2.9051
But when they moved away from prison and approached Moore 's Ford Bridge , a mob surrounded the car .	-4.1278
" It turns out that it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murders , " concludes an FBI report .	-3.2080
" It is also obvious that there was a plot between the state and local prosecution , which was not only involved in the murders , removed evidence and covered up the identity of witnesses " .	-5.1120
Brooks puts it even more succinctly .	-2.3600
" It was an electoral massacre , " he said .	-1.4521
'You have all been killed to send a message to black people in this community : ' If you register and vote , you will do so here . '	-4.6320
For almost a decade , Cassandra Greene led the annual renewal of Moore 's Ford Bridge Lynch murders .	-3.5787
Their presentation is vivid , touching , and based on a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe no longer exists in America .	-5.3542
It is difficult to watch , and even more difficult to look away , but Greene said that is the point .	-3.5944
" We do not want to talk about lynching , because we are then confronted with its ugliness in all of us , " she said .	-4.0716
" But I cannot build a relationship with you if you do not want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have done " .	-4.0125
The rehearsals for this year 's production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen whites and the rest blacks - pushed into a room and listened when Greene launched a well-rehearsed overview of the play .	-5.6316
Wade Marbaugh is Greenes co-director here .	-2.2491
He has been playing the role of the chief clan member for years , but he said that the role will never be easier .	-3.5811
" I feel dirty because I 'm not so , " said Marbaugh .	-2.4784
'But I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return to those times . '	-2.8233
On the other side of the room , the actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rasona , who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester , tried their lines .	-3.6558
The play begins with Malcolm , who joins Hester and afflicts him , furious that he has slept with his wife Dorothy .	-5.7453
" I said n --- he , disappeared from my property ! "	-2.4171
Rasona returns the fire .	-4.1657
There is a pause .	-1.1453
And then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .	-3.4196
Greene laughs the loudest .	-1.2770
" What ? ! " Rasona asked .	-3.2845
He is alarmed and confused .	-1.1911
Was I too tough ?	-1.6423
" No , " Greene said , still kicking .	-2.5814
'I simply do not think that white people said ' n --- he ' then .	-5.3924
" But " , one of the other black actors quipped .	-3.8024
'You only have to hit the hard ' R. ' .	-2.4132
And that is exactly where the energy shifts in the room , a feeling of comradeship replaces the discomfort .	-5.2559
Everyone is busy getting this right , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four people killed .	-3.0824
The scene starts again .	-1.2836
This time , when Rasona says the N word , he says it sharply and forcefully .	-4.6335
No one laughs at all .	-2.1453
This repetition ends violently and quickly .	-2.0567
There are cries , shots and then silence .	-1.7681
A woman , dressed with a funeral dress , stands over the bodies of the actors and carries out Billie Holidays 's stirring praise " Strange Fruit " .	-6.8733
Her voice breaks with every second word .	-2.1565
About a hundred meters behind it a group of about four dozen viewers swears of sweat and tears .	-4.5633
The audience is divided almost equally between black and white .	-1.8216
A couple travelled from Ithaca , New York to see the performance , many just come down the street .	-4.5217
They have experienced Georgia ’ s oppressive moisture every nearly eight hours , when Brooks guides them on a pilgrimage to the burial sites of the Malcoms and Dorseys .	-6.5977
Up to this point , the murders have remained an anecdote , but now , when you stand in the same country where the Lynch murders took place , the air feels like a ghost .	-6.4321
When the final notes of the song end , Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the corpse .	-3.6801
Children flock to their heads , register the fake blood and the quiet bodies and whisper each other .	-4.8164
" They are not really dead , " a little boy mumbles as if he wanted to remember .	-3.6549
After a few minutes Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it is over .	-1.9920
The actors throw away the lynchpin and wipe off their tears .	-3.0583
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh , the man in the suit who played the clan member .	-2.2690
Nick Rasona hugs two of his fellow players and then falls crying in her arms , the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through with him .	-6.9398
" It is okay " , whispers one of the women .	-2.0465
" We know that this is not in your heart .	-2.1271
You did it for one reason . '	-2.0580
Later , the audience joined the actors for dinner .	-3.4858
At a table , a white couple from Atlanta talks about the replica of a black couple they have just met .	-6.5707
Denise Duplinsky struggled to find words that left the performance feeling behind .	-3.6833
" It is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... come from people who look like you and who do it because they look like you , " she said .	-3.3665
" What this really does with me makes me believe that the lynching continues , " she added , " today it is only called police fiction . "	-5.3504
In the same room , Tyrone Brooks Hof sits at his table , eating and recalling civil rights .	-4.7056
He said he had already started planning the show next year .	-3.1580
" The reproduction is in some way inspiring , because it describes the horror of what we have endured , but it is also a moment of learning , " he said .	-3.9923
" If we do not learn from it , then it can happen again .	-4.0346
Those who do not study their own history , those who do not know their own history , are condemned to repeat them . '	-3.4338
The Wagnerians in Bayreuth reconciled " Twilight of the Gods " .	-4.8828
In the fourth part of Richard Wagner ’ s monumental work , director Frank Castorf also insists on a colorful , frivolous staging against a gigantic , six-storey backdrop .	-5.8383
The rotary platform ( designed by Aleksandar Denic ) displays either a shabby street corner with the rest of the walls and the Dönerdore in Berlin , a " plastic and elaste " logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange .	-7.6744
Prior to this , there is an open Mercedes classic car in which the Rheintöchter pose as a rocker , or alternatively an Isetta .	-6.5803
Castorf 's leitmotif - Money , Power and Greed - is remembered by his " ring " production .	-5.9638
The three Rheintöchter - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel , Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonise wonderfully as in the " Rheingold " .	-4.6714
Kess seduce them Siegfried ( Stefan Vinke ) , tear a corpse in the boot in Hollywood style and give the Krawall Clique .	-6.4657
Stephen Milling sings the glorious nasty Hagen that surrounds the aura of a heavyweight boxer .	-5.8367
Brutal the scene when he shoots Siegfried .	-2.5748
Later on Gunther ( Markus Eiche ) must believe in it .	-4.0885
The audience thanks it with strong applause .	-2.5269
The festival takes place every year from November to September .	-7.3912
There is great applause for the Festival Orchestra , which will be shown on stage for the first time - in the light of the great heat again in casual casual casual clothes .	-8.3045
Frank Castorf and his director team were eagerly awaited .	-3.2399
In 2013 , if he had had to endure a resounding whistling concert , five years later , there was great cheer in which the sporadic " Buh " run fell .	-8.9829
Katharina Wagner , the head of the festival , will be delighted with this .	-6.6500
" You realize that the audience has somehow grown up with the " Ring " , " she said shortly before the performance of the dpa .	-4.4485
The audience not only made a form of peace with Castorf , but also grew an understanding of his view .	-4.4563
I draw a positive conclusion .	-2.2497

The Taliban said they had carried out this attack .	-1.9053
On May 31 , a massive bombing in the center of the city killed more than 150 people with the country ’ s deadliest militant attack since the US-led troops ousted the Taliban from power in 2001 .	-3.6640
The violence underscores the precarious security situation in Afghanistan , as US President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of US troops supporting the military and police in the country .	-3.4590
Correspondants say that the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , its policies , and in particular in President Ashraf Ghani 's reputation .	-4.7443
CEPOL Returns Decision to Delay the Smog Rule	-4.2579
The US Environmental Protection Agency has suspended a decision to delay regulation of Obama ’ s administration , requiring states to reduce smog-causing emissions a day after 15 states sued the agency for the move .	-5.9492
The EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to press ahead with the so-called ' ozone provisions in 2015 ' and said that it is showing the Agency 's commitment to cooperate with states .	-5.6747
" We believe in dialogue with and that we respond to our state partners , " said Scott Pruitt , Head of the EPA , in a statement .	-4.9576
In June , Pruitt announced the EPA 's intention to delay by one year to October 2018 the ozone regulations - which will measure pollutant emissions in part of the country to determine where cuts must be made to comply with stricter air quality standards .	-6.6194
A group of 15 largely democratic states , along with the Colombian District , filed a complaint on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .	-3.5181
President Donald Trump ’ s administration has tried to reduce a wide range of environmental requirements imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that Trump says should boost economic growth .	-4.2653
But efforts have triggered the backlash of democrats and nature conservation groups that worry about the impact of greater emissions on public health .	-5.0791
The website of the EPO says that inhaling air containing ozone can " reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms " such as asthma .	-3.8075
Community Council	-1.5628
In the end , the decision was clear : in the event of two votes against , the Municipal Council of Fluorn-Winzeln decides to set up a common area in the future Senior Residence .	-6.3609
Before the discussion , there is an important information : The sales contract for the missing property has been signed , reports Mayor Bernhard Tjaden .	-4.9931
While it will still take time for the area formerly owned by the parish , there is no longer any obstacle to planning the project to be continued by a private investor .	-7.3785
There is a discussion on a Community area for this .	-3.5272
One of the two investors still in the boat has offered to meet the community .	-3.0698
On the ground floor it would provide a living area - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with 70 square meters of space for a special price .	-4.2913
The administration and the majority of the municipal council have the idea that such a common space should not be used as a meeting point only for the residents of the senior-related housing , but rather openly entered the community .	-12.2617
As an example , the word " knickcafé " made the rounds .	-4.7939
The decision , which was made last autumn by allocating funds for the current budget , will be lost by means of funding .	-6.9953
The building is located in the renovation area .	-2.9087
The creation of a Community area , reports Tjaden , would be eligible for funding at 60 % of 30 % .	-3.7251
The proposal for a decision , in order to signal to the investor that he is not going to be thrown a stick between his legs in this respect , provides for the observation that both the saddle - which is similar to the surrounding buildings - and the pulpit roof - which reduces the height of the marriage and makes the construction more economical - would be possible .	-9.0944
Not only Wilfried Sohmer thinks this addition is unnecessary .	-4.0100
If it helps , it happens unanimously .	-3.8561
The common area is not that easy .	-2.7029
Daniela Ruf refers to the many buildings with which you are not so much ahead , for which we are now opposed from the window in the common room , she says , ' I am hard at it ' .	-8.8647
Yvonne Staiger is absolutely in favour of the common area - but absolutely against the participation of local communities .	-5.6818
It sees a hidden subsidy to already wealthy or even foreign investors .	-3.7668
This is not the case , because the acquisition of the area does not give a grant , but instead gets a real value that can be marketed in the event of doubt , the objection is .	-9.5057
Staiger ’ s request to split up the proposal for a resolution is met by three in favour .	-6.2227
Thus , two votes against the original programme , which Stefan Haller sums up : " If we take the decision in this way , we are taking a giant step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure " .	-6.0614

Ancelotti has been responsible for the five defeats in the last six matches and for the lack of balance in the game of his team .	-6.3746
" We know that we are not in the best physical constitution , " said Ancelotti and added : " The most important point is the balance in the team .	-3.1058
It was not good last time . '	-3.1844
However , the 58-year-old believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory season .	-3.7000
" Football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation .	-1.3913
I have great confidence that my team will show these qualities .	-2.5890

Hiking from Star to Star in the Harz	-3.1776
The first " Star Path " is to be created in the Harz region .	-4.0775
The association Sternwarte Sankt Andreasberg plans to do so .	-5.5119
A planetary path exists in Göttingen - since 2003 .	-3.0849
A " star trail " meets the information needs of many visitors to resin , it was said .	-4.9463
It combines nature , science , movement and sporting performance .	-1.9174
The members want to draw up panels along the route and inform about stars and constellations .	-5.6448
In a first phase until 2018 , the association plans to " easily accessible installations at five to six locations " in Oberharz .	-5.3927
Infrage come St. Andreasberg , Braunlage , Hohegei<unk> and Sieber .	-4.2568
The information on the panels should be supplemented by the Internet .	-3.8915
Therefore , good mobile network reception plays a role in choosing the location .	-4.9600
Accessibility is also a criterion .	-1.4940
Later on , the Star Path Zug is to be extended by train .	-4.1227
" On the Star Path , the viewer experiences a lot of interesting facts , for example about the physics of the individual stars , " explained the association .	-6.2087
They also learned why stars have different colors , or why one star shines more strongly than another , although it is much further away .	-4.8696
It also deals with which constellation a selected star is located and when it is best to see .	-5.6266
Since 2014 , the association operates the highest observatory in Northern Germany in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg .	-4.7408
The location in the middle of the Harz National Park , according to the Federal Office for Conservation , is one of the six darkest regions in Germany .	-4.5941
Often the Milky Way and even the Andromeda galaxy are visible with the naked eye .	-3.6086
Since 2003 , at the initiative of the Goettingen Planetarium , the Unistadt has had something similar to the planned Sternewerg - the Planetenweg .	-7.4061
Starting in front of Gebhards Hotel in Goetheallee , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planetary path with its steles leads up to Hainberg and the observatory - as well as an " alien " site in Diemarden ( municipality of Gleien ) with the planet Sedna .	-6.4947
The steles with the individual planets - including the dwarf planet 's Pluto at the end - are set at exactly the distance and scale of one to two billion .	-7.5084
The earth shrinks to a sphere of 6.5 millimeters in diameter , while the exactly 75 meters away Sun measures 70 centimeters .	-4.6280
The total distance of the planetary path is about four kilometres .	-3.9457
While the light from sun to Pluto takes about eight hours , pedestrians need a good hour to get to the bridge with Pluto .	-4.6318
Pedestrians are therefore faster than light in space .	-2.5367
But the march to the next fix star would take half a year .	-3.3034
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time , discuss a possible showdown .	-1.7594
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia , who were to be in a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future under GBP 147 , met for the first time on Thursday .	-4.0923

After Garcia 's victory by unanimous decision on the former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday at Showtime , both fighters are members of the Top Five Pound-for Pound-List .	-4.8653
Garcia stretched out the right hand and said : " How do you , Champion ?	-3.1315
I wish you good luck . '	-1.6870
Lombachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday evening at 7 p.m. on ESPN .	-2.8628
When the pair posed for photos , Lomachenko-Manager Egi 's climate noticed that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the " perfect magnitude " .	-3.7622
" I am a former spring weight , " Garcia recalled .	-2.4446
" I went up for Broner [ to 140 pounds ] , but I 'm not so big .	-3.2581
I am small for 140 .	-0.9633
I would like to get down to light weight .	-2.0304
And he must move to lightweight [ 135 pounds ] and then we fight .	-2.7095
That is what fans are asking for .	-2.8293
Let us give them that . '	-1.4615
Lombachenko agreed .	-1.9396
'Boxing needs this fight ' .	-2.2452
Climate asked whether it should be on pay-per-view , part of a strategy that Lomachenko must fight with a 135 pound debut this year to agree a date next summer with Garcia ( 37-0 , 30 knockouts ) who also has an interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Linares Luke Campbell after their lightweight patch fight in the Forum on 23 September .	-6.2740
" This fight could take place in pay-per-view mode because all the fans asked for it , " Garcia said and then expressed himself openly to fight on the network that offers the best financial package .	-5.4532
We are the best .	-0.6084
No other names can generate this kind of attention .	-1.9151
Whenever they are ready ... '	-1.5961
Garcia said that he regarded Lombachenko as a " enormous fighter " and he may be taking part in his Saturday Battle .	-6.1241
But Lombachenko stopped at the generous praise for Garcia and said that he thought the three-fight champion from Riverside saw " very slowly , sorry Mikey ... you wanted to co-out " .	-8.2731
Garcia said the focus is to show weight , then boxing .	-2.8043
Both said that they could feel the momentum that was built for their own struggle .	-4.0977
" This is the fight that must be carried out .	-2.0892
No other fight generates so much attention and enthusiasm .	-2.3577
I am more than happy to work on it , " said Garcia .	-1.8667
Lombachenko said : " I have been waiting for the top fighters , and that is Mikey .	-3.1227
It will be a great fight . '	-1.9512
Four Injuries to Tyre	-4.2977
In the event of an accident on the A7 on Thursday afternoon , four people were partially seriously injured .	-3.8800
According to the first information , the driver of an Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle at about 4.30 p.m. just before the junction to the market width probably after a tyre platter .	-7.4226
The car slipped to the right into the embezzlement , where it overlapped and then remained on the roof in the green strip .	-7.0139
The four occupants - two adults and two children - were partially seriously injured in the accident .	-2.8158
During the initial rescue service to the injured , the A7 was closed to the north for about an hour , and then the traffic on the left could be passed by the accident site .	-7.1989
Fortinos Hoffmann : ' Trilogy works better '	-4.7972
Andre Hoffmann hopes after the 2 : 2 season start against Braunschweig that the optimization of the defence formation in Aue points .	-5.6098
Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the first round of the season , and the result would not have been the two opposite at the 2 : 2 match in Braunschweig .	-7.5038
" These were two opposite doors too much , and we need to be even more careful in Aue , " says the defensive player from Fortuna Düsseldorf .	-5.7214
In the Erzgebirge the triple chain should also be further optimized .	-5.1934
And a gate after a blow , the Fortunes no longer want to capture .	-5.8684
" For the future , there will be no one standing next to Michael ( Rensing ) . "	-5.1651
Hoffmann is convinced that even after his experience in the preparation with the triad , his team is better equipped than with the four-pack .	-8.5284
" I do not yet know how we will act in Aue " , says his coach Friedhelm Funkel , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , " because we have just in the triad on the semi-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gie<unk>elmann players who can build well , " said Hoffmann .	-6.1244
" It is a prerequisite , but that we harmonise even better and that we do not afford so many mistakes in the design . "	-7.5391
Of course , Hoffmann also drives to Aue to win the game .	-2.6836
" But whether you can speak of a failed start after a draw does not know .	-4.5288
The performance may well be okay , " Hoffmann said .	-3.7778
'If we can have four points on Sunday and concentrate on the Cup , we will certainly be able to speak of a good start to the season ' .	-5.7151
His coach did not want to know anything about this .	-3.3022
" I only judge the start of the season after six to eight days , " said Friedhelm Funkel , who does not want to speak of an advantage over Aue , just because the match of Saxony in Heidenheim had to be cancelled prematurely because of a weather .	-5.8198
" Now they can start the season with a home game , " said Funkel and Hoffmann believed that Aue players might even be a bit fresher , because they don 't have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against a climbing favorite in the bones .	-7.2385
" But they do not know where they are now 100 % , " said Fortuna 's internal defender .	-5.1403
Although the guests from the Rhineland are going to meet in the final ( almost ) finished stadium of Aue as a light favorite on Sunday .	-6.0098
" That we sweep them away , just because we have the right to be among the first six , is nonsense , " says Funkel , whose balance sheet is very positive with only a defeat against Aue from nine games .	-7.1675
" There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga that you have to beat from the start " , explains Fortunos Chief Coach .	-5.6483
" Such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant " .	-2.6659
And so Funkel doesn 't want to experience his players on Sunday .	-4.2476
New Results of Swedish Asylum Age Test Published	-4.3802
The recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , which have undergone a new medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 % of those tested are older than 18 years , but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .	-4.6874
The Swedish Federation of Forensic Medicine ( Rätsmedicinalverket ) started carrying out the tests last year .	-5.7376
During the asylum procedure , they are supposed to make the assessment of age more accurate after the Swedish Migration Agency ( Migration Act ) was criticised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were minors .	-7.5374
To date , migration has sent 6.880 cases to be tested , and the Forenic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2.481 tests from mid-March to July 31 , 2017 .	-5.1099
Eighty percent ( 2002 ) were judged over 18 or older , while in another 25 cases the Forenic Medicine Agency judged that the person was " possibly 18 years or older " .	-4.5512
In 432 cases , the conclusion was that the person is " possibly under 18 years old " .	-2.1766
The tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is called into question .	-3.1782
According to Johan Göransson of the Forenic Medicine Agency , the results have been consistent in recent months .	-3.4535
" We do not see much difference in the statistics of recent months , the numbers are pretty constant , " he said the magazine The Local .	-4.0126
The high percentage of cases in which the person was judged over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker lied over his or her age .	-3.6927
In May , the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases ' suggesting that the person investigated was 18 years or older ' .	-3.7733
When Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results , she found that in 243 of these cases , the person had frankly said that she was 18 years old this year .	-4.2426
The method of medical age assessment , in which x-ray shots of wisdom teeth and MRT recordings of knee joints are made , which are then analysed by dentists and radiologists , has also been criticised in some areas .	-6.2622
One skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute , whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of people to see if they were going through puberty sooner or later than usual .	-5.1535
" I had reason to think about it and I do not think that the type of measurement should be used .	-2.4305
It is very uncertain to judge biological age in this way .	-3.4469
If we cannot say it safely , we should not pretend that we could , " he said to the Metro newspaper .	-6.0127
However , Göransson of the Foresic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests : " In general , you can say that the risk of misjudging a child as an adult is low .	-3.6230
The greatest risk is when the person is just under 18 , in this case this is about 10 % . '	-4.0088
Full in Plan	-1.2535
Work on the three bridges of highway 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well .	-2.1593
On Wednesday a 7 ton heavy concrete section was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach .	-2.8643
" We are very good at the time , it is running super , " says Reinhold Leicht , building manager at the Department of Road Management and Traffic at the government headquarters in Freiburg .	-6.3168
In April the work started at the same time on all three bridges in need of renovation between Schramberg and Lauterbach .	-4.0627
The construction is scheduled for October and it is easy to be sure that the timetable will be met .	-5.0910
The first bridge , coming from Schramberg , leads over the Trombach .	-2.9492
It is a concrete arch bridge covered with red bunker stone and has a total length of 4,80 metres .	-4.9239
It was built in 1900 .	-1.2227
Like the other two bridges , it has come into the years .	-3.3425
In order to guarantee stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated .	-4.1764
The other two bridges cross the Lauterbach .	-2.4260
They are made of red bunker stone .	-3.0059
Both were built in 1939 and are 12 and 10.60 metres long respectively .	-3.7527
The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach has now received a 1.30 m wide bridge cap on Wednesday morning on the north side and 7 tons heavy .	-6.4469
This is a border fortification which is also used as a working path .	-4.3978
On Friday , a 2,20 m bridge cap is to be used on the southern part of the bridge .	-4.2211
This is where the pedestrian path will run .	-5.1358
The special thing about this is that it is finished parts , a patent of the Schramberg company Dizwo .	-4.4238
The other two bridges are already equipped with patented bridge caps .	-2.2436
The laying of lines through the building in Lauterbach required a particularly sensitive approach .	-6.7574
There is also a fiberglass cable , to which many companies are connected .	-4.3242
The residents were informed about the project in advance of the work by hand .	-4.5758
In addition , fish and crabs had to be fished first .	-3.5592
For the bridges between the Bauhaus building and the collecting pond in the direction of Schramberg , the traffic is regulated by a single traffic light .	-9.2698
For the construction work on the bridge at the Lauteracher entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels " Tannenhof " and " Sieben Linden " is closed .	-5.9819
The total cost of the three bridge renovations is EUR 700 000 .	-3.1327
It is financed by the country .	-2.5298
AfD in Gerolstein : A protest at Germany ’ s potato salad . : :	-9.0125
It is not so often the case that parties pull together , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( AfD ) , it comes together , which is difficult to reconcile .	-4.9347
The parties represented in the Kreistag Vulkaneifel ( CDU , SPD , Grüne , FDP , FWG , Linke ) belong to a broad alliance that shows a peaceful flag on that day , because the AfD in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle Rondell invites the " big campaign launch " according to the poster .	-7.3927
And well-known names will be launched - such as Alice Weidel , who together with Alexander Gauland will be the lead duo for the federal election on 24 September , and Deputy Federal President Beatrix von Storch .	-7.7039
But those who are there hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the AfD people , but rather demonstrate .	-5.0541
The motto " The Eifel stays colourful " .	-2.4355
Originally planned as " All at a Table " on the Brunnenplatz , the City Ticket is now taking place in the parking lot below the Rondells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the Stadthalle .	-8.5542
A colourful picture that offers .	-7.7818
And what Christa Karoli , chairman of the A World Forum and one of the relevant organizers , is really pleased : " Great how many people have met here " .	-5.7776
There is music and a lot of food , including a " Urdeutscher Potatosalat , which the AfD could easily eat " , says the woman who brought him along .	-5.5221
The police have ordered a lot of officials to Gerolstein , it shows presence especially at the station , which is only a few meters away from the venues .	-6.2808
How did the AfD actually come to Gerolstein ?	-1.9600
Mario Hompes reported about the AfD Vulkaneifel that he tried to do this and received the award .	-5.9938
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had first asked in Daun , but got a cancellation because of the already built Laurentiuskirmes not enough parking spaces .	-7.0840
So now the Rondell , Hompes is pleased that " we can have such a nice event here " .	-3.1506
In view of the event at Rondellvorplatz , he says : " This is the right of people , the main thing , it remains peaceful " .	-4.7069
This is also the case : around 8 p.m. there is a band for entertainment at the Rondellvorplatz , in the Stadthalle there are various speakers , including the rhinessential AfD Chairman Uwe Junge .	-8.6984
There are about 200 people in the hall waiting for the top candidate for the federal election , Alice Weidel , and Deputy Federal President Beatrix of Storch to make their speeches .	-5.6197
The police presence is unchanged , but so far the officials had a quiet evening .	-3.2995
The AfD event lasts a little more than an hour , the guests on the forecourt have a longer breath , but there is also the time to clean up shortly after 9 pm .	-7.8320
The police can stop - no special incidents .	-3.5184

In the Haslacher series of monastery concerts tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 p.m. in the monastery church , there will be a relistening with the Wolfacher trombonist Frederic Belli .	-7.2973
Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov he gives a concert entitled " Black Sea meets Black Forest " , or even " Balkan folklore " meets a classical German education with roots in brass music .	-4.2580
Both soloists are winners and prize-winners of numerous international competitions and have solo positions in top European orchestras .	-3.9510
For example , Petkov Solotrompeter is the soloist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra at the renowned Concertgebouw Orchester Amsterdam and Frederic Belli .	-4.8052
Both combine the desire not only to cross the boundaries of their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres .	-4.1873
Thus Johann Sebastian Bach sings both in a new guise , Daniel Schnyder 's " World Music " , combined with Bulgarian folklore , and in the play " Exchange Suite " by Nils Wogram , classical music , jazz and free play are combined into a fascinating overall artwork .	-8.0075
This core of the program was premiered in Freiburg only this spring .	-4.0865
The renowned composer Nils Wogram wrote it especially for the two musicians and more : The Haslacher monastery church with its special acoustics is consciously included in the concert .	-5.4905

The Hollywood star 's most famous relationship was Robert Pattinson 's " Twilight " affair , which ultimately fell apart bitterly .	-6.2003
In spite of all this , the brittle actress assures the " Harper 's Bazaar " magazine : " I was seriously in love with everyone I 've dated .	-6.7903

I really felt attacked , scared and ashamed .	-1.9702
Now I look back and think : ' Girls , be proud of you ! ' .	-3.5550
They do not like to explain their love to the public in particular : " People expect you to behave in a certain way and that annoys me .	-5.4127

West Virginia Governor announces that he is changing the Party	-2.8631
. West Virginia ’ s democratic governor , Jim Justice , announced at a rally with President Trump on Thursday evening that he would change the party .	-3.5496
Whether you like it or not , the Democrats have moved away from me , " said Governor Justice .	-2.4178
'Today I will tell you with many prayers and much thought ... today I will tell you , as a resident of West Virginia , I can 't help you any more if I am a democratic governor . '	-4.9621
The rally broke out in rejoicing .	-2.8502
" Tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republicans , " adds Justice .	-2.3985
'As a trainer , I would say that it is time to play another game ' .	-2.4521
Mr. Trump previously promised a major announcement at the West Virginia Rally .	-2.6529
Mr. Trump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not approve Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton .	-1.9885
Justice , which , according to Forbes , is the only billionaire in the state , was elected in 2016 .	-1.8212
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states and inherited a coal business from his father .	-2.9666
It is worth about $ 1.59 billion .	-1.2267
Meanwhile , on Thursday evening , the Republican National Committee issued a statement saying : ' The change of the party by Governor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party that would prevent us rather than work to make our country great again ' .	-5.5508
" With only 15 governements and control of the least legislative bodies in history , Governor Justice 's announcement is only the last rejection of a party that is without leadership from top to bottom and is unable to find a positive , unifying message , " said RNC Chairman Ronna McDaniel in a statement to CBS News .	-6.0302
Coe praises " honest " Russian apology for doping scandal	-2.4546
On Thursday , the global leader of athletics , Sebastian Coe , praised what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia for a doping scandal , but he repeated that it was not the time for the country to get back into sport .	-4.7093
Russia ’ s athletics leader Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF Congress on the eve of the world athletics championships that his country ’ s exile from sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping .	-4.6906
He said he was sorry for " all athletes who were caught up in gold and silver medals in competitions " .	-4.4228
Despite his comments , the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 , after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) found evidence of government-sponsored doping in Russia .	-3.1430
" I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , " said IAAF President Coe to reporters .	-2.6305
'The entire Council and Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has realised with itself that it has experienced some rather hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the federation is redesigned ' .	-5.6186
Coe said that he was also " pleased " that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction .	-3.7490
" I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been made , but Congress supports the recommendations of the task force that this is not the moment to reinstate Russia , " Coe said .	-3.4717
" We must do everything in the coming months to normalize this situation .	-2.8888
The guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate clean athletes from the spoiled system , " he added .	-2.9624
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete as neutral players at the athletics world championships starting on Friday in London , according to the strict IAAF criteria .	-4.6835
The head of the IAAF task force , Rune Andersen , said on Monday that Russia still has to meet some of the criteria for reinstatement .	-2.9141
Drug tests are still inadequate , and banned trainers are still free , he told reporters in London after a lecture at the IAAF Council .	-4.4155
Traurish for Mali ’ s Tied Soldiers	-4.8818
At a funeral in Fritzlar , northern Hesse , about 1000 people thought of the two soldiers who died in a helicopter crash in Mali .	-5.0815
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the Domstadt under high security conditions .	-3.2417
Minister Ursula von der Leyen ( CDU ) said nothing about the still unknown cause of the crash .	-5.1779
However , she called the two pilots who were in the vicinity " experts of her profession " .	-7.4614
" We bow before this highest sacrifice they made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany , " she said .	-3.8898
The 33-year-old Major and the 47-year-old Stabshauptmann from Nordhessen were killed on Wednesday a week ago in Mali , West Africa .	-4.5499
Her coffins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday , accompanied by a German army funeral guard , brought to the Fritzlarer Dom Sankt Peter .	-6.4552
At noon only the members of the church initially took leave .	-4.3850
After that , the funeral started in the family , close friends , representatives of the German Armed Forces and politics .	-9.0169
Among them were Hesse ’ s Prime Minister Volker Bouffier ( CDU ) and the general inspector of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker .	-3.4963
They settled roses and their families stood in arms at the coffins .	-6.9459
In front of the church , Fritzlarer and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas .	-3.2219
Secretary of Defense of the Ley called the nearby soldiers " highly decorated " and experienced deployment .	-6.2679
The Stabsshauptmann was one of the first six trained Tiger pilots of his regiment .	-6.5898
Volker Bauersbach , commander of the regiment to which the soldiers belong , also said : ' If this occupation could not avert the crash , then no one could have avoided it ' .	-5.2782
Doubts about the UN mission in Mali did not show Leyen Minister : the use was dangerous .	-5.0811
But he was also of great importance ' for a country from which we are separated only by two states , ' she said .	-4.8528
After the funeral , the coffins were brought out of the cathedral .	-2.6382
When and where they are buried , the Bundeswehr did not provide information on this .	-4.2264
Prince Henrik does not want a Tomb beside his wife	-2.9941
The Danish Queen Margrehe ( 77 ) , Prince Henrik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death .	-3.5179
This was announced by the Royal House on Thursday .	-3.5057
Traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the Cathedral Church of Roskilde .	-3.8134
The sculptor Bj<unk>rn N<unk>rgaard already made a sarcophagus for the two .	-1.8590
The queen agreed with her husband ’ s decision , the message continued .	-4.2250
Where Prince Henrik is buried is still unclear .	-1.5251
But he has no intention of being employed in his French homeland .	-3.7235
Prince Henrik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .	-3.1401
After the rise of his wife Margrehe in 1972 , he would have liked to become king .	-3.9420
In 2016 , he retired , with the title " Prinzgemehl " .	-4.4962
Since Henrik did not get the title and the function he wanted in Denmark , he did not see himself as equal to his wife - not even after death , Lene Balleby , the chief speaker of the Danish Royal House .	-6.4465
It is still unclear where the final resting place of the 83-year-old will be .	-3.9704
He does not intend to be employed in his French homeland , but in Denmark .	-3.8754
He likes the country he has worked for over the past 50 years .	-2.1695
Born Henri de Laborde de de Monpezat , son of a French noble family , Margrehe met in London in 1965 .	-3.3004
He worked on the Thames in the French Embassy .	-2.3723
During his later wife , Prince Henrik had a difficult position with the Danes in his almost 50-year reign .	-6.8735
In an autobiography , Henrik said about the first years in Denmark : " A few months after my arrival , everything I did was criticized .	-3.6454
My Danish was volatile , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk stockings instead of knicksocks , Citro<unk>n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .	-2.8615
I could not hope for forbearance even for the Gauloises I used instead of Virginia-tobacco , who had a reputation in Germany to be the brand of socially critical intellectuals .	-5.9932
I was different .	-0.7106
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not ashamed .	-2.7520

Prime Minister Weil Wants Rapid Reelection	-2.5015
The CDU and the FDP before the possible majority in Lower Saxony	-3.4974
Lower Saxony ’ s Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) is in favour of a rapid re-election of the country after the loss of the red-green majority in government , but does not want to resign .	-6.1448
Because , on Friday , we called for Parliament to be dissolved .	-3.7705
Previously , the surprising departure of a Green MEP from her country assembly in Lower Saxony had plunged Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) ’ s government into a severe crisis .	-4.8657
Five months before the official election , the red-green coalition in Hanover lost its narrow one-vote majority in parliament to the CDU and FDP opposition .	-4.4956
Former Green MEP Elke Twsten set out her move with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in her constituency of Rotenburg ( Wümme ) .	-5.1653
" I see my political future in the CDU , " she explained on Friday in Hanover .	-2.4802
The CDU leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend that his group accept them .	-4.5613
Thus , the CDU and the FDP together would have 68 seats in the Lower Saxony state parliament , the SPD and the Greens .	-5.2907
So far , the relationship has been reversed .	-1.8563
The new parliament will be elected regularly on 14 January next year .	-3.6489
Thümler said that the red-green state government must now decide whether it can continue to rule without a majority in this situation .	-3.7771
Stephan Weil , however , considers it essential that the country day decides its own resolution as soon as possible .	-5.1796
The Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats is expected to decide on its next on Tuesday .	-4.1675
The state constitution also provides for the possibility that the country 's parliament will deprive the Prime Minister of confidence and elect a successor .	-5.7274
" Our Constitution offers several options .	-1.3564
These possibilities need to be examined legally cleanly , " said Thümler .	-3.8940
'You will discuss all the issues in a calm manner if they are properly examined by law ' .	-6.3740
Thümler called Twum step " but a little curious " .	-5.5965
The politician herself stressed : " I am not a traitor .	-2.4144
I feel very good ' .	-1.1954
She referred to herself as an advocate of black and green .	-3.4862
The Greens called on the renegade Members to return their country ’ s mandate .	-4.7718
" We assume , of course , that she will return with immediate effect her country election mandate , which she received through the Green Land List , " said the country ’ s presidents Meta Janssen-Bakz and Stefan Körner .	-7.7516
The chairman of the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance , Anja Piel , said : ' We very much regret the decision of Elke Twsten ' .	-5.9732
She deliberately decided not to hold a debate in the group .	-3.5758
'Even in the light of the fact that there were no differences in content , we cannot understand this step ' .	-4.7454
SPD candidate Martin Schulz condemns the transfer of Lower Saxony Green MEP Elke Twsten to the CDU as a betrayal .	-4.7486
" The behaviour of former Green MEPs in Lower Saxony is not only a betrayal of the electorate , but also a betrayal of Rot-Grün , " wrote the German head of the Social Democrats on Facebook on Friday .	-5.0502
He supports Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) 's decision to have the country 's parliament re-elected quickly .	-4.0110
Leaving Tw at the latest costs Rot-Grün in Lower Saxony the majority .	-4.8949
The politician puts " in her wounded vanity and in her frustration her personal interests before the welfare of the country " , criticized SPD Secretary-General Hubertus Heil .	-4.3911
" It is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony takes part in this dirty intrigue game and tries to make political capital out of it " .	-5.0318
Niedersachsen ’ s CDU group leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend to his members that they include Elke Twsten in the CDU .	-11.3441
The SPD ’ s leader in the Bundestag , Thomas Oppermann , accused Twsten of falsifying the outcome of the 2013 election with personal career thinking .	-5.0331
At that time , the CDU was the strongest force in front of the SPD , but the SPD and Greens had a very thin majority of one vote in the country ’ s parliament .	-5.9132
Minister of Agriculture in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from poisonous eggs , Mr Schmidt ?	-3.8773
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs .	-1.0596
How could the scandal happen ?	-1.6219
How can consumers protect themselves .	-1.0040
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CSU ) is speaking and answering in an interview with the editorial network Deutschland ( RND ) .	-4.7739
Mr Schmidt , how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs ?	-1.7734
I can only encourage all consumers to look closely at the eggs in your refrigerator and to check the stamp printing .	-3.6954
On the consumer protection portal www.Lebenswarthing.de , the federal states provide the latest information about the affected eggs .	-5.8482
Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .	-1.0763
Even if , according to everything we know at the moment , there is practically no risk to health .	-4.6539
Does Aldi now take the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of the supply - because the central role of the educator is not really perceived by the Federal Minister for Agriculture ?	-6.1629
Food surveillance is the task of the Länder .	-2.7257
Nevertheless , my House has opened up without delay and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since it became known that Germany was affected .	-6.0066
All information and risk assessment is available to consumers .	-2.1300
Trade , like manufacturers , must ensure that the products sold are transportable and harmless to health .	-4.6914
If eggs exceed the maximum residue limit of 0.005mg / kg , they are not transportable .	-3.6818
However , unburdened eggs can be sold and eaten .	-6.7382
This time , the companies are not to blame .	-2.6816
Sitting production companies and consumers in the same boat ?	-2.9194
At present , production companies are not directly to blame .	-4.7840
Rather , they are facing economic damage due to alleged illegal practices by service providers .	-4.6332
As always , there are too few inspectors in an emergency .	-3.1280
Is it only a lack of staff or a coherent competence ?	-4.2199
It was the official controls that revealed the matter .	-3.8085
The truth , however , is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 % excluded .	-3.7175
It is precisely for this reason that it is essential to provide consistent information on such events and to hand over to the public prosecutor in cases where crimes can be committed .	-7.3454
I have already made it clear on several occasions that I expect the responsible authorities to provide full information .	-3.8018
Is regular alarmism really necessary in the case of food scandals ?	-2.7988
Consumers have the right to obtain only safe and transportable food .	-2.3742
If an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly outraged .	-3.0837
Manufacturers , traders and consumers have come into a situation that is absolutely unnecessary because of the adulterated means .	-6.6572
In principle , it must be clear that the illegal use of the insecticide Fipronil in the position of animals supplying food is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately .	-8.6377
This must be pursued consistently and with high pressure at all levels .	-3.9228
I expect all the competent authorities to ensure that the facts are clarified quickly and comprehensively .	-5.6186
How the financial rules of football affect Neymar ’ s move to Paris	-6.5238
The rules aimed at preventing unimpeded spending of European football clubs will not disrupt Neymar ’ s World Record transfer from Barcelona to Paris Saint Germain in Spain .	-4.7899
Any consequences will come for Paris Saint-Germain of UEFA , because the leading organization that has monitored the European game has the power to ban teams from accessing the prestigious Champions League tournament .	-5.5733
Financial fair play rules created by UEFA in 2011 mean that , at some point , the PSG will have to prove that the transfer of Neymar was financed without much loss .	-5.1344
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( $ 262 million ) to buy the Brazilian out of its treaty , and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several tens of millions of dollars per year .	-4.1795
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar 's move to France .	-1.4241
PSG can certainly make the money loose to sign Neymar and bring him to a galaxy of other stars , given the funding of the team by the energy-rich ruling family of Qatar .	-9.2010
Clubs may spend a lot of money on acquiring players , but must counter legitimate sources of revenue that allow them to break out of their football business .	-7.0022
FFP was designed by Michel Platini as UEFA president in 2007 .	-3.1847
The former French player believed that clubs that had incurred huge debts in their quest for success effectively cheat and risk ruining themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support .	-4.6197
In 2011 , FFP shifted from focusing on club debt to monitoring its losses .	-1.9457
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a tougher business .	-4.0096
During the current three-year FFP transition period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses of € 30 million .	-4.3180
And , while the presidency disgraced Platinum in 2015 , its UEFA successor , Aleksander Ceferin , remains committed to discouraging excessive spending .	-4.4579
" Certainly FFP is not dead and we will certainly strengthen the rules for the future , " said Andrea Traversa , who is responsible for FFP at UEFA , to The Associated Press last week .	-3.8857
Although the PSG has paid Neymar ’ s buy-out clause in a lump sum , it can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of its contract .	-4.8029
Neymar has signed a five-year contract , so that the sum of the expenses for the next five years , amounting to EUR 44.4 million , can be recorded in the annual accounts .	-5.5188
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 , together with Abu Dhabi , which owns Manchester City , hit the most severe sanctions .	-3.4171
The PSG received a fine of € 60 million ( then $ 82 million ) , which was later reduced to € 20 million - and it was ordered that the team members for the 2014 / 15 championship league remain limited to 21 players instead of the normal 25 players .	-5.3619
UEFA is looking for clubs to try to outperform their financial supervision by inflating their revenues through companies associated with a club ’ s owners .	-5.6214
While a caterer could sponsor the PSG if the value of the sponsorship were to exceed the standard market rates , UEFA would not allow this to be considered a legitimate income .	-5.7785
That is exactly what happened in 2014 , when UEFA decided that the value of the PSA sponsorship was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .	-3.0184
It has been reported that some of the PSG payments to Neymar could be made by the Organizing Committee of the World Cup 2022 in Qatar .	-3.7400
But PSG and Qatar in 2022 denied that Neymar will become World Cup ambassadors , and such a maneuver could be easy to find out for UEFA regulators .	-4.4415
The previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules .	-3.3161
UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG on Neymar 's transfer , and on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation said .	-5.0567
They spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity , because they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation .	-3.2996
The latest reports show that PSG achieved a profit of more than EUR 10 million in 2015 / 16 , with a turnover of EUR 542.4 million .	-3.8618
The accounts for the last fiscal year are still to be published .	-2.5444
PSG expects Neymam 's arrival to be a blessing for sponsorship deals , merchandising and trikot sales .	-3.6926
The association assumes that sales will increase by at least 30 percent after the signing .	-3.2129
The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players go , and it tried to prevent Neymar ’ s move by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP .	-3.5247
" It is a clear case of " financial doping " with the club and the state , " said the president of La Liga , Javier Tebas , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar 's ultimate ownership of PSG .	-3.6773
Arsenal Manager Arsene Wenger , whose association is owned by an American sports tycoon , shares La Liga 's reservations against a state that finances an association .	-3.8619
" It is the consequence of ownership and this has completely changed the landscape of football in the last 15 years , " said Wenger on Thursday .	-3.0116
" Once a country has an association , everything is possible .	-2.1110
It will be very difficult to respect financial fair play because you can go different ways or have different interests when a country has such a large player to represent a country . '	-4.4452
Swiss is on the lookout for a new shogger .	-4.9930
Over the past few years , Chocolat Frey has produced in-flight chocolate for Swiss .	-4.4936
Now the sweet cooperation is coming to an end : the airline is rewriting the order .	-5.4760
At the request of the news agency sda , Swiss-Sprecherin Meike Fuhlrott confirmed an appropriate report from Friday 's newspaper " Northwest Switzerland " .	-3.9098
According to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .	-2.5913
The products would be inspected every two to three years and subjected to quality control .	-3.1398
" We are very pleased with the current supplier Chocolat Frey , " said the speaker .	-2.4823
About 17 million small , red and white packed 14 grams of shoggita are distributed to passengers each year before landing .	-7.9013
The Swiss did not want to provide any information about the costs .	-3.3892
According to " Northwest Switzerland " , industry insiders estimate the order volume to CHF 1.5 million - the Migros subsidiary generates an annual turnover of around CHF 1 billion .	-10.1611
But the advertising effect is more important than ever : it is a prestigious contract for a chocolate maker .	-4.6018
The Swiss will not reveal how many applicants there are in the new tender .	-4.2927
Only Swiss manufacturers are eligible .	-2.8244
According to the newspaper report , Chocolat Frey wants to renew the treaty beyond the spring of 2018 .	-3.3977
For the sda the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion .	-3.3781
Chocolate tables have been distributing the Swiss on board its flights since 2006 .	-2.9903
Before the Swiss signed a contract with the Migros subsidiary , Barry Callebaut had delivered the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hug .	-4.2021
The possibility of placing the logo was introduced by Swiss two and a half years ago with the launch of the cooperation with Chocolat Frey .	-4.0973
The airline cooperates with different Swiss chocolate producers .	-2.3562
On long-haul flights , First Class customers are treated to treats from the Confiserie Sprüngli , Business Class blue passengers Schoggi from Lindt and Economy Class Schoggi from Chocolat Frey .	-5.5087
Swiss Schoggi from Chocolat Frey also distributes its products in Business and Economy Class .	-5.1840

The Polish title defender Piotr Malachowski , who threw 65.13 metres wide , also qualified for the final fight .	-5.3071
Nostalgia goes to the niche in Wet Hot American Summer and Comrade Detective .	-2.4086
This repetition of the story is nostalgic at the same time for the glorious days of the characters of the 80s , for the 90-year Grunge-era ( when the thinkers David Wain and Michael Showalter shot the sketch comedy " The State " for MTV ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , such as Elizabeth Banks , Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to bigger things .	-5.8882
As a cultural artefact , it is also a parody and an embodiment of our facebookable era of permanent memories .	-3.2338
But as a franchise , it feels like time is running out .	-2.1159
" First Day of Camp " worked surprisingly well , not only because of its absurd humor ( it contained an original story for a spoken can of vegetables , spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .	-3.9166
By focusing on the core of the gag - middle-aged actors play horny children who grow up - they nevertheless managed to get the last part of the joke back .	-6.2232
" Ten Years Later " , with his adults now playing adults , is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more to the watering pot principle , including a reef on the Stalker movies of the 1990s such as " The Hand That Rocks the Cradle " ( " The Hand that Cradle the Cradle " ) .	-6.1522
At one point , a character groans through an Apple Powerbook , some in-line skates , and " a number of other things from 1991 " .	-3.5848
Many of the central stories are the same .	-1.0095
The amiable Coop ( Mr. Showalter ) , now novelist , Katie ( Marguerite Moreau ) has still not forgotten .	-3.6292
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost his virginity .	-1.6140
And there is another crazy malicious plot that includes Ronald Reagan ( also Mr. Showage ) , now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good impression of Michael Ian Black ) .	-5.1212
As always , the excursion is the best part of the franchise .	-1.4843
It is especially fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd , who shows Matt Dillon 's undercoat of " Singles " , whose former big-man-on-camp Andy now feels like an old boy .	-9.1886
These are the moments of random madness that could heat up this franchise like a kind of repetitive " Seven Up ! " series until it reaches what I assume as its logical conclusion : " Wet Hot American Summer : Twenty Years Late " , whose last scene will show the gang how it will visit the film premiere of " Wet Hot American Summer " .	-5.9703
" Comrade Detective " on Amazon is now reminiscent of another kind of nostalgia : the revival of the Cold War of " The Americans " , the film " Atomic Blonde " and even " GLOW " with its East counterWest ring iconography .	-4.7241
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as director indicates to be a TV series found : a Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two policemen as friends , two officers from Bucharest fighting for truth , atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism .	-5.2867
The main characters are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Cornelius Ulici , whose dialogues are synchronized by Channing Tatum ( also an executive producer ) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English .	-4.5981
It is a brilliant idea .	-1.1113
But it is not much more than an idea .	-1.5753
There are some nice gags to credit ( the police spend time watching chess on television , as Americans may be doing with football ) .	-4.1880
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate , Nick Offerman , Mahershala Ali and Chlo<unk> Sevigny - makes for a decent game ' Find the Voice Out ' .	-3.0617
But " Comrade Detective " is so committed to the veracity of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask is included - that it often plays like a single .	-3.2797
In six long episodes , the comedy is not fast or often enough .	-3.9436
" Comrade Detective " , which has been edited to a lesser length , could better deliver its Agitpropag genre , as Gregor and Iosef regularly visit the American Embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who devour a bunch of hamburgers .	-7.6091
The message for the imagined communist public is that Western culture can make everything a feast for the day .	-5.6303
The fictitious Romanian creators were not wrong : we even do it with our own recent history and with theirs .	-2.7334

In addition , officials secured large quantities of marijuana and cocaine , guns , and several hundred thousand euros .	-6.1672
During the same raids in Italy , two people were arrested .	-2.7019
German arrest warrants against the two Italian suspects .	-2.2028
The two are therefore presumably delivered to Germany .	-3.4001
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved .	-6.8859
In total , more than 300 police officers were in charge .	-3.8048
Mafia members are accused of organised drug crime , serious violence , attempted murder and robbery and blackmail .	-3.7461
Since summer 2016 , the Prosecutor ’ s Office has been investigating Konstanz against organised drug trafficking in southern Germany .	-4.4077
Between the public prosecutors in Konstanz and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investigators of the Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .	-4.4185
Therefore , on Wednesday morning , four officials from Palermo accompanied the large-scale operation .	-6.0015
The investigations focused mainly on Italian citizens with close links to the Italian mafia .	-5.3468
An incident on May 27 in Hüfingen , where several shots were fired into a restaurant early in the morning , is also likely to go to the account of the gang .	-6.4053
Considerable gaps in the list of foreigners	-4.8135
" Data from citizens who should not appear " : according to a report , the list of foreigners in Germany has serious shortcomings .	-5.9753
This leads to some serious mistakes in asylum procedures .	-3.4192
According to a media report , the Federal Government 's refugee management officer , Frank-Juergen Weise , has drawn attention to major gaps in the central refugee register .	-5.4314
Deficiencies in the data recorded there could ' lead to serious mistakes in asylum procedures and expulsions ' , warned in a way available to the ' Süddeutsche Zeitung ' .	-6.2159
According to data , the register includes ten million people of foreign nationality , including some 5.7 million from non-EU countries .	-3.8074
The data is thus managed by about 600 foreign authorities in Germany .	-3.4483
Because the data had not been maintained enough , the data quality in parts has not been good .	-4.7181
In individual cases , data from 1921 had been found , " by people who have long since ceased to live , or by citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register . "	-8.2418
" Flawed data input can significantly slow reverse processes , " the report goes on .	-5.4202
Moreover , the statistics on people subject to leave include EU citizens who do not need to leave .	-5.6101
However , such false allocations ' led to a distorted debate on the handling of foreigners ' , according to the analysis .	-6.8373
Meanwhile , the federal government seems to have begun sending refugee families with children under the age of 16 back to Italy once they have arrived .	-4.2730
This is evident from an internal paper by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees ( BAMF ) , reports the Neue Osnabrück Zeitung .	-4.1580
The paper therefore states that the BAMF has been carrying out such procedures ' with regard to families with children - with the exception of infants and infants - to Italy since 1 June 2017 ' .	-5.6595
This has been virtually impossible since the end of 2014 , according to the newspaper , referring to the difficult situation on the ground .	-6.5358
Under the Dublin agreement , refugees are the responsibility of the EU state , which they reach first .	-4.0247
If a migrant travels to another EU country , that state can send him back to the country of entry .	-3.7008
As a justification , the office now writes : ' In the meantime , the capacity for families with underage children in Italy has increased significantly ' .	-6.8179
Italy has given guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families .	-2.5575
Even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECHR ) considers these promises to be sufficient .	-6.8945
Other EU states would also send refugees back there under the Dublin agreement .	-3.0240
The German speaker of the left-wing group in the Bundestag , Ulla Jelpke , criticised this decision : " Families with children are threatened with illegal reception conditions and a threat to the welfare of children because of the shortcomings in the Italian asylum system . "	-6.8565
Second Best Score	-2.6437
A total of 220 litres of blood from people living in Oberreichenbach has already been provided by the blood donor service for other people .	-4.4319
At least of the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .	-3.4371
Jürgen Greule , who , with his now 100 donations , now shared 50 litres of blood .	-5.5877
Traditionally , at the meeting of the municipal council , the community recognizes the multiple willingness to donate blood .	-6.3974
" It is ingenious how our body is designed for this and we pay tribute to the donors who provide their blood for strangers , and also unselfish , " said Mayor Karlheinz Kistner .	-6.5663
" A single blood donation helps several people " , explained Holger Maisenbacher , Head of the German Red Cross ( DRK ) , as the canned food is broken down into its components .	-7.2013
For example , three people could benefit from blood donation .	-2.6982
At the same time , Maisenbacher reported about the actions that will be carried out in the spring in Oberreichenbach .	-4.5033
" This year , with 114 donors , we achieved the second best result , " said the DRK District Assassination Manager .	-7.3014
Obviously , the change to the theatre house a few years ago led to higher numbers of participants .	-4.3278
Before that , Thomas Bockstadt , Susanne Reichle , Sandra Schöck , Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were multiple donors and were awarded for 50 donations .	-7.9363
Half as many Herbert Mair and Dorothee Rixinger , while Tamara Pfrommer , Petra Schleeh , Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter ten times each 500 milliliters of their life juice .	-3.9746
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25 % .	-1.7738
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and the weakening of inflation dampened speculation about an increase .	-3.3207
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain " sluggish " when it kept interest rates on family income in the midst of intensifying pressure .	-3.7662
Policymakers of the Bank ’ s Monetary Committee ( MPC ) voted 6 to 2 to keep interest rates to 0.25 % , with fewer members seeking an increase this month , as weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase .	-4.3314
In its quarterly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecast to 1.7 % for 2017 and 1.6 % for 2018 , warning that the pressure on household income would continue , with inflation expected to rise to just under 3 % in the autumn .	-3.8386
But it signaled the need for interest-rate hikes in the coming years to rein in the inflation fueled by Brexit , and it said that borrowing costs might have to rise more than expected in financial markets .	-4.7919
Members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth package issued a year after Brexit .	-2.5239
It will demand time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financing to banks from next February , although it has been said that it is now expected to provide GBP 15 billion more under this system , with GBP 115 billion sterling .	-5.1088
Minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the bank said : " In the MPC 's central forecast , GDP remains weak in the short term , as pressure on real household incomes continues to strain consumption . "	-5.7909
On interest rates , she repeated that ' a certain tightening of monetary policy ' would be needed to cool inflation and a ' slightly larger ' level than markets expect .	-5.6406
Markets are currently forecasting the first growth in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .	-2.9940
However , the Bank stressed that increases would be ' gradual ' and ' limited ' .	-2.8203
The Bank ’ s downward adjusted growth forecasts for this year and next are compared to the 1.9 % and 1.7 % forecast in May .	-4.3712
It has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .	-2.2314
The pound fell after these news against the dollar and the euro .	-2.7502
The pound fell by 0.5 % to $ 1.31 , and fell by 0.4 % to € 1.11 .	-2.2176
The decision will not change after the recent disappointing growth figures dampened rising expectations of an interest-rate hike , and GDP rose to 0.3 % in the second quarter , from 0.2 % in the previous three months .	-4.5938
Growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will recover slightly after the bank at the end of the year .	-3.5741
The recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and small wage increases , as the tightening becomes even worse before it improves .	-5.3059
It added that monetary policy cannot " prevent " income collapse in the next few years , but it added that wages will " recover significantly " at the end of their three-year forecast .	-8.1833
The economy is also strengthened by rising demand for British goods , owing to the weak pound , which will compensate for part of lower consumer spending .	-3.8044
The decision comes one year after the fall in interest rates to 0.25 % last August after the shocking EU vote , which caused the pound to sink .	-6.1329
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years to achieve full prices and the economy .	-3.5318
Before the Bank ’ s last ruling on interest rates , the call for an interest rate hike had risen , as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households , with three policymakers demanding an increase to 0.5 % in July .	-4.6551
Inflation fell last month from 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % , even though the Bank said that it was expected to do so and that it will attract it again in the coming months .	-4.9388
The Bank said that the excess compared to its 2 % target was ' entirely ' to the weak pound .	-4.4645
Andrew Montlake , director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers , said : " Given the recent decline in swap rates , the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again , because lenders are clamoring for business and want to end the year in a positive way .	-4.6248
The market looks particularly good for those who phase out existing deals and purchase new mortgages , and many with toll-free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . '	-4.6668
NHS ( The National Health Service ) is to prescribe controversial HIV drugs to 10,000 people .	-4.4616
Patients will have access to a " transformative " HIV prevention treatment from September , following a fight before the High Court against funding the drug in the NHS .	-10.1766
NHS England announced that pre-sexual pre-exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 % , is now delivered by the health service through a first three-year study for an estimated 10,000 people .	-5.4265
He agreed to finance the process after last year ’ s appeal court confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court that the NHS had the power to pay for the PrEP , despite claims that local authorities should finance it .	-7.8150
The move announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England chief Simon Stevens as ' important new intervention ' , whereas the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) called this a ' decisive moment ' .	-4.5069
Sexual health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool , and Sheffield will be among the first to allow people to register , and other clinics will follow in October , before it is introduced across England in April 2018 .	-4.2269
Preexpose prophylaxis ( PrEP ) is a consequence of HIV treatments taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .	-4.2669
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in the event of infection risks .	-3.4813
Taking PrEP before intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in a person ’ s body to prevent HIV infection .	-3.4237
Such drugs can be taken every day or even two hours before sexual activity .	-3.6048
Those eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men , transsexuals and people with HIV-positive partners who have not been treated successfully .	-2.7619
Clinics identify suitable participants who agree to the study , including men , women , transgender , and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not , as we know , controlled by antiretroviral treatment .	-4.2342
People who live in England and are registered with a family doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .	-3.9758
The program will be $ 10 million and NHS England signed a contract to deliver drugs this week after an international competitive procurement .	-2.9922
The study aims to assess the entire potential of PrEP by gathering clinical evidence , as targeted , recorded and implemented on a large scale .	-5.1985
Stevens said : " This major new intervention should complement and surpass the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .	-3.0549
It is another milestone in more than three decades of progress in addressing one of humanity 's greatest health challenges . '	-3.6763
Deborah Gold , Chief Executive of NAT ( National Aids Trust ) , said : " This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .	-2.5763
PrEP , if targeted at vulnerable and needy people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic .	-5.4255
From September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner , which will lead to an improvement in many lives .	-5.4757
We warmly welcome this announcement ' .	-2.1364
Ian Green , CEO of the Terrence Higgins Trust , said : " The priority must now be to ensure that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one with a risk to HIV is left behind .	-4.6507
Now that PrEP testing medicine has been obtained , we are on the way to protecting more than 10,000 people infected with HIV . '	-4.0653
Sharon Hodgson , shadow health minister , said : " The start of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delay and delay in government implementation .	-4.2981
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-threatening infection .	-7.5100
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of PrEP .	-2.6930
It is now important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV infected and that it will help us to move a step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society ' .	-5.3353
Living great life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have transformed this little Earls Court apartment into a generous home .	-3.6223
Joanne Leigh , a former banker with a passion for real estate , moved from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014 .	-3.0096
It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags .	-3.0701
" Before that I lived with my Ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room , " says Joanne .	-3.2082
" I was looking for something that was comparable to my prize . , , and .	-8.3650
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and she had the same high ceilings .	-2.1539
I fell in love with her and made an offer on that day . '	-2.6861
Since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely overhauled .	-4.2058
Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to walk through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and an mezzanine floor to make the most of the spacious ceiling .	-5.3327
" I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .	-1.5076
That was my request , " she says .	-1.8466
To this end , they commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne .	-4.6758
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other , so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor in which to stand .	-4.0996
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the task .	-2.2823
" The steel mill is rather complicated , " he explains .	-2.6632
" We had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked on top of each other without having to pay for them .	-5.1770
It was not just a question of building a simple platform , but of creating steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . '	-5.2816
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms on top of each other at full height - with much additional drama .	-4.2678
For the mezzanine floor , a classic retrouvius copper window looks down over the glamorous living area .	-3.8231
mirrored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program .	-3.9917
Using mirrors plays a role in adding theatres , space , and light .	-2.3668
At both ends a short corridor is mirrored to allow it to work longer .	-3.6664
In the kitchen the mirror feels like a window in another room .	-3.0101
At the entrance , mirrored units provide space for all cutlery and glasses of Joanne .	-3.2265
Through the perception of a glamorous room , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .	-3.9053
Connectable kitchens are nothing new .	-2.7509
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door .	-2.7213
" A bit of engineering went into it , " explains Erfan from the steel reinforced , veneered MDF door .	-3.9726
'It is countervailing , so when you push the door it glides very easily . '	-5.0286
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Joanne gained additional 16 m <unk> , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .	-3.9313
" At the end of the day you will sell the base area - or as your property is valued " , says Erfan .	-4.0386
" In a rudimentary form , a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on ground size . "	-12.0793
Here they have managed to increase the floor space while using high-quality materials that give the space its luxurious advantage .	-5.1603
" The materials are the things you touch and that help to create an emotional bond in a home , " says Erfan .	-3.8144
" You do not fall in love with the electrical sockets in the walls .	-2.4490
These are important , but they do not play with your heart . '	-2.1006
It shows that an apartment can be transformed by good design and increased square meters from something standard to something quite amazing .	-5.0992
Indeed , like Joanne , you could decide not to leave it .	-2.5169
Brothers Fight for a $ 500 million Real Estate Empire	-2.3804
Two brothers , four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty , are in a dispute over one of the largest property empires of Victorias worth more than $ 500 million .	-4.8569
The former director of the ' Carlton Football Club ' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak , just three doors away from his younger brother Paul , who has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and assets are to be shared .	-4.8487
Paul has wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp battle over separation takes place in the Supreme Court .	-4.2944
Together with her mother Anna , the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars since the family bought a store on Smith Street , Collingwood in 1973 .	-4.1451
The Westco Jeans family was founded there and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores .	-3.5759
It was sold for USD 85 million in 1999 .	-1.6694
This money has been invested in real estate and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the city centre , the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller and shopping centres in the suburbs .	-3.9999
According to an agreement with her late father , Colin - described by Paul as " the main operator and the dominant personality " in the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of the assets of the company and Paul about a third .	-5.5639
A court order states that this means that Colin owns $ 316 million , and Paul owns $ 176 million .	-4.1023
The distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .	-2.7316
" The divisions proposed by Colin left him with what I thought was the best objects , " he wrote in a first Affidavit in 2015 .	-3.3060
Last Friday , after several failed conciliations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place .	-2.2753
The brothers are now also fighting for control of the existing business - of which Colin , as Paul claims , has ruled him out .	-4.6432
Colin argues that this is not true , but accuses Paul of administering some possessions incompetent .	-3.9316
In an early Affidavit submitted by Colin , he says he hopes to settle the dispute .	-2.2380
" My Italian heritage claims that the family is the most important priority , " he wrote .	-3.0532
Costs rise in the case , with hundreds of pages of Affidavits , e-mails and reports from companies , including Deloitte , Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan Myers , QC , and law firms held by both sides .	-4.6602
Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicatessen shops from the late 1950s and bought a store in Brunswick in the early 1970s .	-3.9117
They took advantage of the security to buy the Collingwood property in which Colin opened the family 's first jeans shop .	-4.5096
Colin says he started Westco there when he was " in my last years of high school , when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) . "	-6.0521
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass on their property to their sons amicably .	-2.7135
" Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to go to court , " she wrote .	-2.7632
Two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lutis group , with Colin claiming that Mark was paid $ 10 million on leaving the company , and Luke $ 26 million on leaving . , , , and are , , , , , , , , , and . are , , , , , ,	-10.1281
Both Lukas and Mark were " bitter about the conditions of their financial separation " , Paul says .	-4.0868
Colin was very reluctant , although he was a former AFL member of the board and , after a 2015 biography by Eddie McGuire , the best friend of the television star .	-6.0738
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers .	-1.0993
Only Colin answered by SMS to say " I really can 't say much " because the case is before the courts .	-3.0727
" It is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and draw our family name through the courts , " he wrote .	-2.6952
In mid-2016 , Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to fulfill his brother ’ s demands .	-2.9091
" Our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end in our current dispute , " he said and added that he " still hope for a solution " .	-3.1044
On Friday , that hope seemed to be over .	-2.7965
" Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future , " Colin wrote .	-2.6075
Trump ’ s new chief of staff is planning to limit the president ’ s media abstinence .	-2.2322
Others tried and failed .	-1.5682
Perhaps John F. Kelly can .	-1.7042
If so , he will be the first .	-1.3857
Politico reports that the White House ’ s new chief of staff is planning to limit the flow of information to President Trump – including news media reports – in the hope of keeping the chief on a more consistent course .	-4.4144
Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey :	-5.5130
" When John F. Kelly , the White House ’ s new chief of staff , met senior officials on his first day of work , he was a major problem in President Donald Trump ’ s White House , which he wanted to repair : poor information falling into the hands of the president .	-5.1926
Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he were given good information . '	-6.5758
Kelly ’ s diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet .	-3.9361
President Trump ’ s relationship with television goes back decades – and now that he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong .	-2.9702
" If candidate Trump was angry about unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting from those who were to be convinced , " said former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg to Politico in February .	-5.3444
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that " the key to keeping Trump ’ s Twitter habit under control , according to six former campaign officials , is to ensure that his personal media consumption carries a constant praise . "	-4.5558
Okay .	-1.9726
But the idea that Trump ’ s Twitter habit has ever been “ under control ” is ridiculous .	-1.7653
Perhaps these campaign officials know something we don 't know - that Trump ’ s tweets would have contained even more fuel without their intervention .	-4.3791
We will probably never hear about the tweets Trump has not sent .	-4.8511
If his employees have managed to keep him out of trouble several times , their efforts have been worthwhile .	-4.4254
But no one has consistently prevented Trump from provoking controversy .	-2.0530
Part of the problem is that people in a White House made up of competing parties keep trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump with material that may promote their views from the world .	-4.5415
In May , Politico , which deals entirely with this story , reported the advisers ’ preference to provide the president with dubious information for strategic reasons .	-7.2460
This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher :	-1.5530
" Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can respond like a volcano to negative press cuts , especially those with damaging leaks , and that he is bent on finding out where they come from .	-7.1010
That is exactly what happened at the end of February , when someone maliciously gave the president a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com , the website of Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson , who accused Vice Chief Katie Walsh of being " the source behind a heap of leaks " in the White House .	-4.9060
Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for harassment , or that he offered no concrete evidence , or that in the past he made false accusations and revoked them .	-5.2276
Trump read the article and began to ask people about Walsh . "	-3.1872
Goldmacher added that then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the White House Secretary General , Rob Porter , " have " tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork Trump receives . "	-3.7959
How did that work ?	-1.7313
Kelly tries to do the same three months later .	-2.0249
Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective manager than Priebus , but Trump is still his impulsive self , and his advisers are still seeking influence .	-3.7234
These immutable factors make Kelly ’ s mission very difficult .	-3.2197
Most Wanted Criminals Get Europol Post	-3.9077
Since the address is unknown , the support of the population is requested and hoped for .	-4.7718
Police across Europe this summer send ( virtual ) postcards to dangerous criminals on their way . .	-8.3217
Since the addresses of the serious criminals in question are not known by nature , information from the population is expected and requested .	-7.1365
Europol reported on Friday the action following the ' EU Most Wanted ' Advent Calendar of winter .	-3.4940
Experience has shown that many refugees are hiding in holiday destinations , as Europol said .	-4.4907
21 postcards of wanted criminals from 21 EU countries have been put together .	-3.8643
Since 2016 there is the www.eumostwanted website , more than 2.5 million times it has been viewed .	-4.3880
36 of the online requests have been arrested so far , at least 11 of them on the basis of references to the publication on the website .	-4.9890
Travellers negotiate a ditch and return to the ' Millions ' row .	-3.5397
Some of the wealthiest property owners of the West Midlands are back with some determined travelers at war , who negotiated a moat drawn by the community to reclaim a field in front of their stately homes .	-8.5521
The travelers parked their 20 caravans on a field outside a wealthy street of Solihull called the " millionaires series " .	-4.8492
They brought horses , babies and an army of transporters after they were thrown out only in May , without being deterred by a ditch dug out by the Council to prevent their attacks .	-5.3102
The tactical group found a gap in the defense facilities and pressed their vehicles through a section that remained uninhibited to find a way .	-4.2922
Angry residents have afflicted the advice of Solihull , who said that it was ' useless to deal with the problem ' .	-5.4193
An anonymous resident said : " They went there on Monday evening after they were sent by Bentley Heath where they threw stones on the passers-by .	-4.1797
The Council must be forced into action by shame because it was useless in dealing with the problem .	-4.1030
The passengers were there in May , were moved and are now back .	-3.7189
More came last night , probably even more today . '	-2.8970
She added : " The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by long assignments to protect its parks .	-4.2552
I live on Streetbrook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my local tax if the Council cannot even stop it . '	-3.1053
A resident who did not want to be mentioned said : ' It is ridiculous , we have just seen the last round of these travellers , just to be plundered by another round .	-4.1928
The numbers have increased this time and you have even seen a horse in the park . '	-3.8364
A Solihull Council spokesman said : ' We are aware of an unauthorised warehouse in the country beyond Streetbrook Road and are working with Solihull 's police , and we are taking the necessary legal steps to ensure that they continue as soon as possible .	-7.3092
To support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible report anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101 .	-2.6967
This will help to create a picture of the situation in which the Court will have to examine when we will present our case . '	-5.4332
Coming from Birkenhof	-6.9440
The former Hotel Birkenhof becomes the Waldhotel Luise .	-2.4762
The house at the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and is to be reopened on 1 March next year .	-8.5030
These are good news for the city .	-1.6114
After all , with the closure of Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH as of 13 April 2014 , around 30 000 overnight stays per year were lost and also income from the spa tax .	-6.1145
In the autumn of 2014 , with dramatically rising numbers of refugees coming to the district , the hotel building was offered to the Landrat Office as a collective accommodation , causing controversial discussions .	-6.3348
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by establishing a construction plan to secure the area as a hotel location .	-3.8954
The decision was not uncontroversial in the municipal council at the time .	-4.1633
But above all Freudenstadt Oberbürgermeister Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and already talked about serious prospective guests at the hotel .	-5.6862
He should be right .	-1.0626
The Luisenhotels Group with Managing Director Birgit Scherer , based in Bad Bergzabern , has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to turn it into a house of the three star plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise .	-5.6317
The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object .	-2.6498
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb .	-1.8598
You are called Hotel Luise , Luisenpark , Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise .	-1.2168
At the former Hotel Birkenhof , construction containers have been in front of the entrance for a long time , and when you enter the house , it becomes clear what extensive renovation work will be carried out .	-7.1450
The floors were torn out , ceilings were partly dismantled , old bathtubs were removed from the rooms .	-4.5850
The staff were very friendly and helpful .	-5.0336
Much remains to be done by March .	-2.1330
" It is actually a nice hotel , " says Thomas Scherer talking to our newspaper .	-2.9098
Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style .	-3.1437
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers , the entrance area is redesigned and new windows are added .	-4.2914
Everything should later become " pretty close to the citizen " , as Thomas Scherer puts it .	-3.9339
'We want to make a jewel out ' .	-2.6164
The facilities include a swimming pool , spa and meeting room .	-3.3700
You don 't want to position yourself at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad , but even at an elevated downtown level , Scherer emphasizes .	-6.8085
The Waldhotel Luise , with its 60 rooms , wants to stand up wide , explains Scherer .	-7.1346
Both individual tourists , groups and business people should feel at home in the hotel .	-5.2869
He has already had discussions with OB Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause , says Scherer .	-4.0304
The staff were very friendly and helpful .	-4.8693
'We are on the same line ' .	-1.5779
When asked about the level of investment , Thomas Scherer does not want to be precise .	-3.6581
Less than EUR 1 million , he expects .	-3.7046
The exterior systems are also brought on the front , which is already clearly visible .	-6.0889
A large terrace is created in a courtyard , which will be accessible from the restaurant , which is open to the public .	-5.0391
Thomas Scherer is optimistic : " Freudenstadt is a good market " .	-6.2799
Russia affair : United States Special Counsel sets Grand Jury	-3.6540
In US President Donald Trump ’ s Russia affair , Special Counsel Robert Mueller is alleged to have set up a so-called Grand Jury after a report .	-4.4816
The panel has started work in recent weeks , wrote the Wall Street Journal , citing people familiar with the matter .	-5.4296
The newspaper regarded the move as a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified his investigation .	-3.7915
CNN reported that there are already first subpoenas from the body in connection with a meeting between Trump ’ s oldest son and a Russian lawyer .	-4.6056
US intelligence agencies have been accusing the Kremlin of meddling in the 2016 presidential election campaign for some time .	-3.3004
Mueller is investigating whether there have been agreements between Trump ’ s campaign team and Moscow .	-3.3368
The investigation will focus on several men who acted as advisors to the Republican in the campaign .	-4.5128
Mueller reportedly also looked more and more at Trump ’ s private and business environment .	-3.3284
The Washington Post wrote a few weeks ago that the special investigator , Trump , has put himself at the center of attention , investigating whether the president may have obstructed the judiciary in the course of the affair .	-7.6468
The main task of Grand Jurys is to check the evidence in possible criminal cases and to decide whether charges should be made .	-6.2941
Grand juries are therefore also called accusers .	-3.8670
Most of the time they are turned on when they are large and controversial cases .	-5.1955
The procedure always takes place behind closed doors .	-2.1996
The body can also be activated by the Public Prosecutor to charge people for consultation under oath .	-5.6324
CNN has already issued charges about the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer .	-4.3674
People who took part in the meeting were asked to make a statement , as the report says .	-6.6932
They should also provide documents .	-1.2908
In addition to Trump Jr. , Trump ’ s advisers and son-in-law Jared Kushner , as well as his then campaign leader Paul Manafort , were also in the conversation .	-5.8369
Legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the appointment showed that Mueller would not be intimidated in his work and that , if necessary , he wanted to act quickly .	-5.8745
However , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on in order to decide on the prosecution .	-5.6854
Nevertheless , the establishment of the body is the beginning of a new phase in the investigation and a new cause of concern for President Trump .	-5.3958
In the midst of the new revelations , the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portray the Russia affair as a campaign by his political opponents .	-3.1538
" Russia 's history is a total invention , " Trump said .	-1.9867
The subject gives the democrats a chance to ' feel good because they have nothing else to talk about ' .	-3.7914
His special adviser Ty Cobb stated in an opinion that he did not know about setting up a Grand Jury .	-4.0082
But they also usually work in secret , he emphasized .	-4.5521
The White House is in favour of any measures to speed up the work of the Special Investigator in a ' fair ' way .	-3.9342
The former FBI chief James Comey said three times that the president is not being investigated .	-3.6280
There is no reason to believe that this has changed , as the statement continued .	-4.7005
But Mueller was only deployed after Trump fired Comey .	-2.0489
This blunder caused accusations against Trump that he wanted to obstruct the judiciary .	-5.0826
Comey told a Senate committee in June that Trump had asked him to stop investigating then-national security adviser Michael Flynn .	-3.3720
The President is under great pressure for the investigation .	-2.5042
After the presentation of US media , the White House collected material against the Special Investigator and his staff .	-4.1217
This sparked speculation about whether Trump wanted to dismiss Mueller .	-3.5250
In contrast to an independent Congressional Special Counsel , such as the Watergate affair of President Richard Nixon , who later resigned , Mueller has a position in which , in theory , he could be fired by the Ministry of Justice at the president ’ s request .	-5.8463
Several senators from both parties want to prevent such a move .	-2.9881
Two groups of Republican and Democratic senators presented draft legislation on Thursday that the Special Investigator could no longer be dismissed so easily .	-4.8072
Antarctica : Giant Ice Mountain in Antarctica	-3.0436
In western Antarctica , a gigantic iceberg of nearly seven times the size of Berlin has been broken off from the shelf .	-6.6973
This was announced by the Bremerhavener Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .	-3.1921
The colossus , which weighs more than one trillion tons and 5800 square kilometres , is now drifting north and will probably take two or three years to melt .	-5.5158
It is one of the largest ice giants in the last three decades with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres .	-4.5468
It does not pose a threat to people .	-3.1773
The extent to which climate change has played a role in breaking down the iceberg is unclear according to research .	-4.3811
However , for some 30 years , there has been a series of unusual eruptions of ice shoals in the region , writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice ( NIDC ) in a factual background .	-6.4470
Many researchers believe that this could be linked to global warming .	-2.5846
The now broken colossus has been part of the Larsen C-Schelfeis .	-4.7980
Schelfeis floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers .	-2.1832
As a result , it continues to grow into the sea , breaking down regularly .	-6.0239
The Larsen C-Schelfeis lies south of South America almost at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula .	-3.2566
North of this slap , the balance of growth and breaking off was disturbed a few years ago .	-5.4881
A complete shelf shoe was broken there , writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen .	-5.3482
There is much to suggest that the Larsen C-Schelfeis is also at risk , because the front edge has never withdrawn as far as it is now .	-6.8501
In addition , the ice plate is under tension and can collapse if a piece breaks down at a key point .	-6.3134
The melting of Schelfeis and iceberg does not raise sea levels , as they swim on the water and supplant ice as much water as it does after melting itself .	-5.1783
However , the loss of the ice shelf means that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before .	-5.5400
This may increase sea levels , but only to a small extent , writes the British research project on Antarctica ( Midas ) .	-4.3587
The Larsen C-Schelfeis , according to AWI data , is the fourth largest Antarctic shelf , with almost 50 000 square kilometres .	-5.8962
On the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the open ocean about 200 meters .	-4.9681
That is where it stops regularly .	-4.1659
" Although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change , the ice sheet is now in a more dangerous position , " said Martin O 'Leary of the UK Swansea University .	-4.5532
" This is the broadest retreat since records began , " he also confirmed .	-4.0765
Among scientists , it is controversial whether the Larsen-C-Schelfeis will now grow again or go back in the long term and possibly collapse , said his colleague Adrian Luckman , adding : " Our models say it will be less stable " .	-5.8510
But this development will take decades .	-1.9449
Even if these researchers do not attribute the demolition of this gigantic iceberg to climate change , a great many ice cuffs of the Antarctic Peninsula have collapsed in recent decades .	-5.6726
This long stretch of the Antarctic stretches towards South America .	-3.0471
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey , the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has fallen by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s .	-3.1127
The rise in temperature has contributed to the decline .	-2.8343
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed about three degrees over the past 50 years and is therefore one of the areas where the temperature is the fastest .	-5.6129
CDU Wants a Personal Income	-9.1901
Because it is becoming more and more difficult to fill vacancies , the CDU is calling for the employers ' association to leave in order to become more attractive .	-5.8268
Just before the summer break , the Kreistag has left 41 new posts in the administration .	-5.0558
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann .	-2.5938
Now , 17 trainees have completed their first working day .	-4.4201
The teachers at the circle are obviously very sought after .	-4.9316
Some 620 applications were available for the places to be awarded this year .	-4.5985
However , the circle still lacks staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks .	-4.9233
At present , there are still 50 unoccupied positions in the Mettmann district .	-4.1341
Among others , doctors and engineers and general administration staff are required .	-6.3353
The CDU wants to take the initiative together with the German Free Democratic Party ( FDP ) and the UWG in the district day to address the shortage of skilled workers in administration .	-6.2502
According to the wishes of the parties , the administration shall " develop a concept for personnel recruitment and personnel development " .	-5.4290
The aim is not only to meet short-term demand for skilled workers , but also to counter the shortage of candidates in a forward-looking manner , it is said .	-6.1178
The overall concept should be oriented to the inside and outside world , should highlight concrete measures for cross starters and should include a training offensive , calls for the CDU , the FDP and the UWG .	-7.4488
This sounds like a good approach .	-1.8280
Because the circle is dealing with personnel problems that were not known before .	-6.5084
Other cities attract good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .	-2.8291
We are talking about a real ' competition between public employers ' .	-3.4386
In addition , a large number of employees leave the service due to illness or age .	-3.7288
So it is high time to act so that no more jobs are left vacant .	-4.6540
But Klaus-Dieter Völkern , head of the CDU group , and his party go beyond the joint motion .	-4.8467
He recently caused a nasty surprise in the district day , when he publicly questioned the staffing ceiling and stunned the other parties .	-6.8481
People want to see all possible ways of leaving the local employers ' association reviewed .	-5.2423
" If we do not find a satisfactory solution here in the short term , the district administration should strive for a domestic tariff with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the cities in which they are connected " , states peoples .	-8.1568
In doing so , the CDU is trying to pay employees and officials better than the public service tariff system actually provides .	-5.7180
The salaries are currently precisely prescribed , increases or more money are only available if you move to a higher level , which is based on years of work .	-7.0788
But the circle ’ s tasks have grown more and more in recent years .	-3.1390
It was only a few weeks ago that new rooms had to be set up in which employees took care of the provisions of the new law on the protection of prostitution . is .	-5.7533
Not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers , Landrat Thomas Hendele and district director Martin Richter have a problem : they have too few staff .	-4.5678
Italy ’ s Tone on NGO Migrants ’ Rescue	-7.7803
Italy has warned NGOs using lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they cannot continue to do so unless they comply with new rules for their operations .	-4.5900
" If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue to work , " said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa .	-3.2056
Minniti 's warning came a day after the Italian authorities seized a boat from the German aid organisation ' Jugend Retreat ' because their team had effectively cooperated with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration .	-4.3661
The aid organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to comment on detailed accusations by the Italian public prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio .	-5.3181
" For us , saving human life is and remains our top priority , so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , " said the organization in an opinion on the social media .	-4.8863
'We can only judge all the accusations currently being made after we have gathered all the information and can assess the situation ' .	-4.9836
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the boat of ' Youth Savet ' , the Iuventa , since October .	-3.3963
It is suspected that his crew will take on board rubber boat migrants who will be delivered directly to them by human traffickers and that the smugglers will be able to leave so that the ships can be used again .	-7.3982
At least one meeting was supposed to take place just 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the act of the prosecutor , whose content was published by Italian media .	-4.6779
The crew is suspected of flouting the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , which monitors the rescue operations in the area for humanitarian reasons and not for any other reason .	-4.9042
Under the code of conduct , boats like the Iuventa must , above all , have an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities .	-3.6008
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue missions have so far agreed to abide by the code : Save the Children , MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain .	-3.3475
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be regarded as unnecessary , but acceptable , as they would not entail ' significant changes or obstacles ' to their rescue operations .	-4.5573
Among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel Laureate Organization is Doctors Without Borders ( MSF ) .	-2.4401
Minniti has now said that the number of migrants arriving after the rescue operations in Italy has fallen sharply in recent weeks , suggesting that efforts to strengthen Libya ’ s coastguard and cooperate with local mayors have borne fruit .	-4.8751
" In recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , " said the minister .	-2.4286
He has announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives , and with Chad , Niger , and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants that these countries are leaving in the hope of reaching Europe .	-8.6032
Rise and Trials	-2.8396
Nine Weilermer Biker , the " Berliner Outpost " and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the Nordpfalz to enjoy trials and sights for four days .	-4.7421
Three friendly guides were available for this .	-2.7661
The accommodation in the Wachenheimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .	-3.2371
The Wachenheim Castle and Wine Festival was a welcome extra .	-2.5194
The first tour led at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim .	-3.1983
It was followed by vantage points , partly on towers , from which one could look far beyond the Pfälzer forest and the upstream plains .	-7.3090
In between , there were always longer climbs for which long trials were rewarded .	-4.8017
On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and the Volkssfest sausage market .	-4.4070
Again there was a lookout point , connected with " flowige " trials and moderate climbs .	-6.2913
On the last two days many vertical meters were announced again .	-4.3458
Caverns , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and wine huts provided welcome breaks .	-4.0281
In Bad Dürkheim , bikers breathed healing brine in the open-air inhaler .	-4.5430
New town was also under control .	-3.9871
After 173 kilometres and almost 4500 metres of altitude , the group had met the Palatinate Forest from its best side - sporty and cultural .	-5.0135
Console Instead of lawn - Bundesliga equips itself for E-Sport	-4.5923
Are the sports stars sitting in front of computer consoles in the future , instead of sitting through the stadium in wind and weather ?	-7.3298
Fact : E-Sport has long since become a serious industry , a lucrative business - including big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high stakes .	-4.4291
This has also been recognised by the first Bundesliga clubs , which are increasingly involved in this area .	-5.3027
FC Schalke 04 and VfB Stuttgart , who founded an e-sports department in mid-July and signed a contract for two professionals for the FIFA 17 computer game , , , , and . , , and are . are . are . are , , , , , , , , and	-9.9081
" We hope to inspire new young target groups to VfB , " says Managing Director Jochen Röttgermann .	-4.4144
He is sure that " there are still many clubs on this train " .	-4.9635
Next weekend , FIFA , the World Football Association in London , is organizing the first " Interactive Club World Cup " in which players from different clubs compete .	-6.6454
Besides Schalke and Wolfsburg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven qualified .	-2.7725
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sports .	-2.0386
The former coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players .	-2.8377
" Real football has to deal with the 14-30 year olds in particular , that young people will continue to go to the stadium in the future , " says the 52 year old .	-5.2185
And : the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian ones .	-3.3689
With prominent e-athletes under contract , these markets could be seen far more often online than just sending Bundesliga teams to Asia once a year .	-10.1486
What is it all about ?	-2.2561
In E-Sport , computer games such as " League Of Legends " , " Dota 2 " , " Counterstrike " or even the football simulation FIFA are played at competitive level .	-8.5476
As in normal sports , leagues have long established in which the professionals compete against each other .	-4.8260
And at Asia games 2022 , E-Sport is already part of the official program .	-3.2503
But is it a real sport ?	-2.5455
For many , the idea certainly needs getting used to .	-4.1488
Ingo Froevil , too , has long grappled with the question .	-4.5673
For the professor at the German Sports Academy in Cologne , E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in classical sports - for example increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormonal changes .	-5.7686
It also needs cognitive skills , technical and tactical understanding , and rapid response .	-3.9002
Professional gamers should not only train at the console but also their bodies and take care of nutrition .	-4.4669
'The fit player is a good player ' .	-1.8458
But there are also problems : ' doping is becoming more and more a topic ' .	-4.7077
Controls are difficult to implement in online games , and in the scene the structures of classical sport were missing .	-5.3905
On the positive side , the scientist highlights the high integrative impact of e-sport .	-4.9889
The players are on the international road , this is like a big global family , there are no intercultural barriers .	-5.4381
A study by Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software ( BIU ) predicts rapid growth for E-Sport .	-3.4068
In 2016 , this meant that EUR 50 million had been implemented in Germany , mainly through advertising , sponsorship and big tournaments .	-5.8188
In three years , sales are expected to be 130 million .	-2.8649
This is little against the nearly € 2.4 billion of the Bundesliga .	-4.4810
However , e-sport " is no longer far from other established sports such as handball , basketball or ice hockey , " writes Deloitte advisors .	-5.1620
Internationally , many countries have gone further .	-3.6623
Major markets are Asia and the US , where ex-basketball players Shaquille O<unk>Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez participate in the US Team NRG eSports .	-2.8932
Hollywood actress Ashton Kutcher invests in the e-sports betting company Unikrn .	-8.2088
Something is also happening in Europe .	-2.4320
In a Norwegian school , e-sport was introduced as a subject of instruction , says Froevil .	-4.4853
In the Netherlands and France , according to Dutt , first-league football clubs are now obliged to set up an e-sports department .	-4.4447
" Germany is lagging behind in comparison with Europe , " explains VfB Managing Director Röttgermann .	-9.7307
It is no longer enough to indulge in nostalgia , and to clarify the old times .	-6.1746

Michelle Carter condemned for the texts that Conrad Roy is pushing for suicide .	-3.8162
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her friend to commit suicide through text and calls .	-3.4192
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars , and five years have been suspended .	-2.7256
Carter was convicted in June for the negligent killing of Conrad Roy , who died on July 13 , 2014 .	-2.8694
Roy 's father said at the hearing on Thursday : " My family is undead .	-3.3134
My son was my best friend . '	-1.1740
Carter was allowed to remain free until appeal .	-1.8656
She had been faced with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from mental illness .	-4.1603
dressed in red pants and a cream blouse , Carter stood there with tears in his eyes , with folded hands and downward eyes when condemned .	-5.1491
" Her actions have killed Conrad Roy , " the prosecutor said to the court .	-4.1868
" She finished his life to make her own better .	-1.8501
She took no responsibility , " she said .	-2.6952
" She has not shown any remorse " .	-2.4198
But Carter 's lawyer said it was a " terrible circumstance that she totally regrets " .	-4.1524
However , Judge Lawrence Moniz said that he did not find out that their " age or maturity , or even their mental illness , has a significant impact on their actions " .	-4.4596
A prosecutor read a statement by Roy 's mother Lynn Roy saying that ' there is no day when I mourn the loss of my beloved son .	-3.8791
I want him to be proud of me and to be as I do with everything I do , I try to be there for .	-9.2708
Roy 's sister , Camdyn Roy , said she was " persecuted " by the recognition that she would never participate in her brother 's wedding or be a aunt to his children .	-5.7836
" Not having this only person with whom I have been with every day since my birth is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , " she said .	-4.1733
The case seems to set a legal precedent , because there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide .	-2.3379
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a car in in 2014 . and were .	-4.5106
The case attracted national attention after Carter revealed text messages that she had encouraged him to end his life .	-2.9493
" Hang up , jump from a building , first yourself , I do not know there are many ways , " she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family .	-6.8533
In the moments before his suicide , she wrote : ' You have to do it , Conrad ' and ' Everything you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy ' .	-4.0406
Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention by the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from the case through any press .	-3.3264
The case has shared legal opinion .	-2.1629
Among the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox , who was convicted in 2007 for murder on her British counterpart in Italy before being acquitted two years ago .	-4.5431
Mrs Knox , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : ' Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not prison ' .	-3.6325
Joshua Kimme : Learning from the FC Bayern ’ s New Mini-Lahm	-2.9667
The fact that Joshua Kimmich was allowed to run up as captain at the Audi Cup is no coincidence .	-6.6817
The FC Bayern dares the Confed-Cup winner a big season - no extra motivation is damaging .	-6.4894
Something was different in his place in the cabin , which Joshua Kimmich immediately saw , even if the additional garment was very , very small .	-4.3700
But as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup no Philipp Lahm was seen and no Manuel Neuer was seen , he stopped his hand .	-6.7158
" The trainer did not announce it , " the Confed-Cup winner said afterwards , after his first assignment as a Bavarian captain .	-6.5248
Well , the Einstand could have been better than the 0 : 2 against the Naples SSC .	-5.2129
But Kimmich could interpret the sign of the coach as well .	-4.1277
Not the eight years old Arturo Vidal was chosen as the lead player in the C-Elf , made up of young players , debutants and just out of the holiday .	-7.6293
Sugar is most likely to be distributed to those who are trusted to be happy .	-7.4664
So anyone who has been chosen to join the legacy of Lahm can only use a small extra motivation .	-4.6556
Kimmich confirmed : " This is what you want as a player to take responsibility " .	-4.3101
On Wednesday the 22-year-old flew over the field as a Mini-Lahm .	-3.9449
Right behind , that is his position , the white tie on the arm did the rest .	-5.0372
And Kimme was at all involved in this initial formation like the one who is best placed to take control .	-10.0929
He gave instructions , tried to direct the unsung troop .	-4.4898
He had a look for the whole while many others were busy with themselves .	-5.3303
Vidal by overplaying his missing fitness ( hardly ) ; Renato Sanches by making devils come out of the performance of the Asian journey ( only partially ) ; and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle by not having a negative impact in their first appearance in the Bayern-Trikot .	-9.4880
After all , that worked very well .	-3.7122
Süle ran alongside Kimme , Rudy before the defense , both acted sovereign .	-4.6490
He was a member of the United States Army , and was a member of the United States Army .	-10.8092
His colleague Rudy admitted that the result was ' not as we hoped ' .	-3.0428
But he also performed well on the debut .	-3.7665
Relocation , Tempo problem : " For this style I was also called " .	-7.4552
How unusual this world of Bayer is for the new entrants was seen after the match .	-6.9476
For example , Rudy did not give one or two interviews in the catacombs , but certainly six or seven .	-3.0412
Kimme said goodbye after a few brief statements in the back of his new players .	-6.1372
There he heard an interesting sentence from Süle : " What is going on here , I have already noticed .	-4.2705
In Bavaria you just have to win every game " .	-3.3910
After all , he no longer has to teach the new .	-2.9609
Alaba Motivated <unk>FB Ladies ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-6.7878
David Alaba believes in the success of our OFB ladies .	-3.2436
Austria ’ s most famous footballer registered via Twitter shortly before the match and wished the Austrian Federal Women well .	-6.9714
The Bavarian Legionaire is almost a club mate of <unk>FB captain Schnaderbeck and he gets in love with our ladys .	-7.2515
The Tweet of the Austrian footballer of the year and the Champion League winner should be a special motivation injection .	-4.1436
Our ladies might also need the famous Bayern-Dusel .	-5.4097
Business satisfied with the Rhineland-Palatinate Minister : Economy praises Wissing ’ s Tempo .	-5.5873
It was often irreconcilable , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when Eveline Lemke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economics of Rhineland-Palatinate .	-3.0212
This is apparent after more than a year in which the new economic minister , Volker Wissing ( FDP ) , is in office .	-4.0138
Chambers and companies from the region speak at T V request of a change in economic policy - and blame the old minister at the same time .	-4.8199
Frank Natus , Chairman of the Trierer Enterprise Association ( VTU ) , says : " Wissing meets the wishes of the economy that Lemke has all blocked " .	-4.0775
Natus ’ s biggest turnaround is in infrastructure policy : the closure of highway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country ’ s list of priorities .	-5.0632
This year , the Ministry is hoping for a planning procedure , and by 2021 the construction law will stand .	-6.9853
The western ring of Trier , which is in the main demand of the Federal Road Map , also plays a role in the country 's plans .	-6.4376
The aim is to get the line operational in December 2020 , says Ministerium Gambler Cornelia Holtmann .	-6.3118
Natus sees this as a signpost to support regional but internationally competing companies .	-4.1962
The Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( IHK ) Trier aims , as suggested by Wissing , to produce a Rhineland-Palatinate label for wine in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports , which have been cutting off for ten years .	-6.2403
In addition , Wissing has an open ear for people who want to set up their own company , praising the .	-8.7759
The Trade Chamber of Trier sees the new Master Bonus as an additional incentive for young trainees , says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach .	-3.5936
A premium of 1000 euros for the passed master exam and 2500 euros is planned , when graduates become self-employed within ten years of master training .	-7.2697
But the domestic tax list for the country remains long .	-3.4066
In the planned road construction , facts need to be created quickly , while the country lacks the necessary personnel , says Jan Glockauer , Managing Director of IHK Trier .	-6.4561
Of the 56 new engineers who want to adjust bissing to mobility at the national plant , only 29 jobs have been filled .	-7.9220
The IHK calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices .	-3.8456
Christian Balddauf , the CDU group ’ s vize , refers to the Court of Auditors ’ calculations that , in 2017 and 2018 , the country is investing more than EUR 20 million less in maintaining national roads than proposed .	-6.7158
Frank Natus also expects a concept of the country to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region .	-4.2607
Furthermore , the country ’ s existing broadband expansion is disappointing .	-6.3556
In 2016 , regional companies had rated net supply only at a rate of 3.4 in an IHK survey .	-4.7212
They complained about stalled Internet connections and break-ins .	-3.4826
On the other hand , former Minister of Economics Eveline Lemke is now out of politics and is still on the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind .	-5.1130
The Green Group left Lemke in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where after four months of disagreements she already cleared the field again .	-4.9097
Audi is to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers are facing a backlash .	-3.3082
One day before the announcement by Audi , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles .	-2.3282
The BMW chairman said that the company believed that ' there are smarter options than driving restrictions ' , referring to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles .	-5.0056
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .	-2.6478
None of the companies described the companies as a call-back .	-2.9757
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules on carbon dioxide emissions .	-3.2203
But the nitrogen oxides emitted by diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma .	-2.3211
The cost to car manufacturers to install systems to neutralize the exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles is also increasing , making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .	-4.6622
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of scarring powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem .	-3.1776
The companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so-called shut-off devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the rules when a car has been tested , but in normal driving conditions .	-6.5372
In the United States , several Volkswagen employees were charged , while others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic .	-2.9506
Last month , the former leader of thermodynamics in engine development was arrested by Audi in Germany .	-2.3262
The former manager , Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be tried in the United States .	-2.8531
Earlier this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen , after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circumvent the emission regulations in Europe , and a question focused on the United States was extended .	-4.4719
The inclusion of Audi in the survey could weigh heavily on Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to Volkswagen ’ s profits .	-4.6999
This is the message of Saturday ’ s Floss on Isar .	-4.2324
The city wants to protect the Isar .	-2.0060
In order for the Isar visitors to join us , a raft will pass through Munich on Saturday , with a special message .	-7.3404
If you take the Isar again on Saturday , you will see a big raft between Flaucher and Reichenbachbrücke .	-4.5041
And this is not a common floss , with Isar tourists .	-3.6631
The construction reference will clarify this .	-5.6685
On the raft you can see a large information transparency .	-3.9812
It shows a mountain of rubbish .	-1.6054
The start of a public campaign to appeal to the Isar people .	-3.2360
With the motto " True Love is ... " the understanding of Isar as a protective wild river should be enhanced .	-6.4254
Last summer , the raft sailed over the Isar , and this year , too , there are other actions and measures to achieve a respectful and environmentally conscious behaviour .	-7.6723
Mordillos Knollennasen and Laughter Against the Sorrows	-5.2774
Mordillo was at times one of the most popular cartoon artists , and the grooved nose of his characters are his trademark .	-6.5608
Even with 85 the Argentinean still signs and works on a film .	-4.0946
His message : laughter , ' because there is too much suffering in the world ' .	-2.8125
Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .	-2.1967
In his first years as an artist , he was among others an artist for greeting cards - which frustrated him .	-6.2737
" The happiest day in my professional life was the day when lost in my job , " he once said .	-1.6961
He was born in Lima , New York , and Paris in the late 1960s . His cartoons were published in " Paris Match " and then in " Stern " and other leading magazines around the world .	-6.9503
Even in China , Mordillo found many fans .	-6.2028
Again and again the artist was inspired by cities .	-2.9102
Large round Mordillo figures are in drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and Red Square in Moscow .	-3.6594
In the early morning , according to his own data , he still sits at the drawing table today , working almost ten hours a day .	-4.8870
With calendars , puzzles , books for young and old , T-shirts , cuddles and watches , his drolly figures continue to spread worldwide .	-6.2984
For six years he has also worked on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters .	-3.5646
The main person in the movie " Crazy Island " is a giraffe - Mordillos 's most popular animal in his drawings - with a thousand-feet opponent .	-4.4416
His figures speak for the first time in the 3D film , which is to come to the cinema screen in 2019 .	-4.7298
" I don 't know exactly what they will say , it 's strange for me , " says Mordillo .	-2.7682
The script is not written by him .	-1.8453
For this reason , he prefers the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced without any word .	-6.3074
Lavender from Provence Threat to Climate Change	-2.2003
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .	-2.1070
Lavender is falling due to drought conditions and disease spreading insects , causing great headaches for scientists and farmers trying to find solutions .	-5.1916
Eric Chaisse , expert of the Agricultural Research Institute CRIEPAM in Provence , said : " Lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years , which caused much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn .	-5.0708
This has an impact on the lifetime of lavender .	-2.7217
There is also a small cikade , a microbacterium that transmits dwarf cicadas , and in very dry weather there are many of them . '	-4.8537
And the stakes are high .	-1.7626
Lavender oil not only attracts tourists , it is also popular for perfume and cosmetics .	-3.8924
Eric Chaisse said : " Instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , underdeveloped and either missing or weakened .	-3.4749
So we have fewer parts with essential oil . '	-2.1967
The solutions that are being considered include better water distribution and the slowing down of evaporation from the soil , but also the spraying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to .	-9.7808
This year the town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhön celebrates its 1200-year anniversary .	-3.7234
The highlight is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival .	-4.3950
Cramers , guilds , traders , vampires or a country bar camp are to be experienced in the city centre these days .	-8.1631
The murder of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico	-2.2488
The staff of the weekly newspaper Riodoce usually meet on Wednesday to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa through organized crime , corrupt officials , and perpetual drug wars .	-4.5873
But on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .	-2.0530
They were told that it is important to change their routines .	-2.0788
Two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels safer : they should take their children into the office , which was the target of an attack with grenades in 2009 , or leave them at home .	-5.5058
Security experts have written three words on a panel at the front of the room : opponents , neutrals , allies .	-2.9370
You ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no proof is needed , perception and feelings are sufficient .	-4.8107
There are drug smugglers , politicians , business people , journalists suspected of being on the government ’ s pay list or cartels , a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .	-4.2046
There is no respite from violence , and while the corpses are accumulating throughout the country , there are more and more journalists : at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012 , 589 after attacks and threats are under federal protection , and so far there have been at least seven deaths this year in seven states .	-5.9792
Among the latter is her editor and her inspiration from Riodoce , co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas .	-3.9246
" The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , " Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug-related violence .	-3.0722
His absence is deeply felt , although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez showing his middle finger with the word " Justice " hangs on the fa<unk>ade of the Riodoce building .	-5.3778
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the reporters discuss their divided topics , the trauma , their nightmares , insomnia , paranoia .	-2.4373
Although a special Federal Prosecutor was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists , according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists , he has only launched two criminal proceedings .	-5.1771
As with most of the thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organised crime every year , journalists ' murderers are rarely brought to justice .	-4.1306
At Riodoce , they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa , although they are inexorably and although the terrain is now even more treacherous .	-5.1406
Without information about the murderers , without justice , the meeting has little use to discuss security , says Ibarra .	-3.1148
" It is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , " he says .	-1.4789
'Until we know why , we are suspicious of everyone . '	-3.5302
In the morning of May 15 , Valdez left the Riodoce newspaper office in the capital of Culiacan .	-4.0240
He was forced out of his car and 12 times shot on him , probably because of the newspaper 's name , which is translated as " Twelve River " .	-6.8245
The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .	-2.0774
Valdez was 50 years old .	-1.2432
He left behind a woman and two adult children .	-4.2089
Rumours tend to roam freely in Culiacan .	-1.5781
But there is virtually nothing but silence on the Valdez issue .	-2.8450
Since Guzman ’ s arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January , Sinaloa had become one of the country ’ s bloodiest battlefields , as rival factions are fighting here to fill the vacuum .	-2.9100
It does not matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot on the street , or that the cemetery is full of decorated two-storey mausoleums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living .	-6.5172
Forget for a minute that there is a state of ' calm ' when only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States .	-3.9474
Nevertheless , despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work , Ismail Bojorquez ( 60 ) , a co-founder and director of Riodoce , is guilty of not protecting his friend .	-4.0248
He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder .	-1.7734
First , in February , there was an interview with Damaso Lopez , a leader of one of the rival anti-trust groups in war with Guzman ’ s sons .	-6.1066
This publication may have angered the sons , gangsmen suspected of buying each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks .	-6.0348
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own security after the confiscation of another newspaper that had published the same story .	-6.1519
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .	-2.2311
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there .	-2.7714
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 , when he joined five colleagues to establish Riodoce and sold $ 50 in equity .	-4.9790
In Sinaloa , " it was impossible to conduct journalism without encountering the drug problem , " Bojorquez said .	-2.1250
Over time , the newspaper earned a reputation for bold and honest reporting , and sales and advertising grew .	-3.3446
Reporters loved publishing hard-hitting research without fear of censorship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to deal with .	-4.2959
Eight years after Riodoce was founded , she received the prestigious " Maria-Moors Cabot Award " for her coverage in Latin America .	-3.1350
In the same year , Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in pursuing the Mexican drug history , wherever it led .	-4.6992
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid .	-1.7136
" I want to live on , " he said at the time of the CPJ award .	-2.4481
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa " is a way of life , " he said last October in an interview with Rompareto TV .	-3.9005
" You have to take on the task that suits you as a journalist - either that or you play the fool .	-4.5983
I do not want to be asked : ' What did you do with so many dead ... why did you not say what was going on ? '	-3.6936
The Riodoce team missed Valdez , the fun bird who could curse like a dockworker , the friend who was generous with reinforcements and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .	-5.2863
They trusted in his routine .	-1.5138
He would always wear his hat .	-1.5215
He would always go to El Guayabo , the bar opposite the office , and always sit at the same table .	-2.6622
Now they ask : Was his love of routine his corruption ?	-3.1392
His death has also forced her to question her own assumptions about how best to do her work and remain alive .	-3.8657
" They don 't like it if you are dealing with their women , their children , their clean shops , their secret runways " to move drugs .	-4.8843
" These things were not allowed , " Bojorquez said .	-1.4058
The result , even in the best times , is a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation .	-2.5501
Trust his own instincts .	-1.8354
If it smells wrong , stay away .	-3.0427
The trouble is , said the editor of Riodoce Andres Villarreal , that " smell a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing happened with Javier . "	-3.5996
The old rules , as he and others say , no longer apply in Sinaloa - just as they are in Tamaulipas , Veracruz , Guerrero , and other states where a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes , weak institutions , and corrupt government officials is at home .	-3.4393
The landscape is constantly changing .	-1.2092
In the space where Riodoce ’ s staff met for security training , mobile phones were suddenly not allowed ; days earlier , it became known that spyware , sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .	-5.4398
Outside , two policemen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 <unk> C ) in the shade of a tree .	-3.5262
They were charged by the provincial government to protect the Riodoce offices in a four-storey building in a mid-class neighborhood of Culiacan .	-8.0842
Half in joke , some of the reporters wondered whether these officers were among the 50 % of the police officers that the governor himself called untrustworthy .	-4.1506
It is months since the reporters went into the mountains , where the drug gangs are in fact under control .	-4.3649
For this week 's edition , Riodoce has featured three main stories .	-4.0970
There was the murder of the brother of the former well-known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa .	-3.0249
They also had an exposé on government spending , which focused on the home city of the governor .	-3.3121
And there was a group that carried out an abduction in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan , one block from the office of the prosecutor .	-3.2892
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or what happened , so caution was required when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite place for drug dealers and authorities .	-4.5298
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party ( PRI ) , which ruled all political levels almost throughout the century .	-3.9057
Recently , several PRI governors were accused of high-profile corruption .	-2.1915
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this venue , including one in which a son of " El Chapo " Guzman escaped a military attack .	-2.9748
Only a few months earlier , readers would have regarded the Valdez column as the best informed source of the abduction .	-3.8666
" In the past we would have known what happened , " said Villarreal , 46 , with the nickname " El Flaco " because of its slender body .	-4.1482
'Now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . '	-2.0793
The Valdez office has been transformed into a storage space for signs and stickers protesting against the murders of journalists , because the staff have become something they themselves would never have expected : activists on behalf of the press .	-5.7139
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed some signals and went to a demonstration next morning for another journalist to the office of the prosecutor .	-4.3959
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan .	-1.9527
A burned body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests , that it is his .	-2.3165
Throughout the country , journalists have become vociferous by writing in organized protests " SOS Press " on sidewalks and buildings .	-5.0844
On that day , the director Bojorquez is out in Washington and tries to gather international support for the judiciary in the Valdez case .	-5.1048
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after the assassination of Valdez , Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on and killing journalists for telling the truth .	-3.7789
She has since asked for it to be reassigned by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity .	-4.3319
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were " surrounded " by organized crime , government officials involved in it , and an equal society .	-4.2308
In his last book , Narco Journalism , he wrote that reporters are killed not only by drug gangs , but also by the orders of politicians and security forces who were covered by organized crime .	-5.0896
Last year , the Media Guardian Group " Articulo 19 " allocated more than half of the attacks on journalists to police and civil servants .	-3.3919
" In Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth shut , " Ramirez said .	-3.4687
Obviously , the murders have a deterrent effect .	-2.7739
No one forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago .	-2.4145
Their body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel : ' I am here because of my reports ' .	-3.5498
A computer keyboard and headphones lay beside their separate head .	-2.6785
Some branches have elected to close , like the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua following the assassination of the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March .	-3.5602
Others continue , as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the murder of her director in 2004 .	-2.8199
In 2010 , the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the front page entitled ' What do you want from us ? '	-3.5197
Some journalists have fled their home countries or even from the country .	-2.6863
It is a painful decision .	-0.8015
It is hard to find work in exile and they are still watching the streets and looking for dangers .	-4.6891
And sometimes they are hunted , as appears to be the photographer Ruben Espinosa , who was murdered in 2015 with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after fleeing Veracruz .	-3.8066
For those who stay behind and continue work , it is a daily dance with risky decisions .	-3.2176
Ibarra , who once wanted to be a poet , admits that drug trafficking frightens him .	-2.8366
" Mexico goes to hell , and therefore I became a reporter , " he said .	-2.0158
At midnight last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Riodoce sat in front of the office on the pavement and drank beer when all their phones started to hum .	-4.4294
A number of shootings with gang rivals and security forces near the resort Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead .	-3.2417
The war continued to escalate , as promised by a number of cartels in the region .	-2.8787
From the edge of the bridge , you have published the news on the website of Riodoce via mobile phone .	-5.8113
The title page had to be changed the next day .	-1.4555
Sirens raised nearby - another shooting shop in the area .	-4.5097
Bojorquez threw a look at the policemen who kept guards to see if they were willing .	-4.0375
If they were afraid at all , they did not show it .	-3.0295
The staff of Riodoce followed his footsteps under the enormous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible throughout Sinaloa .	-5.0624
" How can you think of closing it , " Bojorquez said , " when , on the same day as Javier was murdered , the intern asked me to send it to the streets for reporting . "	-6.1516
Dinosaur used camouflage to evade his enemies .	-2.5758
At first glance , it looks like a statue , albeit a frightening one .	-2.4379
Now researchers have found that the first insights of the incredible rhino of a Canadian miner have been preserved so well that experts have described it as " Mona Lisa the dinosaur " .	-4.9946
It was preserved so well that they could even find that his scaly skin was of reddish brown - and they said it had had had something of a " troubled past " .	-5.5019
The report in the magazine " Current Biology " called it " the best preserved armored dinosaur ever found , and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world " .	-3.5859
The fossil is a newly discovered type of Nodosaur that lived in the middle of the chalk period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .	-3.7518
Its incredibly well preserved condition has stunned researchers who describe it as " truly remarkable " .	-4.7289
According to reports in National Geographic , the armored plant eater is the best preserved fossil of its kind .	-3.6210
It was found by Shawn Funk when he dug in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta , Canada , on March 21 , 2011 .	-2.5266
He met something that seemed out of place from the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely .	-4.1561
Fossil 's discovery was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology .	-3.1906
They spent the next six years discovering the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,100 kg ) heavy earth slurry .	-3.7998
After all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .	-2.4107
" If you blink a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it has slept , " said the main author Caleb Brown , scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum , where the creature is visible .	-4.2466
" It will enter science history as one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs . "	-3.4839
Researchers have found that , although this plant eater is covered with armor and resembles a changing tank , it has probably been threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs .	-5.6096
The heavily armored dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators , and used a shielding technique known as counter-damage , which is also used by many modern animals .	-3.9886
This would have allowed it to blend better into its surroundings and escape its enemies , experts say , suggesting that it was threatened by major dinosaurs .	-5.8873
The 110 million year old creature from the Nodosaur family first made headlines in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology .	-4.3807
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell , one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours carefully exposing it .	-3.3624
The astonishing preservation of the example enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armor over his body .	-3.5754
They discovered the contouring , a common defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was darker than its bottom .	-9.0519
Although contouring is common , the results are surprising , as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of today 's animals .	-6.3586
It suggests that the dinosaur was driven by enough pressure from meat eating dinosaurs that evolution favored concealment of confrontation as a means of survival .	-3.7818
But most contemporary animals using contouring - think of roe deer , zebra , or belt animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey , which signals that this Nodosaur has been subjected to a real struggle for survival .	-7.0935
" Strong predator behavior on a massive , heavily armored dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaur predators must have been the Kreatie-era , " Brown said .	-4.9736
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was red-brown .	-2.6872
Scientists continue to examine the animal for clues about its life , including its preserved intestinal content , to find out what it had eaten as its last meal .	-6.1230
They believe that when the dinosaur died , it came into a river and was driven out into the sea , where it sank on its back to the bottom of the sea .	-4.5333
At that time , Alberta was as warm as South Florida today , and rivers and oceans are likely to spread much further inland than they are today .	-4.4489
" This Nodosaur is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin , but also remains in three dimensions and retains the original shape of the animal , " said Brown .	-5.3690
" The result is that the animal now looks almost the same as it was in the early Cretaceous era .	-7.3672
You do not need to use much imagination to reconstruct it ; if you just shoot a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that he is sleeping . '	-5.0726
The Kreidezeit was a time when huge Theretopodes , carnivorous dinosaur tracks standing on two legs crossed the earth .	-5.6624
Although the king of them , the Tyrannosaurus Rex , lived millions of years in Borealopelta , the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his fearsome ancestors .	-3.2668
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus , a 38 foot ( 11.5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monster .	-4.5813
The scientists , whose latest findings appear in the Current Biology journal , believe that Borealopelta was sunk in the sea after death and mummified in mud .	-7.0401
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he dug in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta , Canada , on March 21 , 2011 .	-9.4398
According to the museum it is the best preserved armored dinosaur of the world , including skin and armor , and is complete from muzzle to hip .	-2.9574
The creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to <unk> 3,000 ( 1,300 kg ) .	-5.7686
It contained two 20-inch long tips that rose from his shoulders .	-3.4988
Researchers believe that the armored plant eater was swamped by Western Canada until an flooded river flooded it into the open sea .	-4.1732
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur kept its armor in exquisite detail .	-2.2930
The fossilized remains of this special example are preserved so well that the remains of the skin still cover bumpy tank plates along the dinosaur .	-4.1328
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic , such a level of conservation is as ' rare as a profit in the lotto .	-2.6703
The more I look at it , the more confused it becomes .	-1.8926
Mounted remains of the skin still cover the bumpy tank plates that carry the skull of the animal .	-5.0622
His right forefoot is on his side , his five fingers are stretched upwards .	-3.8051
I can count the scales on his sole ' .	-1.7233
In a thunderstorm : Mass Caramboage on A8 : Many Injured	-9.4347
A serious accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carnage .	-5.7201
There are many injuries , kilometres of traffic jams and gaffer .	-3.5363
On the highway Stuttgart-Munich ( A8 ) about 20 people were injured at a mass caramboage on the late Thursday afternoon .	-4.5851
According to the police , around 5 p.m. between the connections Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen ( Aichach-Friedberg district ) during a thunderstorm nearly 30 vehicles , including probably also trucks , were ineinbound .	-7.6061
The exact number of injured persons was not reported at first . was , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and . ,	-7.0650
A police spokesman said that they were minor to medium-sized injuries .	-5.2239
A large number of rescue vehicles were at the accident site .	-3.3542
The A8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich .	-2.3285
In the direction of Munich a about ten kilometres long backjam was formed .	-6.1101
As one AZ reporter reports , there were also massive obstacles on the back track - by numerous gaffer .	-5.9787
The fire brigade took note of the characteristics of the drivers , who now face severe penalties .	-5.4871
A second accident occurred on the A8 shortly after 18 : 45 , this time between Augsburg and Dasing .	-3.1998
A collision between a car transporter and a passenger car occurred .	-4.9741
A rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .	-2.6917
Deutsche Bahn : Group tests ' Comfort check-in '	-3.2268
It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced before : you sit in the train and sleep .	-5.6154
Or one is deepened into his work and has just a brilliant thought .	-3.8957
And then : fff .	-3.5017
The Schaffner comes out and wakes one unattended or pulls the passenger out of the workflow .	-7.5282
Control of tickets .	-1.8975
But the times of disruption are soon over .	-3.5970
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the no-loss ticket control .	-3.5583
You simply confirm by phone that you take your seat and devalue your ticket .	-5.1513
Currently , a test operation runs on two routes .	-3.7384
" If the offer is available , we will extend it .	-4.2276
It will then probably be available on many other long-distance routes in Germany at the beginning of next year , " said a railroad specialist .	-5.5156
" Comfort Check-in " is the name of the train for the ticket validation without conductors .	-6.0592
In order to use them , however , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or a tablet .	-5.0701
And you have to book an online ticket - which most passengers already do .	-3.9007
You also have to buy it via the App of the Train , the DB Navigator , which is the most convenient way to book your ticket .	-5.7737
Last but not least , you need a seat reservation .	-2.9192
Because the " Comfort Check-in " works like this : you get into the train , call up your ticket under " My Tickets " .	-6.0354
A button for electronic devaluation will appear on the test customers .	-4.8354
The train attendants receive notification on their mobile devices that the passenger X is in the train and has taken the booked seat Y .	-4.3131
When the train attendant comes to Number Y in the ticket control , he knows that there is a passenger with an already devalued online ticket .	-5.9880
So we can continue to sleep , continue to work , remain silent .	-4.9129
The " check-in " has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should benefit the passengers .	-4.5106
" If you want to travel without ticket control through our train crew , simply check in the DB Navigator .	-5.7589
This allows passengers to make their travel time more personal in the train , " says Michael Peterson , Marketing Board of DB Fernverkehr .	-5.3436
Second Plus : " And our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs " .	-3.6635
Those who often travel by train know that , in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket controls are among the biggest annoyances .	-5.5902
Because you often have not all the documents you need for the devaluation of online-tickets .	-7.5791
Either a credit card or an identity card is missing or a document you need to present .	-5.5054
The result is endless discussions between train attendants and passengers , which leads to bad mood in the department or the large area and delays in the control of your own ticket and ultimately takes the time for the conductors to take care of other concerns .	-7.6046
Only a small number of test customers can use the new service .	-2.2146
And this only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stiutgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen .	-3.1847
Further train numbers on the same route are not yet available .	-2.7524
How an activist got to learn the answer to the question : ' Who Streets ? '	-3.2315
On 9 August 2014 , Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core .	-1.9422
Only a day after she arrived in New York City , the born in St. Louis sat on the bed of an Airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone . , , , , , , and , . , , , , , , , , , ,	-7.3215
She stumbled upon a post from someone from high school .	-2.1313
" The police have just killed an 18-year-old child and it is still on the street , " they said .	-3.8382
Confused , since no one else had posted the information on their feed , closed them Facebook and opened Twitter .	-4.1633
A user with the handle <unk> TheePharoah has been constantly retweeted on their timeline .	-2.7955
The rapper from the area of St. Louis was about to tweet live the death of Michael Brown , an unarmed black 18 year old who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson , Mo .	-3.9304
He postulated a picture of Brown ’ s lifeless body , which was stretched out on the street and would remain there for four hours .	-4.6586
" That 's wild , " Ferrell thought .	-2.8287
But death was nothing new for them and their community .	-2.2825
She dropped her mobile phone to return to tweets about people on the Canfield drive later in the evening .	-4.0966
There were photos of the police band and people shouting , and of a man who claimed to be Brown 's father who was wearing a sign saying : ' Ferguson 's police just killed my unarmed son ! '	-5.1663
She watched a live feed , where a policeman stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a beautiful dog .	-3.4996
In another video , she said , another policeman secured his gun and cried : ' I will kill you ... animals all ' .	-3.8649
" This is not common " , Ferrell remembered her statement .	-3.3659
'This is not the kind of murder we have become accustomed to and which we can call typical ' .	-3.7056
At this moment I felt chills .	-1.9378
I was angry and crying ' .	-2.2779
She booked a return flight and went home the next day .	-1.3701
After landing at 11 p.m. , she took her 6-year-old daughter out of her father 's house and decided that the next morning they would go to Ferguson .	-4.5434
What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the theme of a new documentary film , " Who Streets ? " , in cinemas from the 11th century .	-5.3233
It is a story of survival and protest , of love and loss , of strength and resilience from the point of view of the people who live in the community and who have filled the streets to demand answers .	-4.2427
When Ferrell went to Ferguson with her daughter , wearing a flower dress and a fitting crown , the two discussed a conversation that they had about the black experience and the black state many times before this morning .	-5.6429
" You remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? " She remembered what she said .	-3.4459
" We are now going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that was not right .	-3.2025
I could not take them with me , " said Ferrell later .	-2.6478
" What happened today is a culmination of what happened in the past .	-2.6142
She needs to know it and see it and be raised in it .	-4.4347
It must be well developed , not only activism and organization , but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution , and what we must do to become free to liberate ourselves .	-3.6361
Even though I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience a blatant racism , she is no different from the next black female child .	-5.8732
I have the feeling that I would be doing her a disservice in keeping them away from it . '	-4.9575
The first station , when they arrived in Ferguson , was on South Florissant Road , a site facing the police authority , which became a camp area when activists waited for the possible non-prosecution of Darren Wilson .	-6.1801
Ferrell and her daughter were connected to a local business owner who made lunch .	-4.8171
They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators .	-2.8852
Slowly , a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell .	-3.1279
" My activism has changed completely after 9 August , " she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri St Louis , president of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities .	-4.9694
" I had no experience in organizing .	-1.8356
Everything has come . '	-2.4323
Weeks later , Ferrell met during an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan , one of the co-directors of the film .	-2.1338
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to " document " what happened .	-2.3259
One question was put to Ferrell : ' Do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use ? '	-4.1450
This skepticism was fuelled by countless cases of people , often whites , in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience .	-3.4518
As Folayan said in an interview recently : ' We had heard that people born and raised in Ferguson did not center their voices and we wanted to do it differently . '	-4.4373
Folayan had already worked with then-co-director Damon Davis , an artist known for his activism around death row inmates .	-3.3720
His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project , along with six other locals , followed the team of " Who Streets ? " in the years after Brow.	-5.3796
" This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us .	-2.8661
'That was the main thing for me , how these people are represented , because that is how I will be represented . '	-4.7014
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell 's experience - to show that the movement was " not a messiah leader , but a community that comes together , " said Folayan - it proved to be the most open participant in the film .	-4.4381
As a result , documents from " Who Streets ? " show surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell 's life , as she falls in love with her wife .	-4.4300
" I felt naked , " Ferrell said and laughed when she first saw the finished product .	-2.6169
" But I understood that there must be a certain degree of vulnerability in this work and in the dehumanisation of black people . "	-3.8615
In addition , Ferrell ’ s story repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black Live Matter movement .	-3.1919
Two of the three founders of the movement who , after the killing of the black teenage boy Trayvon Martin in 2012 , marked the film " BlacklivesMatter " in social media , identify themselves as gay . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-7.5290
" Black , gay women in managerial positions have carried the movement as a whole , " said Ferrell , " and therefore we are constantly fighting on various fronts .	-4.4271
Black , gay women must bear the brunt of everything . '	-2.2352
Folayan agreed to note that " the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women " .	-2.6718
However , it insists that " this is not an affirmative type of action " , where Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film due to her identity .	-4.1035
" She was the person who stirred up this energy , " she said .	-2.7139
" It is not by chance , although she was on the front line , because in a life at these crossings as a black , gay woman so much is at stake .	-5.4432
You can feel your energy through the screen . '	-2.1005
In the meantime , the news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared , but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist .	-4.2718
Ferrell is on trial for 2 <unk> years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration .	-2.9643
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : " A Chaos " .	-3.0556
However , she clings to a song and feels obliged to this memory since she took to the streets in Ferguson three years ago .	-5.0360
" It is our duty to fight for our freedom .	-0.9989
It is our duty to win .	-1.4457
We must love and support each other .	-1.2974
We have nothing to lose except our chains . '	-1.9929
From dream to megalomania : TV readers discuss bit-gallery .	-3.0324
The bit-gallery moves people even though it is far from being built .	-3.8953
But the idea of a shopping center at the southern end of the pedestrian zone has split the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .	-3.6450
The issue hardly leaves a cold one .	-4.7312
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page " Volksmünd Bitburg " .	-3.6730
While some say to the Bit-Gallery : " That would be a dream " ( Anja Becker ) or " That would be real class " ( Nicole Schaupsten ) , comes from the other side : " Do not need a person " ( Siggi Betzen ) or quite simply " megalomania ! " ( Lars Scholz ) .	-6.1503
While supporters are relying on a gallery to attract more customers to the city , which will benefit the rest of the shops , opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will bleed out .	-6.9807
In addition , the gallery is planned on exactly the site where the farmers ' market hall is located , where 13 direct marketers offer their products .	-6.3058
This will stop at the start of the construction work .	-3.4329
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Beda square with possibility to sit outside .	-5.1962
Simone Zimmer : " We have been buying in the farmer 's market hall almost weekly for many years .	-4.4538
Mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the rural women are always very happy .	-5.8549
We also discovered the butchery for us .	-2.8162
We would like to see a chance to maintain this offer during and above all after the construction of the gallery .	-4.7520
Other cities do .	-2.9053
Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . "	-2.9997
Gerd Densing : " Whether direct marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery comes to the amount of the rent .	-4.2897
This is not likely to be very low in the new project . '	-4.6811
Eva Kilic : " What are shopping centres in Bitburg ?	-2.9618
Clothing , shoes , drugstores or supermarkets : I find this superfluous .	-3.8116
There is enough of this in our city .	-3.0094
You can see how many shops are empty here - some have been empty for months and years .	-8.5575
However , since there is not even a proper weekly market , it is even more important that we at least retain the market hall .	-8.9174
After all , the goods offered there are fresh , mostly offered directly by the producer and are also inexpensive .	-4.7460
As you can see , shops in a shopping center are only rented by larger companies , because the rental there is often not sustainable for a retailer .	-6.7739
It is a pity that special deals almost no longer exist , and what remains of them is likely to disappear . '	-5.9442
Wolf Fandel : " A shopping centre with a market hall does not fit me together .	-2.8457
And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg .	-1.7125
Above all : Where should the farm market hall go during the construction period ?	-4.6874
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run , if the bit-gallery actually comes at some point .	-4.6285
Or does the ghost bit-gallery manage to drive all shops out of Bitburg ? '	-4.5938
George Marquet : " That simply won 't work .	-2.5843
And a shopping center that is empty does not need anyone .	-3.5051
I think it would have been better to promote a real farm market , rather than this gallery .	-3.2643
But there is no place for a farm market hall thanks to the crazy many - I think - pointless construction projects in Bitburg .	-6.4009
If the farmers ' market hall is broken , a piece of culture will disappear again . '	-5.0117
A fitting similarity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA .	-2.3202
In the middle of the space of the Fridman Gallery in New York you can see many faces - white , black and brown , which are almost indistinguishable - hanging on cables from the ceiling .	-4.6686
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupmakers and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning .	-4.4217
Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison , where the former intelligence analyst served a 35-year prison sentence after publishing classified diplomatic messages on the WikiLeaks website .	-4.6999
The new exhibition , which was opened on 2 August , is called A Becoming Resemblance .	-3.6713
It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg , whose discipline united her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Manning , a transwife and landmark dissident whose conviction was turned by Barack Obama when he had only three days in office .	-5.0115
Dewey-Hagborg , through the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted by Manning , has created 30 portraits of how someone might look with these genomic data , a sharp , if somewhat intellectual commentary not only on the formability of DNA data - the many ways in which they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also on identity .	-5.1176
Manning , born as Bradley Edward , but having spoken openly about identification as a woman since her puberty , was convicted in 2013 for 20 charges , including six violations of the spying law , computer fraud , and theft .	-4.6032
Her image was suppressed by the prison , so much that there was only one photo - a grainy , black and white Selfie , in which Manning was obviously sitting on a driver 's seat and wearing a platinblond wig - with which she was associated .	-6.7146
In 2015 , Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of her 2012-project Stranger Visions .	-3.2372
In it , the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette crumbs and chewing gum by extracting DNA from the waste to create an image of how these people might look .	-5.6309
That was when she received an email from a newspaper magazine .	-2.4445
" They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , " said Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition .	-3.7238
And she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed , so she contacted Chelsea and asked if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .	-4.1767
The artist and her imprisoned Muse became unequal friends of letters who exchanged several letters over the course of two years .	-4.0763
They even created a comic " reinforced images " , illustrated by Shoili Kanungo , which foresaw a future in which President Chelsea 's judgment would be transformed , and she would be able to see the exhibition in person . , , and , , , , , , and , , , , , and , , , , ,	-8.7753
Indeed , just a few days after the book was published , Obama would demand Manning ’ s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome kind of happy meeting .	-4.2915
There is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Trump is waging a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender forces to find new , tweetable ways to further inflame the rigid divisions that he should address .	-5.6398
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said that " things happen for a certain reason " .	-2.7189
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Manning , with her oversized signature ( the " i " in her family name is marked with a heart ) , called for an end to the " automatic fragmentation , the basis of which were sex , race , sexuality and culture . "	-5.7117
On the opposite wall , her mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand-feet of Cs and Gs and As , is written in pencil .	-4.8708
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show how astonishingly similar , at least in biological terms , we are all by including the 200 letters ( or nucleotides according to the highly advanced scientific lexicon of the artist ) .	-6.6009
" What people will hopefully take with them is that our genome does not care about who we are and how open genetic data is for an interpretation and how subjective they are , " said Dewey-Hagborg , whose video work of 2007 , Sphious Memories , is also visible .	-4.6241
" DNA data can tell so many different stories , so these are 30 of these stories . "	-2.9124
The last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in its own room , is a page from the aforementioned comic novel .	-5.1717
She shows Manning as she appears with a hands-free phone in her hand from the disciplinary barracks of the United States like King king king king king king king .	-5.6508
" When they scale up your speech , they have won , " they say .	-4.8738
" So never stop your mouth " .	-2.8809
" It came directly from a letter she wrote to me , " said the artist who greets from Philadelphia .	-3.3718
'I still get goose bumps when I speak about it ' .	-3.3939
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition personally - as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if it should do so , it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks , by their own genomic simulacres , which merge like hordes of protesters .	-6.1881
This was also targeted , like everything in the exhibition , up to size ( 5 " 2 , Mannings Statur ) , where their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil .	-5.6095
" In the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , " said Dewey-Hagborg of the portraits .	-2.8337
" I wanted it to feel like a mass movement formed with Chelsea , like the movement that was behind its liberation . "	-3.8796
Professor of Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University for killing .	-8.0172
A nationwide human hunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University who is being sought as suspects after a man was stabbed with deadly injuries in a luxurious apartment in Chicago .	-4.8605
On Monday , arrest warrants for Wyndham Lathem ( 42 ) and Andrew Warren ( 56 ) were issued for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Trent H. James Cornell Duranleau , as shown by the acts of Cook County District Court .	-4.7154
The documents say that Cornell Duranleau , 26 , died after several stitches .	-2.0857
A common alert system published by the police authority in Chicago states that the body was discovered on July 27 .	-3.7170
Officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries on his body .	-2.2655

Latehem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007 .	-7.6052
Alan K. Cubbage , Vice President of University Relations , said in an e-mail statement that Lathem had now been admitted and was barred from entering Northwestern University campus .	-5.7943
" This is now a criminal matter being investigated by the competent authorities , and Northwestern University cooperates with this investigation , " said Cubbage .	-3.3907
Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University .	-1.7210
A university spokesman and Somerville College said in an email statement that ' we are in contact with the police in Britain and ready to help the US investigation authorities in every way possible . '	-5.3103
The statement added that Warren ’ s colleagues were shocked and want him to stand up .	-3.4389
Chief Communications Officer of the Police Office of Chicago , Anthony Guglielmi , said he is urging suspects to face up to the authorities .	-3.9040
" The police have an idea of their whereabouts , and our efforts to locate them reinforce , " Guglielmi said .	-2.8669
Guglielmi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the suspects .	-2.2277
Guglielmi said that the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand-Laza building , who had just received a mysterious tip saying that something had happened in apartment 1008 .	-3.5162
The police described the scene as very cruel .	-1.0156
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident also took place on 27 July .	-2.8794
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building .	-2.9113
" We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship , " Guglielmi said .	-1.5597
The management team at Grand Plaza issued a statement to the residents : " The police are currently working on the timeline and the background of the victim and researching a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . "	-4.6019
" We will complete the WADA timetable in the near future " - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko	-3.4694
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that it will not take long for the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) to be implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency ( RUSADA ) .	-3.1541
" At a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap , RUSADA has been given the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD ( UK Anti-Doping ) .	-3.7387
The WADA timetable has been updated in this respect , " said Mutko on Thursday .	-2.7396
The PM commented on the second part of WADA 's roadmap for compliance with the code describing the criteria for the reinstatement of RUSADA and recently published on the organization 's website .	-4.3371
According to Mutko , it does not contain anything that might give Russia cause for concern .	-5.4067
" Everything has been announced , everything is being implemented .	-2.0728
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and WADA in the near future , " he added .	-1.4466
However , one of the criteria mentioned in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by WADA by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport .	-4.1009
As regards the matter , Mutko said : " We are conducting the investigation because our anti-doping system has acknowledged a mistake .	-4.5281
All measures have been implemented .	-1.3712
But there were no government programs , and we will not admit something that does not exist . '	-3.5612
Mutko ’ s words were in line with those of Vitaly Smirnov , the head of the independent Russian Anti-Doping Commission .	-3.7118
In talks with the Russian sales office RSport at the beginning of the day , Smirnov admitted problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations , but then added : " We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .	-4.4588
No one intends to accept this report unconditionally , " added Smirnov .	-2.7126
In November 2015 , as part of the doping scandal , RUSADA was excluded from carrying out doping checks in Russia .	-3.6534
However , it has been allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping ( UKAD ) .	-2.3781
After a visit to Moscow 's headquarters in July , WADA Director-General Olivier Niggli explained that RUSADA is moving in the right direction in order to be reinstated .	-11.1176
Aldi no longer sells eggs for the time being .	-3.2378
The business groups shared that .	-3.6618
The communication stated that it was a purely precautionary measure and that it could not continue to be regarded as being harmful to health .	-7.6674
From now on only eggs are likely to be delivered to Aldi , which have been proven to have been tested negatively on fibrous anti-licking agents .	-6.6951
Aldi wants to achieve clarity and transparency for its customers .	-3.7772
The Start-ups that will help your business not to become the next ubber	-4.3301
Amy Eratt wanted to measure your employees ’ happiness with your e-commerce start-up , but the surveys did not work .	-5.2354
Answers were often vague , unhelpful or , worse still , fraudulent .	-6.9197
And even if you promised anonymity , some workers did not trust the process .	-1.8383
" There was simply never consistency and objectivity , " said Ertt , who runs the 75 person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care company Madison Reed .	-3.1245
She called people from outside for help .	-2.3866
A new breed of Human Resources startups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel .	-3.1816
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee involvement , it allows companies to conduct surveys , address special groups and demographic groups , provide anonymity to employees and appeal hotlines , and in some cases whistleblowers allow them to bypass management and address the board directly .	-6.7140
" You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health , but where is the Fitbit for your company ? " said Jim Barnett , co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement .	-3.9842
Erset said that they won a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint .	-4.3334
In addition to the Snap surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat card of the company , which at a glance shows which units have the most complaints and which executives have low approval results - so you can tap why .	-5.3790
Companies come to realize that they must remain at the top of the workplace culture so that you do not become the next person to be involved in scandals since a former employee has published a blog post describing an environment of harassment in which those who have spoken have been punished .	-5.6789
For start-ups like Glint , this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity .	-2.9499
Global governance , regulation , and compliance industry could have more than $ 118.7 billion in 2020 , according to the Let 's Talk Payments financial website .	-3.2324
Denver , Colorado , start-up Convercent , which helps companies prevent and recognize bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the midst of the Uber case in discredit .	-3.9950
Convercent has almost 600 clients , including Airbnb , Microsoft and Tesla .	-1.7419
Uber has recently registered as a client .	-2.4171
Like Glint , Convercent lets companies send tailored " pulse " surveys , collect confidential answers in real time and view the heat cards of your problem areas .	-4.8428
It also provides an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior .	-3.2215
And if the chief executive is involved , complaints go directly to the supervisory board .	-2.5802
" The court of public opinion has captured regulators , " said Patrick Quinlan , the founder and managing director of Convercent .	-3.1816
When a company is found that treats its employees badly or behaves unethical , it can experience costly consequences through consumer goodwill , employee turnover and lawsuits , Quintan said .	-5.4001
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations , has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have a simple way to reach their headquarters .	-8.9157
Previously , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or email to the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .	-4.6159
It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vitrano , Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel , who said there was no good way to prosecute the complaints of employees .	-3.0909
Now that the company is using Convercent , problems previously hidden by executives in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , harassment or unfair practices - can be identified and addressed more quickly .	-5.2993
" I can get closer to this holistic , 360-degree view of employment experience , " said Vitrano , who leads Ruby Tuesday 's Risk Management Group .	-4.3771
'And we protect our shareholders from employment disputes ' .	-3.4497
Companies began to take ethics , values , and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 , after the accounting company Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations by the Enron scandal , Quintan said .	-3.9149
But it took the " social media to get their right " that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry going online .	-4.1177
" Before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , " he said .	-1.2460
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service and charge companies with recurring fees for using their products .	-4.3408
It is a business model and an opportunity that finds the agreement of venture capital investors , who supported both start-ups .	-3.5966
Convercent received $ 10 million in financing in February from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital , raising the total capital to $ 47 million .	-3.3162
Glitzern secured $ 10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners and raised its total financing to $ 60 million .	-3.6658
These investments are hardly surprising , given the networked nature of companies , culture , and venture capital .	-2.9454
There is a growing set of research that shows that today ’ s employees expect more from their jobs than they have been .	-5.0685
In competitive markets like Silicon Valley , high salaries and interesting projects are only stakes .	-3.2640
The staff want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .	-3.8897
" If people are happy to be in a company that owns their voices and that the work you do is worth it , then they feel more committed to making this company successful , " said Nina McQueen , Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn , which uses both Convercent and Glint .	-4.9648
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies run well , and companies run well when employees are active and committed .	-5.0903
If the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .	-4.8788
The data about employee engagement according to the experts of the workplace culture important .	-3.7681
But the data are useless if managers of a company do not take action .	-3.4078
In fact , if a company asks for your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way .	-3.6812
And if change does not come fast enough , or not at all , it can breed disappointments and discourage employees .	-4.2114
" If you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be ready to have 4,000 conversations , " said Russell Raath , President of Consulting at Business Management Company Kotter International , the company that relied too heavily on collecting data .	-4.2844
" Because if you do not follow staff will ask , " Do you really hear me ?	-3.2345
Do you care about this ?	-3.2007
And who do not care , why should I ? '	-3.2350
Madison Reed , who now conducts monthly employee surveys , was able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported about Glint , says excrement .	-4.7525
And , after collecting feedback from frustrated employees , it was able to reorganize several teams within the company through the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication , and to add a communication training to address the problems .	-5.4442
At Ruby Tuesday , the company is getting new insights about its employees , and it hopes that in the long term , this will lead to better retention of employees in an industry known for high sales .	-6.4691
" If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , " said Vitrano .	-2.2515
" And if you lose people , you also lose customers .	-1.9000
And if you lose customers , you will lose companies .	-2.2982
The NCAA eliminates the two-day practices and makes a long day for the Brussels .	-3.3293
It goes up to 11 p.m. , when a lot of UCLA players are on a side of the team 's new training fields on campus .	-7.3699
Some have removed their jersey parts and show their back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .	-3.7133
For a good part of the team , these idle minutes are a lunch break .	-2.8312
Players who are enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final exams after the three-hour exercise before returning to the Waterman Football Center the next morning at 6 : 30 . will and will . will will . will will and will will .	-9.7333
" This is for the guys the next three days a real treadmill , " said Bruins-Trainer Jim Mora just before Monday became Tuesday .	-4.4248
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the load of players and has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .	-3.8772
For this reason , the first three UCLA sessions should start at 19 : 15 to match the players ' pre-packed schedules .	-6.0530
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins postponed the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and had practical exercises during the summer school for the first time during Moras six seasons in Westwood .	-5.3322
They are supposed to have 18 exercises during August , 20 before the start of the formal game preparations for their start against Texas A & M in September .	-5.9024
Mora said he supported the change in the rules of the NCAA , even if they add another point to the player 's busy routes .	-5.5377
" We put this enormous burden on them three or four days , and it is very challenging , " Mora said .	-2.7479
" And they just pushed it through , they keep sticking , they are great people .	-4.8730
I think that as soon as we come to Saturday and have more time , it really will be great . '	-4.3705
The UCLA will end its practice as soon as the camp is finished , which will not be an easy task , given the clear lines of its fields , from an adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center , a upper-class hotel that has already been promoted with footballs that cleared a safety net behind a goalpost .	-7.7313
Bruins players are supposed to occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mora admitted that there might be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .	-4.2049
" We will use our security , " Mora said .	-1.8122
" This is a real problem , and it is not far-fetched to think that people hire a room there and then prepare to record an exercise .	-5.0669
If you have the video tape of an exercise , it is a pretty good business .	-2.9290
But we have security forces there , and we have security forces in parking 8 .	-2.1030
We will do the best with what we have .	-1.5298
I am not therefore very concerned .	-2.9176
We have a plan . '	-1.0788
Facebook wants to step up fake news screening	-4.0667
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with fake news to third parties and then display their results below the original post , said Thursday , the world ’ s largest online social network .	-7.0952
The company said in a statement on its website that it will start using updated machine learning methods to detect possible false messages and to send them to fakt-validators who will possibly show results from the original article .	-8.4803
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main points of distribution for so-called fake news , many of which believe that it has also affected the 2016 US presidential election .	-4.3821
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with French voters being inundated with false stories in the run-up to the presidential election in May , and Germany supports a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to eliminate hateful postings as they did before the September elections .	-5.9845
On Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new fake review will be launched in the US , France , the Netherlands and Germany .	-3.7745
" In addition to finding out which stories are being challenged by third-party facetters , people want more context to make informed choices about what they read and share , " said Sara Su , Product Manager for Facebook messages in a blog .	-5.5320
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the " related article " and work on other changes to its message feed to reduce false messages .	-3.5572
Creating a comic novel : A Castle in the History of England	-2.7662
In his recent past , Scotney Castle was featured in a Squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s .	-4.6725
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cosy home in the Bewl River Valley in Kent , and has now become the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes , a mopharian Yorkshireman with a penchant for historical documents .	-4.7762
" I find it so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years , " he says woefully .	-3.5934
'What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand ' .	-2.7401
A Castle in England spans the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney .	-4.2635
It is not the first book from Rhodes based on an archive : he wrote ' Dead Men 's Teeth and Other Stories ' in 2014 , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he unexpectedly found emotional .	-3.4207
" I only responded to the thumbprint on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700-s who worked for the Jacobins , " he says .	-4.3123
" That 's his thumbprint !	-2.0656
And letters always smelt of smoke , because at that time a fire was lit because of the light .	-3.8093
For someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect , as if it were there .	-4.7708
Oh , I love archives ! '	-1.8122
For someone with old papers , supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council of England , who lived in a castle for almost four months ( " To be honest , I have a little overvalued my welcome greeting " ) , this seems all too good to be true .	-6.2001
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian " new " castle , looking through the archives , and studying the castle 's many treasures and curiosities , such as the mounted hyanists on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch .	-9.9769
He wandered through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle and talked to landscape guards , gardeners and sometimes artists working on the illustrations of his book .	-5.5763
Then , at night he drank " Whiskey and began to write " .	-1.6859
The intimate story of Scotney is relatively unknown , as the National Trust was only fully accessible in 2006 when the last heir , Elizabeth Hussey , died .	-4.2474
When Rhodes arrived a decade later , the employees only began to look after the archive he described as " hundreds of years in which aristocrats said " Oh , throw it on the roof " .	-5.5037
diaries , letters from the time of the English empire , maps that represent who owned what : " You might think that land conflicts would be boring , " says Rhodes , " but there was a birch to fight the two families .	-5.4610
Guys , let everything go ! '	-6.1912
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point for exploring English history on a broader basis , including ' The Labourer ' , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381 .	-5.5651
" There is a record of a rebellion that occurred in 1380 in the castle , in this book entitled ' Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex ' , says Rhodes .	-3.3045
" The peasant uprising began in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start .	-2.7882
Perhaps the two are connected ? '	-2.7933
Other stories are deeply rooted in the history of the castle - such as ' The Priest ' , which tells the story of the Jesuit priest whom the Darrell family hid during the English Reformation for seven years .	-4.6517
Or ' The Smuggler ' , which depicts the smuggler Arthur Darrell from the 18th century , who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones ( a discovery made only years later when his coffin was excavated ) .	-4.0908
The Darrells are Rhodes ' favorite family of Scotney : " The gentlemen seemed to be pretty crooks , always making debts and spending money on things they could not afford .	-6.0143
Other generations of Darrel men resolved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of handsome boys , with a talent to promote peasantry . '	-4.7935
After the end of his life at the castle , Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences .	-4.3845
He has spent two weeks in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämämäki , the site of a sanatorium from the early 20th century , which has since been reclaimed by nature .	-5.4185
But Scotney has a special place for him .	-1.7147
" I was sad to go again , " he says .	-1.4226
It was like : ' Oh , now I have to finish the damned life ' .	-4.1604
Campaign launched : Covering more than 300 years old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf	-4.8277
On Friday , the town of Bad Honnef launched its campaign to introduce a new roof brand ( Thursday 's round show ) with the cover of the 301 year-old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf .	-6.5907
Until Thursday , Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and slogan secret .	-2.6417
At the end of August there will be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth .	-3.5243
" Too good for us .	-1.8374
Or ? " , the promoters of the action have been asking since yesterday on the posters at the Rhöndorfer Chapel .	-5.3226
" We don 't really think this ( of course ! ) , " they write on their yesterday released website .	-4.6819
" But we use this measure to attract your attention .	-1.6437
And to make it clear that things are better than they seem .	-2.5557
Basically , we firmly believe that , as Bad Honnefer citizens , we know very well about the beauty and attractiveness of our city . '	-4.7720
The action is about more than " just " a logo and a slogan , it goes on .	-3.8190
" It is important to formulate a single promise , one that gives the city a distinctive unique selling proposition " .	-4.5106
After all , it is competing with other municipalities .	-2.2666
The city of Bad Honnef can be tasted its new roof brand and campaign .	-5.6651
Turkey 's Military Reform - Erdogan 's Fear of the Army	-1.5571
Every year in early August , the Supreme Military Council ( YAS ) advises on retirements and promotions in the officer corps in Ankara .	-4.0852
This week too .	-2.2048
At first glance a normal procedure .	-1.9766
But nothing is routine with the Turkish forces one year after the coup attempt .	-2.6970
The meeting was no longer held in the General Staff building , as in the past , but in the Prime Minister ’ s office .	-4.3761
The five vice-presidents and Ministers for Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs have now taken part in the discussions under the chairmanship of the Heads of Government .	-5.9600
The majority of the civilians in the YAS were thus .	-4.6219
The government is taking the reins in the military .	-2.9375
The Chief of Staff , Hulusi Akar , remains in office , but the commanders of the Army , the Air Force , and the Navy have been removed .	-5.4400
Since the failed coup , leader Erdogan 169 of the 326 generals and admissions has fired .	-3.3178
More than 10,000 soldiers have been removed from the army , mostly because of alleged ties to the movement of the exile reporter Fethullah Gülen , who Erdogan sees as the driver of the coup attempt .	-5.8320
A total of 486 people , who are to have been directly involved in the coup attempt , have been negotiating in Ankara since this week .	-8.9111
As early as the day after the coup , Erdogan had described the coup attempt as a ' gift of God ' , giving him the opportunity to ' fully clean ' the armed forces .	-5.2125
But is Erdogan really in control of the army ?	-2.1319
At the end of February , the newspaper Hürriyet published an article entitled " Uneasiness in the Military Headquarters " .	-3.1820
At the General Staff there are concerns about an increasing " Islamization " of the army , which is manifested , among other things , in the lifting of the ban on the headscarf for soldiers , the newspaper wrote .	-6.4085
In any case , the army and the security forces are continuing to do so .	-6.3440
In mid-July , Erdogan ordered another 7395 government officials to fire , including 2303 police officers and 546 soldiers .	-3.7870
Erdo<unk>an seemed to have tamed the military .	-2.2088
The generals used to be the country ’ s actual masters .	-3.2581
Three times they were chanting on their role as guardians of the secular order of government .	-6.0729
After winning in 2002 , Erdogan pushed back the power of the military step by step , not least by invoking the European Union ’ s reform goals .	-4.7533
Former officers say that Erdogan is pushing for the Islamization of the armed forces .	-3.7399
In the magazine ' Vocal Europe ' , a notably unnamed officer who sought asylum after the coup attempt for fear of persecution abroad , warned that the Turkish army would be ' full of extremists and Salafists ' in a few years ' time .	-4.7535
If that happens , such a development could not leave NATO cold .	-4.3087
In any case , after the purges , the alliance has doubts about the Turkish army ’ s readiness to act .	-5.1713
NATO diplomats say that the governance structures and operational capabilities are ' weakened ' .	-3.5540
Washington Change the Rules of the Green Card	-2.7415
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Trump , quoted by the media .	-1.9439
It proposes reducing legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stricter rules for obtaining visas for a temporary work permit and restrictions on family visas .	-8.7617
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the president .	-1.8009
The draft law is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .	-2.7444
" This law will reduce poverty , raise wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers , and will do so by changing the way citizens from other countries are given green cards . "	-4.3015
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .	-1.1780
This new application procedure will benefit candidates who speak English , who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , " said Trump , quoted by the American media .	-3.9142
Ministry wants to rehabilitate track for race track shuttle .	-3.4011
Over and over the past few months , we have been arguing about the future of the race track guide - now it should go very fast .	-7.9096
Before the end of the year , it is planned to build on the ailing route on which the tourist railway operates .	-6.9258
In order to secure the future of the racecourse in the long term , construction work on the track should start this year , according to the Ministry of Transport .	-5.5584
" With the decision to continue ordering and renovating the route Ilmenau-Rennsteig , the country is committed to this connection , which is particularly important for tourism " , declared Minister of Transport Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt .	-6.2397
He put the costs of repairing the route at around EUR 2.5 million .	-4.5120
Of this , the country takes 75 % .	-3.7378
The contract , on the basis of which the shuttle is to be ordered by the country in future , is currently being finalised , declared Sühl .	-5.6225
The Ministry and the South Thuringia Railway as operators are already agreed on the technical details .	-4.1291
" The road map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are thus negotiated , " says Sühl .	-4.1068
The planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be concluded for a period of eleven years .	-3.0568
In December 2017 , the Rennsteig Shuttle was to be ordered regularly .	-5.4872
The Rennsteig shuttle is a popular railway connection between the railway stations Ilmenau and Rennsteig .	-4.3738
In recent months , a pilot operation has tested whether the route is used by enough people to order it again in future .	-5.6615
The route is also very slow in parts .	-5.4110
The rise of sex robots is real , and we should be concerned .	-2.0619
Just when you thought that it could not become even more crazy in 2017 , a new report on technological developments in sex robots will come .	-6.0082
Yes , indeed .	-1.2287
Sex robots are a big thing at the moment .	-2.9472
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics ( FRR ) recently published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years .	-2.3643
According to Noel Sharkey , a professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR , we must begin to take their rise seriously .	-3.1076
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of nipples and the type of fingernails .	-3.1812
" People are making fun of them , but companies are delivering a lot of them , and we will see them much more often , " said Mr Sharkey in publishing his new report .	-5.8482
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions achieved through artificial intelligence .	-4.2788
The user can also " adjust " his robot according to his convictions , selecting everything from the eye color of the robot to the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails .	-5.1568
But it becomes even more worrying , as many robots possess the " personalities " that would make a stepford woman look progressive .	-4.6008
Modern sex dolls have become robots with a silicone skin .	-2.0750
For example , the RealBotix robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the features they find appealing , such as shyness .	-4.1794
And then there are the Roxxy Gold sex robots , developed by True Companion , with pre-programmed personalities like " Frigid Farrah " , giving the impression of shyness and " Wild Wendy " with a " adventurous " personality .	-4.7944
" Roxxy Gold has a personality that is as adapted as possible to your personality , " enthuses the site of True Companion .	-6.2090
So she likes what you like , and she doesn 't like what you don 't like , etc .	-2.2318
During the day she also has her moods - just like real people !	-3.8106
She can be tired of being fixated on conversation , or she can be " in mood " !	-5.1743
There are many worrying aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female characteristics , the allusions to rape when one takes a step towards Frigid ( that is , the reluctant ) Farrah worry one most .	-7.3855
On his website , True Companion Roxoxy compared with a vibrator , but for men .	-2.7398
" If women ( sic ) can have a vibrator , why can men not have a Roxxy ? " says the website .	-4.2258
But these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy .	-3.2185
Their emergence and their increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture , a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition .	-7.3195
Most men will not , of course , have sex robots , and while the FRR notes their increasing popularity , they remain on the brink of consumer culture for the time being .	-5.4270
But what seeps from the periphery can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time we live in .	-3.7427
And many people are not strange or offensive until the free market gives them permission to do so .	-2.4888
There is a certain overlap that these sophisticated sex robots appear at a time when the rights of women worldwide are under threat , when there is a president in the White House who has accused women of being sexually assaulted .	-5.6536
The most deterrent aspect of the TV series ' The Handmaid 's Tale ' ( ' The Report of the Magd ' ) are not the graphic images , the convoluted bodies and the ejected eyes , but the realism of this vision .	-8.4541
The Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap .	-2.5559
The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as possible ( though with pornstar proportions ) .	-3.3063
Their builders want them to feel human , to imitate the movement of a real body .	-3.3162
But , to the point , when it comes to their " personalities " , the robots are not real women .	-3.8082
You cannot separate yourself from your pet or simply leave .	-8.7299
They do not have mediation or a background story , nothing that indicates independence or anything that could disrupt the imagination of total submission .	-6.4008
In other words , they are nice slaves .	-2.4542
Or , to put it in the 2017 speech : nanny	-4.2783
Trump ’ s Great Performance ?	-1.1971
He makes Mitt Romney the embodiment of common sense .	-2.1455
It has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarized the US electorate have also split small-scale families .	-3.5316
Around Christmas and Harvest Festival , the US has had newspapers advising on how to deal with the horror of Trump ’ s favorite relatives .	-4.4798
We are all supposedly demanding ourselves to allow our filter bubbles to burst .	-7.9256
Trump ’ s power to bring families together has been lessened .	-2.5827
I mention this because my cousin , a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Republicans in our family , visited me in New York this week .	-3.7391
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .	-1.7290
With Trump in the White House , anyone she knows , including the Republican kinship with which she had fought for decades for politics , is suddenly and completely strange on the same side .	-4.8362
This is certainly a good thing for the dining table , but it strikes me in another context that this also entails considerable risks .	-5.8480
The left has been strengthened by Trump , but his presidency ’ s humiliating effect has the strength to push us all to the right .	-4.5042
When we talk about ' normalization ' and Trump , we refer to the gruesome possibility that one day his kittens will no longer shake us off .	-5.1595
But there is an even more frightening long-term scenario , in which Trump “ normalizes ” right-wing Republicans , who suddenly appear to be the epitome of rationality relative to his standards .	-5.6885
Today , I find myself infected by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney ’ s hilarious version of the madman – the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax statement looked ) – both of which , in fact , appear to be a very mild crime compared to Trump .	-6.6042
When Trump goes , the next Republican candidate must be only mentally healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement .	-3.4945
When my cousin was in the city , we brought our children to the Carousel in Central Park , the largest of New York ’ s carousels , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don ’ t need caffeine .	-4.8995
The horses are enormous , the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are crispy and the animals twisting to look over their own shoulders with fear - extremely dark and the klipping music conveys this in a strange way .	-7.6988
So many clichés of a city disappoint : the views of high buildings become old , the skylines become too familiar to offer a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city does not live up to the dream .	-4.3529
Thirty-five years later , and I am still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a big roundabout in northern London .	-5.0489
The Central Park carousel , however , is still a strangely magical experience , as two years old , one eleven years old and two women in the 40 's can go on it and all have a great time .	-7.2574
If I had been able to assess the Carousel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one asked for it .	-7.4749
On the other hand , this week in a department store I was forced to rate my " experience " with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card .	-4.0089
In the cafe at the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option of matching the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something over the counter .	-4.3379
This not only slows down what should be a neutral exchange , but also puts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no one is required .	-3.8130
The poor woman in the department store was excitingly grinning , while I was tired of the experience of extending my credit card with five stars .	-6.1971
Oscar Pistorius moves from prison to hospital with chest pain .	-3.3886
Pistorius left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time .	-2.4872
Last year , he was taken to hospital for treating cuts at his wrists , which , according to the prison authorities , he suffered after a case in his cell .	-4.7618
Pistorius was sentenced for murder following an appeal by prosecutors against a first sentence of death .	-4.3913
He killed Steenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine ’ s Day in 2013 by shooting them several times through a door of toilet cabins in his home in Pretoria .	-4.5577
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a nocturnal intruder hiding in the cabin .	-3.6327
The prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six-year sentence of Pistorius , which they say is too lenient .	-3.8603
The National Prosecutor said that she would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the appeal could be heard this year .	-4.0321
Pistorius runs the risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if prosecutors succeed .	-3.4839
There is no death penalty in South Africa .	-0.6639
When Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg .	-2.1558
As the last of the Blumberg schools , the four students were fired from Fützen and Epfenhofen into the holidays and the secondary schools .	-6.2216
Three of the discharged students go to high school in the future , four to the secondary school .	-5.5380
On Tuesday evening , school leader Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürgerhaus Biesental in Epfenhofen .	-4.2525
As a symbol of the abandonment of school , the 29 students of the four classes , led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder , chose a young eagle who grows up in the chicken yard but is released into freedom .	-5.6321
In addition , the happy crowd performed a musical entitled " Der Adler im Chicken " .	-6.2168
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg , and let it sprout from his chickens .	-3.3155
Instead of a chicken kiss a little eagle came out .	-3.2428
But the hope of making him a chicken fell apart , the eagle spread his wings on a high mountain and died .	-5.3037
After that , the three and four classes showed a chicken dance in the recording of Yvonne Frank .	-5.0438
The hens danced with the young gockles that carried cylinders to the bet .	-3.5308
The eagle stands for integration , said school leader Angelika Sitte .	-2.7896
The kitten is different from the other kittens , but it is one of them .	-7.1897
But he will never be like a chicken .	-1.6688
Its purpose is to be free .	-1.2826
She wanted every four grader to feel accepted in his new school .	-4.2996
Thanks were given to our colleagues , the former head of the school , Michael Müller , who jumps back and forth in the event of school shortages , and the parents ' representatives .	-7.9312
The Kükenzeit is over , explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher .	-4.6245
After two years of teaching , they are very reluctant to release their students , because it was a really great time .	-5.5555
In the end , she was able to rely on the four sounds .	-5.4122
At the end , all the students made a song of summer and holiday time .	-6.7004
The children enjoyed it .	-4.6910
Eight first graders have already been registered for the new school year .	-3.7731
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece	-1.5345
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece , informed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted by television .	-3.4564
On the morning of 1 August , the police arrested a group of illegally camping people , including the two Bulgarians .	-3.7398
On the same day , they were released while an investigation is under way .	-2.4564
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported bTV that the Bulgarians were released later .	-3.2350
The Greek authorities have tightened control over free camping and impose considerable fines on anyone found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose .	-4.6246
The controls will continue throughout the season .	-2.2871
The Ministry said that the court can impose a fine .	-2.1633
Software update for diesel vehicles : What the stakeholders need to Know Now	-10.0637
How exactly does the software update take place ?	-1.7907
Do diesel drivers have to take part in the campaign ?	-3.0604
Overview of the most important questions and answers .	-1.7007
At the Diesel Summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars .	-6.9663
They are supposed to improve the exhaust behaviour of cars in the emission classes Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 .	-5.5414
Euro-4 diesel or worse are exempt .	-2.9749
Anja Smetanin of ACE Auto Club Europa gives assessments :	-2.4651
Is the new action mandatory ?	-1.2105
No , the negotiated software updates are voluntary .	-1.5574
" The mandatory updates previously only apply to the vehicles that have the software for cheating , " says Anja Smetanin .	-6.0690
Their retrofitting has been ordered by the German Federal Government ( KBA ) .	-5.0082
How and when will customers be informed about updates ?	-2.1841
Manufacturers have announced a rapid implementation in the coming months , but have not yet given a precise date .	-4.7109
Daimler has informed everyone concerned to write to him .	-4.9137
If an inspection is due anyway , it will be done within its framework .	-3.7933
How long should the change-over generally take ?	-5.8695
'Hard to say ' , says Smetanin .	-2.2935
This depends on the manufacturers ' commitment and political pressure .	-3.0559
" We have seen that car manufacturers are not acting voluntarily on the environment . "	-4.7125
How long should the update take ?	-1.2447
The conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .	-3.2120
It may be more time-consuming to get an appointment .	-2.9958
What are drivers who do not drive cars from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?	-2.9922
The ACE advises you to wait .	-3.4275
It is likely that foreign manufacturers would follow suit , says Smetanin .	-4.7367
Is a massive fall in the price of Euro-4 cars now threatening ?	-4.4702
The ACE fears this .	-2.3219
But it is precisely in the regions where driving bans are threatened .	-3.5262
In rural areas , there has been no loss of value for older diesel .	-3.8668
The ACE advises to wait for a sale .	-2.6718
LL Cool J received Kennedy Center Award	-2.0475
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington .	-1.1344
President Trump ’ s first award ceremony promises to be political .	-2.4771
One of the winners will not come - in protest .	-2.1515
LL Cool J ( 49 ) is the first rapper to receive one of the prestigious Kennedy Center awards .	-2.4960
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday , singer Gloria Estefan ( 59 ) , Lionel Richie ( 68 ) and choreographer Carmen de Lavallade ( 86 ) and TV producer Norman Lear ( 95 ) belong to the converted .	-4.0399
The awards will be handed over at the beginning of December .	-1.8711
Traditionally , US President Donald Trump will host a reception and join his wife , Melania , in the ceremony .	-3.4460
Lear , who has been announced with progressive TV series , has already announced that he will not participate in the Gala .	-6.2176
He said to the New York Times : ' This Presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even to deprive them of the resources - and that is a burden on me ' .	-5.9981
59-year-old Estefan emphasized that she would use the conversation with Trump to clarify her view .	-3.6487
The Kennedy Center , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural facility in the US capital .	-4.6560
Former award winners include Meryl Streep , Aretha Franklin , Robert De Niro , George Lucas , Tom Hanks and Sting .	-2.4157
We Make the City livable	-1.9919
Roland Wacker , Haslach ’ s master builder , is retiring next year .	-4.0077
The job is already advertised - suitable candidates are rare .	-3.8980
Wacker has been a master builder for 31 years .	-2.5533
And his work still makes him great fun as he communicates in the press .	-5.1089
He reports on varied but demanding tasks awaiting his successor .	-3.5749
At the same time , he is surprised that no application so far meets the requirement profile .	-4.2796
The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest opportunity .	-3.4481
In this way , sufficient time is still to be given for a review , taking into account the regular termination deadlines .	-8.5282
Since Haslach functions as a sub-construction authority for the administrative community , the applicant must present corresponding qualifications .	-5.7252
The city wants to retain this function .	-4.4261
If they were no longer able to fill them , citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice .	-4.0042
But proximity to the people is important to the city and to it itself , says Wacker , who reports of a good working climate and good mood between the public and the public .	-5.5234
In more than 30 years in office , several important projects have accumulated and Wacker is proud to be able to look back at them .	-9.8460
" We make the city worth living " , he is confident about the building office and his employees .	-4.4463
In the future , however , diverse projects will remain on the agenda : the transformation of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofenparkplatz , for example , are underway .	-6.1306
The Kinzigbrücke between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renewed , and the stadium reconstruction is still under way .	-5.1071
The latter alone will cost around EUR 1.5 million , ' if we do it right ' , Wacker estimates .	-4.8809
" All in all , great tasks await my successor .	-2.0917
The work here is fun . '	-2.1721
There is a lot of room for a master builder in design .	-5.4190
With Haslach ’ s own farm and gardening , many things can be reacted flexibly .	-6.1845
" You can move a lot " , says Wacker , and the design of the green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors .	-8.4829
Since the Old Town is listed as an ensemble , it is important to " have an eye for what fits in " when new buildings are approved , the departing master of the city emphasises .	-6.5086
In any case , the city architect bears a high responsibility .	-4.6870
He is a builder , " at the end everything runs over my table " .	-4.4253
When it comes to support and coordination , he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neumaier ( Hochbau ) has been present for ten years , Manfred Schöner ( civil engineering ) for 15 years .	-6.4189
Wacker also hopes that his successor will be long : " We are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the place " .	-6.1315
Continuity is not only important for a good working climate , but also for the further design of the city .	-3.8867
If you want to bury Roland Wacker , you should , according to the information of the city of Haslach , have completed a degree as a graduate engineer or a Bachelor of Architecture and have good knowledge in the fields of planning and construction law .	-8.7511
The Municipal Building Office is responsible for civil and civil engineering , building management , real estate , administration of the municipal properties , municipal premises with a building yard and municipal gardens , as well as under construction law including monument protection .	-16.9563
Twisted on Lines : South Railways blocked	-5.7799
According to the police , the hitherto unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bicycle on the lines from the railway track crossing in the area of the Leober Strasse ( B116 ) .	-6.2697
These were so badly damaged that the incoming freight train had to be stopped .	-3.4168
The investigators move from two male perpetrators and have been searching for them since the night .	-4.7573
Near the scene , witnesses had seen a pink scooter and a bicycle driver .	-5.4170
" This goes far beyond an eavesdropping " , said <unk>BB spokesman Christoph Posch to APA .	-5.6125
The person or the perpetrator would have put himself at great risk and would also have jeopardised rail transport .	-5.8975
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and the installation , as well as the delay minutes and the costs of the rail replacement traffic , it may also be possible for the railway customers to complain about the perpetrators .	-8.7972
Overall , the speaker said , ' a substantial ' sum should be expected .	-6.3331
The damage was fixed again on Friday afternoon , and rail traffic on the southern railway line was able to be carried out without any obstacles .	-7.8466
Almost ten passenger trains were cancelled on Friday morning , two of which were related to long-distance transport .	-5.2965
Freight trains did not fall , but they were late .	-2.2332
According to <unk>BB-Sprecher Christoph Posch , some 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced .	-5.2408
Insulators and masts were also damaged .	-1.4301
Red meat , dairy products , and chocolate could help alleviate IBD ( inflammatory bowel disease )	-2.3862
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system .	-1.6124
But a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases .	-3.0235
The incurable condition , which affects some 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the UK , causes stomach cramps and bubbles , recurring or bloody diarrhea , weight loss , and extreme fatigue .	-5.0964
While those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms , researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine .	-4.8302
The leading researcher , Dr. Marco Colonna , explained that immune cells patrol the intestine to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in food do not penetrate the body .	-4.0976
Cells that can cause inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues .	-3.3519
If the balance tends too far towards inflammation , an inflammatory bowel disease may result .	-4.1201
Experiments found that a kind of tolerant immuncell occurs in mice that carry a certain bacterium in their offspring .	-5.8648
And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of cells .	-3.1778
Professor Colonna said : " We have established a link between a bacterium - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbios , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .	-4.6100
The more tryptophan the mice had in their food , the more they had of these immune cells .	-2.4542
He proposed that the combination of L. reuteri and a rich diet of tryptophan promotes more tolerant , less inflammatory intestinal milieus when the same system also operates in humans .	-4.6736
Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Baragan postdoctoral studied a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which was separated , had not .	-6.9911
It suspected that the difference had to do with the intestinal microorganisms of mice - the community of bacteria , viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract .	-4.4415
The walls of the mice were DNA sequenced and six bacteria have been found that were present in mice with the immune cells , but without them missing in mice .	-7.0104
mice were raised in a sterile environment , so that they lacked a microorganism and did not develop this type of immune cells , and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells .	-6.3020
In order to understand how the bacteria had an impact on the immune system , researchers L. reuteri grew in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from the mice .	-6.1331
The immune cells became tolerant cells .	-3.2674
When the active component was purified from the liquid , it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as Indol-3 lactic acid .	-3.6818
If researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in mice ’ feed , the number of such cells increased by about 50 % , but if the tryptophan values were halved , the number of cells fell by half .	-4.2332
Dr. Cervantes arragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells as mice , and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tract .	-3.1513
It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease .	-4.3504
She said : " The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote , since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine .	-3.2324
In the presence of L. reuteri , high tryptophane values can potentially lead to an expansion of this population . "	-5.6410
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United committed a " genius " with Nemanja Matic	-2.4956
Manchester United signed a " genius " with Nemanja Matic , Jose Mourinho believes after the midfield player made his debut against Sambodia on Wednesday evening .	-4.9977
Chelsea ’ s 40 million pound signature began with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid begins on Tuesday , and impressed in the holding role when people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marched ahead at will .	-6.4443
However , Matic had been excluded from the Blues ’ s pre-Asian tour and made only 45 minutes , which allowed Mourinho to improve before the Premier League season began .	-6.2097
" He needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , " said Mourinho .	-1.9232
'We will help him to be ready sooner rather than later ' .	-2.0872
In addition to Matic , Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started in the Aviva stadium , when Mourinho formed his Start-XI for the beginning of the season .	-4.7281
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted another three new commitments , but insisted that the club had already done a " fantastic job " to meet three of its four priority new commitments .	-4.0569
" Three out of four to get , for which I thank the club , " he added .	-2.5021
'I will be happier if they get four out of four for me , but they have taken a great deal of trouble ' .	-3.6558
Boeing " painted " Dreamliner in the Sky	-3.4039
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner into the sky .	-2.7973
The pilots flew from Seattle in the US state of Washington , but the drawing began in Marquette in U.S. state Michigan and moved over the US in the form of a Dreamliner , which is several thousand kilometers .	-6.8285
The action lasted 18 hours and one minute .	-1.7577
On the radar screens the shape of a Dreamliner was to be .	-3.3476
The whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .	-1.9565
Boeing had previously made such advertising .	-3.1171
So the number " 787 " and the Boeing-logo were painted into the sky .	-3.1089
New low blow for Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem	-3.8573
As the wind turns out , when Sigmar Gabriel was still SPD leader , Social Democratic prime ministers always looked to Berlin with some concern before elections .	-5.5210
If there were no fires from the party ’ s headquarters , and only no headwinds from the federal government , that was the main wish of the campaign ’ s supporters .	-8.8641
Since Martin Schulz led the party , this has changed fundamentally .	-2.4413
Since then , the staff of the Willy-Brandt-Haus are watching with growing horror the events in the SPD-governed national capitals .	-6.0494
What Schulz got from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in the approach with headwinds .	-2.9825
They were low .	-4.4470
One by one .	-2.0446
After the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of the SPD and the Greens .	-4.1807
" This shows once again : Rot-Grün simply cannot reliably govern , " said CDU-Secretary-General Peter Tauber of the editorial network Germany ( RND ) .	-5.0256
The surprising departure of a Green MEP has plunged Prime Minister Stephan Weil ’ s government into a severe crisis .	-4.0525
Five months before the election , his red-green coalition lost its one-vote majority to the CDU and FDP opposition .	-3.2501
The Green Federal Executive Director Michael Kellner has called on the breakaway members of the Lower Saxony Green Party to return their mandate .	-6.3914
The transition to the CDU means a clear distortion of the will of the electorate .	-4.2825
Elke Twsten must immediately return her mandate , " said the Federal Executive Officer and campaign leader of the Greens to the editorial network Germany ( RND ) .	-5.0197
" All this must not be true " , a SPD campaigner sighs when the new obstinate message reaches the party headquarters on Friday morning .	-6.5245
Stephan Weil , the SPD prime minister of Lower Saxony , is there without his own majority in government after the Green MEP Elke Twesten is transferred to the CDU .	-7.6875
It is the provisional culmination of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD-Landesverband .	-4.1879
And no one knows what comes next .	-2.1050
The misery began with the unexpectedly clear defeat of the Saarland election in March .	-3.8743
A blue eye , no more , the comrades calmed down at the time .	-3.3879
After the regional elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia everything will be different .	-2.8499
That was what happened - and everything got much worse .	-5.5484
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into limbo , the Düsseldorf-Pleite haute the party .	-3.8884
In the weeks after that , the comrades picked up again .	-6.6989
Then , when they had just taken new courage , the G-20 summit came from Hamburg .	-4.5895
And with him came the next low blow .	-2.1405
Mayor Olaf Scholz , the last strong SPD head of state , lost his Nimbus this weekend because he sat in the Elbphilharmonie while his city burned .	-4.1633
And because , in crisis communication , he made pretty much everything wrong that can be done wrong .	-5.9812
Since then , Scholz has been fighting for political survival .	-5.6779
So now also Stephan Weil .	-2.3262
The Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been critical for a long time because of the VW-exhaust effects and his role in the Supervisory Board .	-6.3145
Miese poll values were added .	-2.7862
Nevertheless , or perhaps precisely because of this , Weil has tried to set new trends in recent weeks .	-6.3611
The efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin were not hidden from comrades in the vicinity of Martin Schulz .	-5.9212
They granted him because they promised Weil to stabilize the party .	-3.2925
Now the exact opposite could happen .	-3.3467
Because of the party internal conflict of the Lower Saxony Greens , there is basically no fault .	-6.6222
And Schulz certainly not .	-2.3170
In the meantime , the comrades are trying to keep their own ranks closed .	-4.1559
Their anger is directed at the Greens , and above all at the devious parliamentarian Twsten .	-4.4920
" It is intolerable and damaging to democracy , as Mrs Twsten puts her own career interests above the interests of all others , " says Matthias Miersch , head of the party left in the SPD parliamentary group , the editorial network Germany ( RND ) .	-6.0583
Mrs Twsten was elected to Parliament not because of her person as a direct candidate , but via the country list of the Lower Saxony Greens , the Lower Saxony Member continued .	-5.5580
The logical consequence would be for it to give back its mandate .	-3.1938
Thomas Oppermann , head of the SPD parliamentary group , laments a " undemocratic manoeuvre " .	-4.0379
" The will to vote four years ago was clear : the people have made Stephan Weil the Prime Minister , " says Oppermann , who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as the top candidate in the federal election , the RND .	-5.6259
" Now the personal career thinking of a future CDU member distorts the election result , " said Oppermann .	-3.9417
He called for clarification of the background .	-2.8532
I would like to know whether there has been more or more far-reaching commitments from the CDU of Lower Saxony .	-4.0572
Money for local centre III	-4.0899
If you want to renovate your old house , you can get support from the country in the near future .	-5.2158
Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG urban development informed about this on Wednesday .	-4.2062
At the beginning of the information event Schindler gave a review of what has happened so far .	-4.5475
Since 1991 there have been areas of restoration in Sensigen .	-4.1011
At that time , in the recovery area I from 1991 to 2004 , the state of Baden-Württemberg took over two-thirds of the total funding .	-5.6688
In the redevelopment area II from 2005 to 2016 , the grant was still 60 % .	-4.0516
For Schindler , the previous renovations are a " success project " - it is important , after all , to promote internal development and not just to open up new construction areas .	-6.0677
On April 4 , the President of the Council of Karlsruhe informed us that there will be a rehabilitation area III .	-5.3960
The total funding was EUR 833 333 , of which 500 000 would come from the country , the rest from the community received .	-5.3017
How does a redevelopment area develop ?	-3.9979
According to Schindler , one will examine where the " really old " houses are .	-4.3885
It also has a role to play , however , to rehabilitate whether there is any interest in the planned area .	-5.1868
If necessary , the territorial boundaries could then be shifted again .	-4.5555
The STEG represented Martin Keller , Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening .	-2.3134
Keller presented the contents of the Bund-Country program " Social City " , in which the renovations would then be carried out .	-3.7918
At the heart of the programme are the revitalization of inner cities , the improvement of living and working conditions and the maintenance and development of infrastructure .	-4.8689
The measures would be carried out on an objective basis , i.e. per plot .	-4.4146
The area of redevelopment would then be defined as a statute .	-3.9532
The allocation period for funding has been running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026 .	-3.7587
Until September of this year , however , the stocktaking process would take place in which those involved in the rehabilitation area would receive a questionnaire to fill in .	-6.9808
In November or December , the decision on the sentence should be taken , if possible , so that redevelopment can begin next year .	-6.4130
Pietzschmann then explained that each municipality must carry out the aforementioned preliminary investigations .	-4.7232
It is a question of assessing urban development abuses and deciding when to renovate and to what extent .	-5.1879
There will also be a certificate of renovation for the respective property .	-7.3954
Pietzschmann will come back to his own senses and get a picture of the situation , she promised .	-5.5110
Gotzel stressed that a key success factor for the project was the participation of the participants .	-4.4697
That is why there will be questionnaires which will be sent to the citizens by post in the coming weeks and which can be completed by the end of the summer holidays .	-5.2089
The yellow questionnaire is the " building and land sheet " , which deals with building conditions and recovery plans .	-6.2456
In the grey questionnaire , the " household and housing questionnaire " , details of the size , distribution and residents of a living room can be provided .	-6.0385
The blue " business sheet " is only to be filled out if business premises are operated in the building .	-4.5645
However , note Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not simultaneously an application for funding .	-3.9365
In addition , new building measures are not eligible for funding .	-7.0683
Schindler also stressed that the distribution of subsidies by the " greyhound principle " works - first come , first serve .	-6.8302
It is not possible to " reserve " funds for later .	-5.6928
In the end , photos of the project " Innern II " were shown to make those present " tasty " .	-7.5059
British inventors set themselves a microchip to come with a hand motion in the house and the car .	-10.2289
A British inventor is the first in the country equipped with a microchip to open his door , enter his office , and even start his car with a hand motion .	-4.6915
Steven Northam , 33 , had implanted the tiny chip between thumbs and forefinger and now offers the service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company BioTeq .	-3.9683
He has teamed up with Dr. Geoff Watson , an advisory anesthetist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester , Hants , to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards .	-9.9883
The technology resembles a cat and dog implanted microchip and takes only 30 seconds .	-3.0659
Mr. Northam 's company also wants to change the locks of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for an extra charge of $ 300 per lock .	-4.8626
The married father of one has now installed both at home and his BMW Z4 technology , which starts when his hand is driving .	-4.4758
The cost of the White House ’ s advertising costs to taxpayers is .	-3.2283
The White House ’ s decision to fly a naval helicopter to South Lawn for an event that highlighted American manufacturing last month costs taxpayers up to $ 24,000 , according to military data handed over to the TIME magazine .	-5.0667
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D , known as Marine One when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17 at the White House with American construction programs .	-4.0127
President Donald Trump , Vice President Mike Pence , and senior White House officials made a tour of products from all 50 countries .	-2.6971
The helicopter , manufactured in Connecticut , was exhibited alongside a yacht from Maine , a Wisconsin firecar and a Mississippi forklift truck .	-8.8798
The White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn , according to Marine Helicopter Squadron One ( HMX-1 ) , the unit responsible for operating the helicopter .	-4.8944
" I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , " wrote the commander of HMX-1 on the eve of the event to his superiors , the deputy naval commander for aviation .	-5.1484
The news showed that the helicopter arrived on July 17 at 7 a.m. on South Lawn for the event at 3 p.m. , and remained until the pitch was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 this evening .	-5.4061
The note adds that if departure from the White House should be delayed , a second team would be required for return flight due to the restrictions on hours of service .	-5.6133
The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event , while the unit security personnel remained on the ground during the time .	-4.9894
The records provided by the TIME did not make it clear whether a second flight crew was ultimately required .	-4.8585
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes .	-1.9386
Data sets indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could violate the determination .	-3.8928
" One question we asked was whether it was a violation of the hatch act and we were informed that this was not the case , " the commander wrote .	-3.2796
" Sounds as if you are closed , " the deputy commander replied .	-3.2557
The " Made in America " event was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act .	-2.7573
But official events also have political overtones .	-1.3055
At the event , the President launched the reform of health reform that was underway in the Senate , and he promoted efforts to curb government regulation .	-5.2772
The use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon .	-2.7837
Presidents are obliged to use them for the journey .	-2.2265
But to request their use only for a photo surgery is unusual .	-4.0338
Trump conducted an investigation in February when the presidential plane served taxi services against the backdrop of his first campaign rally in Melbourne , Florida , and his Twitter account is full of reports that complained about his predecessor ’ s use of the presidential plane .	-5.0906
" The White House is thrilled by the show " Made In America " - which shows products from all 50 countries made by American workers using American materials , " said Vice Secretary of the White House , Lindsay Walters .	-4.1312
HMX1 crews often carry out training flights in the area around Washington and South Lawn to remove the US president from the White House with precision centimeters .	-5.2204
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July , HMX-1 led the White House to 58 practice landings .	-4.1936
The flight for the " Made in America " event counted in the training needs of the flight crew for the month , said a civil servant .	-3.2375
Helicopter units flew an additional 11 hours this day for " non-presidential support missions " .	-3.4752
The White House said that taxpayers did not take the burden on any of the other props presented at the event .	-3.0366
A Sikorsky spokesman said that the company was not involved in issuing the helicopter on South Lawn .	-3.4703
HMX-1 does not have budget records for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .	-3.9073
However , according to the hourly rates of the US Department of Defense for the 2017 financial year , the rate of D refunds for the VH-3D is $ 24.380 per flight hour .	-6.3298
The unit records the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico , Virginia .	-4.0112
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is well below this rate .	-2.1355
'Setting the cost to taxpayers on the basis of the estimates for the refund rates is highly misleading , ' said Walters .	-4.9893
'These estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds ' .	-3.3972
According to a 2015 RAND study , the DoD refund rates do not include personnel costs , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance , and contract conclusion .	-4.5739
At that time , the former White House press spokesman , Sean Spicer , defended the helicopter ’ s use for the event .	-6.0078
" The idea is to present things made in America this week , " said Spicer .	-2.5154
" And I know that Sikorsky and the State of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not thousands , are dependent on it .	-3.2485
And I think , like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly .	-2.4006
It is , of course , appropriate to emphasise this . '	-2.8019
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter when he entered his South Lawn route for the event , but he sat in a firecar ’ s driver ’ s seat .	-4.6160
In the White House , Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky , joking the media about his own fleet of corporate products .	-4.7299
'I know Sikorsky very well , ' the President said , ' I have three of them . '	-2.1607
TC BW Neuss ’ s Smart Task	-5.5761
Top player of the second German tennis league will compete at the third SV table .	-8.4321
The TC Blau-Weiss Neuss will perform tomorrow from 11 a.m. in Kiel at the third table in Germany .	-6.7581
Despite five games , the top player of the Second German Tennis League still has a flawless balance sheet .	-7.4464
Team leader Marius Zay has respect for his opponent .	-3.5227
" This is a compact team that always plays in a very similar format .	-3.1590
I find the team very good on the back seats . '	-4.5630
In the case of SV Suchsdorfer , quality and stability are ensured above all by imports from the high north .	-7.8470
" Their Danes and Finns can even refer to stakes in the Davis-Cup .	-3.2552
And they are also strong in double , " says Zay with a view to Harri Heliovaara ( Finland ) , Andre Göransson ( Sweden ) , Sören and Esben Olesen , Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjjerrehus ( all Denmark ) .	-3.8781
" As always , this will be difficult for us .	-3.0858
You also need a good dose of luck . '	-3.5868
The Neuss team for the trip to the high north is practical .	-3.6002
His debut for blue-white could be made by Maxim Janvier .	-3.2819
If the currently active Frenchman in the Italian Biella tournament does not succeed in the Bundesliga , the Zdenek Kolar ( Czech Republic ) , who plays at the Czech Liberec tournament , will be the first to play this season .	-8.1712
Hans Podlipnik-Castillo , who has not yet won , was still on the ball yesterday with the Belarusian Andrei Vasilevski at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel .	-6.1267
However , he should be in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschall , Niels Lootsma ( both Netherlands ) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina .	-5.2494
After his two victories last Sunday against the club at the Alster , Máté Valkusz could join the team again .	-4.2251
If it is not enough for the 18-year-old Hungarian , who was the number one junior world ranking in January 2016 , someone from the coaching team around Marius Zay will fill the cadres .	-5.4686
How America Can Lose the OMV	-2.0051
Donald Trump was not really happy when he signed the law on tightening sanctions against Russia on Wednesday evening .	-4.2961
" In its haste to enact the law , " Congress has packed some " unconstitutional regulations " , he etched .	-4.4931
The Moscow response was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels was ashamed of the US effort .	-3.9608
After all , the draft provides for punishing European companies that help Russians build gas pipelines into the EU .	-3.2743
Accordingly , investors from the local OMV , which together with other European companies are co-funding the construction of the Russian Nord Stream 2 Baltic Sea Line , have been worried since .	-8.0217
The threatening scenery is enormous .	-3.5881
However , it is too early to assess the consequences , according to the official statement of the oil company .	-5.5998
Indeed , Donald Trump himself would have to bring the sanctions to life via an executive order .	-4.3504
Twelve weapons are his choice .	-2.7744

Narcos Season 3 Trailer : Without Pablo Escobar the Cali Cartel will be put into the spotlight in the series of Hits by Netflix .	-4.1843
Despite the second season of Narcos , Pablo Escobars Killer reveals , the Netflix series is far from over .	-3.7034
The three and four seasons were already confirmed by the streaming service , the first received their first trailer and showed the latest villains of the show .	-3.7842
With the third season , DEA has focused its attention on the richest organization of the drug trade in the world : the Cali .	-6.7424
Led by four powerful sponsors , they operate " like a Fortune 500 company " only with more government bribery and violent actions .	-7.1011
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela ( Damian Alcazar ) is the leader of the cartel , Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , Pacho Herrera ( Alberto Ammann ) commands the Mexican connection , and Chepe Santacruz Londono ( Pepe Rapazote ) is located in New York .	-2.5782

Scroll backwards : the city has 46 kitchen aids .	-4.5198
The city organizes the Kita lunch table itself .	-3.4339
With fixed contact points for the children and an assignment to the team .	-4.2908
The clock is turned back in the municipal nurseries .	-3.6215
On September 1 , the city of Krefeld takes over the food supply at the municipal children ’ s daycare facilities ( Kitas ) on its own .	-6.4885
For Sonja Pommeranz , Deputy Director of Youth Aid , this is good news : " We were all very pleased " .	-4.0136
A caterer takes over this task and supplies freshly cooked chilled .	-5.6569
The city operates 46 daycare centres in the Krefeld area , and in 44 children receive a warm meal at noon .	-5.5647
In the previous Kitajahr there were 2800 children at the tables and the demand is growing steadily .	-7.0900
" In the meantime , not only children who are cared for 45 hours a week are eating at lunch in the Kita , " explains Pommeranz .	-5.9127
'The offer also applies in the 35-hour care if children stay until 2 p.m. ' .	-5.3690
46 part-time workers will have a kitchen service from 1 September : they will warm up the food delivered , supplement it with salad , raw food and fruit , portionate the meal individually , leave the food , wash and clean the kitchen .	-13.5138
" The employees are firmly assigned to a kita , " says Pommeranz .	-3.8741
The size - there are two groups as well as seven groups - determines the number of hours .	-3.6157
" The kitchen workers are now firmly part of the Kita team " , says Pommeranz satisfied .	-4.2778
" So they are much more involved and it is easier for the kiteboard to implement educational concepts " .	-5.5299
That is also the point : healthy nutrition and cooking lessons .	-3.7805
" Children should help prepare food " .	-2.7584
The direct connection of the kitchen force to the team is .	-4.9598
Also for children .	-2.0949
" They have a known force in Kita , a person who is familiar with them , and not constantly changing people " .	-3.9326
This continuity is important for children .	-1.2766
The cleaning up of the kita rooms - so far also the job of the kitchen staff - will in future be done by special cleaning staff .	-6.2176
This variation - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has not only improved the quality of the kitchen service but also the charm that it has proven to be the most economical in comparison with the costs of the city 's own government and foreign procurement , it is said from the Press Office .	-9.5936
This is despite the fact that 46 part-time workers are being recruited .	-3.7192
" But these hours do not count so much for about 750 people in the educational sector , " says Sonja Pommeranz .	-5.0696
Afghan democracy depends on women ’ s political role , says the UN .	-4.6290
Elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .	-2.1471
Nicholas Haysom , acting leader of the United Nations mission , said that hundreds of women will be running in provincial Council elections ; three women stand for the role of Vice-President and more than 30 % of newly registered voters are women .	-5.3519
" The role of women cannot be overestimated , " he said on Wednesday in a statement .	-1.9575
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women are fully involved and are involved in all parts of the electoral process .	-5.2104
Afghan elections for the provincial council and presidential elections will take place on 5 April .	-2.3331
The Taliban have released threats against an electoral process that coincides with the transition from international fighting to an advisory role .	-3.1693
This year , for the first time , the elections will peacefully transfer power from one democratically elected government to another .	-2.7512
Haysom said that a strong role for women will reinforce Afghanistan ’ s democratic success .	-3.2067
The Afghan independent election commission reports that 1.2 million women are registered by a total of 3.6 million voters .	-2.2212

Men Trying to steal 13-year-old girls	-3.0040
Two young men aged 19 and 23 are said to have tried to rob a 13-year-old girl on Thursday .	-3.0567
According to police information , the men spoke to the 13-year-old , who was sitting with friends on the Kolpingstra<unk>e , at around 2.55 p.m. , because they wanted to phone with the girl 's mobile phone .	-7.4488
The 13-year-old rejected the request and went on with her friends .	-3.4019
In response , one of the perpetrators tried to grab the mobile phone and the necklace of the girl , which however failed .	-8.3966
Without loot , the duo fled .	-2.5890
The two young men were later arrested by the police .	-1.8919
The investigation is under way .	-1.4994
GMB concerns about investment in the McVitie factory in Glasgow	-2.3409
A trade union would like to assure the managers of Biskuit manufacturer McVitie of the long-term commitment to production at its Glasgow plant .	-5.5137
GMB Scotland said that the company has been silent about the future of investments at the Tollcross site .	-4.2504
More than 500 employees work in the plant , which produces besides other Hobnoks and Rich Tea biscuits .	-5.0030
McVities owner Pladis said he has invested more than <unk> 5 million in recent years .	-2.7414
He added that workers and trade union representatives would be " first experienced " if their activities changed .	-3.8189
In a letter to the company 's branch manager , GMB Scotland McVitie 's called for " concern that funding for the modernization of production lines is not being promoted " .	-4.8109
GMB Senior Organiser Drew Duffy said : " The fact that we cannot gain clarity from the General Site Manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross is deeply affecting our members .	-4.7612
Generations of families have worked here and the workforce is heavily concentrated on the local community and the Greater Glasgow area , an important pillar of decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage .	-5.2154
Thus , from the perspective of jobs , wages , and prosperity , and in the context of Brexit , rising living costs , and chronic output , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a thriving production presence at McVitie .	-5.0941
A Pladis spokesperson said : " The Tollcross branch manager received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday , and the company will respond directly to it , as we appreciate the continuous commitment of employees and trade union representatives .	-7.3945
Two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross , where some questions were discussed openly .	-4.9570
We discussed with the staff that we , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , are constantly reviewing our business - and this applies to all our business areas and sites - in order to remain competitive .	-6.1567
She added : " In recent years we have invested more than <unk> 5 million in our Tollcross site , especially in production lines and operational improvements .	-3.6619
We fully recognise the legacy of Tollcross as a production site , and if our operations at the site change , employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to know . '	-5.7412
Did the PSG warn Barcelona three years ago against Neymar ?	-1.9038
The La Liga side may regret her interest in Marco Verratti	-2.7017
Paris Saint-Germain will not cease its persecution of Neymar , having made an offer of $ 189 million to trigger its release clause , but have they warned Barcelona three years ago against the world record ?	-5.2344
The sensational approach fueled the summer transfer window , because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United last season for <unk> 89 million .	-3.7312
After completion , Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athlete in the world .	-3.7165
Barcelona is furious at the way Neymar forced his way out , even though a source close to the Catalan Board of Directors insists that the club has always done its best to take care of it since its arrival from Santos in 2013 .	-5.0521
But was the football world warned of this prospect three years ago by the PSG president ?	-2.8934
When Manchester City expressed interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014 , Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a severe warning for any club that wanted to sign one of the best players in PSG .	-3.7690
" I 'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players , then we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact their players , " said Al-Khelaifi .	-2.2728
" We respect all clubs .	-0.9521
But if they try to sign one of our players , that will have consequences . '	-3.6781
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish club expressing interest in the PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer .	-3.3127
PSG made it clear that it would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offerings to Neymar .	-4.6405

In the area of the village circuit of Stolzenau , a passenger car came to him on his lane , so that he had to escape to the right .	-6.8195
The Touran rider pulled the ladder .	-6.5802
The car produced material damage .	-3.6792
The driver of the passenger car , a Mercedes Benz , had overtaken a lorry and continued his journey without taking care of the road accident .	-4.3417
According to the accident victim , it may be good that the Mercedes driver had not noticed the accident at all .	-3.9224
The police are now asking witnesses of the incident as well as the driver of the transport vehicle to contact the Commissioneriat in Stolzenau on tel . 0576/ 92060 .	-6.3309
Interview : ' Domspatz report relieves Papst Brother Georg Ratzinger '	-3.4194
The Regensburg Domspatzen report on abuses relieves Papst brother Georg Ratzinger .	-4.7296
This means author and historian Michael Hesemann .	-2.8421
The final report on the Abuse scandal at the Regensburg Domspatzen continues to foster discussion .	-5.3032
Christian Weisnder , spokesman for the reform movement " Wir sind Kirche " , declared after publication to the German Press Agency , he expects an apology from the former Regensburg Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger , the 93-year-old brother of the emergent Pope Benedict XVI .	-4.9609
It would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church very much if Müller and Ratzinger were to express their deep regret at their own omissions or their false assessment of what happened at the time .	-6.0321
The Vatican newspaper " Osservatore Romano " , on the other hand , criticised the ' double standards ' of reporting violence in the Domspatzen .	-5.9462
As far as the attacks in Regensburg are concerned , no one doubts that they are ' shameful and shameful acts ' that should be punished and prevented in the future ; but the ' degree of media manipulation ' , according to the author Lucetta Scaraffia , historian and member of the Italian National Committee on Bioethics , is striking .	-6.2763
" The habit of calling the Catholic Church the source of all ills is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to consider it normal , " writes Scaraffia .	-4.3244
In the interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk , Fürst Gloria von Thurn and Taxis also said : " You like to go to the church and that is a found fresco " .	-6.5063
She also pointed out that , in her youth , " strokes were a normal pedagogical tool " to deal with naughty children , as I was one " .	-6.6993
They would find it unfair to apply today ’ s standards to previous decades , because the world has changed .	-2.9048
In connection with the reports of abuse , Papst brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared .	-5.2339
Author and historian Michael Hesemann , who wrote with Ratzinger the memorial book " My Brother of the Pope " ( translated in 12 languages ) .	-9.2150
" I have to protect Georg Ratzinger , " he says , " because all this had nothing to do with him " , he assesses the results of the final report .	-6.5755
What exactly is in the 440-page report presented by the Rechtsanwalt Ulrich Weber , who was appointed to investigate the matter by the diocese of Regensburg ?	-6.5236
Between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s , a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were sexually abused " with great plausibility " by attacks , 67 Domsp.	-5.4824
The final report refers to Georg Ratzinger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : " So , in summary , it can be said that in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence were used by Domkapellmeister R.	-5.6064
Even with high emotionality , punishment could be more severe for pupils .	-5.2699
However , unlike many other defendants , many victims value the general humanity of R. and therefore , in many cases , even combine positive memories with him despite violence " .	-7.7962
In the interview , Hesemann explains why the final report on the scandal of abuse relieves Georg Ratzinger of the Regensburg Domspatzen .	-6.8357
Mr Hesemann , the 440-page report on the ' incidents of violence against those under protection in the Regensburg Domspatzen ' gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger .	-5.2699
On the one hand , many students emphasize their " humanity " .	-3.1805
On the other hand , he also appears as a cholera and perfectionist , who often became handy when a Domspatz musical did not deliver top performance .	-6.6408
How do you view this final report as his biographer ?	-2.8988
Michael Hesemann : If you take the trouble and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger actually appears in it .	-6.0810
Just eight pages are dedicated to him and he is clearly freed from any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .	-4.6483
The excesses of pre-school violence also occurred outside its sphere of activity .	-3.4825
At best , he can be accused of being too late or of not taking the initial suggestions seriously enough .	-5.9229
The Domspatzgymnasium , on which he worked , was perceived by virtually all respondents as - literally - " redemption " , " heaven " and " better world " .	-5.3682
Thus , the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger also gives an excellent testimony , describes him as " warm-hearted " , " popular " , " sincere " , " competent " and " understanding " , as extremely good-natured teachers who regularly supplied the boys with cakes , biscuits and sweets and " always surrounded by children 's grapes " .	-7.5093
Only a minority complained about his perfectionism and his high emotionality , which has led to outbreaks of rage .	-5.4179
He himself admitted years ago , deeply regretted and apologized for the fact that he not only broke up with chairs and threw the keyring on the ground , but also put his ears on the hair or ears , distributed and too naughty .	-10.0160
But , to his honor , it has to be said that such educational methods were widespread in the time in question , the 1960s and 1970s , among parents and teachers .	-6.5442
Do you also know such breeding methods ?	-2.7995
Of course , I think each of us born before 1968 .	-2.3814
I , too , experienced this in a secular school , a state high school .	-4.6114
In comparison with what this report is actually about , namely the appalling sexual abuse and excesses of pre-school violence , these are , of course , trivial matters .	-6.4303
One wonders if it is not more a matter of his notoriety and his role as the brother of Benedict XVI that many media have fallen upon him .	-6.3695
Many who have never understood him are still working diligently on the Bavarian Pope .	-4.3754
The truth , however , is that the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect !	-3.9507
A great deal has been reported in the media in connection with the report on the issue of abuse in the Regensburg Domspatzen .	-5.3664
Will Georg Ratzinger also be accused of any involvement or complicity in sexual abuse in the final report ?	-3.7432
Michael Hesemann : Clearly no .	-2.5988
Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted himself to the Master of the Cathedral .	-3.7698
Not even the parents were consecrated .	-1.9449
" I have never dared to talk to my father or mother about this , " said one of the people concerned on behalf of the others , " I was very embarrassed .	-8.4731
The real problem in educating sexual abuse was , and still is , that most victims remain silent for shame .	-4.1945
If they were not even entrusted to parents and siblings , it would certainly not be a choir leader who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators in a way .	-7.4098
How do the Domspatzen brothers rate Ratzinger ’ s role with regard to abuses ?	-4.8964
Michael Heseman : As one of the students interviewed put it , " With regard to sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he ( Georg Ratzinger ) of all times had a timely knowledge and could have stopped the respective perpetrator .	-7.9657
I also think it is really absurd to assume that he was the one who opened books ... more intrusive or clearer , or even more so than to their parents , boarding boards , trust teachers , etc .	-10.1032
It is unthinkable to talk to him about sex . '	-3.0195
The report thus came to the very clear conclusion : ' The fact that pupils and / or their surroundings were entrusted to him in advance could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation ' .	-6.5285
So , as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg Ratzinger is free of any complicity .	-4.2025
In this way , he cannot be accused of not having prevented or notified him .	-4.7697
There is therefore no reason to associate his good name with these vile crimes , as has unfortunately happened in some cases .	-3.9640
The media read a lot about " excessive violence " in the Regensburg Domspatzen .	-4.5407
The former master of the Cathedral , Georg Ratzinger , is accused of " looking away " in the report .	-5.5568
Does he have to live with this accusation ?	-3.0091
Michael Hesemann : This is the big problem that in the reporting everything was mixed and mixed into a huge melange of sexual abuse and excessive violence and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg Ratzinger .	-4.9196
But that , in turn , is an abuse of the report .	-3.1022
There is a clean separation : between the pre-school and the high school of domes , between sexual abuse and excessive violence and , let us say , other accusations .	-6.0418
In addition , the report deals with incidents since 1945 , including four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not the head of the cathedral friars .	-5.4634
All the terrible caning education , the cases in which the boys of sadistic teachers were really harassed and maltreated and suffered terribly from it , occurred at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen , where truly scandalous conditions had to endure .	-7.5147
However , the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with them , because he first saw the boys when they were already at the Domspatzgymnasium .	-6.5760
On that , as most witnesses emphasize , the topic " pre-school " was taboo .	-3.5111
They were only happy to escape and enjoyed the much better treatment and even " paradise " conditions for many .	-4.9852
What was different about the Domspatzgymnasium ?	-4.0309
Michael Hesemann : There was discipline , but no sadistic violence .	-3.7451
This also applies to Georg Ratzinger , in which the report concludes that " many victims value the general humanity of R. and therefore , in many cases , even combine positive memories with him despite violence " .	-5.5395
At most , the accusation of looking away remains .	-8.7302
However , despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported on pre-school conditions .	-4.5420
The first time in 1970 / 71 , when he just started to establish himself and did not want to hear anything about what happened at a school that he was not working or responsible for ( as the witness said ) , and then only back in 1993 .	-7.2618
Has Georg Ratzinger consistently closed his ears before the conditions ?	-4.0048
Michael Hesemann : No , because as early as 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the university of the Domspatzengymnasium , which the report even reproduces .	-5.3499
In it , he points out to them that " caning is still practised in the pre-school " .	-6.1087
Already in view of the risk of negative press releases , he recommended urgent intervention .	-3.9128
This was , of course , at a time when there was legal clarity when caning sentences were already banned in Bavaria .	-3.6085
Before that , they were in a legal grey area , as everyone knows .	-4.5150
For him too , it was difficult to estimate where those affected had perhaps been exaggerated or dramatized and where the permissible limit had actually been exceeded .	-6.5304
Nor can we say that he has always looked away .	-3.3287
That is simply not true .	-1.3814
Only in 1980 was caning in schools officially abolished in Bavaria .	-3.4950
Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today ’ s educational standards to that time .	-6.8173
How do you see that ?	-1.7221
Michael Hesemann : We historians are talking about the " Falltrick of Anachronism " , in other words the danger of judging past by current moral standards .	-6.2649
The princess is right .	-3.4307
But this does not , of course , apply to sexual abuse , which has always been abominable , nor to what has been said in the pre-school of incantations and violence against innocent children 's souls , which goes far beyond what was then common .	-9.1146
That is all very terrible and I am glad that it is finally being worked out .	-4.7887
But at the same time I must protect Georg Ratzinger , because all this had nothing to do with him .	-3.0400
His means of discipline and punishment , that is to say , slap in the face and pull on the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .	-6.6461
When physical punishment was then banned , he also adhered strictly to it .	-3.8767
What image of his Regensburg time did Georg Ratzinger reflect in his conversations with you for the book " My Brother the Pope " ?	-5.9870
Did the subject of caning also be mentioned ?	-3.1479
Michael Hesemann : Well , the book deals with the life of his brother Joseph , in other words Pope Benedict XVI , tells from his perspective that the Domspatzen played only a secondary role .	-6.1331
Nevertheless , I do not hide the fact that he led a strict regime there .	-4.2373
However , this must be said once again : without this perfectionism , without demanding unconditional discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world renown , true cultural ambassadors of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .	-6.5752
With biscuits and sweets alone , you don ’ t turn recalcitrant boys into great singers and stand before every success , no matter what area , but always discipline , passion and self-overcoming .	-7.7897
What kind of person did you see Georg Ratzinger talking about her book ?	-4.4689
Michael Hesemann : By working on the book and beyond , I really got to know Georg Ratzinger very well and I have always experienced him as a wonderful , humorous , good-natured , deeply believing and heartbreaking person , from whom one cannot imagine that he could do anything even for a fly .	-9.3836
I regularly get in touch with him , visit him , read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family , 23 years after .	-4.7682
So those who still do not forgive him for being strict with them are clearly in the minority .	-4.6668
Most Domspatzen are grateful to him today for enriching their lives and bringing the world of music to them .	-4.6256
And that he was always a good , paternal teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a likeable person of respect , to whom they are still today and who they almost worship .	-7.3914
I would like to make it quite clear once again that all that is being accused of is methods of education that were on the agenda at the time .	-7.1774
We can be glad that we have long since overcome this period .	-3.5537
But it is highly unfair to make a man , just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother , the media scapegoat .	-3.4206
The evil intention behind it is all too obvious .	-3.0257
The report that has just been published relieves it .	-2.9421
Now the decency would demand that a 93-year-old man , who has earned a great deal of credit and who , without those outside Bavaria and perhaps still Germany , would probably not know the Regensburg Domspatzen , finally leave in peace . is . is .	-11.5284
