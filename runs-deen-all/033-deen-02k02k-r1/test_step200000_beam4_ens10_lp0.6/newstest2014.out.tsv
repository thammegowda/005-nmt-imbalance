Gutach : Even more safety for pedestrians	-1.9763
They are not 100 metres from each other : on Tuesday , the new B 33 pedestrian lights were launched at the village parking lot - in view of the older Town Hall lights .	-5.9784
Two facilities so close to each other : intention or coup d 'état ?	-2.6205
This question was clearly answered by Gutach ’ s mayor yesterday .	-2.4018
" The Town Hall Sample was installed at the time because it secures the school path " , explained Eckert yesterday .	-3.9058
The Kluser traffic lights safe both cyclists and bus passengers and the inhabitants of cycccc. ccccccccyclists and cccycycycy	-10.3488
Yesterday 's official plant was important for the Sulzbachweg / Kirchstra<unk>e crossroads .	-3.5645
We have the museum , two churches , spa park , the bus stop , a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area <unk> Grub <unk> .	-3.2067
" In the high volume of traffic and pedestrians , another traffic light had to be found for their safety " , says Eckert .	-5.6906
This is also confirmed by Peter Arnold of the Offenburg Landratsamt .	-3.0993
" According to current measurements , about 12 000 vehicles pass through the municipality of Gutach on the B 33 daily , about ten percent of which are heavy goods traffic " , stresses Arnold .	-4.6580
Therefore , the construction of another traffic light is more than necessary : " Safety is simply going ahead " , says Arnold .	-4.7351
A total of four traffic shows had been carried out , and a roundabout was also thought out , but due to the narrow crossroads in Sulzbachweg / Kirchstra<unk>e .	-6.0628
According to Arnold , everything was tested earlier in the location of the traffic lights : " By means of an extra transporter loaded for us with particularly long wooden trunks , we have tested whether these vehicles can leave the Sulzbachweg to the B 33 without knocking the traffic lights " .	-7.5406
The approximately EUR 15 000 traffic lights facility itself is the " most modern thing on the market " , explained Arnold .	-4.8408
The facility is equipped with coloured LEDs that shine so strongly that the lights can be easily recognized by the drivers , for example , even in deep sun .	-6.3760
It is also economical : the older lighting systems consume about 100 watts , the new just eight watts .	-4.4288
There are three lights per direction .	-2.5871
Arnold explained the technology of the new plant : this is equipped with two radar sensors .	-2.7395
If the pedestrian pushes the traffic light button , the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation .	-3.0246
If the road is free , comes immediately green for the pedestrian , if not , it takes about 15 seconds .	-2.3961
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase can be finished for the pedestrian .	-2.9180
" If a group or disabled people go over the road , the green phase will be extended , so everyone will come safely over the road , " said Arnold .	-4.9748
Of course , the driver must consider this as a partner and observe the road .	-5.0622
This was not the case yesterday : hardly showed the traffic light for pedestrians green , noisy a top class vehicle - with shining red .	-4.2167
For more than 30 years , Josef Winkler has written the needs of his childhood and youth from the soul .	-3.1303
The Carinthian poet has often described the disasters of his Catholic village childhood - the lack of language , the tendency to raw violence and blunt sexuality , the narrow and joylessness .	-4.7994
The Büchner Prize winner is mainly known as a prose author , theatre texts are rare in his work .	-4.6676
Collage from prose texts Gerhard Fresacher creates a collage of prose texts for his performance " Weather lights on the tongue tip " , which is now visible in the garage X at Petersplatz .	-5.8455
The theatre maker , for example , combines elements from the autobiographically characterized novel " Der Leibeigenen " ( 1987 ) with prosaminiatures from " Leichnam , his family lauding " ( 2003 ) .	-5.1213
The eight-headed ensemble hangs through the text material on the largely empty stage - an important requirement : a slippery sofa on coand the . the the , , , , the , , , , or , , , , , or , , the , , , , or , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-25.0584
Director Fresacher seems to have little confidence in the text .	-2.6501
The 70-minute performance overlooks the template with a wealth of direct incidents , known from the repertoire of post-dramatic forms of play .	-4.4872
Especially the actresses come up with the sometimes somewhat dubious scenic realisations .	-10.7002
They are touched hard , dipped with the head under water , baked with their evening robes to the wall .	-5.4508
Impressed in cellophane or blacksmith , they stake on dangerously high sticks through the staging , either monologize them loudly or lie completely silenced on the stage floor .	-6.1182
The text , however , is hardly conveyed in this effort .	-4.1101
The best moments have the evening when sung - the bandwidth ranges from Deep Purple to popular songs .	-3.6306
Only in the end will the overturned performance come to a little calm , and Winkler 's absurd humor is flashing up . the . the the . the the the the . the the	-13.5805
A blackbox in the car ?	-1.3972
U.S. road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the declining highway system , and believe they have found the solution in a small black box that can be placed on the dashboard of each car .	-5.1981
The devices that record every kilometre of driving and report the information to the authorities are at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and the states ’ planning offices to revise the outdated system of financing US roads .	-4.6271
The normally rather boring area of road planning has suddenly sparked an intense debate with colourful alliances .	-3.4815
Libertarians have allied themselves with environmental groups , arguing that the government can use the small boxes to record the driven kilometres – and possibly where they were driven – and then use the information to calculate tax modes .	-4.7393
The Tea Party is horrified .	-1.2643
The American Civil Rights Association ( ACLU ) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of data protection concerns .	-2.5126
But , while Congress cannot agree on action , several states no longer wait .	-3.4729
They are currently examining how they can switch over the next ten years to a system where drivers pay per mile . .	-3.5782
Thousands of motorists have already tested the tachographs , some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring . .	-8.6528
That really is a must for our country .	-2.1391
“ It is nothing we may only use , ” said Hasan Ikhrata , Managing Director of the Southern California Assn. of Governments , who plans to record the miles driven by all Californian drivers in the state from 2025 onwards .	-4.7130
The way we pay these taxes will change .	-1.3616
The technology is there .	-1.7613
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund , financed from taxes paid by Americans at the fuel pillar , is defaulting .	-3.7379
But America is no longer tanked as much as it used to be .	-3.5445
Cars use less petrol .	-1.3326
The government oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon ( less than 4 euro cents per litre ) has not increased for 20 years .	-2.9112
At high injection prices , politicians do not dare to raise taxes by just one cent .	-4.0302
“ The tax on petrol is simply not sustainable , ” says Lee Munnich , an expert in transport legislation at the University of Minnesota .	-3.1926
Its state recently equipped 500 cars with tachographs to test a mile-based payment system .	-2.3005
“ This is the most meaningful alternative in the long run , ” he said .	-6.8298
Bureaucrats call it a mile-based user fee .	-2.1853
Not surprisingly , the idea has been applauded by urban liberals , for example , because the tax could be used to influence driving behaviour in such a way as to reduce congestion and harmful emissions .	-5.1553
The Californian planners are relying on the system to develop strategies to achieve the ambitious statutory objectives of the federal state on climate change .	-4.7811
But the Republican Bill Shuster from Pennsylvania , Chairman of the House Transportation Committee , has also stated that he is the most viable long-term alternative .	-2.9800
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are also encouraged by the idea of having drivers pay after the route reached .	-5.0638
“ This is not a tax that disappears in a black hole , ” explains Adrian Moore , Vice President of Reason ’ s Guidelines .	-2.8398
People pay directly for what they get .	-1.3078
The movement is also supported by two former US Transport Ministers , who in a 2011 report called on Congress to move toward mile-based accounting .	-9.3293
The US Senate approved a $ 90 million pilot project last year , which would have included 10,000 cars .	-2.5022
But the majority in the House prevented the move and thus responded to the concerns of rural MEPs , who represent people who often have to go many miles on their way to work or to the city in their daily lives .	-5.6482
Nonetheless , several states and major cities are moving in this direction on their own .	-3.2620
The most committed is Oregon , which currently recruits 5,000 drivers for the country ’ s biggest experiment .	-10.2375
These drivers will soon pay the mileage fees instead of the oil tax to the state .	-3.0020
Nevada has already completed a pilot project .	-1.0727
New York City is also considering this .	-1.7797
Illinois tests it to a limited extent with trucks .	-2.0487
And the I-95 coalition , which includes the Transport Ministries of 17 states on the east coast ( including Maryland , Pennsylvania , Virginia , and Florida ) , is currently investigating how to introduce the change .	-2.8644
The concept is not a universal hit .	-0.9050
In Nevada , where recently 50 volunteers were equipped with the equipment , drivers were sceptical about the idea that the government could pursue each of its movements .	-3.4230
“ Concerns about Big Brother and such things were a big problem , ” explains Alauddin Khan , Head of Strategy and Earnings Management at the Transport Ministry of Nevada .	-3.4869
People did not want it .	-1.5470
When the test started , Nevada ’ s ACLU warned : “ It would be relatively easy to turn tachographs into adult monitoring devices . ”	-3.7194
There is no need to build a huge , bulky technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data about the daily movements of individuals .	-2.6344
Nevada is part of a series of states that are now looking for affordable technology with which the state can capture the driven kilometres , but not exactly when and where .	-4.1194
That , Khan said , would also reassure the public .	-3.4784
Hunting for this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California .	-2.2999
The company originally failed to help states tax drivers .	-3.5659
Rather , it was their aim to foot in an emerging market for car insurance , where drivers should pay on the basis of the miles driven .	-5.2883
But the devices it tested are also interesting for road planners , because they do not work with GPS and provide only limited information that is uploaded regularly by modem .	-4.8937
“ People are more willing to participate if their speed and sites are not recorded , ” said Ryan Morrison , Managing Director of True Mileage .	-11.2877
Some of these public pilot programmes have made major mistakes .	-2.2109
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways of implementing this .	-2.1594
In Oregon , the planners experiment with giving drivers a number of choices .	-3.3000
You can choose a device with or without GPS .	-1.7693
Or they choose no device at all and instead pay a flat rate based on the average miles driven by all federal residents .	-4.5559
Other bodies hope to be able to sell the concept of a suspicious public by providing the devices with more functions than few .	-4.2134
In New York City , traffic officers want to develop a taxation device that also pays parking fees , pays insurance only for driven kilometres , and collects speed data from other vehicles in real time , thanks to which car drivers can avoid traffic congestion .	-5.2326
“ Drivers would be motivated to participate by the added value of the benefits offered by the system , ” says a city planning document .	-3.9799
However , some transport planners are wondering whether the whole talk about paying per mile is not just a huge diversion .	-12.6812
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay area , officials declared that the Congress could solve the problem of bankrupt Highway Trust Fund simply by increasing fuel taxes .	-12.9152
An additional one-off charge or an annual charge could be imposed on drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that use little petrol , so that they also pay a fair share .	-4.3197
“ There is no reason for an operation if an aspirin is sufficient , ” explains Randy Rentschler , the Commission ’ s Legislative and Public Affairs Hthe the . the the the . the the the . the the the	-11.8479
If we do that , hundreds of millions of drivers worry about their privacy and many other things .	-2.4665
Königsfeld : Small team hits wacker	-9.3558
The Volunteer fire brigade managed its autumn main sample despite the lack of staff .	-5.4199
Only eleven people participated in the exercise .	-2.2744
Hans Kammerer had chosen the property Feder in Burgberger Stra<unk>e in his practice .	-4.3538
A short circuit should have been created when sawing .	-4.0783
Two people were injured by the fire and the smoking development , but one of them could send an emergency call .	-4.8613
After the first review of the facts by Hans Kammerer , two respiratory guards of the Wehr prepared to enter the building .	-4.7346
After a short time , we managed to find the first person and lead to the open air .	-11.3318
The second person had to be worn .	-1.2974
This was not so easy , as a narrow staircase was also to be overcome .	-4.8335
The building , a workshop with integrated stabling for two horses , was not easy to secure .	-2.3682
It stored a lot of wood and also straw bales .	-2.8498
There were also electrical machines for wood processing .	-2.7449
The first extinguishing attack occurred via the tank in the vehicle .	-2.3754
A further line was carried out via a floor hydrant at about 100 meters distance .	-5.2455
Three extinguishing attacks have now been created .	-2.6432
A cavity tube was also used in the building .	-3.4309
Hans Kammerer also wanted to show what is to be done with little available personnel .	-5.3314
In case of seriousness , support is provided via the Königsfeld daily operations group .	-4.3609
The commander was satisfied with the course of the exercise .	-2.6354
Networking of universities and companies	-15.5638
On his visit to the Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald district , Landtag President Guido Wolf was also able to explain to Titisee-Neustadt where the workers of tomorrow come from .	-5.2594
At the Hochschwarzwald Förderzentrum , he worked together with the Managing Directors of Vocational Schools and the District Gymnasium and the Chairman of the Parent Advisory Board on this important issue .	-6.2303
" Education is an important location factor " , emphasized Claudia Stehle , director of the Hans-Thoma School , who presented the networked educational project Education Centre Hochblack Forest .	-4.5072
Wolf was impressed by the model projects for training .	-3.2006
Since 2011 there has been a successful collaboration between the Förderzentrum , Kreisgymnasium and Vocational School Centre in the Walderstadt .	-4.5528
He also praised the family friendliness in the county .	-2.4025
" It is important not only to have a look at the family phase , but also the phase of care for relatives due to demographic change , " explained Wolf .	-4.4591
He also stated that more and more employees took care of the care and care of their relatives .	-3.8953
" Without the support of employers , the resulting burden on employees can lead to an end to the working relationship , " said Wolf .	-3.7335
But no one can afford to lose skilled workers , he said .	-2.5590
Another particularly important factor is the networking of universities and companies .	-2.7810
" For anyone who has already learned the benefits of the region during his studies , with his acquired knowledge and skills , is often preserved by the regional economy , which contributes to the strengthening of the region , " the president of Landtag was convinced .	-6.7262
Because only if sufficient training places are offered can the skilled workforce be met .	-4.8045
In his opinion , the district 's location advantage is its advantageous location in the south-west of Germany , close to France and Switzerland .	-3.7870
He also experienced the efforts already made on his railway journey from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg to develop public transport .	-4.5227
" Stay stubbornly and make public transport better , " he explained to the local politicians present .	-4.4833
Experience an entertaining afternoon with music .	-9.5163
For 15 years the Kaul family has been inviting the Dietinger seniors to coffee , cakes and then to a vesper .	-3.5492
In the past the elderly were hosted in the restaurant .	-3.5940
Meanwhile , this afternoon will take place in the nursing home of St. Josef .	-3.8945
The residents were looking forward to the delicious cakes and cakes .	-2.6577
Later there was a salad .	-2.4701
Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich talked with common melodies .	-3.2117
The more than 100-year-old natural stone wall as the front separation of the old school courtyard to the Kirchstra<unk>e is to be replaced with the restoration cost plan of the city of Bräunlingen .	-5.9323
In the days before the Kilbig , a small corner wall , stabilization and static discharge of the 100-year-old natural stone wall with balustrade was installed during the first work of the rehabilitation of the front school courtyard .	-6.4775
Further action is envisaged , according to Alexander Misok of the Bräunlinger Stadtbauamt , to include the National Monument Office in the planning and to develop a rehabilitation concept for the old wall .	-5.6363
Then a cost calculation is to be carried out by experts , who will then be put on the table to the municipal council to decide and determine how to proceed further .	-6.0944
A decision on this is expected to be taken next year .	-2.9955
After the rehabilitation , paving and tree planting of the old school inner courtyard within the two sides of the school built in 1912 , it will be necessary for the foreseeable future to rehabilitate and rebuild the restrictive wall from scra.	-7.4759
The historic , 100-year-old separation wall of the old school courtyard to the Kirchstra<unk>e , is mainly due to water and frost damage , since there is no drainage , needs to be rehabilitated and has an arch propensity forward .	-6.2769
Deep cracks in individual stones demonstrate weather damage , but the wall is not currently at risk of collapse .	-3.7545
A stable wall is a prerequisite for a school courtyard used by pupils , which has been done through the current fastening work .	-5.8722
Originally , school rehabilitation was planned even in 2008 / 2009 , but high unscheduled expenditure brought a shift .	-4.4910
An important word in the historical rehabilitation of school walls , which has even been used for film recordings , will be helped by the National Monument Office .	-6.0262
Should the guidelines come from this site , the city of Bräunlingen hopes for grants from the monument protectors .	-4.9896
The students of the Bräunlinger Primary School , who are now again taught in a well-restored old school building with new aula , will soon be able to use the old school court .	-12.2066
<unk>zdemir wants to receive jazz training in Stuttgart	-2.0885
In the ongoing discussions about the future of the music colleges in Baden-Württemberg , Cem <unk>zdemir , the Chairman of the Greens , has now become involved .	-4.9803
" I think it is wrong to give up holistic training at the Musikhochschule Stuttgart " , said <unk>zdemir the " Stuttgart News " .	-3.2875
Jazz and classical music just belong together at the jazz location Stuttgart .	-3.9237
This contradicts <unk>zdemir , who in Stuttgart is a favourite for a direct mandate in the German election on 22 September , the Green Red State Government .	-14.5481
Based on an expert study , this study forces a reorganisation of the five music colleges in Baden-Württemberg .	-4.6356
After that , the study course Jazz and Pop will be relocated from the Musikhochschule Stuttgart to the Musikhochschule Mannheim . .	-11.5468
US Border : Super-Tunnel discovered for drug smuggling	-3.1741
On the border between Mexico and the US , investigators have discovered and decommissioned a " super tunnel " for drug smuggling .	-3.1764
As the US customs authorities announced , the more than 500 metre-long tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity , railway tracks , and a ventilation system .	-3.5491
Three suspects were thus arrested , eight tonnes of marijuana and almost 150 kilograms of cocaine confiscated .	-2.7945
According to the tunnel , it has not yet been used .	-3.2433
" These cartels are stupid when they think they could go through the radar , " said the prosecutor general of the US district of Southern California , Laura Duffy , at a press conference in front of a warehouse in San Diego , where this had been discovered an end to the tunnel .	-4.8471
Duffy insured the drug bands : " If you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them , we are determined to make this a huge waste of your dirty money " .	-4.6857
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a permanent fight against the drug cartels .	-2.6069
Since 2006 , more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug crime .	-2.0127
Constructed by Experts	-1.6165
Due to the elaborate equipment of the tunnel , the investigators assume that it was constructed by architects and engineers and that the construction took about a year .	-4.2271
The track system was equipped in such a way that electrically operated cars could be used there .	-3.9879
On the Mexican side , access is located in a building 80 meters from the border .	-9.4487
According to the authorities , a ladder leads 20 meters into the depth to the actual tunnel entrance .	-4.1809
The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 metres altitude and 90 centimeters width .	-8.3309
It would have been appropriate to encourage illegal immigration towards the United States .	-3.0392
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine fund .	-1.9303
The third , a Mexican , was captured because of the seized marijuana .	-2.9235
All three threaten lifelong freedom , as civil servants have said , as . . . the . the the . the the . the the the the	-10.5831
Eight such tunnels had been discovered since 2006 , and the press conference in San Diego continued .	-2.8668
But it is the first time that cocaine was found in such a tunnel building .	-3.2843
Normally cocaine is smuggled in smaller quantities and not through tunnels .	-2.5209
This shows the " despair " of the drug gangs whose traditional routes have now been cut off , Bill Sherman said of the DEA drug seizure in San Diego .	-8.4346
They would do everything possible to reach the US .	-2.3480
No details were announced on the detainees , at least one of them was Mexican .	-9.7965
They must expect prison sentences of up to ten years .	-2.5979
In 2014 , Geisinger Festjahr	-14.5344
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250 .	-2.5060
Returning to the first documentary mention is becoming ever closer .	-3.7910
When the year ends in just over eight weeks , the anniversary year is due .	-4.2139
Geisingen und Kirchen-Hausen wurde 794 erkundlich erstmals zusammen .	-5.5658
A certificate was produced in churches where both places are mentioned .	-3.6607
On 15 March there will be an official start to the anniversary year , and since Geisingen currently has no hall , this opening event will take place in the place where both were first mentioned 1250 years ago , in church houses .	-5.2576
A number of events are planned in Geisingen as well as in church houses .	-4.3875
Church house will be the 1250 in July on a festive weekend from 18 to 20 July .	-3.7190
Return to celebrate .	-2.5528
On Friday with a festival , on Saturday and Sunday with a festival around the Kirchtalhalle .	-2.9781
This weekend is also the Church-Hausen Church Festival .	-3.9610
City Music Director Rudolf Barth wrote an order composition for the city on the occasion of the anniversary , which will be performed at three dates .	-4.4054
On June 21 , together with the sunny celebration of the Black Forest Association , on July 12 , in the arena with fireworks and on December 13 , the first concert of city music in the new Festhalle .	-11.1259
It will be ready and dedicated in the anniversary year , the official date is last September weekend , 27 and 28 September .	-12.2585
A new chronicle will be released on the occasion of the Geisinger City Jubilee .	-3.9858
" It should be a chronicle not only of Geisingen himself , but also a printed work about today 's hostage , which consists of Geisingen , Church Hausen , Leipferdingen , Aulfingen and Gutmadingen , " says Mayor Walter Hengstler .	-5.3853
Today ’ s hostage celebrates its birthday in 2014 , and today ’ s space with the communities was completed in 1974 .	-4.6182
The new chronicle will be presented at the new Festhalle in Geisingen on 21 or 22 November .	-3.1677
But 2014 is another year with many anniversaries .	-2.6777
The Strohglonki Narrenzunft starts on February 8 with a custom evening on the occasion of its 60th anniversary , the harmony of Gutmadingen becomes 90 years and has the festival banquet on March 29 and then celebrates the district music festival from May 1 to 4 .	-6.1702
The Altenwerk Leipferdingen becomes 40 years old , the Geisinger School has been at the new location for 50 years and celebrates it on 10 May , the music association Polyhymnia Leipferdingen will be 150 years old and celebrates it in the context of the Well Festival from 4 to 7 July .	-5.2618
The town of Geisingen was first mentioned in 764 in a donation certificate owned by the St. Gallen monastery .	-10.6438
The certificate was produced in churches ( houses ) , which was then a court place .	-3.8274
Both municipalities are therefore mentioned in the same document .	-1.9537
Because of 2014 to celebrate this 1250-year-old accordingly , the municipal reform is 40 years ago .	-5.2973
Council is targeting track installations	-3.5628
Should the railway transition " Am Hirschen " be costly converted to increase road safety ?	-4.6176
Yes , the municipal councils decided .	-7.9350
Shiltach must take EUR 220 000 into the hands for this .	-3.8743
Deutsche Bahn wants to improve the Kinzigtal railway line next year .	-3.3523
The aim is to increase safety at railway transitions - regularly collisions of trains with other vehicles occur throughout Germany .	-5.7671
If the municipalities agree to the restructuring measures , they must participate with a third in the costs , the rest share the railway and federal government .	-5.3265
Schiltach 's mayor Roland Gree<unk>haber explained to the municipal council the characteristics of the railway pass " Am Hirschen " .	-4.4770
There , the city plans to build a book in the amount of the tunnel mouth to the west of the railway track .	-5.0095
There could also be larger vehicles , such as those carrying long wood , at opposite traffic without having to block the track .	-5.5026
Greek-owner therefore proposed to construct a necessary support wall in such a way that the city could spread the subsequent road in due course to ensure a smooth traffic flow .	-5.5705
This was controversially discussed in the municipal council , as some councils doubted the need for road spreading : Thomas Kipp , in his statement , brought the critics ' mood to the point : ' Do we have to take so much money into the hands of so few vehicles ? '	-6.5286
Mayor Thomas Haas contradicted : The railway transition " Hirschen " is regularly used for long wood transport .	-3.5187
Even wood from the " Kuhbach " area is partly transported over this route , because up to 20 metres long vehicles could not use the route on the Häberlesbrücke because they could not turn into the main road there .	-5.3975
In addition , the route serves as a redirection for those vehicles that cannot use the tunnel when the main road is closed , Haas argued .	-3.5435
Since it should be foreseen that the Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnels should be rebuilt and rehabilitated , as is currently the case in Wolfach , the railway transition " Am Hirschen " could also have an important transport meaning for a longer period .	-12.2086
The councils agreed to investigate the costs of the intended broadening of the road .	-4.5874
Notwithstanding this , the majority voted in favour of the restructuring of the railway transition with the required supporting wall being built in such a way that the city could expand the subsequent road towards " Bahnhofstra<unk>e " to approximately 5.5 metres for encounter traffic .	-7.1576
On the other hand , the transition of the railway at the Gerrei Trautwein could pose a very different problem , which concerns access to the heavily rising ' Geroltzhäuser Weg ' .	-6.3319
The administration had investigated the restructuring plans of the railway from the Breinlinger engineering office , as it had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhauser Weg would be possible without further delay .	-5.7044
The investigation came to the conclusion that it is not possible to rule out that the tendencies of the road could lead to longer vehicles sitting .	-5.4690
The responsibility for this , in turn , lies with the city as a street carrier .	-5.0874
The conversion could therefore result in liability disputes .	-3.9249
Haas argued that , since both the wood deportation and the turning off were working in the current state of expansion , the transition was not supposed to be approved .	-8.4418
At this point , too , the risk of a collision of the train with a car on the transition is significantly lower than at the other railway crossings , because there is directly next to the stop point at which there is a good visibility connection .	-7.1224
Even trains from the central station would have to be slowed down here to the point that no collision threatens .	-5.4458
The majority refused to accept the restructuring of this railway transition , as the city of Schiltach had to " bathe out " the problem with vehicles on its side , according to the councils , as the railways could withdraw from the responsibility after the construction works have been completed .	-8.8740
The panel considers the restructuring at the railway crossings " Vor Heubach " and " Vor Kuhbach " , for which cross-cutting agreements have already been reached by railway .	-13.4700
Esa decides on major space missions : Missions for billions	-2.6494
Far planets , gravitational waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects they want to launch in the coming years . .	-9.4302
30 proposals were available , five are still in the race .	-3.4705
Far worlds .	-0.7946
More than 1000 planets at other stars have already found astronomers .	-2.0855
No one knows whether there are lives on at least some of them .	-3.3111
The choice is difficult : Should you look for gravitational waves ?	-3.2052
Or would you prefer to explore the origin of the cosmo the the the the the . the the the the the . the the	-8.3419
Or walk to Earth-like planets , perhaps discovering alien life ?	-4.9590
These questions are exactly the responsible of the European Space Agency Esa .	-4.1684
For their " Cosmic Vision " program , they are looking for ideas for two major space projects , which are intended to promote research decisively .	-10.2458
The budget for such " L-missions " is approximately EUR 1 billion each .	-10.0244
The start is expected to be 2028 and 2034 .	-2.0418
In early September , the elite of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions .	-2.2189
30 ideas have been discussed , five of them have now come to the closer election .	-4.1846
Numerous bodies examine the proposals and follow up with researchers .	-4.3331
In the next few days , a final decision will be taken by the scientific programme committee .	-10.9037
A total of four major questions have been chosen by the Esa , to which the missions of the 2007 Cosmic Vision programme will find answers .	-4.4432
What are the conditions for the emergence of planets and lives ?	-1.8394
The exact events of the emergence of stars from large gas clouds - and thus the emergence of planets surrounding these stars - are still in the proverbial dark .	-4.6048
A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this dark .	-2.4505
And if a star has a planet , under what circumstances can life arise there ?	-3.0368
To address this issue , the 2017 space telescope " Cheops " will be launched , with which 500 already known planetary systems will be examined more closely in our surroundings .	-5.3132
The possibilities are limited , however , and cheops are a small mission with a budget of EUR 150 million .	-2.9103
With larger instruments , astronomers could map earth-like planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres , searching for " biomarkers " : gases that are considered to be an indication of biological activity .	-9.6873
How does the solar system work ?	-0.9926
This issue , too , is ultimately intended to provide information on the conditions for the emergence of life .	-5.1912
An important role is the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field as well as the particle radiation that it generates with the planetary system .	-4.3728
In our solar system these processes can be examined exemplary .	-3.3945
With the " Solar Orbiter " , the Esa has already granted a M class mission ( there the budget is about half a billion euros ) for this issue .	-9.8622
The probe will start in 2017 and closely monitor the surface and activity of the sun .	-3.1601
Jupiter and his moons are of great interest to researchers .	-2.6980
They want to find out what role the giant planet played in the development of the solar system .	-2.8224
The Esa provides for the first of the three L-missions of the Cosmic Vision program . the the the the .	-5.5123
The probe " Juice " ( Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer ) is expected to start its journey in 2022 .	-2.3980
Eight years later , she reached Jupiter and was to investigate the atmosphere of the planet and the icy moons of Europe , Kallisto and Ganymed .	-3.6037
What are the basic physical laws of the universe ?	-0.9400
Space offers many opportunities to study matter under extreme conditions and to investigate whether the laws of nature known to us are still valid there .	-5.2824
Perhaps there are also deviations that could show physicists the way to a new theory under which all known laws of nature can be united .	-4.4872
What has the universe emerged and what is it ?	-3.5778
13.7 billion years ago our cosmos came into being through the big bang .	-3.1912
Besides the common matter that consists of stars , planets and living creatures like us , there is dark matter , whose gravity holds galaxies and galaxy clusters together , and dark energy , through whose actions the expansion of space accelerates .	-5.4451
So far , researchers do not know which physical laws were valid in the first fractions of the big bang , nor what dark matter and dark energy consist of .	-3.9688
With " Euclid " , the Esa has already approved a M mission , which is scheduled to start in 2020 .	-4.7075
With a special telescope , the probe is designed to investigate the distribution of material in the universe for the first time throughout the sky , thus enabling conclusions on the nature of dark matter and dark energy .	-5.8552
Who Could Do the Race	-9.1937
Of the 30 proposals , only two will remain at the end of the selection procedure .	-1.9250
In the opinion of many experts , " E-Lisa " , the best chances of granting an L-mission is a sophisticated concept for detecting gravitational waves .	-5.5904
This includes physicists ’ changes in the structure of space that Albert Einstein predicted almost 100 years ago .	-3.2580
They have not been proven to date .	-2.6134
Elisa could do that , the scientists hope behind the project .	-2.1258
The mission provides for a detector consisting of two or three probes , which is deployed in space .	-3.8450
In contrast to plants on Earth , it could also prove gravitational waves created by the Big Bang , thereby providing new insights into the emergence of the cosmos .	-12.2748
Four other proposals are still competing for the second L-mission : a large X-ray telescope called " Athena " , which is intended to explore , among other things , black holes , " Icy Planets " , another mission to the outer planets of the solar system , " Prism " , a mission to measure the cosmic background radiation , and the " Exoplanet Finder " , which is intended to detect and investigate earth-like planets .	-5.1726
There have already been suggestions for the sample return transport from Mars , for the exploration of moon , venus and asteroids as well as for solar physics .	-5.6741
Snowden willing to “ cooperate ” with Germany on US surveillance	-2.1551
Edward Snowden , the whistleblower of the US intelligence service , has declared that he is willing to travel to Berlin and say to the German Bundestag if the American National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander do not provide answers about their activities .	-4.4047
German MEP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden in Russia on Thursday , where this asylum was received to discuss with him the statement in Germany .	-3.3338
In a letter from Snowden , which was presented to the media in Berlin on Friday by Ströbele , he writes : “ Although the outcome of my efforts has been demonstrably positive , my government continues to treat a differing opinion as a faithful break and attempts to criminalise political expression with a threat of punishment that cannot be defended . ”	-6.3227
But telling the truth is not a crime .	-1.7875
In the letter , Snowden writes that he is convinced that the international community ’ s support can persuade the American government to drop the charge against him .	-3.6997
The charge charged by the US Department of Justice includes spying and theft of state property .	-3.4398
German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich said to Time Online : “ If Mr Snowden is willing to speak with German representatives , we find ways to make that possible . ”	-3.8347
Relations between the US and Germany are strained by claims that Chancellor Angela Merkel ’ s mobile phone has listened to the NSA .	-3.7573
Thomas Oppermann , the Member who chairs the parliamentary committee responsible for the intelligence service , said that one should seize the opportunity to listen to Snowden as a witness , if possible , “ without jeopardising him and completely ruining relations with the US . ”	-5.2147
Ströbele , a member of the Greens , published a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed .	-2.8680
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia .	-1.4421
Ströbele explained that , according to the lawyer of the former NSA employee , Snowden cannot return to Russia when he leaves the country .	-3.6402
When Snowden says in Germany , he needs an assurance that he is “ safe ” there , he says .	-3.8663
Snowden explained in his letter that he was exposed to a “ serious and ongoing ” persecution campaign that had driven him out of his homeland .	-4.0770
But it is touched by the global response to “ my act of political expression . ”	-2.6520
Citizens around the world and senior politicians – including in the United States – have described revelations of an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance as a merit to the general public .	-3.9579
In his letter , Snowden makes the German authorities an offer of cooperation , “ if the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation have been resolved . ”	-3.6504
Frontier Airlines charges handbaggage baggage char. baggage charbbbbbaggage .	-6.7664
Frontier Airlines plans to demand up to $ 100 from passengers who want to stow hand baggage on their flight .	-3.8568
Frontier Airlines intends to calculate up to $ 100 for a piece of hand baggage and $ 2 for coffee or lemonade , even if the announcement on Wednesday was that passengers would be likely to keep the entire . the , the , the , the , the , the . the , ,	-11.5948
The new fee applies to hand baggage in the luggage compartment above the seat , small bags under the seat remain free of charge .	-3.6381
Frontier explained that $ 25 is calculated when the fee is paid in advance , and $ 100 for travellers who only paid at the boarding gate .	-4.6895
Frontier spokesman Kate O 'Malley said that the fee of $ 100 was aimed at moving travellers to take care of payment in advance .	-4.3284
“ We do not want to calculate this sum , ” she explained .	-2.3326
In 2008 , airlines began to charge fees for the first and second checked baggage pieces . . the . the the . the the . the the the . the the	-11.4553
Therefore , passengers who tried to circumvent them have pushed as much as possible into hand baggage , which means that the baggage boxes are often overcrowded over the seat .	-5.6741
Fees are a way to get passengers to take less on board .	-3.0885
O 'Malley said that the new fee is not really about making money .	-2.0696
We are talking about the most loyal customers of Frontier , who would have made it clear that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find space above the seat .	-5.0078
Passengers who purchase your tickets on the airline ’ s website do not have to pay .	-2.7542
This means that a passenger at the boarding gate of Frontier may be allowed to take a piece of baggage free of charge , but the next person may have to pay $ 100 for a comparable baggage .	-11.1590
O 'Malley declared that the Frontier website and check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers were informed of the fee before they arrived at the boarding gate .	-4.9595
The new hand baggage fee from Frontier only comes into force in the summer , the exact date is not yet available .	-4.1711
Passengers are often vaccinated by baggage surcharges and other charges , but airlines like to use them .	-11.6080
They argue that the transportation of baggage should cost money and passengers should pay this service if they wish .	-4.0314
Many on Wall Street view the new baggage charges as a sign that airlines are taking enough money to cover the costs of air travel after years of loss .	-3.8831
Most , however , have so far left the fingers of charges for hand baggage .	-5.2093
Spirit Airlines Inc. demanded three years ago as the first charge for hand baggage and later followed Allegiant Air , also a low-cost airline .	-4.3465
The only other airline with such a charge is the Hungarian Wizz Air , declared the airline consultant Jay Sorensen , who closely monitors the extra charges .	-4.1944
He estimated in a report of December 2011 that the handbaggage fee earned Spirit $ 50 million annually .	-3.7560
Sorensen , who previously held a leading position at Midwest Airlines , has recently flown with Spirit and was curious about what would expect him at the boarding gate if passengers were confronted with the company ’ s unusual hand baggage charge .	-5.0631
“ The boarding process was one of the smoothest I have experienced in my career in aviation , ” he said .	-3.0699
I expected to see teeth knerries and hands-on discussions at the boarding gate .	-4.0886
“ The plane was full , ” he said , “ and the boarding was running like lubricated . ”	-2.6420
Frontier also follows Spirit with the $ 2 required for coffee , tea , lemonade or juice .	-2.9687
The company explained that passengers who bought lemonade or juice are likely to keep the whole cans and coffee for free .	-4.9242
Water is still free .	-1.2192
US Airways had tried shortly in 2008 to demand money for refreshing drinks , but reversed it seven months later , after passengers complained and no other large company had followed .	-5.9601
Frontier ’ s step to charge handbaggage baggage if passengers do not buy directly from the airline is the latest initiative to direct customers to their own website .	-5.0389
Airlines pay online travel agencies such as Orbitz 10 to 25 USD per ticket sold .	-10.6567
This provides an incentive for all companies to move passengers to purchase directly from them instead of through an online travel agency . .	-4.6964
However , Frontier has gone the most in this area .	-3.6323
In September , the company began to award only half as many frequent flyer miles when booking through an online travel agency .	-3.1695
On Wednesday , the miles were reduced to 25 % of the flight route .	-3.0915
A flight booked by a third party provider with a frontier over 1000 miles brings customers only 250 miles .	-4.8157
Passengers can also reserve seats only when purchasing directly on the Frontier website .	-3.7599
Frontier has a loyal customer base at its headquarters in Denver , but the business is shrinking and the company is losing money .	-3.0465
The revenue declined by 9 percent , and the flight capacity declined by almost 13 percent in the first quarter , as was read in the financial report published on Wednesday by the parent company , Republic Airways Holdings , Inc .	-15.0499
Republic has tried to control the finances of Frontier as part of the sale of the company .	-3.8049
Proverbs come from the Bible	-1.8154
Well 40 women visited the last women 's breakfast this year in the evangelical parish of Bisingen .	-3.5125
The theme of the day in the municipal house was " proverbs from the Bible " and " Middle Ages " .	-4.0805
After breakfast Zita Köhler , Chairman of the Church Municipal Council , entered a talk on the biblical proverbs .	-4.2161
" Proverbs contain lifestyles , regulations or warnings , " she explained .	-3.0040
It compared several proverbs with the corresponding bibliographs and explained the meaning .	-12.2038
She called sayings like : wooden eye is vigilant , as scales fall from the eyes , throw an eye on someone who gives His Lord in sleep , his hands wash in innocence .	-4.5907
On several occasions , the speaker also advised her listeners what the proverb was .	-4.7705
Christel Dehner took up the speeches from the Middle Ages : all good things are three , make blue , hay something .	-6.1824
She explained the importance and origin of the words she called ' bridges to the past ' .	-2.8804
Finally , a raffle was raffled .	-2.9139
The prizes were covered on a table and were humorously described before they were handed over to the winners .	-2.7719

Learning instead of unemployed : pilot project for unlearned in tourism	-2.6125
Today , a pilot project for the tourism industry starts at the Mecklenburg lake plate .	-3.7913
Under the leadership of the Federal Labour Agency , 49 women and men who are already working as unlearned in the industry should be qualified over three winters to professionals for hotels and restaurants .	-4.1484
" New is that the six-month courses end with degrees , " said Carmen Wiechert of the working agency Neubrandenburg .	-3.5668
The benefits are varied : the participants would not be unemployed , the firms would receive trained professionals , who were increasingly lacking in hotels and restaurants , and the agency would not have to finance unemployment .	-12.3409
The project also includes the Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Neubrandenburg and the Deutsche Hotel- und Gaststättenverband ( Dehoga ) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern .	-2.7381
NSA declares that an “ internal error ” and not hackers are guilty of crashing the website .	-8.5100
The shadowy National Security Agency declared late Friday that an error had paralysed its public website for a few hours , not hackers , as was claimed online .	-4.5518
“ NSA.gov was not reachable this night for several hours because an internal error occurred during a planned update , ” explained the Spy Agency in a message sent by e-mail .	-4.4452
The problem will be fixed this evening .	-1.8698
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed Denial of Service attack ( DDoS ) is not true .	-2.6082
In the early evening hours , online server trackers noticed that the NSA website was not accessible for at least six hours and that this is still not available to some users .	-4.7848
Previously , a NSA spokesman explained to ABC News that the Authority ’ s sensitive internal network was “ in no way ” compromised .	-3.4403
Secret information is not in danger , according to the speaker .	-2.0607
At least one group of hacktivists claimed to have paralysed the NSA website with a DDoS attack .	-2.9960
In such attacks , the target website is flooded with page calls until the servers are overloaded and the website collapses .	-3.8783
Cybertactics are relatively simple and attacks do not serve to penetrate the internal network of the target system .	-2.7998
The former super-secret NSA , whose nickname was once No Such Agency ( no such authority ) , is now in the bright light of the public , and is facing sharp criticism of its extensive monitoring program at home and abroad – a result of the secret NSA data stolen and published by the disillusioned former NSA employee Edward Snowden .	-5.9381
The growing controversy over the intelligence service fueled initial speculation that the incident today is the result of a targeted cyperoperation .	-3.5140
The number of people without jobs has fallen by 22 to 1,307 in October .	-3.4340
Although the 3.1 % quota is better than last year and also better than in September , " we would have hoped for more , " says Monika Felder-Bauer , Deputy Manager of the Agency for Work in Sonthofen .	-4.4949
Because many companies have reacted to date in the case of settings .	-5.3013
One reason for this is , according to Felder-Bauer : " We have little skilled workers in crafts , health care and care for the elderly " .	-4.8266
Since September , job opportunities for personnel in the hotel and restaurant industry have also been launched . .	-5.6678
The winter season begins in mid-December .	-2.3781

Bombardier ’ s decline in delivery numbers and orders	-3.6637
The Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15-percent decline in net profits on Thursday , having been under pressure due to declining orders and deliveries for aircraft in the third quarter , as well as treaty problems in the railway division .	-5.6745
Bombardier , headquartered in Montreal , did not publish flight test data for his brand-new CSeries aircraft and did not give any new information as to whether the aircraft could enter commercial use in accordance with the ambitious timetable next September .	-5.2965
One and a half months ago , the maiden flight of the test aircraft followed only three further launches , which makes it questionable whether the test phase was running as planned .	-5.7062
The results remained behind the forecasts and resulted in a price fall of more than 8 % on the Toronto stock exchange .	-9.7302
Cameron Doerksen , analyst at National Bank Financial , lowered on Thursday his assessment of “ outperform ” to “ sector perform ” with a view to the share having a limited price potential in the next one to two quarters .	-4.8377
“ Although weaker delivery numbers for aircraft were largely expected , we are clearly disappointed by the margin development in the transport sector , ” said Doerksen in a customer letter .	-4.6942
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries when the test program progresses for the aircraft .	-3.2460
However , if no new orders are made available in the coming months , we expect the market to become more sceptical about the programme .	-3.6491
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft can catapult the company into the lower market segment currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus .	-2.2605
The first test aircraft was presented to the public in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delays .	-2.6605
But binding orders for CSeries have been moderate to date , with 177 potential buyers waiting for the results of the flight tests and wanting to see whether the company ’ s claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost saving potential of the new jet transport aircraft are correct .	-5.5111
There are currently 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies .	-2.1819
CEO Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will reach his target of 300 binding orders at the beginning of commercial use of the jet .	-3.1700
The management also insured analysts and the media on Thursday that the programme is on schedule .	-4.5169
“ The test aircraft was no longer on the ground than expected , ” said Beaudoin at a telephone conference and added that during the aircraft ’ s life ground tests and software updates were scheduled .	-4.7520
Each manufacturer plans differently .	-1.6558
We have decided to make a first flight and then attach a revision period , which we have also done .	-3.9701
This happens throughout the flight programme .	-2.3480
The second of five test aircraft is expected to start in the next few weeks , the rest shortly afterwards , it was said by the company side .	-4.5515
Nevertheless , analysts remain sceptical whether 12 months after the maiden flight the first customer can commission an aircraft from the CSeries .	-11.3623
Bombardier explained that it will check the planning for commissioning ( EIS ) and will update it in the coming months .	-3.0407
“ The slow progress of the flight test – although obviously Bombardier ’ s internal planning – reinforces our view that commissioning is postponing to the first quarter of 2015 , ” said Doerksen .	-3.8737
In the third quarter at the end of 30 September , Bombardier ’ s net profit fell to $ 147 million , respectively 8 cents per share of $ 172 million , respectively 9 cents per share a year earlier .	-3.7958
The adjusted profit per share is 9 cents .	-3.1152
Sales declined slightly and fell from $ 4.2 billion to $ 4.1 billion .	-2.3264
Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and a turnover of $ 4.56 billion , according to Thomson Reuters I / B / E / S .	-2.6165
The world ’ s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer indicates that it delivered 45 aircraft this quarter , a decline of 57 last year .	-3.1743
The net positions fell from 83 aircraft to 26 .	-1.5734
The order book in the aerospace division was $ 32.9 billion on 30 September , and was thus unchanged on 31 December .	-3.6433
“ In the field of aerospace , the results were within the scope of our guidelines , but the low order intake and market conditions as a whole were disappointing , ” said Beaudoin .	-4.7164
Sales in the aerospace sector fell by 13 % to $ 2 billion .	-2.4568
Bombardier , the world ’ s largest rail manufacturer , announced that sales in this division have risen by just under 11 % to $ 2.1 billion .	-3.2300
The order book in the transport division was $ 32.6 billion on 30 September , and was thus slightly increased compared to 31 December .	-3.9899
The profit margin in the transport sector has been affected by settlement problems in some major contracts .	-3.6195
According to corporate governance , there will be new requirements for the fourth quarter . the . the the . the the . the the . the the	-8.8562
In the afternoon trading on Thursday , the bombing share declined by 8.5 percent and stood at 4.83 Canadian dollars , after it was also announced that the Google Finance Board will change Patrick Pichette to the Board .	-5.3354

Cocain-dependent lawyer , who warned drug boss against police investigation , must be in prison .	-12.2905
Basharat Ditta , 42 , gave information to underworld size Neil Scarborough further .	-2.4173
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction could come to light .	-1.9529
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Crown Court	-2.0404
A well-known criminal defender who warned a drug baron of a major police investigation because he feared that his secret drug addiction could be exposed was sentenced to three years in prison .	-3.7987
Basharat Ditta , 42 , supplied Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about his drug trafficking activities after being compromised by his own cocaine addiction .	-4.0644
The “ first-class ” lawyer praised by criminalists , nicknamed “ Bash , ” was arrested in his house in 2011 , after the police surveillance Scarborough , whom he had represented in a previous drug procedure .	-5.5334
Officials observed how Scarborough ( 32 ) delivered three bags of cocaine at the house of the lawyer in Blackburn , Lancashire , while he was with colleagues at a meal of the lawyer 's chamber .	-3.9642
The investigations showed that Ditta regularly consumed drugs in class A after testing traces of cocaine had been found in his hair , wallet and credit cards .	-4.5050
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011 , he tried to obtain unauthorized information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners .	-2.6419
All four suspects were then monitored by the police in the context of a major investigation into the heroin and cocaine trade in Lancashire , Cumbria , Merseyside , Berkshire and West Yorkshire .	-3.2397
Together with 32 other people , they were later arrested after the police secured heroin and cocaine worth 1.5 million pounds and 200,000 pounds of cash in a series of domestic searches .	-4.6287
Ditta , 42 , gave information to the criminals because he feared that his drug addiction could become public .	-2.7905
Today , Ditta , working for Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn , was found guilty and convicted at the Liverpooler Crown Court after a three-week trial in two charges for obstructing the judiciary .	-4.4148
He gave cocaine ownership during an earlier survey .	-2.6503
The lawyer was transferred after the police found out in their investigations against Scarborough that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011 .	-3.2727
Two investigators followed the suspect and saw how he went to Dittas House , where drugs with a purity of 60 % in a black golf glove put under the lawyer 's tonne .	-4.8613
Shortly after supplying the drugs , Scarborough regularly phoned Ditta at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park .	-2.8867
The lawyer returned home , picked up the drugs and then nine messages were exchanged between the two .	-2.8708
In court it became known that Ditta was a “ regular consumer ” of cocaine after testing drugs in class A had been discovered in his hair , wallet and credit cards .	-4.0827
Ditta was arrested later , but disputed to take cocaine and said that he spoke to the alleged dealer because he was his client , and claimed that her discussion was subject to “ lawyer secrecy . ”	-4.2750
During his arrest Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards , but they were secured and a hair sample was taken from him .	-3.3866
At the police interrogation , he stated that he would run an office and client at home for legal matters both under his private address and at work .	-5.1552
It was announced before the court that he had called for important actors in the drug trade , some of whom he had previously represented , after significant arrests and informed of what the investigators knew about them .	-5.7440
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said , “ A criminal lawyer should know better than anyone else that the law is not broken . ”	-2.6962
Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal defender , because he has engaged too much with certain clients .	-3.6931
The relationship in question is not simply that of a drug trafficker , but a drug trafficker providing his lawyer with drugs .	-2.8675
Some of his communications were undoubtedly legitimate , because he was the lawyer of these people .	-3.0211
But that went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between lawyer and client .	-2.4157
He counteracted police investigations as far as possible , so that they could continue to investigate their criminal activities .	-4.0864
Mr Ditta thus disreputed his profession .	-9.2415
He was too close to certain clients , especially Scarborough , and he allowed his independence to be compromised .	-2.0009
Ditta dismissed every misconduct and claimed , “ If I were a corrupt lawyer , which I am not , and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough , I would not wait 15 hours , but do so immediately . ”	-5.2680
But , after the hearing , Superintendent Lee Halstead of the police in Lancashire said : “ Mr Ditta has taken the step from a criminal defender to a criminal at the moment when he began to acquire drugs from organised criminals . ”	-3.6580
His cocaine dependence led to a hopeless compromise and made him sensitive to the motives of leading members of organized crime , who asked him to obtain valuable information about police investigations .	-4.1097
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure public confidence and confidence .	-1.8839
Ditta lost this trust and tried to hide behind the facade of his profession .	-3.8312
The Serious and Organised Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigations against Ditta , which also led to a conviction in three cases for the possession of cocaine and judicial obstacles , which underlines our determination to bring criminals to justice .	-4.7242
This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that nobody can escape the arm of the law .	-2.8410
We will find you and bring you to court .	-1.9760
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after having declared himself guilty of the conspiracy of heroin , cocaine and cannabis trade .	-3.1573
Thirty-five other drug trafficking people were sentenced to total sentences of 153 years for drug offences .	-3.7168
On his website Ditta published an area of questions and answers about himself , in which he stated that his dream job was to represent clients in the death cell in America , his ultimate guest at dinner was Mohammed Ali and inequality of opportunity was the motivation for his work .	-5.0054
Revolutionary work of church music	-1.1841
At the end of the celebrations of its 160th anniversary , the song crane Dunningen will frame two services with the " Deutsche Messe " by Franz Schubert .	-5.2067
After the great success of the musical " Rock my Life " , which was enthusiastic for the audience this spring , the song crane will enrich two worship services with the performance of the Deutsche Messe of Franz Schubert at the end the . the the the the the the the the the . the the the the the	-11.5463
On Saturday , 26 October , this extraordinary trade fair will be held from 19 a.m. during the evening fair in St. Martinus Church Dunningen and on Sunday , 27 October , from 10.15 a.m. at the service of God in the St. John Baptist Church in Lackendorf .	-10.9965
The so-called Deutsche Messe with the original title " Songs for the celebration of the sacred victim of the fair " , D 872 , is a spiritual music work of composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was regarded as almost revolutionary at the time of the formation .	-5.3354
The exhibition is listed in the context of the services of worship , as the client Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind .	-4.7981
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider , the choir is accompanied by the Musikverein Frohsinn Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi at the organ .	-2.9558
Haslach : Skepsis Skepticizes Confidence	-3.8561
The 2015 elections to the parish council will , for example , change fundamentally in the Haslach ( SE ) maritime unit .	-4.3043
There is only one common parish council for all six parishes .	-2.7710
In a joint meeting on Saturday the bodies from Haslach , Hofstetten , Mühlenbach , Fischerbach , Steinach and Welschenstein prepared for the changes .	-3.1717
Because the fundamental decisions of the diocese cannot be changed and it is up to the parish councils to implement them as satisfactorily as possible .	-4.4660
Over the course of the day , it became particularly clear that skepticism toward the New is reluctant , but increasingly confident .	-5.7648
From the ideas and expectations of the innovations in 2015 to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the parish council , the extremely constructive discussions of the six bodies with the main officials of the maritime team ranged .	-4.2455
Regional dean Georg Schmitt explained on the basis of a presentation the new guidelines for maritime units in the Archdiocese of Freiburg .	-4.2238
In the future , SE Haslach , as a church community , will form a public body which will enter into the rights and obligations of the six individual church communities so far .	-6.0111
There will only be a common parish council and a foundation council in which the parish is represented .	-4.2352
At least two elected members are to be represented from each parish ; in the six parishes , so-called community teams are formed on the ground .	-4.9803
Their task will be to promote church life in the place in the future .	-3.4370
The question of the finances of the individual parish municipality then demanded considerable talks .	-5.7255
The innovations envisage that accumulated credits in the parish remain tied to purpose .	-5.2948
By contrast , liabilities are transferred to the entire community .	-3.0931
There have been great concerns , particularly with regard to the large planned investments , whose commitment will meet all parishes .	-5.6993
" In the past , too , investment was only made in projects that could be managed by the individual parishes alone , " Haslach 's parish president Bruno Prinzbach .	-5.5510
Practical experience with a joint body for five parishes described Barbar Knights , the Chairman of the Board of the Schutterwald-Neuried Seelsorgeheit .	-4.8053
In 2006 , they set themselves the task of ' becoming one , remaining five ' and found that this is not so easy at all .	-5.9165
The bodies of the Haslacher Seelsorgeeichnitt then sought to answer the questions about the future composition and size of the common parish council and the practical work of the community teams .	-5.0953
The preparations will be specified at further meetings and decided at another joint meeting of all six bodies next spring .	-3.9421
In the end , the parish council Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the maritime unit , which was approved by a clear majority .	-3.8096
In Poullendorf , the electricity is becoming more expensithe . the . the the the . the the . the	-8.8743
Poullendorf citizens must adapt to higher electricity costs .	-3.0717
As the Managing Director of the Stadtwerke , Jörg-Arne Bias , confirmed against the S<unk>DKURIER , a four-headed Pfullendorf family pays 70 to 90 euros per year .	-4.3683
The main reason for the upcoming price increase is the increase in the so-called EEC levy from 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt-hour .	-3.1429
Every year in October , this fee is redefined by the four operators of the major streets .	-5.5379
These quantify the extra costs incurred from the energy transition , which they can impose through a charge via the electricity price .	-6.7883
Stadtwerke Ppullendorf form the last link in this chain .	-3.2696
The Supervisory Board of the Energy Company even assumed a higher levy in its forecasts , as Jörg-Arne Bias reports .	-3.2879
Now the concrete payments would have to be calculated before the city works could inform their customers about the exact price increase next week .	-3.8956
" We start from an increase of 1 cent plus x " , says Bias , with the number more close to 2 cents .	-4.5068
Traffic lights on permanent red : Wait for waiting time	-3.8967
Sometimes a traffic light simply does not become green .	-2.7174
The contact loop in the street does not react , or the light sign is defective .	-3.0565
What should we do - drive red ?	-4.3603
If an affected person has been waiting long enough for a red light and the crossroads are free , he can continue , explains the Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine " Motorrad " .	-4.4418
However , waiting time must be ' appropriate ' , which can be interpreted differently from case to case .	-3.4977
Becker advises you to remain at least five minutes before the traffic light is disrupted .	-4.8646
However , anyone who continues the journey despite red light must be aware that he is fully responsible for an accident caused by it .	-5.1191
Anyone who tolerates less than five minutes may not wait long enough , warns Becker and refers to a decision of the Hamm Supreme Court .	-3.8768
In the negotiated case , a driver had ignored the traffic lights after about three minutes and had to respond to a negligent redlight violation .	-4.8176
The traffic light was not defective , but jumped to green little later .	-3.6952
A driving ban was saved because of the particular situation - but the fine did not .	-4.5303
Municipal Council is delighted with a sound budget	-3.8312
Whenever the budget is at stake in municipal meetings , mayor Ralph Gerster has laughed well .	-4.1643
The municipal sacrifice in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and debt is no longer known by the administration since 2005 .	-3.9630
The 2012 financial year can also be recorded in this sense as a full success .	-3.8257
This was evident in the presentation of the annual accounts for 2012 .	-3.0722
As Andrea Rothmund explained , the administrative budget , at around EUR 7.6 million , was more than EUR 1 million than planned .	-3.7580
The surplus of the administrative budget , too , is about EUR 1 million above the approach , with some EUR 1.8 million .	-10.3308
The surplus is mainly due to higher commercial tax revenue and the municipal share of income tax .	-4.3504
The asset budget was also well above the planned values .	-3.5893
Instead of the EUR 1.5 million planned , it was EUR 2.5 million last year .	-2.1730
" This is mainly due to the increased contribution from the administrative budget , " says Rothmund .	-4.0051
Since fewer investments have been made in the 2012 financial year than planned , the increase in savings has also been higher .	-4.6986
Overall , the overall reserve has been increased by around EUR 2.1 million to EUR 4.9 million now .	-3.5211
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for their good work .	-1.5338
" Such a work is not simply shaken out of the sleeve , " Gerster praised with regard to the annual accounts .	-10.8627
He and the councils clearly enjoyed the good figures .	-2.9054
It may sound paradoxical , but it is precisely these good figures that citizens could soon be expensive .	-3.3445
In the past , the municipality was able to avoid high levers due to the good financial situation .	-5.9483
But , according to Gerster , this has often reduced subsidies from the country .	-4.5923
There are prerequisites for these subsidies from a variety of compensatory sticks . . . . the .	-11.0371
Among other things , cities and municipalities that apply for grants must have certain levers .	-3.9396
" We have to look at the issue of lifting satellites , because in the coming years investments are needed , for which we would like to have subsidies , " Gerster announced in this context .	-6.7384
Nagold : Hugo Wermter in the choir for 60 years .	-2.5535
At the age of 60 , Hubert Wermter ’ s history at the Cäcilia Men ’ s Song Association is almost twice as long as the Autumn Festival , in which he was solemnly honored .	-4.9884
Hubert Wermter stood on stage as usual in the colours of his male singing club .	-3.2914
Even after 60 years , he still enjoys singing with the choir that has now been won .	-6.5397
Wermter was also active in the association , including 28 years as a member of the committee .	-3.3149
He received several awards for his engagement and association : Jörg Kohr , pastoral speaker on behalf of the Cäcilienverband Rottenburg-Stuttgart , presented him - since the choir is also a church choir - a certificate of the association and a letter of honour signed by Bischof Gebhard Prince .	-4.8832
His singer colleagues gave him the certificate of the German choir association and a engraved tin plate .	-3.9288
In addition to the honour , the 31st Autumn Festival took place in accustomed tracks : with the MGV Betra , the song crane Salzstetten , the Baisingen singer department and the local music association , the Vollmaringer had loaded a colourful mix of choirs and singing styles that had the 400 visitors .	-7.4034
The MGV Vollmaringen opened with atmospheric songs such as " In Wine Paradise " and " Funny , her brother " .	-3.5715
Her honorary singer Hubert Wermter prepared a small stand for honor - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart 's " Bundeslied " .	-3.7497
The male singing club Betra also sang classic choral songs such as " Jägerwerben " by Julius Wengert , " Weit , weg weg " by Hubert Goisern and the folk song " When you pass through the valley " .	-4.3574
The song crane Salzstetten , with his mixed choir and his women 's group - the " Impulschor " - ensured the female quota of the festival .	-4.9064
The mixed choir abducted with the Neapolitan folk " Santa Lucia " and " Eviva Espana " by Antos Gus in foreign countries , while the " pulschor " also resorted to foreign languages : " Liberatio " and " Hey Jude " belonged to their program .	-5.1166
The singer department of the Baisinger Sportverein came back to home with " What isch der Schwob ? " by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Papperts " Bierlied " , where the Vollmaringer Musikverein offered the crowning musical degree .	-5.0006
For the children there was a small annual program - " Grandma Hanne " alias Hannelore Stollsteimer performed a castle theatre and read a few stories that kept the children busy at lunch .	-5.9369

Bauhaus provides the material with the support of the Sparkasse Zollernalb .	-2.9265
It will be delivered to the kindergarten on the agreed day and will then be processed directly by the helpers .	-3.0923
Helpers can be parents , grandparents , friends , clubs and , of course , the teachers and children themselves .	-9.3419
Kenya ’ s press is outraged by controversial media law	-2.2811
‘ We are in a frightening situation and we can ask ourselves what prevents Parliament from simply abolishing judicial independence tomorrow ’ was read in the newspaper , which considers the draft law to be unconstitutional .	-5.0936
“ The law is draconian and very punitive and we reject it , ” said Cyrus Kamau , CEO of the Capital Group , including CapitalFM , one of Kenya ’ s most prestigious independent radio stations and news sites .	-3.1221
He said that the new media tribunal “ will always be biased , because it is an extended arm of government , ” and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya ’ s position in the global economy .	-2.4368
“ I hope the President listens to us and we appeal to him to reject this bill and send it back to Parliament , ” he said .	-3.1846
According to The Star newspaper , the government , through the new law , “ effectively imprisoned the media , ” whereas The Standard , Democracy , and Freedom of speech in Kenya would have suffered “ a severe blow , ” and titled the draft as “ draconian . ”	-5.8794
The adoption of the law is part of a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security following the attacks by armed Islamists on the Westgate shopping centre in September .	-3.6894
The Kenyan media attracted the authorities ’ anger because they published recordings of security cameras that showed how the units sent to the office supposedly robbed the luxurious shopping centre .	-6.0990
Police chief David Kimaiyo responded by appointing two journalists and a leading media representative to interrogate , even if the subpoena was withdrawn after a cry of the media .	-4.3391
According to the new law , media houses can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan schillings and individual journalists with up to one million and the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation .	-3.9614
The Tribunal also has the right to seize the ownership of those affected if a penalty is not paid .	-2.9236
According to Daily Nation , “ one punishment can push most radio stations into bankruptcy . ”	-3.0415
Moreover , the newspaper believes that these measures could have a destructive impact on Kenya ’ s description of “ lively blogosphere . ”	-2.7693
If they silence the media , politicians could do whatever they want .	-2.4909
“ Nobody will ever hear it , ” wrote Mutuma Mathiu , a journalist at the nation that calls the Kenyan media a a decisive control factor in public life .	-4.0375
“ Leaving politicians to themselves , leading the country into bankruptcy , and returning to the hunters and collectors , ” he commented .	-4.3520
Kenya ’ s legislators have already raised public anger in the past .	-3.3746
In May , they voted to reverse the cuts ordered by the national remuneration commission , and put their rugged salaries of around 532,000 schilling back into force tax-free per month – among the world ’ s highest .	-5.7411
Bad-Dürrheim : A dream becomes true for the FC .	-2.1665
The official inauguration ceremony for the artificial road sports ground lost nothing about the importance of the city and the football club despite the cold weather and the rain .	-5.8838
A more pleasant celebration on Saturday was probably all hoped for , but Peter did not want to play with him .	-5.7814
Thus , all those who came without a umbrella or could not hold one for any reason .	-12.4478
This was what the musicians who surrounded the festival , as did many speakers .	-5.4948
Therefore , Wasser was also the FC chairman Albrecht Schlenker , who spoke about fulfilling a dream .	-4.8157
Mayor Walter Klumpp , who has been strongly committed to implementing the project , thanks to the municipal council , the companies involved and members of the association who contributed .	-6.9235
Here especially Lothar Held , Paul Weizenegger , Heiner Gail and Peter Graf .	-2.2571
The equipped pensioners moved 400 square metres of pavement stones for the new paths .	-4.0119
This remarkable volunteer commitment was also appreciated by Karl Rombach .	-3.7920
Further greetings were addressed to the urban sports committee Hubert Baier , the district chairman of the South Badian Football Association , Kuno Kayan , and Friedrich Knorr of the Planning Office , who announced a donation for the youth department of the club .	-4.7977
Mayor Klumpp reminded us that recurring weather-related influences in the spring and autumn were adding to the original lawn so that he could not be played .	-4.9314
Fifteen years ago , the first thought was given to solving the problem when the construction of a third place was planned at the football club or at the real school on Salinensee .	-5.8443
Both were rejected .	-1.5121
Six years ago , thoughts came up with the creation of an artificial transport site , which was generally regarded as the ultimate solution .	-4.8603
Two years ago , concrete plans were started when the FC took over the Schabelstube in Hereditary , promised a cost share of EUR 100 000 for the construction of the square and approved the country funding of EUR 104 000 .	-5.0256
The municipal council decided in October 2012 to take over the remaining EUR 356 000 at the total cost of EUR 560 000 , summarized Klumpp .	-3.5275
The construction began on June 4th , 108 metres of artificial grass square . . . the the the the . the the the . the the	-11.7737
During the construction phase lasting over three months , 3000 cubic metres of earth were worn , half of which was used for the creation of a dirt-bike route .	-5.8190

The competent working group met in Berlin this morning .	-3.1753
Among other things , it is about direct democracy , bribery of Members and the Federal Police .	-3.3726
In the morning , the working group on migration and integration also wanted to continue its discussions .	-3.3288
Among other things , this should be about dual citizenship , where both sides have contradictory ideas .	-5.0638
The SPD wants to end the obligation for immigrant children born in Germany to choose one - the Union rejects a double passport .	-3.4377
On the subject of transport , which is not on the agenda this Friday , the SPD reinforced its ' no ' to a car toll called for by the CSU .	-3.9937
A vignette is a ' flatrate for cycling and therefore ecologically counterproductive ' , the SPD negotiator for transport , Florian Pronold , declared in a letter to his group .	-4.3242
There was a threat of avoidance on roads which are already priorities for accidents .	-5.2093
The introduction of tolls for all cars would , moreover , be just a first step from Pronolds ’ point of view .	-3.8647
" There is a danger that compensation for Germans will be deleted at a later date , " he said .	-3.4843

Vienna Airport abolishes passenger calls	-1.6783
Mr Max Maier , please come to Gate 24 .	-0.9917
Surveys like this will no longer exist at Vienna-Swechat Airport .	-4.2951
Much of the speaker confirmation falls away - the noise level is to be significantly reduced .	-6.1980
Creating a more relaxed atmosphere is the aim of this innovation .	-2.2799
As Airport spokesman Peter Kleemann announced to Radio Vienna , Vienna Airport follows an international trend with the suspension of announcements concerning individuals .	-4.2796
For example , the airports in Copenhagen , Frankfurt or Dubai , among others , are already abandoning noisy calls .	-4.6303
By eliminating these announcements - on average , around 200 personal calls by the speakers on one day - it will be more quiet at the airport in the future .	-6.5174
" It has also been shown in experience that these individual announcements have been perceived relatively little , but at the same time all other information on changed aircraft or departure times is slightly losing here , " says Kleemann in conversation with the radio station .	-6.9831

According to the lexicon , Déjà Vu is a psychological phenomenon that expresses itself in the feeling of having experienced or seen a new situation before . the the . the the the the the the . the the the the the the .	-10.0908
In the event of a visit to the café of the same name at the Opplay in the district town of Kleve , within easy reach of the Rhine-Waal University , it does not have to remain with the pure Déjà Vu feeling .	-6.8142
After all , the café with its beautiful name has exactly that goal : to make a real stay not only thoughtful , but also hand-in-hand recurring .	-7.1289
Because it 's just fun and simply is beautiful .	-3.3014
A glance into the inner life of the optical 8 gives the viewer a good feeling at first .	-5.2561
The state-of-the-art but not cool café ambience looks like a place to feel good .	-3.3675
Here the team with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner spoils the guest with a variety of coffee and cocktail variants .	-12.3417
There are also delicious cakes or individually occupied fresh baguettes .	-3.5959
The owners , both 33 years old , made a name for themselves before the opening of the jewellery café at the opposite : in Kranenburg they led the " Art Lounge " .	-6.2998
From the move to Kleve , the coffee lovers are hoping for more audience .	-4.9961
Last but not least through the university .	-3.0260
" Where we do not have a specific target group , " said Daniel Büttner .	-3.4241
Rather , the two young students here would like to raise the same issue as seniors and all ages between them .	-4.7297
Speaking of café lovers .	-1.9515

Two events already took place in the bright café .	-2.8724
Better to say one .	-1.7675
Because the harbour festival took place outside - the Café Déjà Vu did not benefit from it .	-4.1238
But there was also the ringelnatz evening .	-2.8652
" Beautiful , successful and funny " , the two 33-year-olds found .	-3.1979
But not everyone 's cause .	-2.6369
Perhaps that is why Daniel Büttner is not a fan of events : " You can 't make it all right " .	-5.3564
And with an event I always talk only those who are interested in the special event .	-3.9855
Therefore events will be the exception to us .	-3.6460
" We want to disrupt the normal operation as little as possible " .	-2.7964

UN announces new targets for poverty reduction	-10.9478
The United Nations is now beginning to draw up a series of new targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals announced 12 years ago to combat poverty .	-3.9371
In the run-up to the UN Summit on Sustainable Development , which began in Rio de Janeiro in the evening , Australian diplomats played a key role in pushing for “ sustainable development goals ” to replace the Millennium Goals expiring in 2015 .	-3.1619
They were included in the final draft of the document , which will be adopted by world leaders , including Mrs Gillard , at the summit .	-2.6532
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at the evening that the time had come to “ think beyond national interests . ”	-3.0009
“ I am pleased that the member states have agreed to embark on a process to agree on universal , sustainable development goals , ” he said .	-3.7609
“ These goals will build on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the post-2015 development framework .	-2.7321
I will spare no effort to implement this mandate given to me by the member states to realise our vision of the Sustainable Development Goals built on the success of the Millennium Goals . ”	-3.5143
Even though the SG Achim / Baden has been without victory for four days , the Handball Oberligist continues to have a good mood .	-5.2067
Trainer Tomasz Malmon leaves no doubt about this .	-2.8040
All are still fully motivated in the matter .	-2.8295
Nevertheless , I hope that we will finally win again .	-3.0649
" I don 't know how to taste such a victory anymore , " Malmon expects a success experience from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II .	-4.2132
Even if the third league reserve from Fredenbeck has not yet extracted trees , Malmon warns the finger in advance .	-4.3163
Many players I have trained myself in the A-Youth .	-3.9346
Therefore , they will certainly be particularly motivated against their ex-coach .	-3.0762
" Furthermore , we have to wait to see if there will be further reinforcement from the first , " the SG-Coach illustrates .	-6.7462
To finally return to the track of success , the Malmon team must definitely increase compared to the previous performances .	-4.2484
Especially in coverage and switching games , it lasted enormously . . . the . the , the . the . the the .	-11.6806
Opportunities must definitely be improved .	-10.2639
Therefore , I hope that during the short break my players finally got their head free .	-3.9340
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing in the face of clashes between influential personalities .	-6.5144
Thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo under the watchful eyes of the statue of Samora Machel , the founder of the state and first president of Mozambique , to bring peace calls to a rare public demonstration .	-4.3883
“ We want peace again , we want stability , ” said Vanessa de Sousa , CEO of an investment company .	-9.6091
For fear of the country ’ s future , she has exchanged her business clothing against a T-shirt called “ We demand security ” in Portuguese and joined the crowd on Thursday in the capital ’ s independence square .	-5.4278
For two weeks , there have been almost every day reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo , which have been among the worst battles since the peace agreement over 20 years ago .	-4.0887
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement , initially supported by the White Rhodesia and later by the apartheid government of South Africa in an effort to destabilize the country ’ s independent government .	-3.4165
After the 1992 peace treaty , it became an opposition party .	-1.9803
Analysts find it unlikely that the country will return to a full-blown conflict , but recent events have worried foreign investors and locals .	-3.3852
There is a lot at stake for the fast-growing economy , because discovering huge gas deposits off the coast and coal stores in the north-west could bring investment of more than $ 50 billion from companies like Rio Tinto , Vale from Brazil , Eni from Italy , and Anadarko from the US in the coming years .	-4.9110
The ruling Frelimo Party , the dominant force since 1975 , and Renamo blame each other for tensions .	-2.5806
Renamo claims that the government has provoked the recent clashes by attacking its members in the province of Sofala , a traditional Renamo stronghold on 17 October .	-11.5181
The attacks on the previous rebels escalated when government forces attacked Renamo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama , the group ’ s leader , Renamo ’ s spokesman against the Financial Times .	-3.5112
The government blames Renamo for the clashes and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers .	-1.9207
President Armando Guebuza has tried to downplay concerns about instability .	-1.9044
Against AFP , the French news agency , he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama considers himself a “ loser , ” who “ wants to use all his remaining forces to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government . ”	-3.5249
Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they want to avoid war .	-1.7769
But concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted as saying that Renamo is abandoning the 1992 peace agreement .	-3.4540
He said to the FT that he meant that Frelimo no longer respected the agreement .	-3.6335
“ Our vision is to resume negotiations seriously , ” said Mazanga .	-2.6106
Previous talks between the parties have contributed little to settling the tensions fueled by a number of clashes this year .	-10.9298
“ We have two adult men ( Guebuza and Dhlakama ) who meet the heads here , ” says Joseph Hanlon , lecturer at the Open University and Mozambique expert .	-3.4366
None of them is well negotiated and none is prepared to make the necessary concessions .	-2.2862
Renamo , who is pushing for electoral reforms , has already said that she will boycott the local elections in November .	-3.0599
Presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for next year .	-8.5744
Some commentators have interpreted the use of force as an attempt by a disgraceful movement to obtain concessions and financial benefits from the government .	-2.8291
Renamo ’ s electoral success has been shrinking since 1992 , while a newer party , founded by a former Renamo member , Democrático de Mo<unk>ambique ( MDM ) , is likely to improve in the elections .	-3.3388
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – whose resignation is due when his second term ends next year – wants to destroy the country ’ s democracy .	-2.8997
“ He doesn ’ t want multi-party democracy , he doesn ’ t want transparent elections , he doesn ’ t want peace , because he doesn ’ t want to give up the presidency , ” Maz.	-3.0906
It is unclear what capacity Renamo has , but it has made unrestful attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important North-South connection .	-4.1505
Most of the struggles took place in the province of Sofala , which lies a few hundred kilometres north of Maputo , in which Beira is located , the port , the mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale , use coal exports .	-5.2852
In June , Rio interrupted the use of the railway for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the route .	-3.2268
Mazanga replied cautiously to the question of whether Renamo would repeat this threat .	-2.7451
Renamo wanted “ to warn the international community that things are not good in Mozambique , ” said Mazanga .	-2.1584
Instability has increased frustration over the government , says Fernando Lima , head of Mediacoop , an independent media company , because many people have already worried about corruption , slow progress in development and a recent wave of abduction .	-3.7081
“ People think that the government and the president are responsible for the country ’ s future and should be the one who finds solutions to the problems , ” he explains .	-3.1879
Omar Sultane , a demonstrator , said that people just wanted stability .	-1.4724
“ No Renamo and Frelimo are interested , they just want peace and usable roads , ” he explained .	-3.3589
Children should be taught myths and legends as “ models of life ” means an author .	-3.2065
The stories of Thor showed that “ brutal force has no chance against clever tricks , ” and the Artus legend demonstrated how important it is to have a dream .	-2.5241
Many of the myths , however , are “ far too wild , too offensive , and , in some cases , too dirty to be taught at schools , ” which is why Crossley-Holland advocated a “ careful selection ” of ancient works .	-4.0919
“ I find it wonderful that myths and folklores are already part of education in America , ” he said .	-2.5650
I have been proposing this as a plan for twenty years .	-2.7598
He added that , among authors and teachers who are “ excessively didactic , ” children would “ disable completely , ” because in entertaining stories , the messages would be “ subliminal . ”	-4.9948
Crossley-Holland , who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon , and author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myth and the British Folk Tales , said : “ You can pursue certain intentions , but you should keep them as background as possible . ”	-3.8830
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an author writing for children is the need to convey hope .	-2.5354
Not everything must be simplified or lead to the happy end , but there is an immanent sense of good and evil .	-2.2807
This must be underlying , revealed by history and not explained .	-3.2996
This is the old story of showing instead of telling .	-2.4334
Hansjakob moves again to Freihof	-2.5328

Their expectation subsequently made the three-queen singers who led Hansjakob to the declaration : " Oh , beautiful , youth reminders of my own three-queen age will be alive again " .	-7.4316
With her song " O Jesulein " they enjoyed the audience in the outdoor courtyard as well as the stork children with their noisy " out , out " .	-5.3761
His criticism of the Official Church was expressed in the same way as his concerns about agricultural excesses , the consequences of industrialization , or the effects of war .	-4.7719
In his homeland , behind his tomb band on the fire near Hofstetten , he found his resting place .	-3.9574
" A troubled spirit had finally found its calm and had gone home forever , " it was said at the end of the scene game .	-4.1604
Much applause and many praising words were given by the audience for the performance .	-3.5525

In close consultation with the authorities , it is now time to keep the warning signals quieter with technical measures .	-3.3979
He will continue to rely on open dialogue with neighbours .	-2.8931
Because Matthias Schrell still has a lot to do at the site .	-10.2981
With the expansion of the Lower Saxony Bridge , Rhenus Midgard continues to rely on coal imports for power plants and is one of the big in Europe in this sector .	-3.5672
Capesize bulk carriers can be manufactured here for a long time thanks to the 18.5 metre deepened sun bags in front of the terminal .	-6.4045
" This year we want to crack the 3-million tonne brand in the envelope " , says Schrell .	-4.3107
In addition to the Eon power plant on the ground , import coal goes to power plants in the internal country .	-3.8223
If the GDF Suez power plant goes onto the grid , more than 5 million tonnes of coal imports per year will be realistic .	-3.7949
The three shipping loaders on the bridge and the second conveyor belt could create up to 10 million .	-2.9255
Bavaria ’ s basketballer , despite its first defeat , is optimistic in the face of defeat .	-4.5919
Even the first defeat in the Euroleague could not diminish the huge optimism of the basketballers of the FC Bavaria Munich .	-3.3261
" Nobody can prohibit us from believing that we will also win against the best team in Europe over the past two years " , accounted for Bavarian Coach Svetislav Pesic after the unfortunate 83 : 88 ( 39 : 47 ) on Thursday evening with Title Defender Olympiakos Piraeus .	-4.9765
We sent the message : Basketball also exists in Munich !	-2.3304
During their first third appearance in the European Royal Class , the Munich people sold themselves very well for a long time , but were simply not clarified enough in the decisive phases .	-5.4296
Guests initially created the piece of art to convert a 15-point backlog 13 minutes before the end into a guided tour before Piraeus returned to the game .	-4.7974
" We have fought incredibly back against the two-time Euroleague champion , but then made light mistakes again , " said Bavarian professional Yassin Idbihi .	-4.4565
We are proud of our performance , but we want to win every game .	-1.8303

Ben Greenman : Ten years of New York Comedy Festival : The New Yorker	-1.3689
One might say that New York City is the birthplace of Stand-up Comedy in America : almost a hundred years ago , the variety artist Frank Fay , who worked as a Conférencier at the Palace Theatre on Broadway , started telling the crowd directly jokes in the form of a talk .	-4.5537
Over the years , Fay ’ s innovation has been expanded , as was the most recent at the New York Comedy Festival .	-4.0207
The festival is celebrating its tenth anniversary this year with over sixty shows in small clubs and large theatres .	-16.2071
“ Most of these headliners began with Carolines and became more and more successful until they eventually became known to appear in a club , ” said Hirsch .	-4.2956
We have designed this festival so that we can continue working with them .	-2.6477
At this year ’ s event there are performances by Wanda Sykes , Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher as well as by “ Stand Up for Heroes ” , an annual music and comedy benefit event for army veterans in Madison Square Garden , where Bruce Springsteen , Jon Stewart , Roger Waters and Bill Cosby are among others .	-4.5202
With the festival also the world of comedy has grown .	-2.7954
A number of comedians participating in the festival this year have become known through rather unconventional ways , such as broadcasts on smaller television channels such as Comedy Central , FX and Spike .	-4.4700
Nick Kroll became famous with a sitcom on cable television ( the ironically slippery fantasy football series “ The League ” on FXX ) and now has his own Sketch show on Comedy Central .	-10.4029
Jenny Slate was part of the film at both Saturday Night Live and Parks and Recreation , although she is most famous for her viral video series " Marcel the Shell with Shoes On " .	-4.3614
Both Kroll and Slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices ( the surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik , the ironic W. Kaumau Bell focused on racial issues ) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy .	-3.6756
One of the biggest visitor magnets of the festival is an interview : David Steinberg talks to Larry David .	-2.9159
Steinberg started as a stand-up comedian , but became a respected television and film director and an unofficial comedy historian .	-3.3909
From 2005 to 2007 he moderated a television show entitled “ Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg ” at TV Land .	-2.9327
The meeting will take place in the Town Hall in the middle of Manhattan .	-2.2382
“ The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry ’ s entire work , ” said Steinberg .	-2.3945
He told me when he is here , then sometimes he goes through the street between two buildings and thinks : Hey , if I lose all my money , then perhaps I live here .	-3.6578

It would be a long way to go , but the nuclear chief negotiator is satisfied with the negotiation process and also optimistic that the two sides will end up with a solution .	-5.0934
Drama in Uruguay : Boys kill chambers with Machete	-3.1630
Two children admitted the murder of a 11-year-old in Uruguay .	-2.0346
The two 14 and 12 years old boys had invited their victims to go bird hunting with them .	-2.8825
Armed with machetes and knives , they reached the 11-year-old on Tuesday and threw the corpse into a well , reported the newspaper " El País " on Thursday .	-3.5672
They would then have played football before their homes in a working-class district .	-3.3252
The corpse was found in the following night in the village of Cerro Pelado , 15 kilometres north of the exclusive beach of Punta del Este .	-10.8247
As an alibi , a five-year-old half-sister of the younger who had taken her with her should say that she was sexually attacked by the boy .	-3.9925
However , when the girl described the event before the police without mentioning an attack against them , the two boys admitted the deliberate killing of the 11-year-old .	-4.0730
Among other reasons , the elderly named a rivalry in the football match .	-11.0950
He was temporarily consigned to a psychiatric youth institution .	-4.1492
Pauls must Prison	-5.1777
Due to the exploitative trafficking in human beings , pimp , threat , insult and dangerous body injury , the District Court of Konstanz sentenced a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen to three and a half years in prison .	-4.4240
The former federal army soldier , who worked as a doorstep after two deployments in Afghanistan , submitted a confession within the framework of a process agreement .	-5.1160
Therefore , in five cases he met women about Internet or telephone contacts , which he sent on the line after a few weeks against their will .	-5.0407
Resistance he used to break with violence and threats . .	-3.4687
He maintained the revenue of women , some of whom for years purchased him .	-5.2189
By confiscating mobile phones and SIM cards , he prevented women from contacting the outside world .	-3.2824
Together with a colleague who conveyed the women , he brought them to different brothels in the so.	-3.5525
There he sometimes watched them to control their revenue .	-4.7501
In court , the defendant first claimed that he was suffering from a serious trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan died alongside him in an explosion .	-4.5406
After a psychiatric expert indicated great doubts about the mental restriction and thus about limited debt capacity , the 33-year-old submitted a comprehensive confession .	-5.4605
The court no longer had to hear any of the damaged women .	-2.5596
As a Kripo official reported , at least four more cases of exploitative trafficking in human beings were identified after a first ad by telephone surveillance measures .	-4.7528
The intercepted talks were highly aggressive .	-2.8214
In later interrogations , the victims would have confirmed their martyrdom .	-2.6613
Another witness in which one of the women had discovered blue spots on the whole body has not yet made any statement .	-4.2338
It is ' a completely broken personality ' that considers violence and exploitation to be normal in this meter .	-4.5645
The defendant regretted his behaviour yesterday .	-1.9590
" He dissolved himself from these circles and wanted to lead a normal life after prison , " he said .	-3.8802
Oil prices continue to reach USD 96 per barrel	-2.4318
The price of oil continued to fall on Friday , after concerns about a high supply overshadowed a report that the energy-hungry manufacturing sector in China is growing .	-4.1130
The reference crude type for deliveries in December had fallen by 14 cents to USD 96.24 per barrel in Europe the late morning in electronic commerce on the New York Mercantile Exchange .	-5.5451
The contract fell by 39 cents on Thursday , which meant a price decline of 5.8 % in October .	-3.1377
The large crude oil supply has burdened prices in recent weeks .	-3.2956
The US Department of Energy declared on Wednesday that US supply increased by 4.1 million barrels last week .	-2.4947
Over five weeks , the supply had risen by 25 million barrels .	-2.2903
But on Friday there were evidence of stronger demand through two reports of an increase in activity in Chinese manufacturing .	-3.9689
This suggests a continued recovery in China ’ s economy , whose growth had risen to 7.8 % in the third quarter , after reaching the lowest level in the previous quarter for two decades .	-4.0109
Crude oil from the Brent variety , a reference value for international crude oil , also used by US refineries , fell at the ICE Exchange in London by 26 cents to $ 108.58 per barrel .	-3.1194
Court blocks decision on the NYPD Stop and Frisk Directive	-3.1520
A federal appeal court in the USA blocked on Thursday the order of a judge who had requested changes to the New York Police Department ’ s stop-and-fresh program ( “ stopping and browsing ” ) , and unbanded the judge of the case .	-5.7906
The 2nd US Court of Appeal declared that the decisions of Judge Shira Scheindlin would be suspended until a decision was taken on the appeal of the city .	-4.9304
The judge judged in August that the city violated the Constitution with the way in which the programme for stopping and questioning people is implemented .	-4.3231
The city appealed against its assessment and ordered remedies , including the decision to set up a monitoring body to help the police amend their directive and the relevant training programme .	-4.3950
On Tuesday , the Court of Appeal heard the arguments for suspension requested .	-8.7372
The appeal report stated that the judge must be removed from the case because she violated the code of conduct for US judges by determining that a judge should avoid the appearance of partiality ; this was partly justified by a series of media interviews and public statements in which she publicly responded to the criticism of the Court .	-13.5247
The judge had judged that police officers infringe the civil rights of tens of thousands of people because they target inappropriately black and Latin American men with the Stop and Frisk Programme .	-3.8102
It appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of major changes , including reforms in directives , training and service monitoring , and arranged a pilot program with cameras worn on the body in quarters where most controls were carried out .	-4.5918
In August , the city of New York agreed to end the practice of storing names and addresses of people who were released after police control .	-3.6386
An oral negotiation on the appointment of the city is planned after 14 March 2014 .	-3.4096
Stop and Frisk tactics have been criticized by a number of civil rights defenders .	-10.4683
Such controls have been in various forms for decades , but the number of checks recorded during the term of the partisan mayor Michael Bloomberg rose to an all-time high of 684,330 in 2011 , most of them black and Latin American men .	-3.7814
In 2004 , complaints were filed by four men belonging to all minorities , which became a collective redress .	-4.4841
Advocates of changes to the NYPD ’ s stop and fresh risk programme say that changes will end unfair practices and create a more trustworthy and effective police force , and influence the way other police presidents use the regulation .	-4.5796
Opponents believe that the changes would dampen the morality of the police , but not crime ; money would also be wasted and the wider problem of a police force under pressure following the abolition of thousands of posts in the last decade .	-5.0141
The judge pointed out that they do not end the stop and fresh practice , which is constitutional , but only reform the way in which the NYPD implements the controls .	-4.7703

With this Bedouin wisdom , the first chairman , Wolfgang Henne , described the history and fascination of the association " Helfende Hände " .	-3.2770
On Saturday afternoon , the tenth birthday of the association was celebrated , which has already had considerable success .	-4.0063
The first chairman Henne reported in detail about the work of the association .	-2.7905
He himself was the first time in Mauritania in the Cheijk-Zajed hospital in Nouakchott in 2004 .	-3.3002
As a result , further cooperation was developed , and the gynaecologist Henne carried out numerous operations on the ground during several trips .	-5.5319
During the speeches , images of the inserts were shown on a large screen so that the guests of the anniversary event could see the above actions .	-5.3485
The desert vehicle of the association was also shown .	-1.8896
It is a former Federal Border Vehicle .	-2.1194
Rainer Prewo , the former OB of Nagold , had made the proposal to equip this vehicle with a photovoltaic plant and now , according to Henne , is planning to work at the association in an advisory function .	-10.3317
In 2008 , the Schleeh room from Baiersbronn in the record time of just under a week created the sick station in Socogim , a misery district on the edge of the capital - volunteer .	-5.3324
Henne also mentioned a new mother-child hospital in Nouakchott	-1.7779
Especially interesting in times when the birth clinic is to be disrupted in Nagold .	-4.5195
There is a lot of learning in Africa as a medical doctor , Henne said , for example , to speed up against burn-out .	-4.8698
Due to the political unrest in the country , it was not possible to travel as many as planned , but many medical professionals came to Germany to hospitalize here in various areas .	-5.6966
Moreover , containers with material are regularly sent to Africa , including medical equipment , drugs , association materials , hospital beds and glasses in March this year .	-4.2059
Mitinitiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself delivered plenty of local color by telling Mauritania about Mercedes vehicles converted to the mobile goat stall and describing the experiences of the Stammheim musicians who traditionally support the association during their Mauritanian trip .	-5.8726

Coulson used phone hacking to check a tip	-9.5999
The former news of the Word editor Andy Coulson allegedly used “ telephone hacking , monitoring , and confrontation ” in trying to confirm a false tip about an affair of the then interior minister , Charles Clarke .	-4.8568
Public prosecutor Andrew Edis QC declared to the Court in Old Bailey that News of the World heard a false rumour in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with his “ attractive special adviser ” Hannah Pawlby .	-11.4751
The newspaper commissioned the private detective Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlby 's voicemails , and pursued them , but Coulson also called them and left messages as the court learned .	-3.5110
“ According to the Public Prosecutor ’ s Office , Coulson , who is now the publisher of NotW , is no one who is in front of people ’ s apartment and hopes to catch them up with fresh action , but one who likes to confront people with a story to see their reaction , ” explained Edis .	-6.4687
He said NotW use three procedures to investigate stories : telephone hacking , monitoring and confrontation .	-8.9469
The publisher is personally involved in the third method .	-1.3473
Obviously he knows of the second , of monitoring , otherwise it cannot be .	-3.4308
What about the first ?	-0.9314
Does he know about telephone hacking ?	-1.6766
He denies this , but we say , “ And whether he knew it . ”	-3.1709
Rumors about an affair of Clarkes were first taken up by the NotW feature editorial , when a source sexually interested in Pawlby was said : “ Do not waste your time , it is with Charles . ”	-4.2573
A band with voicemails from their phone of at least three occasions was ensured in August 2006 in Mulcaire 's apartment .	-3.1484
The investigators also found entries on the detective computer where Pawlby and her sister were stored as “ projects . ”	-3.2267
In the time when the research was running , the grandparents of Pawlby received anonymous calls asking for information about them , Edis explained .	-4.2318
Meanwhile , former chief porter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup overseen the monitoring of Pawlby ’ s movements .	-7.5920
On 18 June 2005 , Coulson left her a voicemail with the following content : “ I have a story that we want to publish tomorrow , which I would like to talk about with Charles . ”	-3.3093
Edis explained that Coulson ’ s activities in this story followed the same pattern as other important figures , such as the former interior minister David Blunkett .	-3.7041
The juries heard on Thursday that Coulson Blunkett had confronted a married woman for an affair , when he himself lied with the co-accused Rebekah Brooks , who had been married at the time .	-4.8791
Coulson and Brooks dispute having conspired others to hack phones between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006 .	-2.9719
Mulcaire , Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted the phone hacking .	-2.0499
In protest against the planned rich tax , French football will indeed go through the first strike since 1972 .	-3.2037
A conciliation meeting ends without results .	-2.6600
In the conflict over the rich tax , the government and professional football in France have manoeuvred into a dead end after a failed conciliation meeting .	-4.0142
President Fran<unk>ois Hollande received association and association representatives on Thursday at the Paris <unk>lysée Palace and listened to their complaints .	-3.6857
But he refused to spare football from the planned 75 % tax on incomes of more than one million euros per year , which all the country ’ s firms will pay for two years from 2014 .	-4.7957
The other side remained tough .	-3.0812
The strike announced at the end of November will now be brought through by the Chief Association of Professional Clubs ( UCPF ) , Jean-Pierre Louvel .	-3.9677
The match days scheduled between November 29 and December 2 in Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 are thus out .	-4.7742
Gechingen : No absolute protection possible	-8.9883
" We want to involve the inhabitants in the planning at an early stage " , Mayor Jens Häu<unk>ler opened the civil information event on the flood protection concept in Gechingen .	-4.3650
About 80 participants had entered the municipal hall to explain the planned measures , ask questions , express concerns and introduce ideas .	-4.1959
Häu<unk>ler made it clear : " The ultimate decisions are made by the members of the municipal council " .	-11.9610
The flooding that unprepared Gechingen on May 15 , 2009 , was a major event that raised the question of protective measures for the future , according to Häu<unk>ler .	-5.7112
A river survey was commissioned with the neighbouring community of Aidlingen , which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen .	-3.7844
" The protection of as many land as possible is the goal , " says Häussler .	-4.3231
The planning of the protection against a flood expected every 100 years , according to the German weather service , is based on statistical planning . .	-12.0158
Climate change is taken into account by a 15 % surcharge .	-2.5558
In specialist circles this is called " HQ 100aKlima " .	-2.7178
The water masses that caused considerable damage in Gechingen in 2009 corresponded to a 1000-year-old flood .	-3.7498
" There is no absolute protection , but we can achieve a relative improvement , " he says .	-3.1546
In order to achieve the HQ 100a climate protection , approximately EUR 4 million must be invested in Gechingen , with the municipality expecting approximately 70 percent of national subsidies . , the the . , , the the , the , , , , the the the , the the	-16.2650
Häussler pointed out , however , that support only exists if an overall concept is implemented .	-4.2481
The community needs the participation of the citizens .	-4.2430
An elaborate planning and approval procedure must be completed .	-2.5381
In the best case , implementation can begin in 2016 .	-2.5684
Among other things , the protection concept , which was already presented in the municipal council last week ( we reported ) , provides for local measures in the influx of the Irm River from the Stammheimer Valley .	-4.9477
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept , participants took the opportunity to contribute their concerns .	-3.1429
Among other things , it was questioned why no more dams and restraint basins were planned to protect the place .	-4.3645
Gregor Kühn , specialist planner of the engineering office Wald and Corbe from Hügelsheim , who presented the concept , emphasized that it required the interaction of all the measures presented to achieve the desired goal in the sum .	-10.0403
Moreover , the most economical solution is kept , according to Joachim Wald von Wald and Corbe .	-4.3443
There has been displeasure among ancient fans , who , even with normal thunderstorms , have suffered constantly from overloading the channel network .	-7.9852
The problem is known in the administration and initial measures have already been taken .	-3.4476
However , Häussler pointed out that the directives on channel systems are different from those for flood protection , and this must not be mixed .	-12.5922
The municipality is obliged to interpret the channel network in such a way that two to three years of rainfall could be brought to bear .	-5.1340
More dimensioning of sewage channels would swallow millions .	-3.3482
Heavy Injured After Collision	-3.3870
In the early Friday afternoon two drivers were seriously injured on the road 44 near Revensdorf at a frontal collision .	-4.1575
The police immediately blocked the road , but could not say much about the accident .	-3.9143
However , there are various testimonies which should be evaluated .	-9.7582
The 19-year-old handler of a VW golf took the way to Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf met her with his Hyundai .	-5.2145
Both vehicles collapsed , with the woman so heavily trapped that the fire brigade needed half an hour to free her from the vehicle wreck .	-4.9596
The actual cause of the accident remained unresolved first .	-3.4851
Both disasters came to nearby hospitals .	-2.4675
The route was closed for about two hours .	-2.8087

Philip K. Dick was a god searcher , a metaphysicist , his novels and narratives also have something serial .	-3.2151
Surprisingly the outer relationship : the stinging eyes , the beard , the high forehead .	-4.2268
And as Fjodor M. Dostoyevsky , with his massive oeuvre , is to be understood as the founder and apologist of the Russian soul , one reads Philip K. Dick as an American prophet , who is very much true in his own country .	-5.1947
Some titles have been published in Heyne Verlag , the Haffman cassette with the 118 narratives distributes two thousand .	-3.7109
Dick explains America - the realm of breathtaking technological progress , coupled with paranoia , security madness , and belief to be selected .	-3.8379
Dick had God 's experiences , his late books read like a mixture from the revelation of the John and a computer manual .	-11.2365
Perhaps he was crazy , had added drugs to his brain .	-2.1351
He captured early that the computers are divinities .	-3.1465
He wrote a theology of the computer and asked what distinguishes a man from a machine , the creator of his creature .	-3.1475

Talk about Merkel in Russia	-2.3060
Former US intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum in the US Chancellor Angela Merkel .	-12.8430
Representatives of the German Federal Prosecutor could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old personally in Russia , the Agency Interfax reported .	-3.5301

At the instruction of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection and Terrorism ( BVT ) , the German Intellectual Service , he should photograph the roof of the US Foreign Post , which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank .	-4.4962
According to German media , the BVT wanted to prove the existence of monitoring antennas and the action led to a change of word between the US and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin .	-3.8604
James Clapper , US Director of National Intelligence , insisted again in September that the US did not use foreign spionage opportunities to “ steal the operating secrets of foreign companies on behalf of US firms to enhance their international competitiveness or profits . ”	-4.5116
But , since Edward Snowden , the former Whistleblower employee , began publishing his fillhorn to US surveillance secrets , European governments and corporate leaders are no longer sure that they can take the director at their word .	-5.1561
Reports that the American National Security Agency spies the Brazilian oil company Petrobas and obtained data from American cloud providers , including Google and Yahoo , have brought the company paranoia to a new peak because of government surveillance .	-4.5377

“ I believe there is a sufficient basis for formal investigation , ” he said .	-2.5681

CDC Publish Allergy-Directives for Schools	-2.3061
On Wednesday , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) published a series of guidelines for dealing with food allergies for children in schools .	-2.5967
These are the first such guidelines issued by the US Government , as the number of school children with food allergies increases .	-3.8272
One in 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy .	-2.0629
According to the CDC , the spread of food allergies among children increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007 . the the the the the the the the the the the the the	-7.1840
The guidelines contain information for schools to raise awareness of food allergies for teachers and employees and how to deal with children who show allergic reactions .	-4.3566
It is also recommended that schools have Epinephrin in stock – the auto injection of the EpiPen brand is most commonly used – to deal with a potentially lethal hypocrisy reaction .	-3.9090
Legislators in the states have recently changed the rules so that schools can keep epinephrin in stock more easily .	-4.2224
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms mentioned by children who have an allergic reaction .	-2.6243
Children may say : “ It feels like something pushes on my tongue , ” “ My tongue feels like a hair lies on it , ” or “ My tongue cribbles ” .	-4.5511
Parents of intersexual children can choose “ Gender Undetermined ”	-2.2559
Germany is the first European nation in which a third gender is recognised for children born with unclear genitals .	-2.5079
Newborn is no longer allocated rigidly male or female .	-3.6228
According to the new law , parents no longer need to declare gender for such children , but can indicate “ indeterminate ” or “ not ” on the certificate of birth .	-4.0258
The aim of the law is to take the pressure of parents so that they do not have to make hasty decisions regarding operations for sex allocation in newborn people and to combat discrimination against intersexual people .	-5.7957
An intersexual person said years later , according to the BBC , “ I am neither a man nor a woman . ”	-2.9373
I remain the patchwork created by doctors mutilated and full of scars .	-1.6619
It is estimated that one in 2,000 children every year is not boys or girls .	-3.9990
They are among the intersexuals , a group that falls under the diagnosis of “ sexual differentiation disorder ” ( DSD ) , a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes , germs ( ovaries or testimonies ) or unusually developed genitals .	-4.2567
Valais Simpson was perhaps intersexual .	-1.8036
Understanding gender identification is still not very well developed , but most experts in the US advise that you should use the best available sex-allocation information if a provision is not possible and not wait for the psychological and physical development of the child before choosing an operation , if any .	-5.6614
The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher , who specializes in the issue of gender identification , said that the new German law “ sounds like a good thing . ”	-3.1658
Intersexual children constitute an ethical dilemma .	-10.8378
“ Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgical intervention , but most children do not , ” he said .	-3.0672
You can assign sex without surgery and then wait for the identity to develop .	-4.0897
The scientific data on how a child develops its gender identity at all are not very accurate .	-2.9700
No one knows why it happens .	-1.7943
It is like the secret why people are homosexual .	-2.2193
A 2011 report to the European Commission states that intersexual people should be distinguished from transsexual or transgender persons , because their status is not gender-based , but conditioned by their biological constitution , which is neither exclusively male nor female , but typically defined both simultaneously or not clearly as one of them .	-5.0670
These characteristics were shown in subordinate sexual characteristics such as muscle mass , hair , breasts and stature , priority sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals , or chromosom structures and hormones .	-4.0425
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination faced by intersexual and transgender persons in professional life , as well as the extent of harassment , violence and prejudice cri. , . , , and , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-8.8310

In neighboring France , gender issues are still controversial , such a news report on France 24 .	-3.4442
In 2011 , dozens of French MEPs from the strictly Catholic country signed a petition that “ gender theory ” should be removed from school books . the .	-8.9574
The US website Catholic Online has also spoken out against German law , on the grounds that , “ If the world is broken into a new state where gender is a decision , but not sexual activity , then we are twisting two more pillars of civilization . ”	-5.4812
The mother of a newborn from Maryland explained to Baby Zone that it would be better if babies were assigned a sex at birth .	-3.9574
“ Parents are already stressful enough , even without further restrictions , especially if they do not know the sex of their own child , ” she said to the parent website .	-5.9177
Children need stability and security .	-0.6599
Historically , children born with both male and female sexes were called hermaphrodites , according to the attractive Greek God who had both sexes .	-2.6597
Ten years ago , medicine regarded gender as something that could be extinguished and then rebuilt .	-10.9716
But , meanwhile , the ethical foundations of an operation are being questioned , as it is now known how complex gender identity is , and that doctors can also be wrong because they do not know how the child feels when growing up with the gender they assign .	-5.5449
“ In the middle of the 20th century it was called a psychiatric emergency , ” said Drescher .	-3.1050
When such a child was born , it was not the psychiatrist but the surgeons that were called .	-4.7481
The ruling theory of the treatment of children with unclear genitals dates back to Dr John Money of John Hopkins University , who believed that gender was formable .	-4.2631
He coined the term “ gender identity , ” arguing that social and environmental impulses – as parents educate a child – interacted with a child ’ s genes and hormones , and characterized whether a person considers himself male or female .	-4.6538
But his theories became controversial in a 1966 case called “ John / Joan . ”	-3.2151
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been separated in a boiled circumcision , to castrate the child completely and also to remove his testimony and then raise him as a girl .	-4.8345
“ Money presented this case as a successful example of transformation , which he was not , ” says Drescher .	-3.4637
When the boy was about 15 , he moved back to male sex and married a woman .	-2.5731
At the age of 38 , he committed suicide .	-8.7402
According to Dresher , there are still doctors who would practice this model .	-2.0336
But in the 1990 ’ s , with the entry of the Internet , survivors of these gender operations came to the public , who are “ unhappy with the outcome . ”	-4.0244
For example , at Jim Bruce , a 36-year-old author from Montana , born with XY-male chromosomes , but ambiguous genitals .	-2.9561
The doctors were not clear whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis , and were convinced that he could never lead a “ satisfying life ” as a man .	-3.5966
So his external organ and the testimony were surgically removed shortly after the birth of 1976 and was raised as a girl .	-3.4021
At the age of 12 he received female hormones .	-1.7971
“ I knew I am not a girl , ” he explained to ABCNews.com	-2.4992
I was unhappy , but it was really difficult to ask questions .	-1.6515
At the age of 18 he should be given a vaginal plastic .	-2.6701
But , as he was depressive and knew that something was wrong , he demanded his medical files .	-3.3252
What he found out was shocking .	-1.0144
I was sterilized at my birth – and no one ever told me .	-2.7205
Bruce was born with a DSD in which his body could not produce enough testosterone to develop genitals .	-3.2142
After learning the truth , he returned to male identity , received testosterone injections and removed his breasts .	-3.3455
Through the operation it has become infertile .	-2.8913
Today , in an organization called the Interface Project , he is fighting for intersexual people to be perceived as normal .	-2.7372
But Anne Tamar-Mattis , CEO of the Advocates for Informed Choice legal group based in California , worries that German law can “ encourage stamping and stigmatizing . ”	-3.1705
“ Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and to assign to the child , not specified , ” she explained .	-4.2450
We fear that this favours intervention .	-2.2205
We think it would be better to allocate the male or female sex and then wait .	-2.7954
But we do not yet know how the law will affect , so we can only speculate .	-2.6354
Tamar-Mattis said that their organization supports Australian law , because “ it enables adults to recognize as a third sex ” .	-3.6221
“ Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal gender , ” she explained .	-2.6178
The German law is about birth allocation .	-3.1282
This is not a struggle to force small children at that time .	-3.4453
When they grow up , they can decide their own body .	-3.2437
But Dr. Arlene Baratz , a Pittsburg breast diologist who has a daughter with a sexual disturbance and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group , says the German law “ authorized ” both parents and children .	-4.0327
Katie , daughter of Baratz , was born with male chromosomes , but has a DSD called complete Androgen Resistance .	-2.9687
Due to the recipe defect of target cells for testosterone , female characteristics developed .	-3.2295
She has a vagina , but no uterus and no ovaries .	-1.6413
Today Katie is 29 and married ; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as a child psychiatric .	-3.0015
Although it is infertile , it hopes to get a child through adoption or surrogacy .	-3.3619
“ The law gives space to parents , which does not require them to make hasty decisions , ” said Baratz .	-4.4425
It gives them the time to do different tests and clarify things , giving them time before they write “ male ” or “ female . ”	-3.6255
In this way everything is fine – you draw the child big and love it .	-4.6695
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy parental happiness .	-2.5399
And you don ’ t have to rush out an operation that can no longer be undone .	-4.5226
“ This includes children in the decision and eliminates the fear that parents are killing because they think they are not doing the right thing , ” she explained .	-4.2141
Ultimately , the child decides on the sex that better fits him – and that is wonderful .	-3.7062
This will enable children to make the decision themselves .	-2.7746
Unknown injury girls by car shot	-3.1273

Housing with Future	-2.5777
Waltraud Ries really lives dreamy .	-2.8614
Your house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with a lot of green , an old tree , nice neighbours and not too much traffic .	-3.7876
The city is only a few minutes by public transport .	-3.0490
" Hopefully you are not afraid of spinning ? " , asks Waltraud Ries and points to a fat spider on the door frame .	-3.5900
I have been looking for a new apartment for my husband and myself for some time now .	-2.2452
But you know how difficult it is in Stuttgart .	-1.9880
The reason , however , is not a spider phobia , but the concern that at age the many stairs of the house and the apartment can no longer be handled explains them .	-6.4790
Moreover , since a meniskus operation , the mid-fifties have learned what it means to move from floor to floor with handicap .	-4.8252
Just recently a book of her appeared on the subject of ' Happy Living in Age - What form of living is the best for me ? ' .	-5.3323
'Our apartment is the best example of what doesn 't work at all in age ' , starts telling them .	-4.9561
When she moved to the maisonette apartment more than 20 years ago , it was just a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green .	-3.7010
Today with mid-fifty , Waltraud Ries thinks differently .	-3.1232
She also knows , however , that she is one of the few people who are even dealing with the issue of ' living in old age ' .	-4.7369
Most of them displace it as long as it goes .	-3.8299
Old are always only the others ' , she says muttering .	-4.0368
Only when the suffering pressure is really great will one think .	-4.2680
'Then it can be too late ' , says Ries .	-2.9648
In her book , the interior designer presents 17 living models for a self-determined living of age .	-3.9949
'What form of living you choose is always an individual decision ' , she explains . the the the the . the the the the the . the the the the	-9.2737
D i e solution is not available for age .	-1.8052
Even those who can afford the age rest seat in Tuscany or Brittany should always consider that they can become ill .	-3.9286
And : ' Without good knowledge of the national language , you can also join the Dolce Vita , ' the author of the book gives you the willingness to consider .	-6.9521
Among their models are classical care models , alternative living forms or the often cited pensioner WG .	-4.0883
At age , everyone has his ticks and blankets .	-10.3191
'For me , however , such a community would be nothing ' , she says with a wink of eyes .	-5.8085
Not as in a student WG with a common bathroom and a kitchen .	-4.7352
" At age you simply need your retreat rooms , " said Ries .	-4.4720
However , the author does not want to rule out the fact that a senior residential community can still work .	-4.0264
But that must be different from the classical student WG .	-5.4996
And sometimes you just want to rest , ' she believes .	-3.2838
With this opinion , it is not alone , at least in the state capital .	-4.1765
'Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own home for as long as they are ' is also the experience of Theresa Rütten , the head of civil service life at the age of the state capital .	-4.6410
Your department advises people around the issue of ' becoming older ' .	-4.6189
Therefore , the elderly in particular would often also accept inconveniences and restrictions in order to remain in their usual environment , which is also the experience of the Foundation Warentest .	-6.3014
Today there are many ways to make the house or the apartment accessible .	-3.3213
Ries recommends that everyone who is engaged in the reconstruction of their house or apartment should be thoroughly informed and not commissioned the first craftsman .	-7.3922
Today there are also specialists for the adaptation of age .	-4.7514
Even in the rental apartment one or two can be realized , and if it is only the toilet height , the interior architect clarifies .	-5.8149
But the existing apartment cannot always be redesigned according to age and thus accessible , even if it is still so beautiful .	-4.5892
This experience had to do Waltraud Ries .	-2.3758
Although there was a stairlift within the apartment , the paved path to the apartment door would be the far greater obstacle .	-7.0049
She will continue to search until she has found the ideal object for herself and her husband .	-2.9032
Before moving , she greets her more than before the spider at her home door .	-3.7039
US Wants to continue prosecuting Snowden	-2.8528
The US has not changed its attitude to former US intelligence officer Edward Snowden . the . the the , the the . the the the the .	-8.9096
He will continue to be accused of having given unauthorized secret information .	-3.5944
Therefore , he must face criminal proceedings in the US , said the spokesman of the US Department of Foreign Affairs , Jennifer Psaki , in Washington .	-3.9998
Snowden ’ s recent statements would not change this either .	-3.2877
Previously , after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow , German Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele had appealed to the US not to continue threatening him with punishment .	-3.7921
Psaki emphasized that hurricane statements are that of a parliamentarian , not that of a German member of the government .	-5.6312
Intelligence Teller Edward Snowden is willing to talk with German authorities in principle .	-4.1351
First , however , he wants to clarify his situation .	-2.8704
This was made clear by the former NSA employee sought by the USA in a non-addressed letter published by Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwarded to the Federal Government , Bundestag and Federal Attorney General .	-5.6024
The letter has the following text :	-2.6158
To the responsibilities	-2.4434
I have been asked to write to you about your investigation into mass monitoring .	-2.4830
I am called Edward Joseph Snowden and used to be a contractual or direct employee at the National Security Agency ( NSA ) , the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) and the United States Defense Intelligence Agency ( DIA ) .	-3.8753
As I worked in these institutions , I witnessed systematic violations of the law of my government , which led me to act on a moral duty .	-4.8312
As a result of the publication of these concerns , I was exposed to a serious and persistent hatch that forced me to leave my family and home .	-4.1469
I currently live in exile and enjoy temporary asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation under international law .	-2.0183
I am encouraged by the response to my political action , both in the United States and elsewhere .	-2.4065
Citizens around the world and also senior officials - including the United States - have judged revelations about a system of comprehensive monitoring that is not accountable to anyone as a public service .	-4.5780
These spy revelations brought forward many proposals for new laws and directives aimed at the previously hidden abuse of public confidence .	-12.7449
The benefits for society from these findings are becoming increasingly clear ; at the same time , the risks posed have been significantly reduced .	-5.0059
Although the outcome of my efforts has been demonstrably positive , my Dissens Government is still treating as a faithful break and seeking to criminalise and prosecute political expression .	-5.0136
Yet telling the truth is not a crime .	-2.5291
I am confident that the United States Government , with the support of the international community , will take this harmful stance .	-3.1592
I hope that , if the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved , I will be able to participate appropriately and legally in the responsible explanation of the facts concerning the statements made in the media , particularly with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports .	-4.9151
I look forward to talking to you in your country once the situation has been resolved and thank you for your efforts to safeguard the international law that protects us all .	-3.6808

Kindergarten has found a private buyer .	-1.0688
" The building is in good hands , " says Winterlingen 's mayor Michael Maier .	-1.7958
The municipality sold the former kindergarten in the Gartenstra<unk>e to a private person .	-3.3562
The municipal council agreed to the sale in its recent meeting in the non-public part .	-3.7744
The building changed its owner at a " reasonable " price .	-2.3887
" The community is satisfied , " stresses Maier .	-2.3257
The budget was estimated EUR 100 000 .	-2.9288
It is not yet clear how the new owner wants to use the former kindergarten .	-2.7352
The mayor is right that Winterlingen handed over responsibility for the building to someone before the winter and thus no longer has to pay for the entertainment of the house , how to heat , look at the garden and clean the walk .	-5.3348
" This effort is now away " , Maier is pleased .	-3.3088

Report : Obama campaign considered replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton	-1.7000
President Barack Obama ’ s closest advisers have secretly considered replacing Vice-President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton in the 2012 election campaign , according to the New York Times .	-2.8196
The revelation is the most notable surprise of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann ’ s long-awaited work on the 2012 election campaign , “ Double Down : Game Change 2012 . ”	-2.6359
The Times have a copy of the soon published book , and they reported on Thursday evening that the president ’ s top advisers had conducted “ extensive group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011 ” to find out whether Obama ’ s dwindling hope of re-election would look better if he dropped bides .	-5.7493
According to Jonathan Martin , the Times ’ national correspondent , the book thoroughly traces the history of the campaign and White House leaders ’ efforts , notably the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley , to measure the effect of exchanging the former Secretary of State Clinton against the Vice-President .	-5.0026
The potential change was a strictly kept secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office .	-2.2917
Only half a dozen of the president ’ s closest advisers – including Daley , Obama ’ s former campaign leader , Jim Messina , and the former White House leader , David Axelrod , and David Plouffe – knew about the thought of change .	-3.4358
“ Double Down ” claims that Daley has been at the forefront of efforts to exchange Biden despite its “ narrow , personal relationship , ” before deciding against such a move , after the data showed that Clinton ’ s candidacy “ would not significantly improve Obama ’ s opportunities . ”	-4.8639
In an interview with Martin , Daley confirmed that the government actually thought about replacing Biden with Clinton .	-2.5519
“ I said a whole series of things to consider , and that was one of them , ” said Daley to the magazine .	-8.0414
It must be remembered that the President had terrible survey values at the time , so we thought : “ For God ’ s will , what are we doing ? ”	-4.0733
While Daley referred to the investigation as “ due care , ” Martin said to Anderson Cooper of CNN that a considerable amount of effort was undertaken during the re-election campaign to determine whether such a train pays off with regard to the ballot boxes .	-5.9314
“ Campaigns don ’ t spend so much money on surveys and focus groups if you don ’ t think seriously , ” Martin said on AC360 .	-3.8540
But it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team was thinking about exchanges .	-2.3653
Martin said to CNN that he asked Daley if his then boss knew about the potential change .	-2.7859
While Daley declared that he did not believe that the president was “ aware ” of the possible change , the former head of staff admitted that it was “ possible ” that Obama knew of . the , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-11.5591
Martin added that “ double down ” does not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether Obama ’ s political explorations had reached his desk .	-3.3714
Cooper asked Martin if he thought seriously that Obama knew nothing about investigating whether bides should be dropped in the elections .	-4.1377
“ Possibly , ” Martin replied .	-1.6383
What happens on the road with my email ?	-2.7167
E-mail actually means electronic letter .	-2.2467
Was email technically implemented in the design of the Internet service similar to the conventional mail ?	-5.8139
The focus of the conception of early Internet services was to make communication possible .	-3.9262
Therefore , the basic technical protocols have not taken care to create a stable foundation for listening safe correspondence .	-4.0470
Therefore , a conventional e-mail is more like an open postcard than a sealed letter .	-10.1309
If user " Anna " sends an email to " Benni " , are the computers of the two directly connected ?	-3.0314
The email program or browser of Anna sends the mail to their service provider 's mail server in the first step .	-3.5354
For example , if it has a GMail account , it would be Google .	-2.5343
This mail server sends the content to the provider that uses Benni .	-1.9809
On the route the mail can run via several other servers on the Internet .	-4.4253
Bennie can then call the content to his provider .	-2.2272
Will traditional e-mails be read on their way through the network ?	-3.3386
Most mails are read multiple times by software robots on the way . the the . the the . the the the . the the the	-9.3323
The sender 's provider usually checks if the mail carries a malicious program as an attachment .	-4.5141
A virus check is also made on the receiver systems .	-9.2447
Furthermore , the providers check whether this is an annoying and unwanted spam mail that is deleted immediately or at least moved away into a spam folder .	-14.7915
Do the robots have another task ?	-2.0876
For systems like GMail , the robot also determines the information Google needs to place context advertising .	-2.6582
When Anna and Benni communicate via GMail about their upcoming holiday journey , Google can display appropriate links to holiday offers .	-3.6927
Do unknown people also read the emails ?	-3.7417
The likelihood that unauthorized people will read a mail is very low .	-3.5392
In theory , however , this is possible .	-6.8606
In companies , administrators often have the opportunity to read electronic mail .	-2.9133
The law enforcement authorities and intelligence services also have legal means of intercepting or taking note of emails .	-3.7880
In addition , there are possible illegal recovery actions .	-4.8706
Is it possible to protect emails against reading ?	-2.4437
With an encryption according to the OpenPGP standard , an email can be encrypted effectively against Mitlesen .	-4.4038
With a great deal of technical effort it is also possible to conceal the metadata of an email communication so that it is not easy to recognize who communicated with whom .	-5.5161
How important are Yahoo and Google on the email market in Germany ?	-1.4665
Yahoo and Google , according to an investigation by Convios Consulting from August 2013 , play a minor role in the mainly privately used mailboxes .	-4.8917
While the shares of Yahoo mail had last fallen , GMail could increase significantly from Google .	-4.5812
Mother in the Forest Stormed and Pensions Cassed	-5.8907
When his mother died , a man from Wolfsburg forged a plan .	-2.0093
He buried the dead in a forest - and continued to receive their pension and care .	-4.1852
A 67-year-old Wolfsburger has buried his dead mother after investigating the police in the forest in order to receive further pensions and care money .	-5.4530
First of all , he covered up the death of the 89-year-old , then he cut the money for more than a year and a half .	-4.8738
Now the 67-year-old has to be responsible for fraud , as a spokesman said on Friday .	-3.1813
So the man hidden the woman in a forest near Helmstedt .	-2.8734
The man was suspected as early as May : at that time it became apparent that no medicines were needed for the needy mother .	-5.2726
The pensioner told the investigators that his mother had travelled to Spain .	-2.3914
Because the officials found this strange , they determined further .	-4.1719
It came out that the two had lived in a common apartment for more than 15 years and he had last maintained it .	-5.2626
The 67-year-old finally granted the death of his mother .	-2.7477
According to the police , an obduction did not provide evidence of a capital crime .	-3.4805
Looking for ice cream that shines in the dark ?	-2.5532
A British entrepreneur has developed the first glowing ice in the dark – with the help of torture .	-4.2395
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent characteristics of marine animals and created a bright delicacy .	-4.1059
The idea came to him after reading a research on torture and convincing Chinese scientists to artificially produce the luminous protein .	-4.6128
The ice cream reacts with the tongue when eating , which increases the pH value in the protein and triggers the light .	-4.3451
Chris explains that the ice reacts to the warmth of the mouth and shines – the more you lick , the lighter it becomes .	-3.8998
Charlie , founder of the “ Lick Me I 'm Delicious ” ice cream company , says , “ The product is incredible , but still in a very early production phase , and so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds . ” the .	-8.8979
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH value .	-2.0774
When the mouth warms the protein , the pH value and the ice shines .	-2.3798
We have tested it in recent months and it seemed ideal for us to put it on the market at Halloween because it has this wonderful light effect .	-12.5420
It is probably the most expensive ice cream I have ever made , because the source light is four times more expensive than gold .	-3.1851
Each ball costs me about 140 pounds .	-1.6580
But for that it tastes delicious .	-2.9227
Charlies experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual flavours , including beer , cheese , beef and leaf gold .	-2.9917
But his latest creation is to become even more ambitious .	-2.3348
He says , “ I would like to develop an invisible ice cream . ”	-2.0300
This is impossible in itself due to the break of light caused by the ice crystals that make up ice cream , but I suspect we will find a way to do it .	-6.2194
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a torment artificially produced by Chinese scientists .	-3.3112
The TSV Morsum is still without any point in the Handball Association League after six days of play . the . the . the the the . the the the the .	-10.8355
Tomorrow , the team of Ingo Ehlers will come to Derby against the TSV Daverden , who celebrated his first victory last weekend .	-4.7408
With this game the season starts again for us .	-2.5438
" I hope that we finally have our head free " , Ehlers behaves optimistically .	-4.0790
He finally has his complete cader at his disposal , except for the permanent injured Hendrik Blohme .	-4.5338
Even Daverden , like us , has a tempo game .	-4.4744
We must therefore keep our error rate low .	-2.3480
First and foremost , however , we need to increase the coverage , which has recently left anything but a safe impression .	-4.9409
Daverdens Coach Thomas Panitz is much more relaxed after the first season victory against North Horn .	-3.5531
The game was of course a house number .	-1.5609
But that is why we are far from favorite , because everything can always happen in the derby .	-9.8462
Nevertheless , Panitz now wants to move to Morsum to start a series .	-4.2827
Lack will Jan-Malte Jodat .	-2.3320
The A-Jugendliche Joost Windsuss , who is active in the A-Jugend-Bundesligisten HC Bremen with double play rights , celebrates his seasonal debut .	-5.1498

Halloween 2013 : Figures	-1.3544
When I was small , Halloween had something magical .	-1.5913
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets , stay late and dress us for the neighbourhood .	-2.7207
Today I have become a Halloween muffle .	-2.5225
Over the last two years , I have not agreed to distribute my apartment from sweets , and I do not think I will do so again this year .	-5.3451
But according to statistics , I am a black sheep as far as Halloween is concerned .	-2.4381
The majority of Americans – 158 million to be precise – celebrate Halloween this year , spending a total of $ 6.9 billion on sweets , costumes , and decorations , according to the US Retailers Association ( NRF ) .	-3.2522
One thing I look forward to every Halloween is the trend values .	-3.1659
The costumes will amount to approximately 1.2 billion of the $ 6.9 billion spent , according to the NRF . .	-8.9912
This year , exciting unanimous items are the last cry .	-11.2972
Women no longer have to wear sexy clothes , they can now also embody seductive food such as pizza , hamburger or carrots .	-4.0469
As far as men are concerned , I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead , and I bet that the Daft-Punk space men will create it this year in the Instagram feeds .	-3.4337
According to Google , the most sought after costumes are zombies , batman , pirates and witches .	-1.8039
I suspect that nothing is wrong with tradition .	-2.1017
We dressed our dogs last year and were not alone to my surprise .	-3.0708
Indeed , Americans spend $ 330 million this year on costumes of their pets , according to the NRF .	-2.2479
These are a lot of “ hot dogs ” .	-2.4758
As far as sweets are concerned , we are not cheerful .	-3.6073
Americans will spend $ 1.9 billion this year , according to The Nielsen Company .	-1.6416
These are about 270 million kilograms of chocolate bars , lutchers , candies and rubber bears .	-3.4044
So good news for the 41 million people , according to the US Department of Trade , who go through the quarters with the saying “ sweets or sources . ”	-4.7852
In fact , we will buy more than 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and – let us not pretend – eat .	-3.2334
The only thing we do not want to consume is the sugar-sweet Candy Corn ; yet 15 million kilograms of it are sold by Halloween , according to the National Association of Confederates .	-4.0524
These are about nine billion corn grains .	-2.2956
It is a mystery that I have not yet been able to solve .	-2.6650
Nothing belongs more to Halloween than houses where it spokes .	-2.7682
They have great names such as “ Terror Behind the Walls ” ( which , incidentally , is in a real prison ) , “ Howl-O-Scream ” and “ The House of Shock ” .	-3.4199
In fact , there are 1,200 officially recognized spukhouses in the United States , which earn $ 500 million , America Haunts said , and this includes the wonderful photographs on which you are pinking in the trousers and then putting friends on Facebook , where you will not get rid of them , and then leave a comment on the type you are standing on , such as “ nice face expression . ”	-8.8747
But finally we come to the pumpkins . . . . . . , , , , , , ,	-7.9894
Charlie Brown familiarized us with the Great Kürbis when we were children , and carving a pumpkin lamp is like decorating the Christmas tree – something we made from small to small .	-4.5155
Fortunately , the “ baby in the Kürbis ” trend only began last year thanks to Pinterest , so most of us grew up with cutting the pump and not sitting in it .	-4.7185
This year , Americans will spend about $ 106 million on pumps , according to the US Census Bureau .	-2.3016
The pumpkin lamp , which slowly rotting in the front garden , is probably from Illinois , where this year 245 million kilograms of pumpkins were harvested .	-4.4353
If you want to score correctly , then call Tintin and Susan Mathisdon in Napa , California and cut something pretty out of their 921 kilo heavy pump .	-5.2665
Housing fire in Helmbrechts : Rescue forces mount coaled corpses	-3.7356
The fire brigade had to spend the late Thursday evening in Helmbrechts .	-4.0162
A three-family house in the Hof district catches fire on Friday night .	-2.9988
The rescue forces have a cold corpse from the house .	-4.0974
Rescue forces have found a cold body in a three-family house at a fire in Helmbrechts .	-11.8971
Whether it is a resident is still unclear , as a police spokesman said in Bayreuth .	-3.3327
Late Thursday evening it burned on the ground floor of the house .	-2.6342
When the fire brigade arrived , the flames beat out of a window .	-3.3477
The staff went into the apartment and found the corpse in a room .	-2.9842
This and another room was completely burned out .	-4.7421
The entire ground floor was damaged .	-2.0334
All other inhabitants were not at home during the fire , the police spokesman continued to declare .	-3.6810
For the time being , the building is no longer habitable .	-3.1524
The exact cause of the fire was not clear at first .	-2.4416
Germany ’ s largest national church has an offensive ceremony to promote the profession of the pastor .	-10.2344
Background is a possible lack of parish : the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Hanover expects the number of its currently around 1,800 pastors to be halved by 2030 .	-4.5470
For young people today , the profession is very attractive and offer good prospects , said Pastor Mathis Burfien ( 43 ) in conversation with the Evangelical Press Service .	-3.5743
It is attractive to be able to determine the working and daily routine for yourself . the the the . , the , the the the , the .	-10.3606
The Landeskirche first commissioned a pastor in a full place to inspire young people to study theology .	-5.0046
Currently , fewer and fewer young people choose to study theology after the university .	-3.4430
Burfien returns this to the process of unchurch : " God 's voice is quiet , the world is loud " .	-4.1112
The profession is characterised by great freedom and diversity .	-2.1304
I am a member of my calendar of appointments and can set my priorities where it is important to me .	-4.4861
Pastors could be very close to the people as a maritime care . . . . the . the . the . the . the	-10.9621
They earned as much as teachers and could live well from them .	-2.3897
Certainly , more is being paid in the free economy , but theologians would have a safe employer .	-9.2207
Today ’ s young people , who are not just about careers , but also about a meaningful job , are .	-5.9495
According to the Landeskirche , which comprises three quarters of Lower Saxony , approximately 60 pastors are retired each year .	-3.6659
At the same time , about 40 graduates of a theology study begin their vicariat .	-3.9620
In sparsely populated peripheral areas such as resin , Emsland or Wendland , it will be difficult to fill jobs in the future .	-4.2850
Burfien wants to organise study days for young people and also invite celebrities who have studied theology .	-3.7150
Theology studies offer broad education .	-3.1728
You can even become President of the Federal Republic .	-3.8983
Land Rover Rally Series announced	-0.7200
The interior features racing seats and six-point belts as well as a free speaker system .	-4.5426
The options range from reinforced brakes , a service package with bowler works and logistical support to vehicle storage between events .	-3.8344
Drew Bowler , Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport , said : “ The rally customers who come to Bowler have changed . ”	-2.8806
They are not all experienced racing drivers , but people who are looking for excitement and adventure as well as for an accessible way to world class events .	-4.3432
We are pleased to be able to open this path in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format opens up new possibilities for experiencing the various rally disciplines in the UK and abroad and preparing newcomers for the strain and reality of Rally Raid .	-4.9699
We really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge car – this will be an entertaining championship .	-2.8055
Moreover , the Defender Challenge has a training and test day in February and the option of participating in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East .	-3.6565
Called fire brigade to save a dog that sat 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rock lead in a quarry in a dangerous rock .	-5.1927
Cockerspaniel-Dog Ruby had run away after a smaller traffic accident . the the the . , , , the , , the . the the the . the	-14.2246
Three days later , she was discovered by a walker in the quarry in her miserable location .	-9.7069
Firefighters sealed to the wall and saved the dog from safe death .	-4.7143
The fire brigade succeeded in bringing a dog to safety , which was fixed on a 15 metre high lead in a rock wall .	-5.6423
The nine months old cockerspaniel dog Ruby had run away after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before she was saved from a quarry on Wednesday .	-4.2235
Scott Alderson , 25 , and his girlfriend Becky Hall , 20 , to whom the dog belongs , came to the Steinbruch Flappit in Denholme , West Yorkshire to welcome Ruby again and thank the firemen of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service .	-3.7811
They had desperately sought their missing bitch and published calls for help in social networks when she was in the quarry after the small traffic accident .	-5.5253
About 14 : 15 on Wednesday , a walker running his dog saw the stranded Ruby on the 15 metre high paragraph in the quarry .	-4.9018
The technical rescue team at the Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the spot and sealed to rescue Ruby , which was then transported to the top in a dog box .	-12.0197
Andy Clayton , specialist of the technical rescue team , said : “ She was in a dangerous situation .	-2.7956
It was located in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and the ground .	-3.2072
She did not move a muscle during her rescue – she was like stiff-frozen .	-2.9483
But now it is doing well .	-2.1988
She then eaten a few dog cakes .	-2.8804
That was quite unusual .	-2.8394
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible .	-1.4002
Peter Lau , the technical rescue team specialist , said : “ Ruby had a huge luck . ”	-2.8766
It was possible that it was very seriously injured or worse .	-2.5602
Ruby was brought to the veterinary surgeon , but nothing except exhaustion and dehydration .	-4.9693
Becky Hall from Halifax , West Yorkshire , said , “ watching to save was frightening . ”	-2.6430
I could not think she was really up there .	-2.8950
It was wonderful to keep them back in the poor .	-1.8796
The veterinarian explained that if the exhaustion had become too big and it had collapsed , it would probably have crashed .	-3.5948
The fire-fighters have done great things .	-2.6720
It was really courageous what they did .	-2.1628
We are simply so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible .	-2.1867
Scott Alderson from Keighley added , “ We were afraid that it would fall down , but it remained above . ”	-2.7905
The fire-fighters were great .	-2.0199
I can hardly believe where she was .	-7.1974
Mick Jagger explains that he never did Katy Perry when she was 18 .	-2.3025
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week , the pop star said that she worked as a background singer on Jaggers song “ Old Habits Die Hard ” from 2004 .	-3.5341
Perry explained that she eaten with the aldryer to evening , and that “ he excavated me when I was 18 . ”	-3.9640
She added : “ That has been a long time ago and he was very nice to me . ”	-3.0105
In a statement , a representative of Jaggers , 70 , said on Thursday that he “ categorically denied that he ever tried to rapprochement with Katy Perry . ”	-3.8155
The representative added : “ Perhaps she confused him with someone else . ”	-2.0840

George Kerevan : European Unbundling gives the Scots the election .	-2.4904
A new day , a new horror story about independence .	-2.2897
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland is needed to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership .	-2.2253
This provides the keyword for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a barbed wire border along the Hadrianswall .	-3.2222
Indeed , the Strathclyde template referred to the potential economic benefits that would bring more freedom of travel in the rest of Europe , but , as expected , this did not matter in the headlines .	-4.6204
Nor has anyone mentioned that EU member states often defy their strict rules if it is more favourable to them .	-3.8661
Since Scotland is not currently part of the Schengen area , continued disregard for Brussels would only be a small concession in exchange for what we really want from the Scots .	-3.5720
So no story .	-2.4448
And one that has come so far in the years that it is already a fossil : the first time I heard the “ independence means passport controls ” duck at least 40 years ago .	-12.6600
An interesting point is lost in the constant repetition of this ancient history .	-3.5178
Why should one expect an independent Scotland to dance according to the European pipe ?	-2.6447
Why exchange the London yoke against that of Brussels , particularly now ?	-10.3002
These are the real European news : the big post-war plan for the unification of Europe has stalled .	-3.3991
With the euro crisis , the European project has officially died .	-2.3836
Throughout the EU , parties that are hostile to the EU or want to abandon the euro as a single currency are gaining ground .	-3.7804
Even in Germany , the Euroskeptic Party was able to gather almost five million votes for itself in the federal election in September , thus effectively driving the Free Democrats ( the equivalent to the British Liberal Democrats ) out of the Bundestag .	-5.4895
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federalist Europe .	-1.5673
But the current economic crisis turns out to be a turning point .	-1.4579
Because of the strict austerity policy imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank in connection with the straitjacket to which the national economy is required by maintaining the single currency , many people believe that the European project has gone too far .	-4.2163
The euro ’ s crisis has little to do with national governments causing excessive fiscal deficits – only in Greece . . the the the the the the . the the the the the the the the the	-9.3577
Instead , the Eurosystem has arrested its members on exchange rates , which are beneficial to German exporters – and German politicians would like to do so .	-4.2393
Without the possibility of depreciating the local currency , Southern Europe will find itself with a built-in productivity disadvantage over Germany .	-3.5071
The only way is to cut wages and public spending – spurred by Berlin .	-2.2101
Behind the current budgetary and monetary problems lies a deeper European productivity problem .	-2.1029
As a result of the “ green ” energy directives imposed by Brussels – a code for subsidising French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – European industry pays double for electricity and four times for gas compared to the United States .	-3.6671
This is a paralysing cost disadvantage , as we have already seen in Grangemouth .	-2.6362
All world wage detentions do not protect the European petrochemical industry from being pushed into the corner by cheap American shale gas .	-3.2530
As a result , a revolt is emerging , especially in France , the EU ’ s former cheerleader .	-2.9435
After the war , France ’ s political elite saw the EU as a vehicle to keep Germany in check and raise Paris to Washington ’ s eye .	-3.4725
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy , imposing its own economic policies on Europe , which has to struggle the fragile French economy .	-9.6660
The result : Marine Le Pen ’ s right-wing anti-EU National Front has just won a decisive re-election , thus pointing the ruling socialists to place three .	-4.2789
The National Front is now France ’ s most popular party , with 24 % of the vote – a timely warning to the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a right-wing division would automatically benefit the left .	-3.7205
What does Le Pen do with its newly gained popularity under the white French of the working class ?	-3.7304
It would like to use next year 's EU elections to forge an anti-EU , anti-common currency bloc in the European Parliament .	-2.9186
If the anti-EU parties do well in these elections – and this is very possible – then for the first time such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament .	-3.8858
This is the point I want to make : in the not too distant future , the growing resentment against the EU and the single currency will come together to abolish the euro .	-2.9701
The EU will not disappear , but it will become more like the “ Europe of ( sovereign ) nations ” that General de Gaulle favored .	-2.3344
Germany and some of its satellite economies may hold the euro , but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies .	-2.6235
I expect Britain to dissociate itself from this project in the hope of flattering with the US .	-3.7354
But Washington ’ s growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain alone will stand in the Atlantic rain .	-2.2628
Where does Scotland remain in all this ?	-2.4326
We can decide to be a region of ( last consequence ) small England .	-3.1567
Or we can defend our own economic interests – which includes saying Berlin and Brussels what they can hide .	-3.3316
I suspect that Scotland could go very well in a looser European association if we keep our own currency .	-4.1540
Cooperation with other similar countries is easier in an unfederated Europe of nations .	-1.8027
Otherwise , we should consider equating it to Norway and maintaining our economic independence .	-2.8582
The SNP government in Scotland is – remarkably – the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe , and won a spectacular majority in 2011 , owing to the rejection of the proposed ( and made ) cuts to which Labour finance minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory Lib to the coalition were responsible .	-4.2269
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to choose independence now only to impose austerity on Berlin and Brussels .	-3.0161
Early Puberty : Faster Adults	-2.7700
African-American and Hispanic girls tend to achieve puberty rather than their white co-workers , as investigations show .	-4.1844
Physical change does not mean immediate puberty .	-2.6533
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible .	-1.4884
Experts believe that epidemic obesity is a trigger of early puberty .	-1.7019
The trend towards early puberty is less pronounced among boys	-1.8738
The former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in child health and family topics .	-2.5218
Should a mother be worried if her daughter already grows breasts and shame hairs at the age of seven or eight ?	-3.1509
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics , this week in Orlando , Florida , the paediatric endocrinology Dr. Paul Kaplowitz declared that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and were a new standard . the .	-14.3275
“ I spend a lot of time reassuring parents – normally this is not an indication that puberty is now fast , ” explained Kaplowitz .	-4.6709
Obvious indications of development , such as growing breasts , shame and axle hairs and body smell , are shown in girls earlier .	-4.7829
Nevertheless , there was only a slight shift in the age of the menarch ( occurrence of the first bleeding ) over the last 40 years .	-4.5756
In the United States , the average age is 12.5 years , slightly less than 12.75 in 1970 .	-1.8845
“ When the development of breasts begins , it takes at least two to three years to reach the Menarch , ” said Kaplowitz , also author of the book “ Early Puberty among girls : The essential advisor to dealing with this frequently occurring problem . ” . the the , the the the . the the the , the the	-11.7151
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty progresses .	-2.2673
It is controversial what is actually the beginning of puberty , but it is “ early ” when breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth boost of eight years ago .	-4.9719
In most cases , the process slows or stagnates – something that a paediatrician can monitor closely .	-3.0734
In the event of faster progress , tests may be displayed by an endicronologist to avoid serious problems such as tumors or cysts .	-4.2494
There are treatment methods for delaying an early menstruation and defending another consequence : the premature ageing of bones , which can ultimately lead to growth impediment and thus small body growth in adults .	-12.9953
The recommendations for medical or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child , the speed of development , the growth rate and the emotional maturity .	-3.1804
Psychosocial aspects are also important .	-1.0329
Kaplowitz is cautious about drugs , but he acknowledges : “ Suppressing puberty can mitigate behavioral problems and girls ’ feelings , unlike their age co-workers . ”	-5.5583
The other major problem is understandable : parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have the period .	-1.8479
“ They worry about the risk of pregnancy or how they handle the hygiene side , ” said Kaplowitz .	-3.2686
“ It was a shock , ” a woman remembers , whose daughter received ten days .	-3.8923
Although there were first signs and we had talked about menstruation , it was not emotionally prepared .	-3.1047
She came home frightened and excited from school because she was the first in her circle of friends .	-3.1610
There are many comprehensively published theories about the causes of early puberty . . the .	-9.5636
But there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other food , chemicals in the environment , or sexual messages in the media would be caused .	-3.0339
Boys come to puberty similar to girls in the past . . . . the . the . the . the . the .	-10.3064
Kaplowitz believes that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of obesity .	-1.8844
He supported the conduct of a study in 2001 on girls aged six to nine , which establishes a link between body fat and admission to puberty .	-3.8632
Other investigations support this conclusion , but there are many other factors that played a role .	-2.2825
In that country , African and Hispanic girls tend to achieve puberty rather than their white fellow women .	-3.6910
There are different explanations for this .	-2.3163
Globally , early puberty seems to be influenced by all kinds of things , from economic conditions to climate to genes .	-10.0337
Another puzzle : Although boys have grown the face and shame hair before , the trend towards a full-scale earlier puberty is not as strong as girls .	-5.0299
Other doctors at the AAP conference highlighted the complexity of the issue .	-1.9850
The appearance of acne and shame hair is widespread even in babies and infants .	-3.2534
“ We need to be careful about how we identify the true beginning of puberty , ” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman , a paediatric endocrinology at Goryeb Children 's Hospital in Morristown , New Jersey .	-2.9611
Parents should not hesitate to be advised by their doctor on how to talk to their child .	-3.1753
“ This can mean that you have to talk earlier than expected , ” Kaplowitz advised .	-4.2145
If you stay calm , the child normally reacts well .	-3.2534
Girls who flourish early need the insurance that the process is a normal part of life , even if it occurs earlier than intended .	-3.3571
Jumbo manufacturers argue over seat width in the face of large orders	-2.8798
There has been a discussion between leading aircraft manufacturers about the width of tourist seats on long-haul flights , which sets the tone for a bitter clash at the Dubai Airshow this month .	-4.5768
The dispute revolves around the range of seats offered to passengers on long flights in the tourist class – not always those who are most concerned about airlines , but this designated space is the key to asserting efficiency in the latest aircraft from Airbus SAS and Boeing Co . .	-6.6029
This week , Airbus demanded an industry standard that requires a seat width of at least 46 cm ( 18 inches ) in the tourist class , but the US archrival Boeing says that the airlines should decide .	-4.2704
The discussion comes at a time when aircraft manufacturers are competing to sell even larger versions of their twin-engine long-haul aircraft and expect record orders at the event from 17 to 21 November .	-4.4689
How the rear part of the aircraft is designed – especially whether there are nine or ten seats – is crucial to the economic results that the new “ mini-jumbo ” design is supposed to deliver . the the the the aircraft .	-10.0195
Boeing claims that his modernized “ 777X ” holds 406 people in tourist class seats , which are more than 17 inches wide , allowing ten per row .	-4.8597
Airbus declares that the competitive version of the A350 carries 350 people in 18 inch wide seats in the tourist class , with nine per row .	-3.5703
Aircraft giants often share bends on technical details through advertising in the specialist press .	-4.3553
Now Airbus appeals directly to the public before the Dubai Airshow , where the 777X with over 100 orders is expected to make the race .	-3.6367
Recently , the company presented an advertisement that could be the beginning of a new advertising war , showing donors a picture of three people squeezed together in a restaurant , and the title : “ Would you accept that ? ”	-5.5177
“ Boeing proposes long-haul flights in seats closer than regional turbo props , ” says Airbus head of sales John Leahy .	-3.2564
Given changes in food habits , people are becoming thicker , but aircraft seats have not changed radically .	-3.7321
Between the early 1970s , when the Boeing 747 defined the modern long-haul journey , and the end of the century , the weight of the male average American between 40 and 49 years increased by 10 % , according to the US Department of Health .	-8.9369
The male average American waist in the 21st century is 100.8 cm according to US health statistics .	-3.4614
Airbus says that its rival adhered to a seating concept from the 1950s , when the average body of the freshly baptized “ Jet Set ” was narrow.	-4.4202
According to Airbus , investigations were carried out that an additional customs ( 2.54 cm ) per seat increased sleeping quality by 53 percent .	-3.9874
Boeing disputes the Airbus figures for the seats and says that it is not at the discretion of manufacturers to decide how airlines can balance flight tariffs and facilities .	-5.3086
The company also explains that , according to investigations , the experience on the plane depends on more than the seat width .	-9.4855
“ It really amounts to giving airlines flexibility so that they can do what they think they need to be successful , ” explains the aircraft cabin expert Kent Craver von Boeing .	-4.1108
They do not want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable . .	-2.0229
They know their business better than anyone else .	-1.5619
For passengers , it is about more elbow freedom , but for manufacturers it is becoming an increasingly important issue that can affect sales .	-4.7772
Behind the battle is a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least $ 700 billion after list prices in the coming decades , which could have a lasting impact on the US or Europe export balance .	-4.1510
As Reuters reported for the first time in July , the seat layout is the driving force behind the discussion about the new jets .	-2.7720
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 % more efficiency per seat in their latest twin-engine long-range designs than the market leader in this segment , the 365-seat Boeing 77-300ER .	-3.0884
Boeing 's statements on the results depend partly on the 777X being compared to the original design of nine seats in the 777 .	-4.5567
The increased cost per unit is still lower than the current machines with ten seats per row .	-3.5899
“ Boeing thus quetches more seats into its aircraft to make it more competitive to our products , ” says Kevin Keniston , Head of Passenger Comfort at the European Airbus .	-3.6346
On the other hand , analysts say that full cabins with ten seats per row on existing 777s suggested that many passengers decided to arrange more closely , which could be accompanied by cheaper fares .	-5.4121
“ Eighteen customs seats would be great for passengers , but the reality is : from an economic point of view , the Airbus offer is controlled by the 777 threat , ” says Mary Kirby , expert for cabin facilities , founder and editor of Runway Girl Network .	-4.0940
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats , but a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose .	-2.8009
The world-travelling jet sellers even carry bandmass to measure the equipment at the competition .	-5.4848
Even if they offer comfort , all manufacturers also offer jets with highly compressed design for low-cost airlines and regional flights .	-4.1041
Airbus has a ten-seat A350 , but has not sold anyone according to its own statement .	-5.0076
Until recently , Airbus has stressed the importance of increasing cabin adaptability and offering wide seats for some jets at the corridors .	-4.1256
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets , experts say that the call for a new industry standard would probably be pushed out , but could distract from the wave of 777X sales .	-4.3558
New anti-nicotine vaccine could make the pleasure of smoking a crack out of smo.	-13.8205
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could spoil the fun of smoking .	-2.0505
A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice from nicotine addiction for life .	-2.5993
Prior to human testing , further attempts are needed , which may take some years , but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said that the first results are good .	-4.2330
“ We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can help once millions of smokers who have tried to stop trying all the methods available on the market , but have experienced that their nicotine addiction is stronger than those approaches , ” Cornell said .	-4.3311
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus , which has been changed so that it contains genetic information on the production of nicotine antibodies .	-3.1739
The virus selectively infects the liver cells , which then produce a permanent flow of antibodies .	-2.2863
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain , so a smoker does not experience nicotine high .	-3.5772
In trials , vaccinated mice that nicotine was administered retained its normal level of activity .	-3.6898
Mouse without vaccination , on the other hand , would have taken a “ time out , ” explained the researchers , a sign that the nicotine had reached its brain .	-11.2393
The experiments are described in the Science Translational Medicine .	-2.2972
Former tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies .	-1.6160
The vaccines had to be given so often to maintain the antibodily level that they were expensive and impractical .	-3.0804
But the costs of the new vaccine are probably much lower , because it transforms liver cells into antibody factories .	-2.7598
As Professor Crystal said , a future vaccine could be administered for people , if it is quite certain , before they were tempted to try a cigarette , thereby preventing nicotine addiction .	-3.9258
More likely , smokers would use it to stop .	-2.1380
“ They know then : when they start smoking again , they no longer feel pleasure because of the nicotine vaccine , and that helps them to save the habit , ” he explains .	-5.5284
British scientists said that the results were interesting , but at the same time warned that further research was needed .	-2.5502
Tripodi denied having been influenced by Obeid	-2.1888
An investigation is being launched against the former minister of the New South Wales Laboratory Party Joe Tripodi .	-3.6150
The former NSW Minister denies that he has changed the maritime leasing arrangements at the request of his political mentor , Eddie Obeid , who owned hidden participations in three plots in state-controlled land .	-5.5301
On Friday , the Independent Commission Against Corruption ( ICAC <unk> Independent Commission against Corruption ) extended its investigations into whether Obeid has influenced various Ministers of State to extend letter contracts at the Circular Quay , where the Obeids operate two restaurants and a café without calling for tenders after their expiry in August 2005 .	-5.4529
Now it is determined that Tripodi knew of Obeid ’ s hidden interest in the land after Tripodi ’ s former Deputy Chief of Staff Lynne Ashpole announced on Thursday .	-5.7499
In years of talks that began in 2005 , the government had pressed for public tenders for the leased contracts .	-3.8842
The runners were opposed to this and also wanted to run for longer periods . . the . the the . the the . the the	-10.9884
In 2009 , the lending contracts for companies at Circular Quay , which contributed $ 2.5 million annually to Obeids , were extended without public tendering .	-5.4316
Tripodi , who was Harbour Minister from February 2006 to November 2009 , originally spoke in favour of public tenders .	-3.0360
But he denied that he had made the changes at Obeid ’ s request , which , as Tripodi confirmed , had pressed for a reorganization of the government ’ s guard rules .	-6.2933
One of the ICAC ’ s telephone records showed talks from August and September 2007 between Obeid , Tripodi and Steve Dunn , a senior official who had moved to the port ministry after working under obedience in the fishing authority .	-4.8127
“ Was the topic discussed in these telephone calls the preparation of commercial leasing rules ? ” asked Vice-Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi .	-4.6966
“ No , ” Tripodi replied .	-1.4956
I cannot remember what was discussed , but that was definitely not .	-2.2813
Certainly not between me and Mr Obeid .	-2.2139
Israeli combat aircraft attack target in Syria , so official sources	-2.4319
Israeli hunting aircraft would have attacked Thursday night a target in the Syrian port of Latakia , confirmed a senior government official to Fox News .	-3.6372
The official did not explain what the objective was , but said that it was at least one .	-2.8603
According to Associated Press , the target was Russian SA-125 missiles .	-1.7914
At least twice this year , Israel has already carried out air strikes on rocket deliveries in Syria .	-2.4536
Foreign workers with 457 visas could be subjected to “ authenticity testing ”	-12.7497
The government is considering , as part of extended measures , a “ authenticity test ” for foreign workers with 457 visas .	-3.3435
Should the test be introduced , it would be used by a criterion to prevent the 457 from being used to occupy unqualified jobs or as a back door for family and friends to Australia .	-11.1440
Today , a government proposal for discussion was published after former Laboratory MEPs , Maxine McKew , condemned the government 's comments on foreign workers , because they could be seen as insults by the neighbours of Australia . the the the . the , the the the the the . the the , the the the	-11.7705
“ Volume explanations such as “ foreigners should hire behind – and , Australians first hire – are a very unpleasant retreat in times when trade unions demanded a protected labour market , ” she said to the Australia India Institute today .	-5.8971
Historically , that meant that white workers should be protected – and if some in the region suggest an echo of this historic artifact , I would not be surprised .	-4.0561
The proposal for a debate covers twelve measures which were once thought out by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen .	-4.3726
Immigration Minister Brendan O 'Connor , who visited Sri Lanka yesterday for talks on human smuggling , implemented five of the recommended changes , and the others are still being considered .	-3.9319
If the “ authenticity criterion ” is adopted , then someone who applies for a visa could be checked whether “ the application is real in cases where the applicant is related or personally associated with the supporting company ’ s holder or relevant person . ”	-5.2622
Companies could also be obliged to account for the number of 457 visa holders , after in the past , companies that initially wanted to support only a small number of workers have finally hired hundreds .	-4.3195
Meanwhile , a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker probably died from a heart attack after arriving this week with a refugee boat on the Christmas island .	-3.7278
The disturbed nine-year-old son of the man who had come with him to Australia has been served by an adult cousin since his father died on Wednesday , who was also on the boat .	-17.7894

A study has been announced by the British Government to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland .	-10.0409
HS2 Ltd 's work proposes that high-speed connections between Scotland and the north of England should be implemented as early as Phase 1 in 2026 .	-4.4989
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said that the project ‘ will bring Britain closer together ’ .	-2.2082
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was very pleased to work with the British Government on this plan .	-2.5858
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail connection between London and the West Midlands .	-2.0736
After Phase 2 , there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds .	-2.5957
In June , the government corrected the estimated cost of building the high-speed road between London and Northern England from <unk> 32.7 billion to <unk> 42.6 billion .	-10.2294
The British Government , which is in talks with Transport Scotland , has commissioned HS2 Ltd to seek further route capacity and travel time improvements for North England and Scotland .	-4.1383
This includes the possibility of a travel time of three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London .	-3.1287
Baroness Kramer said : “ Our goal for HS2 is a truly national route network that brings Britain and its cities closer together . ”	-2.1727
We are proceeding with HS2 because it brings enormous benefits .	-2.8882
Without it , we are facing a capacity crisis in our railway network .	-2.2534
But it is also about connecting 18 British cities , including Glasgow and Edinburgh , which are improved thanks to HS2 .	-9.9407
The Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael commented : “ Today ’ s announcement is good news for Scotland . ”	-1.8190
On behalf of the Scottish Government , Keith Brown Carmichael called for “ unequivocal ” commitment to Scottish integration into the HS2 network .	-2.9609
Brown said , “ The high-speed railway connection has the potential for enormous economic benefits for Scotland , but at the same time Scotland ’ s economic power provides an argument for rapid railway connections across the United Kingdom . the the the . the rathe the the the the . the the the the the	-11.1766
That is why we are pleased to work as a partner of the British Government and to investigate the options for high-speed rail links in Scotland , which creates benefits for all and complements the Glasgow-Edinburgh link , which the Scottish Government is already planning .	-4.5879
I look forward to examining the investigation report with the British ministers next year and to jointly adopting the next steps .	-3.4101
Regulations on electronic equipment in aircraft remain in force for the time being in Australia	-2.7369
Australian air passengers must continue to shut down tablets and smartphones when they start and land , despite efforts in the US to relax regulations on such equipment .	-4.1441
The US Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) allows US airlines to change their requirements so that passengers can read , view or play videos on their devices during critical flight phases , provided they are in “ flight mode . ”	-4.3075
During most of the flight , passengers are allowed to do so , but many people find it annoying that they are not allowed to read their e-books when they start and land .	-4.4545
Australian companies observe the decision to implement which US airlines have to do a huge amount of work , but do not pursue direct plans to change their rules .	-5.1665
The CASA Aviation Safety Authority also stated that the announcement will be looked at , but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic equipment remain in force during critical flight periods in Australia .	-5.4495
“ CASA currently has no specific regulations concerning the use of electronic equipment in the aircraft , ” has been announced .	-4.1746
The subject is subject to provisions stating that airlines must maintain safety at all times and passengers must follow the safety instructions given by cabin staff .	-4.3661
Virgin has already held talks with the CASA about extending the use of its Wi-Fi entertainment system to flights and declares that it is open to change , but it should be initiated by the legislator .	-5.6853
“ We would welcome a review of CASA ’ s licensing of electronic devices , because we are convinced that this would improve the customer ’ s experience after we now offer ( wireless entertainment ) during the flight , ” said a spokesman .	-4.2495
Qantas explained that the current rules will remain in place until further notice .	-4.0503
“ Our current guidelines stipulate that electronic devices cannot be used when starting and landing , and we currently have no plans to change that , ” the company explained .	-4.5698
The FAA regulations apply to US airlines .	-1.6717
However , we are always interested in developments in regulations that can benefit passengers and will certainly look closely at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it .	-3.8994
The decision differs from US companies according to the age of the fleet .	-3.8370
They must prove that their aircraft can tolerate radio disruptions by mobile devices , and change manuals , training materials , hand baggage programs and customer instructions .	-10.0372
“ After an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet , it can allow passengers to use portable , lighter electronic devices such as tablets , e-book readers , and smartphones at any height , ” the FAA announced .	-3.9667
In rare cases in bad view , the crew will instruct passengers to turn off the equipment during the landing .	-4.9420
The group also recommended that heavier devices be stowed safely under the seat or in the subjects over the seats when starting and landing .	-5.4074
Before the Revierderby versus Schalke , BVB trailers with lighting rockets had taken care of ugly scenes in the Veltins arena . the the the . , the the , , , the the the . , , the , , , , the	-16.7684
Borussia Dortmund then announced tough consequences .	-1.7046
Before the Friday match of the Bundesliga football league against the VfB Stuttgart , the ultras responded with a silence - first .	-3.9124
It was an unusual , almost spectacular acoustic that offered the viewer until shortly before the federal league game began to appear between the German vice champion Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart in the Signal Iduna Park .	-5.4105
The guest fans with their songs were mainly listened to .	-4.3842
The South Gallery , on the other hand , where the most loyal and loyal BVB fans stand , presented themselves extraordinarily quiet : no songs , no slaughter calls .	-6.0866
The podium of the capo , which otherwise coordinates the joint firing , remained unoccupied .	-3.3123
And at the front of the gallery lonely blew a big flag called " Stadium Ban Section " .	-5.9419
Only as a goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller as always the first BVB player to enter the place , burned short-term cheer .	-5.7441
When his team colleagues followed , there were loud songs and floating scarves - but far from everywhere .	-4.3517
There was nothing exciting in the central blocks 12 and 13 of the South Gallery .	-3.5342
Also that stadium spokesman Norbert Dickel once again listed the positive experiences of the last few days - Derby victory , victory over Arsenal , extension of the contract of coach Jürgen Klopp - did not make for a celebration .	-5.6996
Only five minutes before the hit , the Capo took his podium - and the tangible tension so far became apparent in a loud cry , when thickness as usual queried the mood on the ranks in the stadium .	-8.7373
Last but not least , the South Gallery was on the line - and finally here , as usual , was the loudest place in the stadium .	-6.6694
And at the latest when the southern gallery took the vocal call " Derbysieger stands up " , everything was as always .	-6.6000
The silence before was probably a response to what has happened in recent days .	-3.0698
Just before revierderby at FC Schalke 04 , some of the BVB trailers had fired lighting missiles into the audience racks and on the square - almost goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller hit .	-7.0725
The game was late attacked because of the chaotic scenes .	-2.5625
BVB-Boss Hans-Joachim Watzke received the heads of the Dortmund Ultras in his office - and if you think Watzke 's words , this was a rather uncomfortable appointment for the fan representatives .	-12.6552
" There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra movement , " the BVB boss announced on Thursday evening at a panel discussion in Frankfurt .	-2.8617
As an immediate measure , Watzke forbidden Ultras a choreography for the home game against VfB Stuttgart .	-10.4346
" I have banned this , " he said .	-3.1527
We cannot give up the zero tolerance policy on pyrotechnics .	-1.9787
Moreover , the ultras have been shown various possibilities of punishment - until Tuesday they have time to choose one .	-10.6986
Otherwise , Watzke said , the BVB will impose a sanction by the end of next week .	-2.2713
" This becomes incisive " , insured Watzke .	-3.2485
We can look forward to hearing the reactions in the South Gallery .	-4.6675
Pfandhouses are booming in Singapore , as the middle class crisis has arrived .	-2.6445
In a deposit house in the Bendemeer Shopping Centre in Singapore , Janani Amirthalinga exchanges a golden arm ripe , a ring and a pair of earrings to pay the school fees of her daughters . a . a , , or a , , , , or a , , , , , , , or , , , , ,	-14.6765
“ My husband and I just bought a house , there is all my money in it , ” says Amirthalinga .	-3.2960
Although she earns 3,000 Singapore dollars every month ( about € 1,730 ) as an administrative officer and her husband also worked , her monthly family income is not enough , she explains .	-4.9350
Indeed , demand in parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt is increasing – is so great that ValueMax , where she has exchanged it , this week became the third deposit house listed on the Singapore stock exchange .	-9.7811
Jewelry pledging is not only a fast way to get money – $ 1,300 in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also almost as favorable as unsecured bank loans .	-3.4451
Typically , deposit houses in Singapore require an effective annual interest rate of 17 % , just above the 15.4 % required by the United Overseas Bank , a local lender with a branch in the same shopping centre .	-3.6663
Pfandhouses , however , offer the advantage that there is no need to check creditworthiness or income proof , which is why loans are possible more quickly than in banks .	-5.6565
For this reason , millions of people in the region are turning to deposits , as families feel the pressure from rising living costs and increasing household and consumer debt .	-11.9595
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis , and cheap loans due to loose fiscal policies in the advanced economies , lower and middle-income families are seeking deposits to compensate for the difference in the devastating economy .	-5.0994
This week , the rating agency Standard & Poor 's growing budget debt , mainly due to rising mortgages , called a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks .	-3.3825
According to the Agency , Malaysia , Thailand , and Singapore have the highest budget debt in Asia relative to GDP .	-3.2028
Malaysia , with 80 % of GDP , is at the top of the list , a 60 % increase in 2008 .	-2.8741
Economists are also worried about the high consumer debt in Thailand , which this week has just emerged from a technical recession .	-3.1559
On Thursday , the data showed continued export weakness and a reduction in consumer demand .	-2.8792
“ In the end , this means that , given rising costs , people in the middle to lower segments ( the income scale ) will try to supplement their income wherever possible , ” says Song Seng Wun , economist at CIMB , a Malaysian bank .	-3.6802
Historical highs in gold prices over the past two years have reinforced the trend towards pledging personal objects , as people use the opportunity to turn family jewellery into cash .	-4.2647
In Singapore , about 70 % of the pledged objects are in the 200 deposits of the city state of Gold .	-3.7525

The largest Thai depository operator , EasyMoney , has experienced 20 % growth in its branches in recent months .	-3.5478
Growth in the deposit business is so strong that ValueMax , operator of the branch in Bendemeer and 15 others in Singapore , wants to expand not only to neighboring Malaysia – where the company operates four houses – but also outside Asia , says Yeah Lee Ching , Managing Director of ValueMax .	-4.1998
The company finances this with 60 % of the Singapore $ 66 million it took this week with the Singapore stock exchange .	-4.6940
While some lenders were crusaded for high interest rates , Yeah explains that depositors not only offered cheaper interest rates than other lenders , but also did not directly raise debt .	-4.9069
“ Customers lend items they already possess , and the liquefying of personal value does not increase household debt , ” she explains .	-4.5476
Pfand-lending is increasingly accepted socially as short-term , secured financing .	-3.6258
Nor are all people who use deposit bonds in financial difficulties .	-2.9509
Rich people from Singapore also come to the branches of ValueMax to pledge gold bars and Rolex watches , for which they receive up to 60 % of the purchase price in cash .	-3.0408
Customers come to us from every social class .	-3.2635
“ This includes wealthy people who borrow in the short term for a business or investment , or small businesses that have to bridge bottlenecks in cash flow , ” Yeah says .	-5.3610

Rescue package over $ 325 million for Tasmanian Health	-3.3008
The Australian Government insists on the harsh conditions associated with the rescue package of more than $ 325 million for Tasmania ’ s health care to ensure that the government of the federal state cannot waste the money .	-3.9570
Federal Minister for Health , Tanya Plibersek , has announced that the Commonwealth will take “ immediate action ” to avert a crisis caused by an ageing population of the island state , a higher rate of chronic diseases and system restrictions . .	-8.8423
The funding for a four-year period was decided after government consultations with the independent Tasmanian Member , Andrew Wilkie .	-4.0968
“ The government has launched an emergency rescue package that , in our view , addresses the unique challenges facing the federal state , ” said Plibersek today .	-3.3587
The $ 325 million package includes $ 31 million emergency aid for electoral services .	-3.2234
Other 2600 operations , including orthopedic interventions and treatments due to grey star , are intended to eliminate residues .	-4.5435
Furthermore , there is money for daily hospitals in Hobart and Launceston , better aftercare for stationary stays , specialist training , mental health services and the introduction of a system for electronic recording of health data in local hospitals .	-4.0967
“ These investments correspond to the ideas that affected clinic workers have told me that they are the best way to improve the Tasmanian healthcare system , ” said Tanya Pliberse.	-4.0896
The Minister insisted on the Tasmanian Government 's strict reporting and accountability .	-2.7533
The federal state must maintain the current level of financing in order to receive money from the Commonwealth and report monthly on where the additional funds were spent .	-4.3564
A three-member Commission will be set up to ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible .	-3.3450
As Wilkie explained today , the $ 325 million would benefit little if “ they were not accompanied by genuine reforms that push the Tasmanian public health system on a more sustainable path . ”	-9.5836
Nevertheless , he praised the government for responding to its request for urgent assistance , which he first expressed to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May .	-3.5390
“ I am confident that federal aid will make a major contribution to removing the state ’ s public health system from the worry list , ” said Wilkie .	-3.3756
According to the government of the federal state , these elections will largely compensate for the recent cuts .	-3.0157
But the opposition ’ s health policy spokesman at the federal level , Peter Dutton , believes that today ’ s announcement is only a “ paving solution . ”	-3.3786
“ We are in a position today because the Labor State Government has withdrawn $ 430 million from the health system , ” he said to ABC TV .	-10.2683
It is unacceptable that a state government is putting almost half a billion dollars out of the system , and that the Commonwealth is 300 million , and then pretend that good news is .	-6.3522
Dutton called on Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the bailout is spent on additional bureaucracy .	-2.8084

Syria has destroyed its ability to produce chemical weapons , such as a monitoring group .	-8.3110
Syria destroyed important facilities for the production of chemical weapons and gas ammunition , the Global Chemical Weapons Monitoring Group declared on Thursday , while in the north of the country there was serious clashes near one of the sites where toxic substances are allegedly stored .	-5.4135
A Syrian activist group also announced on Thursday that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the civil war began three years ago .	-3.1675
The announcement of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons ( OPCW ) came one day before the deadline .	-3.3322
1 November , the Damascus organization based in The Hague set up to destroy or “ inoperable ” all facilities for the production of chemical weapons , including all machines for mixing chemicals into toxic gas and filling ammunition .	-4.6175
The completion of this process , which is basically the first stage of destruction , is an important milestone of an ambitious timetable aimed at destroying all Syrian chemical weapons by mid-2014 .	-3.0526
The destruction of the facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons .	-2.0198
However , Damascus must begin to destroy existing weapons and stocks .	-2.7463
According to assumptions , there are about 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons in the country , including senfgas and nerve gas Sarin .	-4.0245
The announcement came at a time when fighting in the city of Safira took place on Thursday , when experts said that there was a production facility for chemical weapons and storage facilities , as the Syrian Human Rights Observatory , based in the United Kingdom , announced . the the . the the the , the the the . the the the , the the the the	-11.4853
On Thursday , the group of activists who persecute the number of deaths through a network of activists in Syria declared that 120,296 people died .	-4.3949
Of this , 61,067 are civilians , including 6,365 children .	-8.0134
On the government side , 29,954 of them belonged to President Bashar Assad ’ s army , 18,678 are pro-government fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militias .	-7.5286
Also among the dead are 2,202 deserted army soldiers and 5,375 opposition fighters , many of them foreigners .	-2.1581
On 25 July , the UN estimated the number of deaths in this conflict since March 2011 to 100,000 .	-2.0844
This number has not been updated so far .	-1.7824
The conflict has forced around two million people to flee the country .	-2.2983
Assad ’ s troops have been fighting for weeks in Safira against the rebels , many of whom have connections to al-Qaeda groups .	-3.0125
The Observatory said that there were losses on both sides on Thursday , but no details were mentioned .	-9.2867
The fighting underlines the danger posed by the chemical weapons inspectors , because their mission to liberate Syria from its toxic weapons arsenal is a race against time in the midst of a raging civil war .	-4.4755
According to the OPCW , which is working closely with the United Nations , the team is “ now convinced that it has seen all the important production and mixing / filling facilities mentioned by Syria and has experienced their destruction . ”	-4.1966
Therefore , “ no further inspection activities are planned at the moment . ” . the .	-4.3594
Earlier this week , the inspectors explained that they had completed the first round of checks and visited 21 out of 23 of the sites specified by Damascus .	-3.8660
Because of security concerns , the visit of two institutions was not possible , the inspectors said .	-3.3983
On Thursday , the OPWC declared that the two sites had “ been abandoned , according to Syria ’ s statement , and the existing objects of the chemical weapons programme had been relocated to other mentioned facilities that were inspected . ”	-5.3582
It was not immediately clear whether the Safira site was one of the two facilities that the OPCW inspectors could not visit .	-2.6860
Syria has presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons , which must be approved next month by the OPWC Executive Committee .	-8.4624
“ I take care of the bravery and the courage that you have shown all in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever carried out by this organization , ” said Ahmed Uzumcu , the Director-General of the Supervisory Organization , in a comment published by OPCW .	-4.5145
For three years now , the mainly Sunni Muslim rebels in this civil war have been fighting Assad ’ s government and its security forces , many of which belong to the Alawites , a secession of Shia Islam .	-4.3177
With regard to further developments , the head of the observatory , Rami Abdurrahman , said that on Wednesday there was a strong explosion in an air defence facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia .	-3.7530
The cause of the explosion is not known , he explained .	-2.2490
Anger at the Bali Bomb Leg	-4.9661
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who died in 2002 in the bombing in Bali reacted angry at the judgment for the last of the inciters to be brought to justice , as Umar Patek believes that they should be shot by law .	-6.5585
Patek , who was one of the most sought after people in Southeast Asia for almost ten years , was sentenced to a sentence of 20 years for his role in building explosives for the bombing .	-4.9445
It could be made redundant after 15 years with penalties .	-4.1730
The 45-year-old was guilty of mass murder because of the attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta , where 202 people died , including 88 Australians , and many others were injured .	-3.3189
A blame was also made in a series of terrorist charges , including a wave of explosive attacks on churches in Indonesia on Holy Eve in 2000 .	-4.0607
The Public Prosecutor had demanded a lifelong sentence , even if it could have applied for the death penalty for the man who , because of his reputation as a masterly bomb builder , is also called “ Demolition Man . ”	-5.6762
The decision has raised painful memories at June Corteen , a mother from Perth who lost her 39 year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the devastation caused by Patek and his co-conspirators almost ten years ago .	-3.8173
Fighting with tears , she said that Patek should have been sentenced to death .	-2.4879
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys .	-2.0801
“ It should be put before a shooting command , ” Corteen said to AAP .	-3.7089
I have to live every day that I will not get any more grandchildren and I will never see my daughters anymore .	-4.4143
The Sari Club was equated to the ground when , on 12 October 2002 , a huge bomb exploded in a small truck that was parked before the night club .	-5.8363
Peter Hughes was in Paddy 's Bar , where only 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber exploded a backpack filled with explosives .	-2.5344
He fell into the coma for a month after the attack , and “ died ” three times , while he went to a life conservation system .	-5.0337
Hughes said that Patek deserved the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cell Jemaah Islamiah – Amrozi , Mukhlas , and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the bloodbath and executed four years ago .	-2.8044
In reality , this type should be punished above all else .	-3.8502
Leaving him alive – no , there is no reason to keep him alive .	-2.4738
It is not much to get 20 years after he killed 202 people and injured many hundreds .	-9.0162
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers to trial .	-8.4515
He escaped almost a decade of arrest , but was eventually taken up in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad in January 2011 , where US forces killed former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden just under four months later .	-3.8457
During the negotiation , an FBI agent said that intelligence reports would have indicated that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of rebuilding the link between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda .	-3.1000
“ He didn ’ t stand , ” said Corteen .	-3.0234
Until recently , he has shown no repentance for how much suffering he has caused to other people .	-3.7471
The judgment was made before the ten-year anniversary of the attack this year , which will be celebrated in Bali and Australia .	-3.2386
“ There will be many tears this year , ” said Corteen .	-1.8608
Patek may appeal against his judgment .	-2.2059
FAA : Passengers can now use electronic equipment in aircraft ( but not make mobile phone calls )	-3.1839
Air passengers can now listen to their electronic devices from departure to landing for reading , work , games , music and use the reputation of movies , but not by phone , such as the new guidelines issued by the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) in the United States on Thursday .	-5.1568
But passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately .	-1.3135
How quickly they would be implemented depended on the respective airline , FAA staff Michael Huerta explained at a press conference .	-3.1328
The airlines must demonstrate to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated the aircraft ’ s training manuals and the regulations for restoring the equipment in accordance with the new regulations .	-4.7765
The FAA stated that it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic equipment in aircraft .	-3.4009
Among these airlines were also Delta and JetBlue .	-1.8908
“ Depending on the state of the plan , we could approve the extended use of electronic devices very soon , ” the FAA announced in a statement .	-3.7687
Currently , passengers must disable smartphones , tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed .	-2.7062
They may not restart them until the aircraft has reached a height of three kilometres and the captain has the green light .	-4.3952
When entering the landing flight , passengers must disable them again and must not restart them before the plane has landed .	-13.5420
According to the new guidelines , airlines whose aircraft are secured against electronic disturbances could allow their passengers to use the equipment even when starting , landing and rolling , the FAA declared .	-4.7535
Most new traffic aircraft and other aircraft converted to larger heights for the use of Wi-Fi should meet the criteria .	-3.9003
Laura Glading , president of the professional cabin , welcomed the changes .	-2.8322
“ If the new regulation is safely implemented – and we work closely with the airline in this regard – both sides will benefit from it , ” commented Glading .	-3.4345
We are honestly sorry to have to feel like watchdogs on this issue .	-3.2319
Nevertheless , Internet connections to surf , exchange of e-mails , text messages or downloading data under three kilometres remained prohibited , the authority explained .	-14.0109
Passengers are required to move smartphones , tablets and other devices into flight mode .	-3.0159
So still not a “ Words With Friends ” , the Scrabble similar online game that the actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 , when he had to leave a jet from American Airlines in public effect because he refused to turn off the device while the aircraft was parked at the border .	-5.4549
And heavier equipment such as laptops must continue to be stored , as there is a risk of injury if they fly through the cabin .	-4.4134
Mobile calls during the flight are also still prohibited .	-3.3766
The regulatory competence for telephone calls lies with the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) , not with the FAA .	-2.4152
FAA may lift a ban on certain electronic devices at start and landing	-3.0020
Last month , Mark Rosenker said by the National Transportation Safety Board , security experts on national transport issues on CBS news , mobile phones would still be considered a risk .	-3.8173
“ Mobile phones are really a problem , not only because they could potentially cause disturbances in navigation devices , but because we know from the FCC that the transmission from the air can also interfere with transmitting masts , ” says Rosenker .	-5.2257
A consultancy committee of the industry created by the FAA to investigate this issue recommended last month that the government permitted a wider use of personal electronic equipment .	-4.7135
In recent years , pressure on the FAA has increased to relax restrictions on use .	-2.5732
Critics such as the democratic senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri believe that there are no valid security reasons for the ban .	-3.0893
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to impose because the use of the equipment has become ubiquitous .	-3.6157
Some studies mention that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore the disabling of the device .	-4.2208
In 1966 , the FAA began to restrict the use of electronic devices by air travellers , after reports of disturbances of navigation and communication devices by passenger-carried UKW radios that were the latest technology trend .	-6.0053
New aircraft are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft , but they are also designed and approved by the FAA that they do not constitute electronic interferences .	-3.6968
Airlines have been providing passengers with Wi-Fi for several years when the airline is up .	-5.2573
The flyers adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also more insensitive to interferences .	-2.8041
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for greater use of electronic equipment under the new directives , said Huerta .	-2.9009
Today ’ s electronic devices generally produce much less radio than previous generations .	-3.2004
E-readers , for example , only give minimal radiation when you flip around .	-4.5757
But when downloading or sending data , the transmission values are stronger .	-2.6091
Amazon.com is one of the advocates of relaxing restrictions on the use of devices by passengers .	-12.1779
In 2011 , company employees invited a passenger aircraft full of Kindle E-Reader and made a test flight to identify problems , but could not detect them .	-4.3261
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using devices .	-2.6509
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said that he believed that the disruption by the devices was real , even if the risk is minimal .	-4.2910
Other committee members said that there are only a few pilot reports that talk about aircraft systems being disrupted by the equipment , and most of them are very old .	-5.4819
However , the Committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to arrange for passenger switching off devices when they land instruments under poor visibility .	-5.7869
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and described them as a reasonable adaptation for travellers , who are now fully equipped with technology .	-4.4178
“ We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not at odds with safety , ” said Roger Dow , CEO of the U.S. Travel Association . the the the the the . the the the the the the the . the the the	-10.0309
Birds rescued by air rescue service from North Sea drilling island released again .	-3.9881
A bird flown by air rescue service to the coast , which had been exhausted on a North Sea drilling island , was returned to nature .	-4.5286
The watertrall was flown last month with a helicopter to Aberdeen , where the Scottish Animal Welfare Organization SPCA stuffed it into their rescue centre in Alloa .	-6.0031
Colin Seddon , Head of the Centre , said : “ This watertrall was probably a winter migratory bird from northern Europe stopped by the strong winds above the North Sea . ”	-9.3744
Apparently , the exhausted bird sought refuge on the drilling island .	-2.7222
He added : “ He could no longer fly , so we were contacted with the request for help . ”	-3.2205
When they were released , the watertrall was again fit and healthy .	-3.9889
Is Europe ’ s elite ready to do business with Britain ?	-1.6725
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy together and defining what those who are providing prosperity and work in the UK want to change in our relations with the EU .	-4.3672
To this end , we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey among British economic leaders and asked them what they think about Britain , the economy , and the EU .	-2.9833
YouGov surveyed over 1,000 economic leaders , representing roughly British corporate sizes , sectors , and regions .	-4.0315
The results of the survey will surprise many .	-1.4825
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now exporting outside Europe and focusing on countries that are modernising and growing while the states in the EU are stagnating .	-3.3533
They would like to see the government favouring new trade links with countries like China , India , and Brazil , rather than staying with the long and strenuous process of reforming the obscure EU institutions .	-4.7565
Asked for their view on certain legally regulated issues – from antitrust law to product legislation – the majority of economic leaders believe that control of these key competences should be recovered to Westminster .	-4.3468
There was widespread dissatisfaction with the internal market , because , according to companies , the costs of the Brussels regulations would now outweigh the benefits of being part of Europe ’ s commercial zone – even 40 % of big companies agreed with that , which are traditionally the most pro-European .	-6.2456
Finally , and probably the most says , our survey by economic leaders revealed that a clear majority of Britain wants a course of change to the agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade , not politics .	-5.7637
This recognition , finding itself among companies of all sizes and leading corporations , shows that the economy is pushing for “ meaningful change , ” which brings the magazine of action back to Britain .	-4.9909
Much is at stake – an amendment to the agreement and better conditions for Britain would result in a referendum of 16 % in favour of remaining in the EU .	-5.0393
The Prime Minister should have no doubt : this survey shows that the British economy is behind its plan to renegotiate British conditions for EU membership .	-2.8882
It also shows that companies expect a significant shift in power relations back to Britain from renegotiation .	-3.0903
A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary , as the eurozone moves towards closer economic and fiscal union .	-2.8875
The priority must be jobs and growth in the United Kingdom , as the result of our survey shows , what more emphasis on trade and fundamental change in the Brussels approach to regulations means for businesses .	-5.0095
Alexei Miller of Gazprom refers to the pipeline in Bulgaria as the beginning of a new gas era .	-3.1996
The construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria is the start of one of the largest European energy projects , explained by the Gazprom Board .	-3.4531
“ Today ’ s event is a milestone : the construction of the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline , the largest and most important project in Europe , has begun , ” said Gazprom ’ s CEO , Alexei Miller , in a statement on Thursday .	-3.6305
The project is a key element in the energy security of the entire European continent .	-2.1695
South Stream is supposed to provide more diversity for Russia ’ s export routes across Europe .	-8.8532
A treaty dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine , where most of Russian gas is stored for Europe , increases the risk of conventional routes , as is officially heard .	-4.4462
Miller said that the direct link to Bulgaria , a member of the European Union , means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are “ forever . ”	-2.4832
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from South Stream at discounted rates when the entire project starts operating in 2015 .	-10.4334
According to Gazprom , construction works in other downstream countries will start on the planned route at the end of the year .	-3.4534
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic meters of natural gas .	-1.7303

Hearing before the Royal Commission : Two YMCA staff accused Jonathan Lord of sex offences	-2.8083
Two YMCA workers from New South Wales ( NSW ) had been charged for sexual offences related to children before , in 2011 , accusations against the child carer Jonathan Lord from Caringbah were raised , as the Royal Commission for Sexual Abuse of Children learned .	-5.3146
But in the opening declaration before the Commission , the YMCA said that ‘ there was never an incident of sexual abuse in the organization ’ .	-4.6526
Managing Director Phillip Hare was asked about a case in which a YMCA employee had been charged for infringements of child pornography , and another in which a sports teacher at the YMCA Caringbah Hall was condemned in 1991 for abuse of entrusted children .	-5.7420
Hare said Gail Furness , one of the Commission 's assisting lawyers , that he knew of the first case , but did not know the second .	-3.3116
He acknowledged that the YMCA ’ s opening declaration to the Commission was also inaccurate in claiming that “ there have been external reviews of the YMCA , in which the YMCA was recognised as the foremost front in child safety . ”	-5.4048
Instead , evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA was informed that it received the second lowest assessment of four possible in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities ( Ministry of Education ) in August of this year .	-3.6710
Hare , who started with 21 at the YMCA , acknowledged that the Management failed “ from me to downward ” to recruit Lord and did not ensure that employees were aware of their obligations to report breaches of the Child Safety Guidelines .	-5.4518
Lord was sentenced to the YMCA for sexual offences at the beginning of the year for 12 boys during his two-year activity .	-3.8305
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison .	-1.4409
Hare denied , however , that the YMCA had a cultural problem preventing employees from reporting Lord ’ s infringements of children ’ s safety .	-3.6694
The staff said they had observed infringements , including that Lord was alone with children , cared for them privately as babysitters , let them sit on his lap , said that he loved it , and let children play with his mobile phone .	-5.1413
Danielle Ockwell , whose superior , Lord , asked for a child protection training because she was concerned about his behavior , said that the child service manager , Jacqui Barnat , who was Lords superior in YMCA Caringbah , “ was very intimidating and most of the time very close . ”	-5.9677
The Managing Director declared that he would not accept statements from employees that they would not have dared to reimburse their superior no.	-9.3530
Instead , he said , her friendship with Lord has affected her judgment , which is why they have not reported him .	-4.2768
Hare explained that he told the Board of Directors of YMCA NSW that the lesson to draw from the “ Jonathan-Lord incident ” concerns “ not the notification ” by employees , and the Board of Directors agreed to him . , , , , , , , , , , , , or , , . , or , , . , , , , or ,	-13.6912
Hare said that the decision to urge employees to sign secrecy obligations shortly after the accusations occurred was made by the Managing Director of the YMCA , Liam Whitley .	-3.9046
He said that this should prevent contamination of evidence , but that was “ overzealous ” and badly implemented .	-3.4965
The YMCA NSW was not a safe organization for children at the time when Jonathan Lord was working there between 2009 and 2011 , Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University , expert in sexual child abuse , the Commission .	-4.6566
He explained that there were “ serious problems ” in recruiting , verifying , training , and supervising employees .	-3.6302
The hearing was postponed until 20 December .	-0.8718
Tony Blair explained that he would seize the opportunity to return as British Prime Minister , but admits that a comeback is unlikely .	-2.8956
In an interview tonight on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his leaving office , the 59-year-old announced his views on various domestic issues .	-2.9904
Since his resignation in June 2007 , after a decade as Head of State , Blair has largely avoided commenting on British politics , and mostly limited his comments to foreign policy and his role as envoy of the Quartet of Peacemakers in the Middle East .	-4.1210
On the question of whether he would like to return to the Prime Minister ’ s office , Blair was quoted by the Evening Standard from London : “ Yes , sure , but it is unlikely that this will happen , so ... ”	-4.4268
When the horse show experts came to Cardiff to win the horse of the year , they knew that there was a tough competition .	-4.9925
But none was prepared for the three years old Fenton Kirkland .	-2.5305
The Knirps , who is not even in the kindergarten and only a few months ago made his first steps , and his Shetland Pony Toffee went loosely through the three rounds and won the first prize – leaving 30 adult opponents behind .	-11.0167
The inseparable couple , both equally large , were praised for their appearance , behavior and style at the annual competition held by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff .	-3.4934
During his performance in competition against men and women with elegant melons , he had set his plate caps in a fresh angle and led the two-year-old toffee through the ring .	-5.4812
Fenton was praised by the jurors for his natural abilities in dealing with the pony , which is far above his age .	-3.6169
And Toffee received best notes for his appearance and personality .	-2.6409
Fenton had received Toffee last March as a gift for his third birthday and since then practiced with the Shetland pony every day .	-3.7562
His mother , Donna , 30 , said : “ Fenton and Toffee are a great strap . ”	-10.2097
They had to compete against the whole field of participants and went out of the course with gold pocal and rosette .	-5.4513
It was only the second time that he took part in a competition with Toffee , and we were all enthusiastic when he won .	-3.0780
Fully strangers in the arena thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him .	-3.4890
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale , South Wales , follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells , which has been performing horses for over ten years .	-3.5989
Howells told : “ The whole audience was like electrified , and everyone fired it and slaughtered it . ”	-5.3073
He ran on sand the entire length of the arena and although he looked so tiny , he did a fantastic job .	-3.7567
Fenton is crazy for animals – he loves horses , tractors and farms and has two chickens he takes care of .	-3.0436
As he starts , it will not take long for him to be on the “ horse of the year ” show – and I am sure he will do well .	-4.2532
One speaker of the annual horse show said : “ Fenton is only three , but he knows how to deal with his pony . ”	-3.0875
Together they are a great team .	-1.2829
The jurors evaluated Fenton and Toffee after how well they had beaten and presented themselves in the demonstration ring .	-4.3561
They pay attention to good cooperation between Pony and Leader – and Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring . the .	-11.0956
I am sure that Fenton 's sweet clothing has contributed their part to this , which really fits perfectly for the occasion .	-4.4050
The Chinese Newspaper is to be “ reformed ” after calls for “ ”	-9.0437
A Chinese newspaper called for the release of a reporter accused of defamation on the front page to be reformed explained a press regulator .	-3.9320
The Neue Express , based in Guangzhou , had printed a rare public call to release the journalist Chen Yongzhou .	-3.0615
But Chen later admitted on television that he had adopted bribes to falsify reports of a part-state company .	-4.0319
Now , the New Express is undergoing “ comprehensive rectification , ” the regulatory authority declared .	-3.3043
The “ Rectification Order ” was established by the Guangdong Press and Publications Authority , Radio , Film the the the the the the the the the . the the the the the the	-10.6080
Preliminary investigations showed that the New Express , which is part of the Yangcheng Evening News Group , published several inaccurate reports on the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013 .	-3.6604
“ The editorial management of the New Express was disorderly , ” the regulatory authority announced in a statement .	-2.2652
She said that they decided to “ impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou and withdraw his reporter license . ”	-3.4940
Moreover , “ the Yangcheng Evening News Group has been instructed to make a complete rectification of the New Express and recommended that the relevant persons in charge of the New Express be identified and immediately reviewed the New Express leadership team . ”	-5.2759
Chen had written several articles for the New Express in which he reported about alleged financial irregularities in a manufacturer of construction machines called Zoomlion .	-3.1363
After being arrested , the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and behind his journalistic work .	-2.8884
But then Chen appeared on state television and admitted that he had published wrong reports for payment .	-4.0681
“ In this case , I damaged Zoomlion , as did the entire news industry and its ability to gain public confidence , ” he explained to the state news channel CCTV .	-3.8343
I did it primarily because I was on money and glory .	-2.8301
I realised that I was wrong .	-3.2020
Following Chen ’ s apology , the New Express published an apology on the front page and explained that they failed to check the reports correctly .	-4.0395
Various known suspects have recently made confessions on television .	-9.3839
Experts say that confessions are still routinely forced , despite a legislative amendment at the beginning of the year in which the authorities were banned , to force someone to accuse themselves .	-3.2777
Discovered Drug Tunnel with its own railway between the US and Mexico	-3.1823
One of the most sophisticated tunnels for drug smuggling between the US and Mexico , fully equipped with lighting , ventilation and electrical railway operation , has now been discovered .	-3.5170
The US authorities described the 120 times 90 centimetres tunnel as one of the most sophisticated passages they ever found .	-3.1322
The tunnel , which runs in the zigzag pattern over a length of just under six football fields , connects storage halls near Tijuana , Mexico , and San Diego , USA .	-3.6584
There are countless invisible warehouses in the area , making it easier to hide lorries loaded with drugs .	-3.6289
The tunnel had been closed before drugs could be transported unrecognized , the authorities declared .	-2.5805
In the discovery of the tunnel , eight and a half tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine had been ensured , according to the records of the court .	-3.5816
Three men who , according to the authorities , worked as drivers were charged with owning and selling marijuana and cocaine .	-2.9402
They are threatened with a sentence of guilt between ten years and lifelong .	-4.5141
In Nogales , Arizona , smugglers rely on an extensive underground network of dewatering channels .	-2.1453
The tunnel is the eighth large passage discovered in San Diego since 2006 .	-2.4003
Some of the biggest tunnels were discovered after the marijuana harvest in Central Mexico in October , which poses the challenge posed by the drugs cartels of how they can quickly bring their product to consumers .	-4.2775
In 2010 , authorities found a nearly 640 metre-long passage with rails that ran from a kitchen in a residential house in Tijuana to two storage houses in San Diego .	-4.3245
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love to love themselves .	-1.7635
Actors Orlando Bloom and Model Miranda Kerr want to go separate ways in the future .	-2.0699
In an interview , however , Bloom said that he and Kerr still love themselves .	-2.0045
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents of two-year Flynn .	-8.7127
Actor Orlando Bloom spoke about separating himself from his wife , Topmodel Miranda Kerr .	-2.7440
In an interview with US journalist Katie Couric , who was supposed to be broadcast on Friday ( local time ) , Bloom said , " life is sometimes not exactly as we plan or hope " .	-4.0222
Kerr and he still loved himself , stressed the 36-year-old .	-2.3244
" We will support each other and love each other as parents of Flynn " .	-2.1723
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010 , and their son Flynn was born in 2011 .	-2.3492
According to Lexica , veganism is subordinated to vegetarianism , but it is very different from that .	-4.5625
Because while vegetarians allow the consumption of cream cakes , ice or a powerful Edamer , these cakes are not on the menu of a vegan .	-4.6672
Milk , cheese , egg , alongside the renunciation of meat and fish , the vegan leaves all consumption of animal products - also honey is denied .	-4.9671
What remains may be wondered , but if you look closer , the vegan nutritional world is characterized by a considerable ingenuity .	-11.3136
" Bread spreads are very popular " , explains Ute Henkelmann , the owner of the local reform house , which offers a variety of special products for vegans .	-4.3736
Also Reuben Proctor is happy to visit the shop in the Domgasse .	-10.4904
For 13 years , the native New Zealand vegan has lived , in Lampertheim he finds ( almost ) everything he needs to live .	-19.0026
At the turn of the century the next step was taken and I became a vegan .	-2.3110
" The conviction came not only because of the nutrition , but because of the choice of shoes , " says Proctor , who prefers the leather of the leather . , , , or . , , , , , , , , or , , or , or , , , ,	-14.4994
He recognized that there are other everyday concerns without animal products .	-3.9143
First and foremost , vegan is an ethic .	-8.6729
" I don 't want animals to die for me , " Proctor says the maxim of vegans that covers all consumption behavior .	-4.3755
Instead of mourning burgers , stirrings or rubber bears , the vegan quickly discovered completely new products , and the enthusiasm increased .	-4.4836
" It 's a double bonus , " says Proctor today , " actually vegan does not constitute a waiver , not a askesis , but it is an enrichment " .	-6.1342
And it is precisely these conditions that failed some even so well intentioned attempts .	-5.6308
" The addiction factor is a crucial factor that lets many quickly abandon , similar to smoking , " Proctor sets a comparison .	-4.2773
And apply : " Certain tastes are not fixed to animals " .	-4.2445
Often it is the spices or the type of preparation that make up the taste .	-3.0136
" You can also create the same effect in other ways , " the vegan clarifies .	-13.1280
Proctor brings aubergines , champignons and also some vegan sausages to a barbecue festival .	-4.1919
It pays attention to a balanced , varied diet , where it should taste very often .	-12.0994
Of course you want to have something between the teeth , that is legitimate .	-2.7754
" It should taste , but this is not only to reduce to animal food , " Proctor said .	-3.4813
Health damage to eating disorders , another widespread assumption , has not suffered .	-3.5868
For me , the conversion had a positive aspect .	-2.3936
I do not take a foreign cholesterol and have an increased vitamin content .	-3.7199
There are high-performance athletes who only feed vegan .	-2.3267
" My blood values are excellent , I often check me " , reveals Proctor .	-4.1854
Especially against the lack of vitamin B12 , many vegansim critics warn . the the the . the the the the . the the the the the the	-9.6028
" Because animals are fed with feedingstuffs instead of grazing on pasture , it is questionable whether the vitamin B12 percentage is high in the meat you buy in the refrigeration chest " , Proctor finds .	-12.4906
For vegans there is also the possibility to take the coenzyme in the form of tablets .	-3.1817
" My B12 values are fine , " he explains .	-1.7979
Proctor must not go a long way for food procurement .	-3.9223
There are basic foodstuffs everywhere and every supermarket now has soya milk and other products .	-3.7861
I find everything I need on the ground .	-2.4946
Only sometimes I buy something special .	-2.6298
" Many people overlook the fact that only the finished products are expensive , but that is how it behaves with " ordinary " finished products as .	-4.9623
In any case , the preparation of vegan dishes is far cheaper and less time-consuming than is commonly assumed .	-12.7563
" In the house kitchen there is a lot to discover , with a few small tricks you can achieve good , if not partially better results , " says Proctor .	-4.3740
Margarine instead of butter , a little more baking powder and carbon acid instead of egg , with his vegan cheese cakes , Proctor was also able to make his parents amazed .	-4.4460
Family festivals give the vegan a new spice .	-2.3739
This is dynamic when you cook together , and it has a new importance .	-5.1106
" The situations that can arise are as different as the people themselves , " says Proctor .	-3.0002
Of course , he was scepticized .	-3.6303
Do you not taste my food any more ?	-2.4189
" Should I feel bad now because I drink milk ? " - if you have such questions you have to act as a vegan with a fingertip .	-5.6054
" I do not reject people , I am part of this society " , Proctor does not want to be an enclave .	-4.2138
And , more precisely , the everyday world does not appear as vegan-alien as suspected - and the vegan does not appear as restricted in everyday life as usual .	-6.2862
Fast food is also allowed .	-1.5901
There are pommes everywhere !	-2.3813
" Many Döner shops offer Falafel , or just a vegetarian yufka , " says Proctor .	-3.1326
In a pizzeria he evades from pasta , or orders a pizza without cheese , all a question of habit .	-4.3420
The restaurants are so slowly adjusting to this . . the .	-5.8581
" When I started to feed my vegan 13 years ago , everything was much more difficult , " the New Zealand can find a development : " You have to talk to the people , make them aware " .	-5.3661
" When enough demands come , they may be inclined to add the menu , " he hopes .	-3.7133
Vegane restaurants develop , such as the Mannheim coffee shop or the Vogelfrei café .	-5.1043
Proctor wants other restaurants to have at least a vegan dish on the menu .	-3.1895
Basically , vegan dishes are available for everyone .	-2.5236
Everyone can eat them , so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive .	-2.0043
" Meat dishes , on the other hand , are exclusive , in the truest sense of the word , because they exclude others , " Proctor stat.	-3.9420
" If you want to avoid food scandals , then veganism is a safe way to make the largest part impossible from the outset , " says Proctor .	-3.4227
However , purchasing vegan products could be a bit difficult at the beginning .	-3.5902
Especially when you learn to understand that animal additives can also be included in earth nuts as a color giver , you seem to quickly leave the courage to follow ethics with so many obstacles and traps .	-6.1972
Not only have Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen written a book : " Veganissimo - animal ingredients and their alternatives " explains the many ingredients that are added to food and also cleaning agents .	-4.1102
" Gradually you develop a scanner view and know what characters and logos you have to look at " It 's sometimes better to do small steps than stop or stumble " , Proctor knows .	-5.1734
Veganism , it is an important moral finger that beats consciousness .	-3.4992
Perhaps he is not entirely able to dismiss his habits , but at least he can teach consumers to critically question their habits .	-4.6217
The stock exchange operator Nasdaq OMX keeps his customers in breath .	-2.5203
The trading on the Nasdaq Options Market was interrupted on Friday afternoon of German time .	-2.8699
In a communication , the operator made technical problems responsible .	-2.4127
The other 11 US option markets , including two of the Nasdaq OMX , continued their business unhindered .	-2.2254
The recent incident continues a whole series of smaller and larger breakdowns with the stock exchange operator .	-3.2941
Only on Tuesday the Nasdaq indexes had not been calculated for an hour due to data transportation errors .	-3.8082
In August of this year alone , there were two breakdowns in one week .	-3.5993
First , the US Investment Bank Goldman Sachs sent massive buying orders to option markets due to technical problems .	-3.2119
As a result , stock exchange operators nearly took a whole day to look through and remove orders .	-4.1032
Two days later , half of the total stock trading in the US came to a halt for several hours due to a computer margin on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange .	-3.4564
Last year , the Facebook stock exchange had also caught up .	-5.3538
The Nasdaq systems had not grown the tide of purchase and sales orders , later determined the SEC stock exchange supervision , and later donated the company to a record penalty of $ 10 million .	-5.2472
Constance : Cyclists drive 63 years	-3.3027
According to the police , the accident occurred when a 26-year-old man on Thursday evening , around 22 o 'clock , with a women 's bicycle regularly travelling from the railway station to the market place .	-6.8126
When a suddenly 63 year-old man walked from a restaurant , the cyclist according to the police was no longer able to slow down in time . the , .	-11.3791
During the following clash , the pedestrian was pushed against the house wall , went to the ground in the further course and attracted an approximately 15 centimeters long space wound on the head .	-7.3065

British police make Assange an extradition decision	-11.3099
The British police have today delivered a notice of extradition to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange , who sought refuge and requested asylum in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London .	-3.5937
Scotland Yard declared that the 40-year-old Australian was sent a “ invitation to stand up ” to appear in a police guard , and added , if he failed to do so , he threatened to arrest .	-6.2096
Assange is threatening to extradite to Sweden because of the charge in a sexual offence , having exhausted its possibilities under British law since the Supreme Court rejected its opposition to extradition at the beginning of the month .	-4.4895
As he fears that Stockholm will extradite him to the US , he sought refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on 19 June and asked the South American country for political asylum .	-3.5008
Scotland Yard “ sent an invitation to a 40-year-old man to join a police guard at a time we chose , ” said a spokesman .	-4.7964
He continues to violate the terms of his release on deposit .	-2.5166
The message did not comment on delivering the police request .	-3.0636
Assange fears that he will be handed over to the United States by Sweden and charged for possible spy accusations after publishing more than 250,000 diplomatic news on the WikiLeaks revelation website .	-5.1173
Drivers with 210 km / h and hot drink between their legs receive $ 1,000 punishment .	-4.4697

Andrew Howie , 35 , from Tiptree , Essex , was stopped on 27 May with his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree .	-2.5325
After the police stopped him , they discovered the beverage cup between his legs .	-2.9862
In front of the Colchester Official Court , Howie knew guilty without having taken the necessary care and attention . .	-16.8340
He received seven points and a six-month driving ban .	-1.7802
Howie was also sentenced to pay $ 90 and a $ 100 victim surcharge .	-3.6153
Tax on foreign property owners against London ’ s speculative bubble	-2.2975
The Treasury has calculated the CGT measure provisionally , but is still waiting for the final decision of Chancellor George Osborne , who had imposed a 7 % stamp tax on housing in the 2012 budget , costing more than two million pounds , annual fees for buyers who hold housing as a company and not as individuals .	-5.6019
Already , revenues from the stamp tax on housing in the Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea districts , which in the 2012 / 13 tax year amounted to 708 million pounds , combined revenues for Northern Ireland , Wales , Scotland , the Northeast , Northwest , Yorkshire , and the Humber region .	-4.7036
Cook said , “ After the stamp tax hikes on high-priced housing and the introduction of the related legislation against circumstances , it is hard to claim that high-quality real estate is too low taxed , regardless of the impact of the outdated community tax system . ”	-11.1959
“ But this step could make some foreign investors more restrained in terms of purchasing property in London , or preventing owners from selling it , ” he added .	-4.0665
First-class real estate – the top five to ten % of the housing market by price – in the wealthy southwest belt of London , which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon , has become more expensive by the record value of 11.8 % last year .	-4.6231
Prices in Central London showed an equal annual growth of 5.6 % , but were overshadowed by an emerging “ domestic market , ” where the south-western part of the city , the north ( 7.4 % ) , and the east ( 6.5 % ) experienced an upward trend , a Savills investigation .	-5.1312
Scientists have been able to shed more light on the context in which a dog 's tail is connected with his mood .	-5.2909
Previous research showed that happy dogs with the tail turned more to the right ( from the point of view of the dog ) while the left side was on nervous dogs .	-5.0053
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive and respond to these subtle differences .	-2.2889
Professor Georgio Vallortigara , a neuroscientist at the University of Trento , said : “ Man knows well that the left and right brain reacts differently to stimuli that cause positive or negative emotions . ”	-3.5613
Here we tried to look at this with other species .	-3.1370
He also noticed that in dogs , like in humans , the right half of the brain is responsible for the movement of the left and vice versa , and that the two hemispheres played different roles in feelings .	-4.6981
In order to learn more about how dogs react to the side of their species ’ cocks , researchers monitored the animals while these movies of other dogs looked at themselves .	-6.1086
They measured the heart rate of the four-legged and analyzed the behaviour .	-8.1941
We will probably soon understand why the cock moves in one direction , sometimes in the other direction .	-4.3161
Professor Vallortigara said : “ We have shown dogs films with dogs – either a natural version or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects , and we have managed the tail ’ s movement more to the left or right . ”	-4.1124
When the animals saw how an otherwise expressless dog moved the tail to the right ( seen from the perspective of the wedding dog ) , they remained completely relaxed .	-4.6225
But if the tail tendency was mainly to the left ( again from the perspective of the dog that washed ) , their heart rate rose and they looked troubled .	-5.4747
Professor Vallortigara believes that dogs do not intentionally communicate with each other through these movements .	-2.1753
Rather , he is convinced that the dogs have learned from experience what movements they should worry about and when not .	-4.2439
He said , “ If you have different encounters with other dogs , and waging in one direction is more linked to friendly behavior , and the right side produces a less friendly behavior , then you react on the basis of these experiences . ”	-5.8697
Researchers say that the findings of dog owners , veterinarians and trainers could help to improve their animal ’ s emotions .	-3.8714
John Bradshaw , an expert in dog behavior and guest scholarship at the Faculty of Animal Healing at the University of Bristol , explained that this was not the first study to examine whether left and right is important for dogs .	-4.6740
Last year , a team at the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their head to the left when they look at an aggressive dog and to the right when it is a satisfied dog .	-12.0466
In another research at the University of Victoria in Canada , the following was : “ Dogs are more likely to go to a robot dog when being tail <unk> left , not right , rather than becoming worried – exactly the opposite of the Italian study . ”	-7.0278
According to his statement , the differences could arise because the dogs in the various studies did not interpret animals in the movies or robot dogs as dogs .	-4.9185
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could help , he explained .	-2.2413
“ While there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two brain halves are used for various purposes , many of the details still have to be determined – and dogs are no exception , ” Bradshaw said .	-3.9687
Since their behavior is simply recorded , it will probably not take long for us to understand why the tail sometimes moves in one direction , sometimes in the other .	-4.5638

In February , Pope Francis appoints first cardinals	-10.0869
On 22 February , Pope Francis will first be called new cardinals of the Catholic Church , as the Vatican announced on Thursday .	-3.6127
Cardinals are the highest clerics in the Catholic Church after the Pope , and they are also the ones who elect a Pope , so that Francis will appoint the first group of men who will ultimately participate in the election of his successor .	-3.9982
There are currently 201 cardinals .	-1.2279
However , a cardinal that reached an age of 80 can no longer participate in the Pope ’ s election – a group of 120 “ eligible cardinals . ”	-4.0994
In a statement in which the message was announced , Father Federico Lombardi , a Vatican spokesman , said that a meeting of all cardinals would take place before the ceremony for the appointment of the new cardinals , also known as a consistorium .	-4.5859
“ Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision to convene the consistency in February in advance so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from all over the world can be planned , ” said Lombardi .	-3.5274
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of cardinals eligible to vote will probably have fallen by February .	-3.0658
He explained that a pope normally appoint as many cardinals as necessary so that the number of cardinals eligible to vote is 120 again , and as many cardinals over 80 as he wants .	-4.2217
The consistorium next year is important because it is the first since the election of Francis in March this year , according to Valero .	-10.2522
There is currently a certain overhang on the part of Europe and , in particular , Italy .	-2.6082
“ It will be interesting to see if the new Pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance , ” he said .	-2.1511
Forty per cent of Catholics live in South America , but they have only a tiny number of cardinals .	-1.8039
The Cardinals will also be the first to be appointed since the formation of the Cardinals Council , founded by Francis , a group of eight cardinals from all over the world , who have the task of finding ways of reforming the Church .	-9.9859
In the past , the Pope decided everything alone .	-1.7212
“ Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him , ” said Valero .	-2.5146
He explained that Francis asked the cardinals for advice .	-3.4335
But , so far , we have not been able to do so – that is all new .	-4.7081
Valero said that bishops would typically be called cardinals from large places , but Francis is “ full of surprises – so we do not know who he appoints . ”	-4.4161
GM recalls new pickup trucks in the US to repair the seat backrest	-2.7375
General Motors call back nearly 19,000 of its brand new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra Pickup trucks built in 2014 to resolve a problem with the manually adjustable seat backrest , such a communication from the US Vehicle Safety Authority on Friday .	-4.8294
Some of the cars may have a defect in the mechanism for reset the front seat rest .	-3.8228
For this reason , they do not comply with the Federal Directives on vehicle safety in head restraints .	-3.4290
“ If the vehicle is driven from the back , it is possible that the head restraint does not properly protect the occupants , so there is an increased risk of injury , ” was read on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ( NHTSA ) website .	-5.1606
The recalled models were manufactured between 1 August and 10 September .	-3.0656
The delivery of GM trucks began in June and represents the most important model launch of the leading US car manufacturer since the insolvency restructuring in 2009 .	-3.6142
GM informed the vehicle owners about the defect in the first half of October .	-2.2249
The NHTSA could not check the notification letter because of the 16-day government shutdown , which had a negative impact on car sales in October .	-4.3360
The sale of Silverado and Sierra trucks , which were redeveloped for the 2014 model year , increased by 20 % in the first ten months of the year , explained GM on Friday .	-3.5134
In October , GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra Pickup trucks .	-2.0022
GM shares rose by 1.4 percent to $ 37.47 on Friday afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange .	-2.5590
A Obama voter ’ s Despite Cream	-3.2972
I elected President Obama twice in the hope that change is possible .	-1.5051
He says that Obama has made praiseworthy efforts that have been blocked by the Republican blockade .	-10.8287
Blockade policy does not excuse the website problems of Obamacare , drone attacks	-10.0237
Obama ’ s memoirs about the 2008 election campaign were a sad memory of what might have been possible .	-2.4378
Nathaniel P. Morris is a student at Harvard Medical School in the second year .	-2.1213
I am currently reading a terribly sad book .	-1.9007
It is a book I thought it would enlighten me during the sluggish second year of my medical studies and give me hope again .	-4.9671
It is called “ The Audacity to Win ” and describes Barack Obama ’ s memoir for the 2008 presidential election .	-3.0931
When I finish with my patient ’ s records in the evening and go to bed , the book brings me back to a time when politics inspired millions and could rob a speech .	-5.5268
The election became a landslide victory and news speakers held to show the historical importance of this hour .	-3.3790
My classmates wept with joy and my parents collected all the newspapers they could find .	-3.3383
A young team of visionaries was on the way to the White House and the nation was ready for change .	-1.7680
When Obama went to office in 2008 , he had 82 % approval .	-3.2061
And then I close the book .	-1.3657
Switching back to the present is a bad awakening as if you are torn out of a dream .	-3.2966
It is difficult to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague memory , a sad reminder of missed possibilities .	-2.4024
In fact , in the years since I first voted , something has changed .	-3.3786
But it is simply nothing I could have imagined .	-1.9737
I recognise the great and versatile things that Obama has achieved , from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for Health Insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq , the end of the forced concealment of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden .	-3.0183
I agree that party political blockades have overturned too many aspirations to bring our nation forward : immigration reform , a public health insurance option , and the closure of Guantanamo Bay , to name but a few .	-4.6874
But , having defended the Obama administration countlessly against colleagues and acquaintances , I have come to the end with my explanatory attempts .	-4.1759
I have reached a point of political despair .	-1.4751
Republican blockade policy cannot explain why it is allowed to listen to foreign leaders or kill innocent children by overseas drones .	-3.9002
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data on Americans ’ private lives , and why whistleblowers are punished that disclose state misconduct .	-3.7557
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki , a US citizen , was murdered without trial , nor why public financing and spending limits are being circumvented during the presidential elections .	-3.5408
It does not justify the results of a report stating that the White House ’ s efforts to rest the media are the “ most aggressive ... since the Nixon government . ”	-3.0488
And recently , it cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website in more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act .	-3.1493
I do not know if this is what I should have expected .	-1.8469
Whether I should have understood at 18 that government work could contradict the previous political campaign .	-3.6796
Obviously , the MEP is not a predictable course , as an opposition party and random events such as the Newtown massacre shape public debate .	-4.0460
But if I look at the examples mentioned above , they seem to be largely elected by the government itself .	-3.1615
And that disturbs me most .	-2.3846
I re-elected Obama in 2012 , not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy .	-2.0053
Mitt Romney represented a confusing and unbalanced alternative ; he seemed unable to determine his direction and positions .	-4.2462
I had the impression that a second term for Obama , free from pressure from future elections , would fulfil the hope we had heard about for so long .	-3.2637
But , with Obama ’ s approval ratings falling below 45 % this week , this book ’ s return to 2008 has become all the harder .	-4.1429
It gives me a yearning for the many promises that have dissolved in the air .	-4.2913
This week I read a section in the book that describes how Obama had to lose a heavy loss against Clinton in the Pennsylvania primary elections .	-3.8964
In a meeting with the electoral workers after the decision , he said to his staff that they had to come back on course and follow the purpose of their cause .	-4.6527
“ I want us to find our spell , ” he said .	-2.4559
We must remember who we are .	-1.0645
It is five years later , Mr President , and I could not agree more with you .	-2.4654

Clive Palmer claims that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has conflict of interest in parental leave	-2.2259
The billionaire and MEP Clive Palmer says that Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in a conflict of interest in his parental leave plans , because his daughters are pregnant and could therefore benefit from it .	-3.8737
The mining magnate , which is in judicial dispute over the payment of $ 6 million to carbon tax , claimed that he wanted to wipe out questions about whether he was in a conflict .	-5.5187
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate , which are important for deciding whether to cancel or cut CO2 and mining taxes .	-3.2008
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and that the daughters of Abbott would personally benefit from the laws .	-2.8608
“ He is in a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave , because when one of his daughters becomes pregnant , he has a direct interest in whether or not she gets vacation , ” Palmer said .	-4.4230
Two months after the election , the Palmer Election Commission officially declared the winner of the Fairfax Sunshine Coast seat , with 53 votes in advance after the recount .	-3.9938
Palmer called for a revision of the process of counting votes to make it faster .	-4.1689
Tony Abbott 's daughter Frances and Bridget .	-7.9761
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of the vote ?	-1.5609
“ We need a better system , ” he said .	-0.9181
Why should we not have a system where you march , enter data into a computer , immediately choose and then have the result at 6 : 30 in the evening ?	-5.1885
Palmer also criticized the use of pencils when marking the ballot papers .	-2.0465
Do you use them , because you can eliminate the results if you don 't like them ?	-4.6380
It is incredible to coordinate with pencil today .	-10.7401
The Electoral Commission has examined the options for electronic elections and recently published a joint legislative proposal with New Zealand .	-2.8563
Palmer , 59 , declared that his policy includes an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he will take his new office “ very seriously ” .	-3.0687

RBS suspends two Forex Traders	-1.3633
The Royal Bank of Scotland suspended two traders from its foreign-exchange department , two people familiar with the situation ; this is another indication that the worldwide official investigation of the alleged manipulation of the currency market is moving rapidly .	-5.1167
Some of the world ’ s largest banks , including UBS , Barclays , Deutsche Bank , and RBS , confirmed that they cooperate with the authorities in investigating the world ’ s largest financial market , with US $ 5.3 billion changing owners every day .	-4.1683
The two dealers would be the first RBS employees suspended in the expanding investigation that results in the scandal of the Libor interbanking business .	-4.8212
The Bank , which did not comment on suspensions , confirmed this month that it received information requests from authorities .	-2.6870
“ Our investigations on this subject continue and we are cooperating fully with the FCA and other regulatory authorities , ” the Bank said two weeks ago .	-3.2268
Last month , people close to the situation indicated that the RBS forwarded the records of emails and instant messages sent by and to a previous dealer to the British regulatory authority , the Financial Conduct Authority .	-4.4479
This retailer , Richard Usher , had left the RBS in 2010 and has now been left by his current position as European head of forex spot trading at JPMorgan .	-4.9263
Rohan Ramchandani , head of the European Spot Trading near Citi , was left this week and Matt Gardiner , formerly head currency dealer at Barclays and UBS , was suspended this week at Standard Chartered .	-3.8341
None of these traders has been accused of any misconduct .	-2.7604
The Usher Instant Message Group included bankers at Barclays and the Citigroup , said people close to the situation .	-3.5130
UBS announced this week that it took steps against some of its employees after the Swiss Regulatory Authority Finma declared that it investigated a suspected manipulation of the foreign-exchange market in a number of Swiss banks .	-4.0968
At least six worldwide authorities – the European Commission , Finma , the Swiss competition authority Weko , the FCA , the US Department of Justice , and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently dealing with accusations that bankers should have agreed on transactions in the currency market .	-4.1163
HSBC , Citigroup , JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal investigations or received information requests from authorities , said familiar people with the . the , , or , , , , or , , ,	-10.1274
Banks comb instant messages and emails from several years in search of cases of malpractice .	-3.6113
News about these investigations has turned traders into an area that has been one of the most profitable of investment bank trading units in recent years , but was under pressure this year because low currency volatility limits speculators ’ chances .	-5.1035
Some bankers have tried to downplay the affair , saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the expanded and highly liquid foreign-exchange market , but leading traders believe that it is not necessarily true .	-11.6396
A leading trader noticed that , despite the enormous daily volume of foreign-exchange trading , the fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use of banks ’ own internal platforms means that “ one can influence the market at very low ticket prices . ”	-4.8279
The news came out the same day when Credit Suisse announced that she announced this week that she had cancelled a dealer from her London Exchange Traded Funds office , after causing a loss of nearly $ 6 million at the end of last year .	-4.7650
The Bank promptly informed the competent authorities and cooperates with them .	-1.7825
“ We are sure that the dealer acted alone and that the matter is contained , ” said Credit Suisse .	-3.4192
Painted the building fence on the Bechtle plot	-3.1467
A group of the Citizens ' Initiative " Swiss Meadow " has embellished the building fence on the Bechtle plot at the spa promenade in Bad Herrenalb .	-13.2417
In addition , it cleaned and broadened the footpath , it is said in a press release .	-3.8128
The planned covering of the disintegrating house in the rear part of the plot was not allowed for security reasons , because the terrain threatens to slip down .	-5.2762
Alfred Abel , who currently administers the plot , had agreed to beautify the BI with his colleague Reinhard Domke .	-3.8852
Before the action of the BI , a transparent message " We are in favour " was put in place .	-4.8407
However , this did not disturb the approximately 20 members of the citizens ' initiative much in their action .	-4.5415
Her motto on the big poster was called " We are against Bauruinen " .	-2.5830
She wanted to point out the danger of even larger ruins on the Swiss meadow - the giant project should one day fail .	-4.4072
In conversation with many passers-by at the " construction site " it became clear that some citizens believe that with the implementation of the project of the city many will be better off , although not a few have the same questions about the dimension of the project presented as the BI .	-6.0988
But they begin to resign because the city is further delaying these answers , it is said by the BI .	-4.1145
As we have heard , the public statements of the mayor also have an impact .	-4.3166
May had said in the municipal session that he fears that the thermal bath should the population vote against the plans for a swimming and wellness complex on the Swiss meadow in the civil decisions .	-6.8360
Some therefore appear almost scared , while others feel that they are a " plump blackmail " attempt on the population , the BI press release continues .	-6.4928
The BI thanked donors for the colour and all helpers .	-2.7278
Rangnick-Schelte für Shiris : Mane kein Schwalbenkönig	-9.4953
As satisfied as Ralf Rangnick is with the current shape of Bundesliga table leader Red Bull Salzburg , so disappointed was the sports director of the " bulls " of the arbitrators .	-4.6902
" There is currently a dangerous tendency that Mane and Alan are being pushed into the category of Schwalbenkönige , " he took the two offensive wildermen in protection on Thursday at a press conference in Salzburg .	-5.0109
The latest occasion for Rangnick 's criticism was yellow for Mane at 3 : 0 against Val Gardena last Sunday , in which the Senegalese became a supposed actress - which was not , however , as the TV pictures showed .	-5.4689
" A gross mistake , " said Rangnick , who referred to Harkam as " totally overstretched " .	-4.3940
Harkam would also have contributed " his part " to the escalation between Salzburg-Coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig-Trainer Adi Hütter after the match .	-2.8803
He decided to defend his German compatriot : " I would have behaved the same way in every single situation as Roger Schmidt " .	-4.4828
Schmidt himself did not want to have any contact with his colleague after the Scharmützel with Hütter .	-4.4384
I do not know why .	-1.1678
" For I am the one who was insulted " stressed the 46-year-old .	-3.1198
Given the success , however , Rangnick approved a praise .	-4.3453
" There are only two words for this : really good " , he noted .	-3.7247
There is not much to suspend .	-1.2131
Especially the way the team plays is impressive .	-2.4164
That is to go on quite quietly .	-4.6172
There will be little changes in the winter transfer period .	-3.0617
There are no great reasons to change something .	-1.8776
" Except for a player , Rangnick made it clear that he wants to leave the club .	-4.4391
Supreme Court confirms Obama ’ s Health Act	-1.4876
It is a great victory for the Obama administration : the US Supreme Court today decided that the Health Act closely linked to Barack Obama is constitutional .	-2.9161
With five to four votes , judges judged that the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – forcing US citizens to complete health insurance or pay a penalty by 2014 – is constitutional under the state ’ s tax authority .	-3.7392
The chief judge John Roberts hit the side of the four more liberal members of the Chamber , while the judges Scalia , Thomas , Alito and Kennedy decided against it .	-3.7809
The Court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 2700 pages of the law , and also argued that the Health Act stipulated that states should either extend the conditions of access for Medicaid or otherwise cancel all state Medicaid subsidies is not unconstitutional .	-6.5945
The proceedings against the law were initiated by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business .	-2.9741
The law was firmly rejected by all leading Republican presidential candidates , including the ultimate challenger Mitt Romney , in the 2012 primary campaign .	-2.7079
Norway : Norwegian village makes light with giant mirrors	-3.5883
With huge mirrors , the inhabitants of a Norwegian village have brought light to their dark valley .	-2.9897
Due to the low degree of sunlight , the Rjukan in the Vestfjord valley usually sinks in the shadow of the surrounding mountains from autumn to spring .	-4.0905
With three gigantic reflectors at 45 metres altitude , a century dream became true on Wednesday .	-3.5872
" Finally ! " , mayor Steinar Bergsland swarmed at the start ceremony in the TV2 station .	-3.6864
Some inhabitants of the valley settled sun chairs , while others set sunglasses for safety reasons .	-5.8705
Until now , sunny hungry people had to drive a cable car to a nearby peak in winter .	-4.6796
Ten years ago , local artist Martin Andersen presented the proposal to steer rays with mirrors into the valley .	-2.9698
However , this basic idea has been in place since 1913 .	-3.3035

Post hardly empty Sundays	-8.0746
" Many citizens will not have noticed that the red points for Sunday empty are still on various letter boxes in the core city and the districts , but reading the small print on the yellow containers of Post AG , you can quickly find out that the emptiness on Sundays and Holidays is no longer taking place , " the FDP communicates .	-6.9488
A request from the FDP confirmed this .	-2.3962
On Sundays and holidays , only in front of the post office building at Ernst-Ludwig-Strasse 36 and at Jakob-Müller-Strasse 1 in Hüttenfeld .	-3.4864
Whether emptied in Hofheim and Rosengarten Sunday will not be answered in the answer to the FDP request .	-3.6366
The FDP ’ s social and adolescent spokesperson , Fritz Röhrenbeck , wants to refuel here .	-11.2869
Sunday empty is an important postal service especially at appointment .	-3.4991
" Despite the price increase for letters on January 2013 , this undertaking is radical and unreasonable " .	-4.0197
Thomas Bittner , Chairman of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party ( Chairman of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party ) and European Democrats , supports his group colleagues : ' What annoys me is the fact that , secretly , the empty periods are being changed or . '	-5.5652
The post office is miles away from the city .	-10.1895
" At least the letter boxes in the neighborhoods of Neuschlo<unk> and Rosengarten must be emptied again on Sundays " , says Bittner and Röhrenbeck uniso.	-4.0404
Also applicable to the core city , especially non-mobile fellow citizens should be able to reach a mailbox with Sunday empty on foot .	-5.6186
In the city parliament , Röhrenbeck asked whether the city administration plans to talk to the post on this matter .	-4.7496
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the post did not communicate with Lampertheim .	-1.6015
His knowledge , however , also exists in Hofheim Sunday empty .	-13.9074
Your party has spoken out in favour of privatisations .	-9.6885

Frankfurt ’ s parking charges are to increase significantly .	-3.7299
Parking in Frankfurt could soon become more expensive .	-3.6924
This morning , the city ’ s magistrate discusses a presentation of traffic decorator Stefan Majer ( Green ) .	-4.7113
Accordingly , parking charges are to be increased by 50 percent .	-3.1584
For this purpose , however , prices should not be increased , but the interval of parking clocks and parking ticket machines should be reduced from 30 to 20 minutes .	-5.2882

Friendship City : Fast actions overrun hosts	-10.9815
With a narrow cadre , Men I of the TSV Freudenstadt had to compete against the TG Gönningen in the Schiller Schulturnhalle in Reutlingen from the Swabian Alb .	-4.7228
The Aelblers were on the other side with an experienced team .	-3.2066
Soon , however , it became evident that they could not fully compete with the rapid actions of the cities of joy .	-5.9979
The Gönningers did extremely hard with the hard and placed surcharges .	-4.3411
They repeatedly missed the passports and attacks that Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz played cleanly over the center of the network , and were not present at the block defense .	-6.2004
Two high first sentence gains clearly expressed the superiority of the cities in all matters .	-4.0162
Given this crushing and playing performance , the third sentence was slightly lazy and funny to the 3 : 0 final stand ( 25 : 13 , 25 : 14 , 25 : 22 ) .	-5.3786
On 2 November , the Baiersbronn TV , which was able to make a clear impact in Nagold , will be a much more powerful opponent in the field .	-5.5019
TSV Freudenstadt I : Dominik Bäuerle , Yannik Büchle , Sebastian Dölker , Felix Pallen , Stefan Räller , Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz .	-1.6227
In the B-class the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt were opposite in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn .	-3.3625
They delivered a hard-fought two-hour match . .	-2.7235
Nervousness on both sides caused errors and dotted gifts , especially in the ball acceptance ; even in the passports , the precision was sometimes deficient and in some critical game scenes , the overwhelming prevented the gaze for potential points .	-13.9885
In this highly balanced encounter , however , the TSV team at Marcus Blasutto consistently agreed on the great physical commitment and a pleasant commitment of both teams .	-5.7169
Maintenance day on the small English hut	-3.5918
For the fifth care day in the succession of the Natura 2000 project upper Hotzenwald , a group of dedicated participants met at the small English hut in Ibach .	-4.6199
Due to suggestions from the population , this day in the area of the cottage the view into the valley should be cut off , Mayor Helmut Kaiser said .	-5.0884
Many hikers , Emperor said , described this area as the shining piece of the gorge climb , where the landscape offers the ideal setting for magnificent views .	-5.2991
He thanked the attendees for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the care day is a suitable tool for strengthening the link between man and nature .	-4.6421
It gives every citizen the possibility of setting emphasis in nature itself .	-4.7430
At the same time , with the tourist aspect , ecological consideration can also be taken into account .	-9.9169
This ecological aspect was explained by the Tribukait Friederike of the Department of Nature Conservation of the Government of Freiburg , following the welcome of Landrat Tilman Bollacher , who took over the patronage and wanted the action to succeed .	-6.6014
According to Tribukait , the tourist destination of the wide view is met with the aim of preserving the old Allmendweidfeld , which has grown heavily in the meantime , with its specific protected habitat types , by opening and connecting to the still existing pastures .	-7.3692
Certain species , such as rare butterflies and grass hoppers , cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest areas .	-2.3880
You need these free connections to arterial conservation .	-4.0085
Tribukait said that she did not want to miss a lance for the planned biosphere area .	-4.0562
The current measure is not merely seamless in this planning .	-3.5424
A biosphere area also offers the opportunity for sustainable economic and environmental development on the basis of internationally recognised Unesco status and thus a continuous supplement to what has been achieved with the Life project and the previous care days for the future .	-5.1778
According to these various statements , the Revierleiter Christoph Wehle and Life project manager Cornelia Bischoff divided the helpers into groups .	-11.0554
The bigger trees had already been beaten in advance , the forestry trawler may be ready to call .	-4.6072
A group of helpers should take care of exempting juniper bushes and caring for a dry stone bar .	-3.4593

Google , Samsung , Huawei sued for Nortel patents	-1.0205
The group , which owns thousands of previous Nortel patents , took up an avalanche of complaints on Thursday for patent infringement against mobile phone manufacturers , including Google , the company that was beaten by him during the insolvency auction of Nortel .	-5.8118
Rockstar , the consortium that the Nortel patents bought for $ 4.5 billion , sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd , HTC Corp , Huawei , and four other companies for patent infringements before the US District Court in Texas .	-3.0162
Rockstar is a member of Apple , Microsoft , BlackBerry , Ericsson and Sony .	-2.0743
Google is accused of patent infringement in seven cases .	-1.7042
The patents concern technology that matches search terms on the Internet with relevant advertising , according to the complaint that thus hits the core of Google ’ s search engine business .	-4.4797
Representatives of Samsung , Huawei , HTC and Rockstar were not directly reachable .	-2.1031
Samsung , Huawei and HTC produce mobile phones that work with Google 's operating system Android , which is in sharp competition with the mobile products of Apple and Microsoft .	-3.6323
In 2011 , Google issued an initial bid over $ 900 million for the Nortel patents .	-2.5145

Egypt Sworns First Freely Elected Presidents	-2.5830
Mohammed Morsi takes office , but his day of triumph is not likely to mean the end of the political disputes in Egypt .	-3.8286
Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised a “ new Egypt , ” when he was the country ’ s first freely elected president to be sworn , and thus took the succession of Husni Mubarak , who had been displaced 16 months earlier .	-9.7510
With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court , Morsi became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and Egypt ’ s fifth head of state since the fall of the monarchy about 60 years ago .	-3.1806
He dismissed the oath before the 18 black robes judges of the Court , which has its seat on the Nile , and is replicated to an ancient Egyptian temple .	-6.0480
“ We are striving for a better future , a new Egypt and a second republic , ” said Morsi at the solemn ceremony broadcast live on state television .	-3.0745
“ Today , the Egyptian people laid the foundations for a new life – absolute freedom , genuine democracy and stability , ” said Morsi , a US-trained engineer and member of the Muslim Brotherhood , a fundamentalist group that , since its foundation 84 years ago , had been sharply targeted by the respective government as a banned organization .	-4.5483
Hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building when Morsi arrived in a small car convoy shortly after eleven hours of local time .	-3.4123
Only a few hundred followers had gathered in the court to cheer the new president , and , unlike the presidential spring of the Mubarak era , traffic was only shortly stopped so that the autoconvoi could cross the usually lively street that connects the city centre with the southern suburbs .	-6.1329
As an uncharismatic “ replacement wheel ” of the Brotherhood , his personal prestige has increased since his victory and a Friday speech , in which he presented himself not only as a candidate of Islamists , but all those who wanted to target the 2011 uprising against authoritarian Mubarak .	-4.2051
“ Today , Egypt is a civilian , national , constitutional , and modern state , ” the Morsi , dressed in a blue suit with red tie , explained to the judges in the wood-panelled chamber in which he took office .	-4.6051
Later , Morsi went to Cairo University , where he was supposed to make his inaugural speech .	-8.6154
He was officially welcomed by an army chapel that played the national anthem he listened to in handling .	-10.9444
The military leader Feldmarschall Hussein Tantawi was present .	-1.4787
On his arrival , he was welcomed by hundreds of people present in the largest auditory hall of the university with speakers of “ The army and the people are a hand . ”	-5.3227
The University of Cairo , built in 1908 as a bastion of secular education , developed into a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s .	-3.5386
On Friday , Morsi laid a symbolic oath at Tahir Square , the birthplace of the uprising that led last year to the end of Mubarak ’ s authoritarian rule , and praised to reclaim presidential powers that the Military Council had assumed from the Head of State hunted out of office .	-4.9867
But when the official oath is put to the court , and not before Parliament as usual , it bows to the will of the military , which indicates that the power struggle will continue .	-5.8967
Morsi ’ s speech in Tahir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures .	-1.6873

rapists in South Africa : twice lifelong detention	-2.8450
Nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa , the perpetrator was sentenced twice on Friday .	-2.6717
This was reported by SABC .	-2.4645
The victim later died of the consequences of serious injuries .	-2.8311
Johannes Kana had already been found guilty of crime at the beginning of the week .	-2.2055
The act had triggered horror nationwide .	-9.5186
The then 21-year-old had raped Anene Booysen in February in an industrial area in Bredasdorp near Cape Town .	-3.1029
14 hours the doctors fought for the victim 's survival , but in vain .	-2.7161
The sight of young people was so appalling that carers and sisters needed psychological assistance .	-2.6549
Kana admitted during the process to have been in a bar in reality with booys .	-3.4449
He also admitted to have beaten and raped them , but he denied responsibility for the death of the girl .	-3.4457
The police initially assumed several perpetrators , but released two suspects from prison because the evidence against them was not enough .	-4.2563
The Public Prosecutor also emphasized during the trial that she was convinced that Cana was alone at the time of the attack .	-7.4371
Rape is almost everyday in South Africa : there are about 64 000 announcements every year for sexual violence .	-3.7515
This is almost ten times as much as in Germany , but with 82 million people it has much more inhabitants than South Africa ( 50 million ) .	-3.6652
Police and women 's associations in South Africa appreciate the dark figures in the event of sexual violence , however , from 10 to 25 times .	-4.7351

Studies show that less time is spent on mathematics in English schools – 116 hours a year or three hours a week – than in most other countries .	-2.5858
On the other hand , Australian schools teach on average 143 hours a year , and students in Singapore receive 138 hours .	-2.6917
While there will be no formal requirement to spend more time on mathematics in the timetable , coalition cycles say that comprehensive mathematics testing – combined with a greater weighting of the specialist in ranking lists – will likely encourage schools to start more hours .	-8.6508

Salem : Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical Discussion Forum	-1.7583
The next Ecumenical Conversation Forum on Monday , October 21 , in the New Museum of the Castle deals with the theme " Zur Hölle mit der Hölle - Theological reflections on today 's handling of the last things " .	-4.8531
Speaker is Professor Johanna Rahner .	-1.5631
The Ecumenical Dialogue Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Protestant Church communities of Salem , Salem Castle and the Cultural Office of the Confederation .	-9.5678
In the forum , Johanna Rahner wants to examine how people today classify the " last things " after death .	-4.1883
Had people knew too much about it in the past centuries , placing them on the images of heaven and hell , " which still shape our ideas " , the contemporary prophetic teaching of the hopes of completion is more distinguished by a certain embarrassment or even lack of language .	-7.0840
" The greater hope has been heartily driven out by religious criticism by Christians , " says the speaker .	-3.8644
She ' provided us with so many question marks that the exclamation marks seem to have lost us ' .	-3.9814
Johanna Rahner continues to say : ' But the crucial challenge remains the annoyance of death ' .	-2.9690
This is the question of the longing , " who dreams that everything might be good at the end " .	-5.8285
Johanna Rahner , born in 1962 in Baden-Baden , studied Catholic theology and biology at the Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg from 1982 to 1989 .	-2.2082
In 1997 she received her doctorate as Dr. Theol .	-4.3700
The Habilitation for Fundamental Theology and Ecumenical Theology followed in 2003 at the Westphalian Wilhelms University .	-2.5964
Since 2010 , Johanna Rahner has held a Chair of Systematic Theology at the Institute of Catholic Theology at the University of Kassel .	-2.9098

Illmensee : Second mountain bike race enthusiasts participants	-2.1899
In splendid weather 214 bicycle riders came to Illmensee to complete the round course over the hills around the lake .	-4.9321
Ulrich Knobel of the organizing sports club Illmensee informs about this .	-3.8002
Among the participants , especially at the short distance of 15 kilometres and 300 metres above sea level , were also numerous wheelers who once wanted to practice their hobby in a competitive atmosphere .	-5.1975
Two junior drivers of the German top class were also at the start of this competition : Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came with the recommendation to be good places at the German Championships .	-5.6630
These two were expected to disappear from the field .	-4.4638
As in the previous year , Felix Bader was able to save a small time advance to the target and defended his title as the overall winner of the short distance .	-4.7128
Pascal Treubel ranked two again .	-4.2758
At the ladies it was Theresa Duelli of the nightmare team who made it at the top of the winning staircase .	-4.7275
Anne Adel from Illmensee and Leonie drivers came out of Owingen in two and three places .	-3.8812
A pleasant development is the growing number of drivers living or working in the community .	-3.1029
Not only in terms of performance was the whole range of athletes represented .	-3.8756
The age structure also ranged from ten years among the youngest to more than 70 years among the oldest starters .	-4.2219

The winner receives $ 250,000 to continue his extraordinary work .	-8.6957
For 21 years , Georges Bwelle saw his sick father losing consciousness and travelling to hospitals that did not have the means to help him .	-3.3415
Jamef Bwelle was injured in 1981 in a car accident near Yaoundé , the capital of Cameroon .	-2.3781
First he had only a broken arm , but then an inflammation was formed that spread to his brain and caused a hematom that should affect him for the rest of his life .	-4.8073
“ There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon , ” says Georges Bwelle .	-2.1537
We would have brought him out of Cameroon if we had the money .	-2.1900
Instead , Bwelle spent years accompanying his father in overcrowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer .	-2.9989
“ It is not easy , ” comments Bwelle .	-2.3648
You can leave the house at 5 o 'clock in the morning and race to the hospital to be the first , and is not the first .	-3.9797
There are many patients .	-1.4370
Some people even die because they have to wait .	-1.6004
The situation has hardly changed since Bwelle ’ s father died in 2002 .	-1.9945
In Cameroon there is only one doctor for 5,000 people each , according to the World Health Organization .	-7.6612
On the other hand , the relationship in the United States is with a doctor for 413 people .	-3.2835
But even if there were a doctor for them , most cameruns could not afford to visit .	-3.8007
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line , and nearly three-quarters of domestic health spending is private .	-2.9682
“ The only problem they have is poverty , ” says Bwelle .	-1.7685
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life .	-0.8695
His father and so many of his compatriots suffered to see in Bwelle the decision to do something about it matured .	-3.6823
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer performed 700 free operations last year .	-2.2273
He himself became a doctor and worked as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé .	-2.9112
He also founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME , which travels to rural areas on weekends and offers free medical care .	-3.7202
Since 2008 he and his volunteer group have helped nearly 32,000 people .	-2.0676
Almost every Friday , he and up to 30 people are forced into small buses and drive with the heated medical equipment on the roof over unattached terrain to the villages that need help .	-6.1131
It is not always smooth .	-2.6345
They had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud for more than once .	-2.8866
But when they arrive , they will be received like heroes : a festive dinner , singing and dance and the best accommodation that the place has to offer .	-4.4979
In these villages , free medical care is really a reason to celebrate and celebrate – with its broad smile and its limitless energy – enjoy the happy celebration .	-5.1528
The next morning the team begins to investigate hundreds of patients .	-2.8601
“ We treat 500 people per ride ” , says Bwelle .	-3.1052
They come from a 60 kilometre radius around the village – and that is on foot .	-4.0180
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas .	-2.3090
Many people are treated for malaria , tuberculosis , malnutrition , diabetes , parasites and sexually transmitted diseases .	-1.5002
Others receive crutches , donated glasses , or free birth certificates – a document that is required for the school , but that many poor families simply cannot afford .	-3.4630
In the evening , the team performs simple operations with local anaesthesia .	-2.7012
Operations usually take place in a school , the town hall or an apartment ; after the surgery , patients are up and go to the recreation area to make room for the neighbor .	-5.7919
The lighting for the OP and disinfection equipment is fed by the group 's generator and so Bwelle and its volunteers work until the early morning hours on Sunday .	-4.1707
It is an exhausting pension , but the village musicians usually help keep the team motivated .	-3.2519
“ You drum all night so that we can stay awake and continue our work , ” says Bwelle .	-3.9853
On Sunday the team then returns to the city , tired but proud of the work done .	-2.6991
The group – a mixture of Cameroon doctors and foreign medical students – carried out 700 free operations last year and knows that , with its work , it causes a huge difference to the people it helps .	-4.8703
One man explained that the free operation of a crash that he received now allows him to work again .	-4.3931
“ This changes the future of my family , ” the man said .	-2.4954
Besides the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital , Bwelle also works at night in private clinics in Yaoundé .	-3.2780
With this second job he financed 60 % of his non-profit activity , Bwelle said ; the rest come from private donations .	-3.9928
“ I really do not know when he sleeps , ” says Katie O 'Malley , who studied medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia in the second year and volunteers in Bwelles Group .	-3.5566
He is always either in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organisation so that he can go to these campaigns .	-3.7671
For medical and health care students , such as O 'Malley , who come from the US and Europe and support thresholds , this is an opportunity to gain practical experience that they would never have at home .	-4.0080
“ We can be involved in operations where we can help to step up blood or keep the instruments for Dr. Bwelle , ” explains O 'Malley .	-5.3207
This would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year .	-1.9259
Students normally pay their trip to Cameroon themselves and bring frequently donated sanitary material .	-3.6892
But once they are in Yaoundé , Bwelle takes over the accommodation , transport and guidance .	-4.6841
" He is undoubtedly a hero " , says O 'Malley .	-2.6820
He devotes his life to this organisation and his desire to help the Cameroon people knows no borders .	-2.7183
For Bwelle , the almost constant work is not a burden .	-3.4355
Helping others to live a happier life and thus fulfilling a promise that he gave to his father gives him great pleasure .	-12.9149
“ I am so happy to do this work , ” says Bwelle .	-2.7943
And I think of my father .	-1.1960
I hope he sees what I do .	-1.3099
I do it to make people laugh again and to relieve the pain .	-2.8066

Excellent Fight Mastered	-7.9667
The role of Santiago , the old man in Hemingway 's novel " The Old Man and the Sea " , is cut to the body Horst Janson .	-3.4144
Janson himself is an old hare in his metier , the art of actor .	-4.6724
No one can fool the old man Santiago in fishing .	-3.5256
So the two simply complement each other great .	-4.1883
You almost think you can see the wrinkles in the neck of the old man who speaks of the fisherman Manolo .	-4.3424
If Santiago sits tired of life on the chair , that is true with Janson .	-11.9446
In addition , the role of the old fisherman is through and through a character role that Janson masters excellently .	-4.1685
Hemingway told the story of a fighter , a courageous man who does not give up and ultimately wins the fight against fish through his knowledge and his will .	-3.6431
Janson is on stage for a long time as a single actor .	-4.7904
He manages to focus the attention of the audience on himself , so that his monologues are not boring for a moment .	-3.4343
His efforts to finally pull the fish onto the surface of the water are so real that the spectators forget that the sea consists of only blue illuminated water bottles .	-4.6075
Director Jens Hasselmann allows the old man to act in front of the fishing village .	-2.9969
In the course of the performance he highlights the active scene in each case : the hut of Santiago , the bar of singer Marie-Luise favourite , who with her songs and her splendid voice sings the feeling of Cuba 's life .	-6.7683

Meeting point for its guided tours is the service center of Cologne-Tourismus directly at the Duomo .	-3.5822
The tour starts quite unspectacularly : " We start in the underground garage " , says Schulze .	-3.2186
In the 1970s , the fathers wanted an autographic city , and therefore the remains of the old city wall remained only what was not too big .	-5.6043
Therefore , most users of the car park run by the Roman remains today and only park their car .	-6.4579
But those looking more closely will discover an archaeological site separated by metal grid rods in the Parkdeck D2 .	-5.0145
Approximately five metre high ruins from handle-sized stones can be seen .	-4.8741
" There are remains of the Roman wall built in the second half of the first century after Christ " , says Schulze .	-3.2708
Before returning to the daylight , Schulze gives the participants at the upper park level a glimpse into a dark , 15 metres deep shaft .	-5.4930
This is the fountain of the old cathedral , which unfortunately is hardly perceived .	-3.4536
The nearest station of the tour is the Prätorium , and here the participants go down to the depth .	-5.0377
Here we see the office of the once most powerful man north of the Alps , the Prätor of the CCAA .	-4.0141
What CCAA means is a visitor wants to know .	-2.2460
" The abbreviation stands for " Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium " , which in good English means as much as " City of Roman law and city of Agrippines , founded under Emperor Claudius at the place of the Altar for the Emperor 's Cult " .	-4.9621
And the Prätorium is the former Palace of Status , the centre of power of the Roman empire on the Rhine .	-3.9709
From the premises of the exhibition a tunnel access to the Roman wastewater channel is available here for about 120 metres .	-6.1066
" You can walk quietly along the so-called Cloaca Maxima , if you want , " Schulze encourages guests .	-5.1645
Schulze still has a surprise .	-1.3974
After getting the key at the box office , he leads the group to a 16 meter deep , walkable shaft .	-10.7754
" We are now in the Mikwe , a ritual Jewish bath , " he explains .	-1.9706
The Jewish community built its bath deeply into the ground to reach the groundwater that was essential for ritual washing .	-3.9422
To this day , the lower end of the Mikwe , whose origins dates back to the eighth century , can be read by changing levels of the Rhine .	-4.3595
The Mikwe will be part of an archaeological zone in the town hall square , for which the construction works will begin shortly .	-4.3204
However , a few years will pass by the end of the completi.	-5.3337
Almost hacked leg : Relaunch of rocker process	-4.9821
A bloody attack in the rocker milieu is re-rolled after more than four years .	-2.7571
A trial for attempted deaths , dangerous body injury , and property damage against two 30 years of age has begun before the District Court of Frankfurt ( Oder ) .	-5.5979
It is accompanied by strict security measures .	-2.0707
The defendants are silent to start .	-2.7662
They were supposed to have been active in the rocker scene and then listened to the bandidos .	-4.2000
The Public Prosecutor accuses them of joining three men in one car in June 2009 with unknown accomplices in Finowfurt .	-3.9877
All victims were seriously injured , a man almost lost his leg .	-2.5986
The victims should have listened to the competing Hells Angels group .	-3.2392
One should have been a high-level member of Berlin .	-2.0754
Apparently , a pursuit hunt with several cars was preceded .	-4.2224
According to indictment , it was a matter of spot fighting and a demonstration of power .	-5.0568
The two defendants had been released in a first trial in early 2012 .	-2.9436
One court spokesman said at the time that it was not possible to prove that men were actually involved in the bloody feud .	-4.3579
The perpetrators had worn masks and had not been recognized .	-1.9056
The Federal Court abolished the judgment after revision of the Prosecutor 's Office and referred it back to the district court for renewed negotiation . the the the . the the the the the . the the the	-10.7979
One of the defendants is currently in open enforcement for another offence .	-2.6362
The starting point was the reconstruction of the processes in reality .	-4.5909
As a witness , the Commissioner appointed at the time was invited .	-3.9708
At the centre were mobile phone calls from the accused and other persons who had listened to the police .	-4.8160
It is difficult that rockers in court almost always comply with a law for them - and not testify .	-5.4782
This also applies to the victims .	-1.7058
In the first trial , only one of the victims had wrapped up .	-8.2286
Public prosecutor Stefan Golfier of the Frankfurt Public Prosecutor ( Oder ) said on demand that new traces have emerged since the last procedure . .	-12.2091
Eleven further negotiating days are scheduled for the process .	-2.9228
The Disposed Society Don ’ t Think	-4.7648
The night was long , the music loud and the mood good , but at some point it goes home .	-3.4502
Only : Hunger becomes apparent in the peoples ' heads on the front-passenger and rear seats .	-6.3271
Clearly , one or other cocktail or sparkling wine may be responsible for this !	-4.0523
What is closer than going to the next drive in to treat yourself to a little bit ?	-5.7854
I admit that I am happy to participate when it comes to fast-food gathering late night or early morning .	-5.2239
A few pommes , a cola , a castle - and then nix as from home and into bed !	-4.3224
But on the way home the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco guys become apparent .	-4.6994
Because what is missing is that you always throw your fast food bags out of the auto window ? !	-5.6932
Especially during the weekends there are paper bags thrown away on the street edges and on parking spaces .	-4.8113
" Why ? " I wonder .	-1.4387
Are people too doof to take the bags home or the next bin ?	-3.9366
It is not only the case that the paper tool is shielding the landscape .	-5.1643
Bags have already hidden traffic facilities such as guide planks , causing accidents .	-4.0490
However , it does not think about what is said about ' disposable society ' , but it probably does not even know what that word actually means .	-6.9967
If you are travelling more often in the evening , especially with several people in the car , you know what a back bank can look like after celebrated nights : clothes , bottles and other garbage towers .	-6.1514
There would be a few bags more or less nix - unlike the street where nobody wants to trample on the food remains of others .	-5.5360
I already see the day when the towns and municipalities are going to be bloated - and the fast-food chains must demand deposit for their bags .	-13.8714
Obama ’ s Retreat in Health PolHeHHHHHHHHHHHH	-10.0533
After strong criticism , President Obama made a withdrawal yesterday in his frequently repeated , clear promise : “ If you like your health insurance , you can keep it . ”	-4.1366
After hundreds of thousands of insurers have received a letter of notice , Republicans have accused the president of misleading the American public in recent days .	-4.0191
Yesterday , Obama relativized his original promise .	-1.4509
“ The vast majority of citizens with functioning health insurance can retain them , ” he said in a speech in Boston .	-9.6515
In response to the numerous media reports on redundancies , Obama called on the Americans who received such communications to look for new insurance in the free market .	-5.3233
Most citizens could receive better , more comprehensive health insurance at the same price or cheaper than predicted .	-3.6246
“ You come a better offer , ” he said .	-1.9595
The government described it as little surprise that the five percent of the population , who themselves have insured , would have to look for another tariff , because their contract does not meet the new standards under the Affordable Care Act .	-5.9139
“ I would like to say to these Americans directly : they deserve better , ” Sebelius said at a hearing before the House of Representatives ’ Energy and Trade Committee in Washington .	-8.3278
Sebelius , who is responsible for implementing the Affordable Care Act , declared that the launch of the online platform has been “ miserable ” since October .	-3.1142
“ I am as frustrated and angry as everyone else , ” she said .	-2.2975
I am determined to recover your confidence .	-7.5759
This saying of an enlightened Seelius to a consultant behind her at yesterday 's hearing in the House of Representatives was added after a dispute with Republican MEP Billy Long from Missouri about whether she should be obliged to participate in Obamacare .	-6.4428
After more than three hours of hearing , Long Sebelius repeatedly pushed for the question of why the Affordable Care Act ’ s “ architect ” did not voluntarily renounce a state-sponsored insurance to conclude a tariff at HealthCare.gov , which she now wants to sell millions of Americans .	-13.4739
Government in Jerusalem does not confirm attack on Syria ’ s Air Base	-8.5492
An American government official who wanted to remain anonymous said on Thursday to the American news station CNN that Israeli warplanes had attacked an air base in Syria Latakia one day earlier .	-4.5408
The aim was ' missiles and equipment ' , which the Israeli Government feared had been intended for Lebanese Hezbollah , according to CNN .	-4.0346
Syrian and Lebanese media and the Arab broadcaster Al-Arabiya had previously reported that the base in the port town of Latakia had been shot on Thursday at night , and the Israelis blamed for it .	-4.5332
Israeli television channel 2 showed satellite images of the base in Latakia , where Russian defense missiles type S-125 Newa and a battery of SA-3 missiles , according to Channel 2 , have a reach of 35 kilometres and explosive heads can transport up to 70 kilograms . the , .	-11.8119
The government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack .	-2.6692
But the Reuters news agency quotes an equally anonymous Israeli government official saying that he believes that Israel has carried out the attack , but is not sure .	-3.9506
An Israeli Ministry of Defence spokesman said : ' We are not commenting on these reports ' .	-3.3905
The journalist Ron Ben-Yishai emphasized in the daily Yedioth Ahronoth that the Syrian regime sooner , partly successful , tried to deliver soil air missiles to Hezbollah .	-3.6592
The Israeli Government has repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to provide Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons would mean crossing a ' red line ' that would follow a military response .	-3.1948
John Kerry explains in an unprecedented admission that the US spy has “ gone too far inappropriately . ”	-3.8335
John Kerry , with an unexpected admission , suggested a weakening of the US ’ s defensive attitude to its surveillance programs by saying that , in certain cases , spying has “ gone too far inappropriately . ”	-5.2362
The Foreign Minister also acknowledged that , together with Barack Obama , he was responsible for turning on “ autopilot ” when the explosive revelations of the whistleblower Edward Snowden about NSA ’ s spy activities became public .	-4.6717
By leaking information , the US administration has fallen into a diplomatic storm of indignation from its allies .	-3.5341
At a video binding speech at the Open Government Conference in London , Kerry said : “ There is no doubt that the president and I , as well as others in the government , have learnt of a few things that have almost gone by autopilot simply because there was a capacity to do what was due to the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War and , of course , 11 September . ”	-7.5530
He then admitted as the first senior member of the US administration that the US spy had crossed a border , but also emphasized that no rights had been abused .	-4.5646
He said : “ In some cases , this has gone too far . ”	-2.5537
The President is determined to create clarity and is therefore carrying out a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel that there is abuse here .	-4.7196
I assure you that the rights of innocent people are not affected in this process .	-2.2631
Kerry insisted , however , that the NSA was a force of good and that its surveillance processes saved many lives .	-4.1445
He added : “ We are dealing with a new world in which people are prepared to blow themselves into the air . ”	-2.6395
There is a radical extremism in the world that is eager to kill , blow in the air , and attack governments .	-3.5702
So what if we were able to stop and stop this before it happens ?	-3.9790
We have indeed prevented aircraft crashes , attacks on buildings and the murder of people , because we have learned from such plans in the run-up to this kind of plan .	-5.0628
Meanwhile , US legislators will travel to Europe to dispel concerns about alleged American espionage and convince Europeans of the need to continue working with the US in the anti-terrorist efforts , as the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said on Thursday .	-4.8292
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said that he spoke to representatives of the European Parliament and other people this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorist organisations due to the frustration about the National Security Agency monitoring .	-4.6276
“ It is very important for US national security interests that Europeans remain on board with regard to our joint efforts against terrorism , ” explained Murphy , who is first in the Senate as a Democrat and chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Relations and European Affairs , in an interview in Washington .	-4.5657
I also go to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism , regardless of their anger about the NSA programmes .	-3.4333
Media reports that the NSA has collected millions of telephone data in Europe have burdened relations with some US allies , although the head of the intelligence service this week stated that the reports are inaccurate and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and exchanged with the United States .	-4.1770
Other revelations quoted from documents passed on by Snowden , according to which the NSA monitored the mobile phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of state worldwide .	-4.2524
The head of national intelligence services , James Clapper , defended spying among allies as necessary and declared that this is common on both sides .	-3.5005
In all the tumult , Murphy said that his authority is preparing the trip of the Congress that is due to take place this year , and hoped that the delegation would include members from both parties and chambers .	-3.9377
The names of the other participating Members will be published in the coming days .	-2.8759
He said that the exact itinerary is still being drawn up .	-8.8398
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the journey was to improve relations , he also said that there would be some “ serious words . ”	-3.0045
He said that European governments should be honest about the type of spy programmes that they themselves have been using for years .	-3.8957
“ Although we can change our monitoring programmes and thus better protect Europeans ’ rights , they must also accept the fact that we are not the only ones who spy , ” Murphy said .	-4.6529
Meanwhile , for John Kerry , a weekend trip to the Middle East and Poland stands to address the grief about the US strategy in Syria , Egypt , and Iran , as well as US surveillance activities .	-5.1641
A stubborn injury to the jumping joint threatens to prevent the use of Nicolai Müller in the Bundesliga Foreign League match of FSV Mainz 05 at the FC Augsburg .	-4.4072
Mainz wants to use Nicolai Müller .	-3.2715
Tomorrow he will try to train with the team .	-1.5252
So far , he could only do so individually .	-3.3803
" We will decide on his deployment in the short term , " said Trainer Thomas Tuchel .	-3.0632
The 40-year-old hopes to have his best goal shooters with six hits .	-3.2825
Because the Mainzers already have to abandon the injured service providers Niki Zimling , Julian Baumgartlinger and Niko Bungert .	-4.1354
Australia appeals against prison sentence in Thailand	-2.6783
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney , who was sentenced to 15 days in Phuket for falsely claiming to have been raped by a taxi driver , appealed against the judgment and was released on bail .	-4.0303
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty by a provincial court in Phuket on 15 June to have made a false message after indicating to the Thai police that a local taxi driver raped it in the morning hours on Sunday 10 June , while two other men held it .	-4.6632
Later , however , the recordings of a video camera showed that she had safely entered her hotel after being separated from her Australian friend .	-3.8255
The police in Phuket interrogated Bamford for two days until they were able to think about history .	-4.1510
Until the trial , she was in police detention on the ground .	-3.9351
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a low-level prison on the periphery of Phuket , rather than in a prison for adult women .	-3.9133
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks , a former player of the Australian Rubgy League , who addressed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra with the request for help for his daughter .	-3.3099
Tunks explained to the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family is “ extremely concerned ” about the well-being of his daughter and wanted to have it back in Australia .	-3.2288
“ We are of course very concerned , but we hope that she will be back at home as soon as possible , ” said Tunks .	-3.7707
Bamford has appealed against the judgment and is opposed to a deposit of 50,000 Baht on its .	-3.6923
In Australian reports it was reported that in the meantime she made holidays in the resort of Krabi in South Thailand .	-4.9204
It was heard from the court that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and was warned that the appeal could also lead to a higher penalty of up to two years in a prison for adults .	-4.2068
However , after the recent murder of the Michelle Smith travel agency in Phuket , Thailand may also seek to improve its troubled tourist image , which is why there is a freedom .	-6.6543
