Members of all the parties to the National Assembly have concerns that they could suspend themselves .	-4.3427
One Labour MEP said that his group ' rides with Twp and Pwp ' .	-3.8139
Note for the reader : “ twp ” in Welsh means “ fired ” and “ pwp ” means “ cock ” .	-4.0261
One member of Plaid Cymru said that the group as a whole is ' unhappy ' and has proposed alternatives .	-2.2363
One Welsh Conservative said that his group would be “ open ” to a name change , but pointed out that it is only a short verbal leap from “ MWP ” ( member of the Welsh Parliament ) to “ Muppet . ”	-4.1771
Note : The Welsh letter W is pronounced similar to the U in English .	-2.6994
The National Assembly Commission , which is currently working on a bill for name changes , said : “ The final decision on the designation of members of the National Assembly naturally lies with the members themselves . ”	-4.1538
The 2017 Government of Wales Act allowed the Welsh Parliament to change its name .	-2.2966
Last June , the Commission published the results of a public hearing on the proposals that broadly support the change in the name of the Welsh Parliament .	-3.9271
On the issue of the title of Members of the Assembly , the Commission preferred Welsh MEPs or WMPs , but the MWP option received most support in a public survey .	-4.6303
Members of the Welsh Parliament seem to propose alternative options , but the fight to reach a consensus could cause headaches to the Chairman Elin JONES , who is expected to present a bill for these changes in the coming weeks .	-4.9918
The legislation on reforms will involve changes in the functioning of the Assembly , including the rules for disqualifying members of the Welsh Parliament and the design of the exchange system .	-4.3844

The referendum is held to settle a decades of dispute with neighbouring Greece , where a province bears the name of Macedonia .	-2.8204
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim to its territory and has repeatedly objected to his application for admission for the EU and NATO .	-3.3911
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov , an opponent of the referendum on name change , has said that he will ignore the vote .	-2.3749
However , those in favour of the referendum , including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev , argue that the name change is quite simply the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO .	-3.5527
The bells of St. Martin silence because churches in Harlem have problems .	-2.5654
'Historically , the old people with whom I spoke said that there was a bar and a church at every corner ' , said Mr Adams .	-3.1673
'Today there is neither . '	-2.5046
He said that the disappearance of pubs is understandable .	-1.3163
" People link comtacts in a different way , " he said nowadays .	-3.3124
'Pubs are no longer a living room in the neighbourhood where you meet regularly ' .	-3.4076
As far as churches are concerned , he fears that money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders expect .	-3.1096
Churches could be replaced by multi-family homes with property homes filled with the kind of people who will not help the remaining refuge sites of the district .	-4.6407
The overwhelming majority of people who buy property homes in these buildings will be aware , he said , ' and will therefore speed up the day when these churches are closed entirely because it is unlikely that most of those people who move into these property homes will become members of these churches ' .	-5.4605
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis in 1870 – Metropolitan Community , St. Martin 's a decade later .	-2.7716
The original white methodist community expelled in the 1930 ’ s .	-3.2162
A black community that practiced a religion nearby acquired the building .	-3.4117
St. Martin 's was taken over by a black community under the parish John Howard Johnson , who led a boycott of retailers on the 125th street , a main street for shopping in Harlem , which opposed the attitude or promotion of black people .	-5.0476
A fire in 1939 left the building seriously damaged , but when Father Johnson ’ s municipal members made plans for reconstruction , they commissioned the bell game . the the .	-12.8793
Pfarrer David Johnson , son of Father Johnson and successor to St. Martin 's , proudly called the bells of the po.	-3.4465
The expert who played the bell game in July called it another thing : " A cultural treasure " and " an irreplaceable historical instrument " .	-3.0767
The expert , Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan , also noted that it was the first bell game in the world played by a black musician , Dionisio A. Lind , who switched to the bigger bell game at the Riverside Church 18 years ago .	-3.9233
Mr Merriweather said that St. Martin 's did not replace him .	-1.2789
What has happened to St. Martin in recent months has been a complicated history of architects and construction contractors , some have been introduced by the lay leaders of the church , others by the bishop 's diocese .	-5.6937
The sacristy – the leading body of the parish composed of lay leaders – wrote to the diocese in July with the concern that the diocese ' would try to pass on the costs to the sacristy ' , although the sacristy was not involved in the appointment of the architects and contractors of the diocese .	-5.4109
Some community members lamented a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese .	-2.3870

I was torn !	-2.3089
His entire key leg was torn up , Hammel said he found this when he came to the boy .	-4.1603
I shouted everyone to get out of the water : " There 's a shark in the water ! " said Hammel .	-3.8351
The boy was brought to the Rady Children 's Hospital in San Diego , where his condition was critically documented .	-2.9814
The shark responsible for the attack is unknown .	-1.3183
Rescue swimmers Captain Larry Giles said at a media meeting that a shark had been viewed a few weeks earlier in the area , but it was found that this is not a dangerous shark .	-4.1936

The idea of investing in the beauty market is that supermarkets are looking for ways to use the shelf space used for television , microwaves and household goods for new products .	-4.4229
Sainsbury announced that the range of beauty products will be doubled to 3000 products , including brands such as Revlon , Essie , Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw .	-3.6896
Existing assortments of L 'Oreal , Maybelline and Burt 's Bees will also be given more space in brand areas , similar to those found in shops like boats .	-3.9225
The supermarket chain also revives its own makeup brand “ Boutique ” , which has many vegan products on offer among young buyers .	-4.5004
In addition , the perfume dealer Fragrance Shop tests concessions in two Sainsbury shops , which opened the first last week in Croydon , South London , while a second end of this year will be opened in Selly Oak , Birmingham .	-4.1040
Online shopping and a shift to the daily purchase of small quantities of food in neighbourhood shops mean that supermarkets need to do more to get people to visit .	-10.2032
Mike Coupe , the head of Sainsbury 's , has said that the sales points will increasingly look like shopping houses , as the supermarket chain is trying to combat discounters like Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food .	-4.3282
Sainsbury 's has placed Argos outlets in hundreds of shops and has also introduced a number of habitats since it bought both chains two years ago , allegedly strengthening food sales and making acquisitions more profitable .	-3.3252
The former attempt by the supermarket to revise its beauty and pharmacy departments ended with failure .	-2.5972
Sainsbury tested a joint venture with boats in the early 2000 ’ s , but it ended undecided , and the revenue from the pharmacies ’ shops could not be shared .	-3.8907
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury 's sold its 281 branch pharmacy business three years ago to Celesio , the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain .	-3.1621
According to information , Lloyds is also to be involved .	-4.7653
Paul Mills-Hicks , Sainsbury ’ s advertising chief , said : “ We have changed the appearance of our shelves for beauty products to improve the equipment for our customers .	-3.8503
In addition , we have invested in training employees who are supposed to assist the customer .	-4.0976

It should be their long-term future and secure it for decades to come .	-2.7150

Nobody could believe what happened on Tuesday – so soon before the start .	-8.9055
" At Marlow HQ there is a warehouse full of goods that can be sold . "	-2.8916

Trump adopted a much more optimistic stance in his rally speech .	-2.1263
“ We are making good progress with North Korea , ” he said .	-1.3681
“ We wanted to wage war with North Korea .	-1.2442
Millions of people would have been killed .	-1.0164
Now we have this great relationship . ”	-2.0587
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have brought positive results , such as ending missile tests , liberating hostages , and transferring the mortal remains of American soldiers home .	-3.8749
And he defended his unusual approach when he talked about relations with Kim .	-1.9118
" It is so easy to be presidential , but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to enter this full-packed arena , about 200 people would be there , " said Trump and showed the crowd directly before him .	-5.2584

After the earthquake in Lombok , for example , foreign non-governmental organisations were told that they were not needed .	-2.1496

Unfortunately , given the earthquakes that Indonesia is constantly enduring , the country is not well prepared for the forces of nature .	-3.5913
While the tsunami protection rooms were built in Aceh , which is not common for other coastal lines .	-4.1034
The obvious absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu , although a warning was already in force , is likely to have contributed to the loss of human lives .	-3.4188
Even under favourable conditions , travelling between the many islands of Indonesia is difficult .	-2.4337
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated .	-1.0649

Perhaps the wrong cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the last century .	-2.1836
Sir William Hamo Thornycroft ’ s magnificent presentation of Cromwell testifies to the opinion that prevailed in the nineteenth century and that parts of the history are still dominant : that Cromwell is worth celebrating .	-10.8339

In the course of the near 50th anniversary of bloody retaliation against students , Mexican president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador never vowed to use military violence against civilians .	-4.2880
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that the military never used to repress the Mexican people .	-2.7870
On 2 October 1968 , troops had ended a peaceful demonstration of left-wing student groups with arms force , killing around 300 people .	-3.9153

The US should Double Artificial Intelligence Spending	-11.8615
While China becomes more active in artificial intelligence , the US should double its research investment , says Kai-Fu Lee , investor , and AI practitioner who worked for Google , Microsoft , and Apple .	-2.5399
These demands arose after US government members made announcements on AI , even though the US lacks a formal AI strategy .	-3.8694
Meanwhile , China presented its plan last year : by 2030 , it wants to be number 1 in the field of AI innovation .	-3.7634
“ Doubling expenditure on AI research would be a good start , given that all other countries are far behind the US , and a breakthrough in AI research is about to take place , ” said Lee .	-4.1936
Doubling funding could double the chances that the next achievement in the field of artificial intelligence will be achieved in the US , Lee CNBC said in an interview this week .	-3.4342
Lee , whose book “ AI Superpower : China , Silicon Valley and the New World Order ( AI Superpowers : China , Silicon Valley , and the New World Order ) ” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt , is CEO of Sinovation Ventures , a company that has invested in one of the most famous Chinese AI companies , Face + + .	-3.0790
In the 1980 ’ s , he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that defeated the high-ranking American Othello player , and later became leader at Microsoft Research and president of Google ’ s Chinese subsidiary .	-4.7667
Lee has acknowledged the US administration ’ s previous technology competitions , such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( US Defense Research Agency ) , and wondered when the next would take place to identify the next visionaries .	-12.7626
“ Researchers in the US often have to work very hard to obtain state grants , ” Lee said .	-3.0381
“ Not China is responsible for the outflow of high-level scientists , but the companies , ” Lee noted .	-3.2717
Facebook , Google , and other technology companies have hired university coryphia in recent years to work on AI .	-3.3601
Lee said that a change in immigration policy could also help the US to step up its AI efforts .	-9.4367
“ I think Green Cards should be offered automatically in AI doctoral candidates , ” he said .	-2.6536

Macedonia votes in a referendum on whether to change the country 's name .	-3.1027
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday whether their name should be changed to ' Republic of Northern Macedonia ' , a step that would resolve a decades of dispute with Greece that had blocked its accession offers for the European Union and NATO .	-4.1935
Greece , which has a province called Macedonia , insists that the name of its northern neighbour is a territorial claim to the Greek territory , and has vetoed the country 's entry into NATO and the EU .	-2.9152
The two governments concluded an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name , but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority population of Macedonia .	-2.6521
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he will not vote in the referendum , and , given a boycott campaign , there is doubt as to whether the result will create the 50 % hurdle , which is a prerequisite for the referendum ’ s validity .	-4.2884
The question on the referendum was : ' Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with the adoption of the agreement with Greece ? '	-2.7400
Advocates of the name change , including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev , argue that it is worth the price of continuing admission to institutions such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia , one of the countries that is supposed to emerge from the collapse of Yugoslavia .	-3.8345
“ I came today to vote on the country ’ s future , it is a decision for young people in Macedonia to live freely under the umbrella of the European Union , because that means a life in greater security for all of us , ” said Olivera Georgievska , 79 , in Skopje .	-4.6653
Although not legally binding , enough honourable Members have said that they will abide by the outcome of the vote so that it becomes crucial .	-3.6407
A two-thirds majority in Parliament is required to change the name .	-2.5558
The National Election Committee said at 1 p.m. that there were no reports of irregularities .	-4.2799
But turnout was only 16 % – at the same time , the figure was 34 % in the last parliamentary election in 2016 , and , in the end , 66 % of registered voters cast their .	-4.5524
“ I went for my children – our place is in Europe , ” said Gjose Tanevski , 62 , a voter in the capital Skopje .	-2.9213
Macedonia ’ s Prime Minister , Zoran Zaev , his wife Zorica and his son Dushko , voted in favour of the referendum in Macedonia on changing the name of the country , which would pave him the way to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica , Macedonia , on 30 September 2018 .	-3.7747
In front of the parliament in Skopje , Vladimir Kavardarkov , 54 , prepared a small stage and put chairs in front of the tents set up by those who will boycott the referendum .	-11.3819
" We are in favour of NATO and the EU , but we want to take part with the heads up , not through the door , " said Kavadarkov .	-3.0944
" We live in a poor country , but we also have our dignity .	-1.8766
If you do not want to welcome us as Macedonia , we can turn to others , such as China and Russia , to join us in Euro-Asian integration . ”	-2.8217
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will bring urgently needed investment to Macedonia , a country with an unemployment rate of more than 20 % .	-1.8253
“ I believe that a large majority will vote in favour , because more than 80 % of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO , ” said Zaev after his vote .	-3.7457
According to him , the “ yes ” result would be a “ strengthening of our future . ”	-7.0443
Last Monday , the Macedonian Institute for Political Research published the results of a survey : between 30 and 43 % of voters would therefore participate in the vote – less than necessary .	-3.0916
Another survey conducted by Macedonia ’ s Telma TV found that 57 % of respondents will vote on Sunday .	-2.3267
Of those who want to participate , 70 % said yes .	-3.1820
The referendum will only be adopted if the turnout is more than 50 % .	-10.1852
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government ’ s policy since it took over in May last year .	-10.3492
Reputation : Sergio Agüero of Manchester City overcomes the entire Brighton defense on the way to the gate .	-3.3162
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling did Brighton ’ s defense at the Manchester City 2-0 victory on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester , England .	-2.9206
Aguero made his hit incredibly simple in the 65th minute .	-2.7086
At the beginning of the game sequence the Argentine Stormer received a pass in the middle field .	-3.2460
He tricked three defenders of Brighton to release himself .	-8.7107
Then Agüero saw himself surrounded by three green shirts .	-1.9545
He circumvented a defender before he ran several players on the edge of the Brighton Penalty .	-10.6492
Then he made a pass to the left and gave off to Sterling .	-3.1382
The English stormer used his first contact to return the ball to Agüero , which then shot with the right – past Brighton Torwart Mathew Ryan to the right side of the gate .	-4.7207
“ Aguero has foot problems , ” City Manager Pep Guardiola said to the reporters .	-2.3480
" We spoke about it ; he played 55 , 60 minutes .	-2.5712
That has happened .	-1.1258
Fortunately , he shot a gate at the moment . ”	-1.9806
However , it was sterling that initially led the Sky Blues in the Premier League Duel :	-3.2315
The gate came in the 29th minute	-1.5223
In the game , Aguero played the ball deep in the territory of Brighton .	-2.6712
with a nice steep pass to Leroy Sané along the left side .	-2.3658
Sane made a couple of touches before leading Sterling to the remote post .	-3.3207

But the hard-fought joker hopes to climb the hill on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies , but only if there are still playoff implications for the rockies that have a lead from a game in front of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West .	-4.5682
The rockies won at least one place on Friday evening with a 5 : 2 victory over the nationals , but the title gain in the first league is still not secure .	-5.3086

The Labour Party is no longer a broad community .	-1.1477
It is intolerant of those who say what they think .	-1.0348
As momentum activists in my local party voted to criticise me , it was hardly a surprise .	-2.2957

Most of my time in the eight years as a local Labour MEP , the GC meetings on Friday evening were exactly the same .	-3.2175
Unfortunately , it is not the tone of many meetings today , and the promise of a ' more friendly , softer ' policy has long since been forgotten if it has ever started .	-3.9944
It has become increasingly clear that different views in the Labour Party are not tolerated , and any opinion is judged by whether it is acceptable to the party leadership .	-4.2729
This began shortly after Jeremy took office , because the colleagues with whom I had previously thought I had a similar political attitude were expecting me to reverse and adopt positions that I would otherwise never have agreed with , be it on national security or the EU internal market .	-6.1141
Whenever I express myself publicly – and it does not matter what I say – a tirade of abuse in the social media , which calls for elections , denounces the Centre ’ s policy and tells me that I should not be in the Labour Party .	-4.8503
This experience has not only made me .	-3.4104
I do indeed know that there is more luck than some of my colleagues , because the comments that are addressed to me tend to be political .	-3.9246
I appreciate the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who are exposed to a flood of sexist or racist abuse every day , but never shy away .	-3.6026
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the extent of abuse has normalized .	-2.3494
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance .	-1.5804
The reality is that we are no longer the broad church and , with every motion of censure or amendment of the selection rules , the party is becoming smaller .	-4.0960
I have received a lot of advice over the past two years to collect my neck , not to be so vocal , and then I would be “ in order ” .	-4.9640
But that is why I have not come to politics .	-3.2882
Thirty-two years ago , I joined Labour as a student , because of the neglect of the Thatcher Government , which led to my classroom literally collapsing , and as a result I tried to promote better public services for those who need it most , whether as a municipal council or minister .	-5.7478

But the only message I have is not at Nottingham momentum , but at my constituents , whether Labour members or not : I am proud to serve you , and I promise you that no threats to election or political opportunities will prevent me from working in what I believe is the best interest of all of you .	-4.8112

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose : Ayr unbeaten at the top	-1.6772
Two late Tries may have distorted the final result somewhat , but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this wonderfully entertaining Tennent 's premiership match of the day .	-9.2006
They are now the only unbeaten of the ten teams to list the table .	-4.1538
The coach Peter Murchie was very satisfied with this .	-4.3906
" We have been tested so far by our games and we are still unbeaten , so I must be happy , " he said .	-2.8226
Robyn Christie von Melrose said : “ Thanks to Ayr , they have made better use of their opportunities . ”	-2.2909
Grant Anderson ’ s attempt in the 14th minute , transformed by Frazier Climo , brought Ayr forward , but a yellow card for Scotland ’ s captain Rory Hughes , given for the game of Warriors , allowed Melrose to speak numbers , and Jason Baggot to gather an untransformed attempt .	-4.0609
Climo envisaged the leadership of Ayr with a punishment before he achieved a hit directly at the mid-term and then made a solo visit to the 17 : 5 break for Ayr .	-7.0271
But Melrose began the second half well and Patrick Anderson 's attempt , transformed from Baggot , reduced the backlog to five points .	-3.6340
After the reboot , Ayr built the lead when a Try was transformed by Stafford McDowall-von Climo .	-5.1987
Ayr 's current captain Blair Macpherson then got the yellow card , and again Melrose paid the additional man with an unconverted Bruce Colvine attempt at the end of a curse of fierce pressure .	-4.1969
However , the home page came back , and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card from the criminal border due to a tackling without a ball of climo , MacPherson made a touchdown , the advancing Ayr in the back .	-11.1073

“ We are about to regain access to the Pacific Ocean , ” he praised at the end of August .	-2.2382
Some analysts , however , consider it unlikely that the Court will decide in favour of Bolivia , and believe that even a positive decision for Bolivia will not bring about any change .	-3.6221
The Dutch UN body has no authority to grant Chilean territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks .	-3.3793
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice came about only six months after hearing the final arguments shows that the case was ' not complicated ' , said Paz Zárate , a Chilean expert on international law .	-3.7274

Thom Browne showed a number of bizarre masks - and just in time for Halloween .	-1.6626
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter rather than Haute Couture .	-3.0843

The oversized hats have glued to the heels of " La Bomba " , the straw hat with a 60 cm wide edge , which can be seen from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski .	-4.1157

Independent schools in Scotland have a track record of top academic quality , which continued in 2018 with excellent audit results , including individual and group successes in sport , art , music , and other Community enterprises .	-5.1089
With over 30,000 students throughout Scotland , these schools , represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools ( SCIS ) , strive to offer their pupils and parents the best level of service .	-3.1199
Independent schools are designed to prepare students – for further education , including universities , for their desired career and for their role as global citizens .	-3.7667
In the education sector , we have the opportunity to develop and implement a tailor-made school curriculum , noting that modern languages are still popular and desired in schools .	-3.8742
Nelson Mandela once said this : “ When you speak to a man in the language he understands , you reach his mind . ”	-3.1079
When you speak to him in his own language , he goes to his heart . ”	-2.3721
This shows impressively that we cannot rely solely on English if we want to build relations and trust with people from other countries .	-12.5337
The audit results of this year show that languages are at the top of the tables with the highest existing rates in independent schools .	-3.5767
68 percent of students who have studied foreign languages have reached the so-called “ Higher grade A ” higher class A .	-11.3761
The data collected by the 74 member schools of the SCIS showed that 72 percent of students reached a “ higher grade A ” in Mandarin , while among the students who learned German , French and Spanish , 72 , 69 and 63 reached note A each .	-4.9443
This shows that independent schools in Scotland promote foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future .	-2.2896
Language subjects have the same rank in independent schools and elsewhere as MINT subjects ( mathematics , information technology , science and technology ) .	-2.8929
A 2014 survey by the British Employment and Qualifications Commission found that 17 % of the reasons why employers had difficulty filling vacancies are attributable to a lack of language skills .	-3.8481
Therefore , language skills are becoming increasingly necessary to prepare young people for their professional future .	-3.2497
Given more promising employment opportunities that require languages , these skills are essential in a globalised world .	-3.0203
Regardless of the career that someone chooses when he has learned a second language , he will have a real advantage in the future with a lifelong ability like this .	-3.9032
Through the ability to communicate directly with people from abroad , a multilingual person will automatically be ahead of the competitors .	-2.9376
According to a YouGov survey with more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013 , 75 % were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation , and French is the only language spoken with a double-digit percentage , 15 % .	-3.4016
That is why the current investment in language teaching is important for today 's children .	-3.1535
When children learn to speak multiple languages – especially those of developing countries – they will later have better chances of finding a meaningful job in the labour market .	-4.2025
Schools in Scotland differ in terms of their language range .	-3.0219
Some schools focus on classical modern languages , while other languages that are most important for Britain in 2020 , such as Mandarin or Japanese .	-3.2997
Whatever your child is interested , a number of languages will always be available in independent schools , with teachers specialized in this field .	-3.4042
Independent schools in Scotland want to provide a learning environment that is well prepared for children , and they should be given the necessary tools for their success whatever the future may bring .	-4.6444
In today ’ s global business world , languages remain undeniably important for the country ’ s future , and this must also be reflected in education .	-3.3685
Indeed , modern languages should be truly regarded as “ international communication skills . ”	-2.2732
Independent schools will continue to offer young people in Scotland this choice , diversity and top quality .	-2.4101

It is the first of five planned electoral events next week , and Trump also visits the Republican-friendly states of Tennessee and Mississippi on his tour .	-3.9899
While his candidate ’ s confirmation of the vacant post of the Supreme Court remains outstanding , Trump must mobilize his electorate for the forthcoming mid-term elections , otherwise it is feared that Republicans will lose the majority in Congress when elected in November .	-10.9748

You can follow Trump ’ s West Virginia Rally online via live stream on YouTube .	-2.3875
Trump will certainly refer to the hearings that will take place this week on the allegations of sexual abuse against his Supreme Court candidate , Brett Kavanaugh , whose confirmation of the Senate has been postponed at least a week until the FBI investigation has been completed .	-12.7199
The main objective of these electoral events , however , is to mobilise the Republicans , who are about to hold a decisive election in November .	-4.2362
According to Reuters , the aim of Trump ’ s campaign is to mobilize volunteers and supporters with next week ’ s five electoral events to defend and expand the majority of Republicans in the Senate and House of Representatives .	-8.9764
“ Congressional majority is first on the president ’ s agenda , so he visits as many states as possible just before the turbulent election season starts , ” a spokesman of the Trump campaign , who namely does not want to be mentioned , told Reuters .	-6.4323
According to the radio network West Virginia MetroNews , tonight 's Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract the attention of the Pittsburgh media .	-3.6709
On Saturday , Trump West Virgina , the federal state he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016 , will visit for the second time this month .	-2.4386

According to Reuters , Simon Haeder , Politologist at the University of West Virginia , said that it was not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come to improve his polls .	-3.6215
Ryder Cup 2018 : The USA team is ready to fight to sustain the hope of Sunday singles .	-3.3244
After three unilateral meetings , the four games on Saturday afternoon were probably exactly what the Ryder Cup needed .	-2.9574
The swinging pendulum is a freely invented sports concept that players have internalised , especially in competitions like this .	-3.6637
So where would they say is the dynamic now ?	-2.0888
“ They had a six-point lead , and now there are four , so it is likely to give us a bit of momentum , ” Jordan Spieth said when he withdrew for the day . ”	-4.4989
Europe is , of course , in the advantage of 4 points , and 12 more are still to be played .	-4.2723
The Americans , as Spieth says , feel a little wind in their sails , and there was much encouraging for them , not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas , who played together all day long and each has three out of four points .	-19.1778
From the beginning , Spieth was superior and went ahead with a good .	-4.3947
This bold cry became louder when his round continued , he lost a decisive putt to reach a draw in game 4 after he and Thomas returned 2 points after 2 matches .	-6.1795
His joy of the putt on the 15th hole with which they won the game was so that one thought he still believed in the Americans ’ victory .	-4.2285
" You really have to concentrate strongly and just worry about your own game , " said Spieth .	-3.4519
This is all that remains for each of these players .	-3.7485
18 holes to leave an impression .	-1.7536
In the last two days , Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood were the only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas .	-3.0901
Europe ’ s strange , but admirable couple is playing flawless and just doing everything right .	-4.4437
" Moliwood " was the only couple who did not reach a bogey on Saturday afternoon , but they also avoided it on Saturday morning , Friday afternoon and Friday morning the rear nine .	-4.0403
This race and the way their energy seems to flow to and from this abandoned amount of spectators makes them the favorites on Sunday and when the sun goes down over Le Golf National , there would be no more popular player who seals a possible European victory than Fleetwood or Molinari .	-5.5311
Probably both at the same time on different holes .	-2.6241
To talk about a European victory now would be too hasty .	-2.4848
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a short process with Sergio Garcia , who won with his partner Alex Noren in the morning .	-2.5959
With a bogey and two doubles on the first nine , the Spaniard and the Swede died into a hole from which they never came out again .	-3.8484
On Sunday there is no one to help you out of your hole .	-2.8835
Because of the interactions between the couples , the given advice , the ungiven advice and the way in which a strategy can change in a handy manner , it is very fascinating to observe the fourballs and foursomes at close proximity .	-6.0616
As a team , Europe has played better and has taken a clear lead over the last day , but this Foursome session has also demonstrated that the US team has the desire to fight , which some , especially stateside , have doubted .	-6.2972
Europe leads 10-6 at the Ryder Cup Final Day	-2.2946
Europe will benefit from a solid advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup , having emerged from the four and four games on Saturday with a 10-6 leadership over the United States .	-4.1310
The inspired Duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the group with two victories over a fighting Tiger Woods to bring its previous balance sheet to four points in the Le Golf National .	-3.4951
The European team of Thomas Bjorn , who came to preserve the trophy she lost two years ago in Hazeltine , dominated an American team fighting with suspenders , and won the series with 3-1 .	-5.1005
The US offered more resistance in the fourth and won two games , but they could not digest the deficit .	-11.4211
The Jim Furyk team needs eight points from the 12 single matches of Sunday to keep the trophy .	-10.0754
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row , while he and Molinari , after a sensational weekend called " Molliwood " , are only the second couple to win four points from their first four games in the history of the Ryder Cup . the .	-9.1293
After breaking Woods and Patrick Reed into the fourballs , it was considered certain that they would beat a sobered woods and American Rookie Bryson Dechambeau by an even clearer 5 & 4 .	-4.3244
Woods , who slept through two games on Saturday , occasionally showed brilliant actions , but he has lost 19 of his 29 games in four-balls and four-balls and seven in a row .	-4.4795
Justin Rose , rested for the morning fourballs , returned to his partner Henrik Stenson in the Foursomes and beat in a 2 & 1 defeat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – place one and three in the world .	-3.3302
On a pleasant , airy day southwest of Paris , however , Europe did not have it in its own way .	-2.5357
The triple main winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans on Saturday with two points .	-3.1413
They won a courageous 2 : 1 victory against the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-pack and later returned to beat Pouler and Rory McIlroy 4 : 3 in the four-pack after losing the first two holes .	-9.3446
Only twice in the Ryder Cup history a team returns from a four-point deficit to the singles , although Halter Furyk 's page only needs a draw to keep the trophy .	-3.9376
After two days of second best , however , a Sunday counter looks like he would go beyond it .	-9.4702
North Korea says that “ by no means ” there will be unilateral disarmament without confidence .	-2.5486
North Korea ’ s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions would deepen his mistrust of the United States , and that in no case would the country unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons under such circumstances .	-3.8247
Ri Yong Ho said to the annual General Assembly of the World Body that last year , North Korea took " significant goodwill measures " , such as the cessation of nuclear and missile tests , the dismantling of the nuclear test ground and the obligation not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology .	-4.7586
" There is no corresponding answer from the USA , " he said .	-4.0658
“ Without any confidence in the US , there will be no confidence in our national security , and in such circumstances there is no possibility that we will disarm ourselves unilaterally first . ”	-3.4819
While Ri resumed the well-known North Korean complaints about Washington ’ s resistance to a “ gradual ” approach to denuclearization , in which North Korea would be rewarded with gradual steps , his declaration seemed significant insofar as she did not entirely reject unilateral denuclearization , as Pyongyang did in the past .	-4.4709
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a first summit between an acting US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June , when Kim committed himself to working towards a " denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula " while Trump promised guarantees of North Korea 's security .	-3.9330
North Korea sought a formal end to the Korean war in 1950-53 , but the United States said that Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons .	-2.6776
Washington has also opposed calls for easing the hard international sanctions against North Korea .	-2.6516
The US insists on " denuclearization-first " ( first denuclearization ) and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its purpose in a mandatory manner , and even rejects the " declaration of the end of the war " , said Ri .	-4.0835
" The perception that sanctions can force us into our knees is a dream of people who are ignorant of us .	-2.9024
But the problem is that continued sanctions exacerbate our mistrust . ”	-2.0002
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump , which the US President highlighted at the United Nations earlier this week .	-2.8212
Instead , the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korea ’ s leader , Moon Jae-in , over the past five months , and added : ' If the party were to denuclearize South Korea and not the US , the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have come to such a deadlock ' .	-4.4962
Nonetheless , the tone of Ri ’ s speech was dramatically different from last year when he reported it to the U.N. The General Assembly that targeted the US mainland with North Korea ’ s missiles was inevitable after “ Mr. Evil President ” Trump Kim called a “ missile man ” on a suicide mission .	-4.3485
This year at the United Nations , Trump , who threatened last year to “ destroy ” North Korea , praised Kim for his courage to take disarmament steps , but he also said that much work has yet to be done , and sanctions have to remain until North Korea destroyed denuclearization .	-3.8918
On Wednesday , Trump said that he did not have a timeframe , saying , " It doesn 't matter whether it takes two years , three years , or five months " . , , , or , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-11.1502
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken .	-1.5386
However , in the United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the UN : Thursday , the Security Council said : ' Implementation of the Security Council sanctions must be vigorously and without continuation of deficiencies until we achieve full , final and verified denuclearisation ' .	-6.3787
Since 2006 , the Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea to prevent the funding of Pyongyang ’ s nuclear and ballistic missile programs .	-2.1353
Pompeo met Ri on the fringes of the UN General Assembly and then said that he will go back to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit .	-3.0620
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year , but his last trip did not go well .	-2.4089
He left Pyongyang in July , saying that progress had been made , and only a few hours later , North Korea condemned him for “ stand-alone demands . ”	-4.4797
This month , at a meeting with Moon , North Korea promised to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex when the United States takes ' appropriate measures ' .	-3.4693
He said that Kim told him that the " appropriate measures " he wanted were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore , and steps to normalize relations with Washington .	-3.0163
Harvard students take part in the course to find enough peace .	-2.7842
With a new course this year at Harvard University , all students get more sleep to fight against the growing macho culture of studying the caffeine “ wrapped nights ” .	-4.7553
A scientist has found that students at a world leading university are often unsuspecting of helping themselves , even when it comes to very simple mechanisms .	-3.8136
Charles Cheisler , Professor of Sleep Medicine at the Harvard Medical School and specialist at the Brigham and Women 's Hospital , designed the course , which he considers to be the first of his kind in the USA .	-12.5585
He was inspired to start the course after having given a talk about the effects of lack of sleep on learning .	-3.2696
In the end , a girl came to me and said : " Why is this only said to me now , in my final year ?	-4.9323
She said that she never told anyone about the importance of sleep – which surprised me , " he said to the telegraph .	-3.6287
The course offered for the first time this year explains to students how good sleeping habits promote academic and sporting performance and improve their general well-being .	-3.8142
Paul Barreira , Professor of Psychiatry at the Harvard Medical School and Managing Director of the University Health Service , said that the university decided to introduce the course after it found that students had slept extremely little during the week .	-4.0436
The 1-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks .	-2.1481
In a section , there is an image of a sleeping room in which students click on coffee cups , curtains , trainers and books to be informed about the effects of caffeine and light , and how sporting performance is influenced by lack of sleep and the importance of a sleeping time routine .	-4.9750
Another section explains how long term sleep trains can increase the risk of heart attack , stroke , depression and cancer .	-2.7784
A map of the campus with interactive symbols encourages participants to think about their everyday lives .	-2.4437
We know that it will not change students ' behaviour immediately .	-2.2858
" But we believe that they have a right to this - just as you have a right to know the health impact of the decision to smoke cigarettes , " added Prof. Czeisler . . the the , the the the . the the the . the the	-9.2112
The culture of pride still exists , he said and added that modern technology and increasing pressure on students makes sleeping trains a growing problem .	-3.9387
To have enough sleep of good quality , the " secret weapon " of a student should be to combat stress , exhaustion and fear , he said - also to avoid increasing , as sleeping trains move the brain into hunger mode and make it constantly hungry .	-5.6554
Raymond Thus , a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology , helped Professor Czeisler design the course after he visited one of his classes last year in his first year in Harvard .	-3.6324
He said that the course had opened its eyes and inspired him to push for a campus-wide course .	-2.3268
The next step , he hopes , is to call on all doctoral students to complete a similar study programme before entering the competition university .	-3.7261
Prof. Czeisler recommended that students set an alarm when they should go into bed and wake up , and be aware of the harmful effects of " blue light " broadcast by electronic screens and LED lighting , which can bring out their circadian rhythm , leading to problems of asleep .	-6.0286
Livingston 1-0 Rangers : Mengas Goal erts Gerrard ’ s men	-2.2518
Further external problems of the Rangers : After a hit by Dolly Menga , the 1-to-0 defeat came in Livingston for the divided team of Steven Gerrard .	-4.9291
The Ibrox team wanted to record its first victory since the 4 : 1 triumph in St. Johnstone in February , but the team of Gary Holt added Gerrard ’ s second defeat in 18 games as a trainer that left his team behind the disappointed Ladbroke Premiership Chief Hearts by eight points .	-5.0945
Menga landed a hit seven minutes before the mid-term , and an inspiration-less rangers setting did not look like they could compensate .	-5.0925
While the Rangers now fall back to sixth place , Livingston climbs to rank three and lies only behind Hibernian because of the peat difference .	-5.2049
New difficulties for the Rangers are emerging , as liner judge Calum Spence had to provide a headwound after he was hit by a litter – apparently thrown out of the foreign fans sector .	-5.6303
Gerrard made eight changes to the side that passed Ayr and swept directly into the semifinal of the Betfred Cup .	-3.8060
By contrast , the same Livi Elf , which took the Hearts one point last week , would have been enthusiastic about how his well-trained team did not allow opponents to take action at any time .	-6.7662
The Rangers dominated the ball , but Livingston did better .	-4.0304
They should have met after only two minutes when Menga ’ s first depositor Scott Pittman sent to Allan McGregor ’ s gate , but the midfield player missed his big change on the gate .	-5.8533
Keaghan Jacobs then released a deep freeze to Captain Craig Halkett , but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only shoot far behind posts .	-5.5201
The Rangers took control , but there seemed to be more hope than treasuries in their own game , in the last third .	-3.8395
After the first quarter of an hour , Alfredo Morelos clearly believed that he deserved a penalty meter after he and Steven Lawless collided , but arbitrator Steven Thomson did not address the Colombian appeals .	-5.0671
The Rangers arrive only two shots in the first half , but the former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was hardly to get away from Lassana Coulibaly ’ s head jump and hit a bitless ovie ejaria .	-5.0278
Even if Livi ’ s opening match in the 34th minute may have been contrary to the course of the game , no one can deny that they have earned it alone for their efforts .	-4.7985
Again , the Rangers failed to master a standard Jacobs situation .	-2.5419
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher Scott Robinson played the ball , which kept the calm and picked out menga for a simple finish .	-11.2993
Gerrard acted during the break when he exchanged Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the change immediately affected the game when the wing player played to Morelos , but the impressive Kelly ran from his line to block .	-4.0340
But Livingston repeatedly moved guests to play exactly the kind of game they like , with Lithgow and Halkett sweeping long balls after long balls .	-4.0313
Holt ’ s team could have expanded their leadership in the final phase , but McGregor stood up to refuse Jacobs before Lithgow got over the corner .	-4.6230
The Rangers representative , Glenn Middleton , had another late claim to a punishment , since he has devastated himself with Jacobs , but once again he saw Thomson wat. , he the .	-11.4778
Almanach : The inventor of the violin counter	-2.1493
And now a page from our Almanach “ Sunday morning ” : 30 September 1882 , that was more than 136 years ago ... The day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm , called Hans , violinist was born in Germany .	-3.9304
Violin developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity , an invention that eventually produced the device known as violin counter .	-3.9134
Since then , the violinist has also become a mainstay of science , as in the 1950s of the movie " Bells of Coronado " , which appears to be unlikely cowpoke scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans :	-5.1134
Man : ' What about everything in the world is that ? '	-2.3660
Rogers : “ It is a violin meter used to find radioactive minerals like uranium .	-2.6103
If you set these headphones , you can actually hear the effects of the atoms released by radioactivity in minerals . ”	-3.3960
Evans : “ Tell me , but now it cracks enormously ! ”	-3.6299
Hans Geiger died in 1945 , just a few days before his 63rd birthday .	-1.5485

New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to " see " and kill malignant cells . .	-7.4977
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of the treatment .	-2.2121
The procedure includes the extraction of immune cells from a patient , changing them in the laboratory .	-8.5456
You can then see a protein that is common to many types of cancer and then inject again .	-3.3598
A study vaccine shows promising results for patients with a number of cancers .	-2.3892
A woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to detect rogue cells saw her ovary cancer disappear for more than 18 months .	-2.8392
The method is to extract immune cells from a patient , change them in the laboratory , so that a protein called HER2 becomes “ visible ” , which occurs in many types of cancer , and then reinject the cells .	-4.1996
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda , Maryland , said : ' Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine ' .	-1.9005
HER2 “ promotes the growth of different types of cancer ” , including breast , ovarian , lung and intestine cancer , explained Prof. Berzofsky .	-10.8685
A similar approach to removing patients from immune cells and teaching them how to attack cancer cells has worked in treating a kind of leukaemia .	-2.9802
After his performance at Saturday Night Live , Kanye West , clothed with MAGA cap , left a pro-Trump tirade from the stack .	-3.5104
It did not go well .	-2.0845

It is unclear whether Rock has tried to mock West with the contribution .	-3.5481
West also complained to the audience that he had had had difficulty behind the stage , because of his head cover .	-4.3221
" They harassed me behind the stage .	-1.0785
You said : ' Do not go out with your hat . '	-3.9575

And then they say I am in a given place , " he said , according to the Washington Examiner .	-2.4547
West continued : " Want to see the sunken place ? " saying that he would " attract my Superman curtain , because that means that you can 't tell me what to do .	-5.7240

His comments were received at least twice by the audience with guns , and the comedians of Saturday Night Live seemed to have been relocated , Variety reported , and quoted a person saying , “ The whole studio was dead style . ”	-5.2027
West was used as a substitute for the singer Ariana Grande , whose former friend , Rapper Mac Miller , died a few days ago .	-2.6526

On Saturday , US MEP Maxine Waters rejected allegations that one of its employees should have published personal data from three Republican US senators on the Wikipedia pages of legislators .	-3.7989
The Los Angeles Democrat believes that the claims of ultra-left wing members and websites have been launched .	-3.4062
“ Lies , lies , and even more repugnant lies , ” Waters announced in a statement on Twitter .	-3.4316
According to the information published , private addresses and telephone numbers from US Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina , as well as US Senators Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch , both from Utah .	-3.5646
The information appeared online Thursday , posted by an unknown person on the capitol hill during a hearing of the Senate on the charges of sexual maladministration towards the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh .	-13.1748
The data of the three senators were published shortly after the Kavanaugh survey .	-2.1404
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the jobs was connected to Waters ' office and published the information of a Waters employee , Hill reports .	-4.1806
“ This unfounded accusation is completely wrong and an absolute lie , ” Waters continued .	-3.5931
“ The employee among my employees – whose identity , personal information , personal data , and security were affected as a result of these fraudulent and false claims – was in no way responsible for leaking this information .	-3.9293
This tenacious claim is completely wrong and an absolute lie .	-3.4879
Water ’ s explanation quickly led to criticism online , including the former press secretary of the White House Ari Fleischer .	-3.3710
“ The denial of the matter is extremely annoying , ” wrote Fleischer .	-3.0587
“ This suggests that it is inappropriate as a member of the Congress .	-2.9445
If someone is accused of having done something , they must not be evil .	-2.6419
They must not be suspended .	-2.8787
You must not question the motives of the plaintiff .	-2.0316
They must be calm and calm ” .	-3.4315
Fleischer seemed to compare Water ’ s response to the Democrats ’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh , accused by critics of appearing too angry during the hearing on Thursday .	-3.4539
Omar Navarro , a Republican candidate who runs alongside the silent water in the mid-term elections , also expressed his thoughts on Twitter .	-4.0971
“ Big , if true , ” he weetened .	-2.9413
In her statement , Waters said that her office " informed the competent authorities and law enforcement authorities about the fraudulent claims .	-3.2277
“ We will ensure that the perpetrators are taken to account and for their actions , which are destructive and dangerous for my employees , ” she continued .	-3.7992
Review of " Johnny English – Man lives only three times " – poorly occupied parody with Rowan Atkinson 's son .	-3.8197
It is tradition to search for Brexit suggestions in every new movie with a British tendency , and this seems to be applicable to this revival of the Johnny English Action Comedy Spoof franchise , which began in 2003 with Johnny English and was re-established in 2011 with " Johnny English Reborn " .	-5.1956
Is the ironic self-satire about the abyss of humanity the new possibility of exporting the nation ?	-3.0329
In any case , the glossy , rubber-sighted and incompetent Johnny English has been licensed for the second time to re-massage things .	-5.7648
He is , of course , the stupid secret agent who , despite his bizarre demands on smoothie glamour , got a little clouseau , a sprayer Mr. Bean and a clack from this guy and who contributed a single note to the guiding melody of the fire trucks at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London .	-5.8219
It is also based on the traveller and international mysterious Atkinson , who once played a part in the meanwhile forgotten Barclaycard TV ads , always leaving chaos behind .	-4.1935
There are one or two beautiful moments in this latest Johnny English comedy .	-1.5761
I loved Johnny English , who approaches a helicopter in a medieval armor and the main rotor shortly beats against his helmet .	-3.8471
Atkinson 's talent for body comedy is to be seen , but the humor feels rather weak and strange , especially as the " serious " brands like 007 and Mission Impossible offer as ingredients .	-4.3604
The humor feels as if it is directed towards children rather than adults , and for me the crazy misfortunes of Johnny English are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson 's Mr. Bean silent movies .	-3.9138
The everlasting premise is that Britain is in great trouble .	-2.2255
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the highly secret British network of spies and revealed the identity of all British agents on the ground , to horror the serving agent – a regrettably small role for Kevin Eldon .	-3.7809
It is the last straw for a Prime Minister who is a pompous and contested personality and already suffers a complete meltdown of political unpopularity .	-4.3440
Their intelligence consultants inform them that , since each active spy has been compromised , they have to get someone out of retirement .	-4.2265
And that means , the fantastic Johnny English himself , who is now employed as a school master in a noble institution , but gives unsurpassed lessons about how to operate as an undercover agent : some nice gags here , while English offers a School of Rock Academy on Spionage .	-5.2975
English is returned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his former , long-suffering cumple Bough , played again by Ben Miller .	-4.1939
Bough is now a married man meeting a submarine commander , an overwhelming , burschicosis role in which Vicki Pepperdine is not entirely valid .	-4.6923
So , the Batman and Robin of chaos at the Secret Service of their Majesty are back in action and meet Olga Kurylenko 's beautiful Femme Fatale Ophelia Bulletova .	-3.2964
Meanwhile , the Prime Minister is dangerously banned by the charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain ’ s computer problems : the dark Jason Volta , played by Jake Lacy .	-3.8346
English and Bough begin their odyssey of colourful highjinks : as waiters disguise , they inflame a French Flash restaurant ; they create chaos by smuggling on board Voltas luxury yacht ; and English triggers pure anarchy when trying to familiarize themselves with a Virtual Reality Headset with the inside of Volta ’ s house .	-5.1604
All the registers have certainly been drawn for this last sequence , but as loving and omitted as it is , the whole thing is reminiscent of children 's television .	-5.3264
Quite moderately .	-2.2711
And as with the other Johnny English movies , I could not fail to think : Can the British film industry Rowan Atkinson not play a role that really does justice to his talent ?	-4.2291
Labour denies having developed a plan for Britain for a four-day week that will be paid for five days .	-3.3503
Jeremy Corbyn ’ s Labour Party is examining a radical plan in which Britons work only four days a week but are paid for five .	-2.7695
According to reports , the party wants corporate leaders to pass on the savings achieved by the revolution of artificial intelligence ( AI ) to workers by giving them an additional day .	-8.0122
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend - but still bring the same money back home .	-2.8965
Sources said that the idea would " fit " with the party 's economic agenda and plans to tip the country for the benefit of workers .	-3.7619
The trade union congress approved the switch to a four-day week as an opportunity for workers to use the changing economy .	-3.7266
A high-level source from the Labour Party said the Sunday Times : a policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year .	-2.9720
A four-day week is an objective that is consistent with the Party 's approach to restoring the economic balance in favour of workers and the Party 's general industrial strategy , but this objective will not be realised overnight .	-4.2867
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea , as the Green Party promised a four-day working week during its 2017 campaign .	-2.4525
However , the entire Labour Party does not currently support this move .	-7.8376
One Labour spokesman said : ' A four-day week is not a party policy and is not intended by the party ' .	-2.7471
Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to concrete his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy .	-2.5306
Mr McDonnell said that he was determined to regain the power of ' faceless directors ' and ' profiteers ' among utilities .	-2.8466
The shadow chancellor ’ s plans also mean that the current shareholders of water companies may not return their entire share , as a Labour government could “ deduct ” on the grounds of alleged misconduct .	-5.4221
He also confirmed the plans to appoint employees to the management and to create inclusive ownership funds to distribute 10 % of private sector companies ’ equity to employees receiving annual dividends of up to 500 pounds .	-4.0152
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk in “ 60 minutes ” about whether FBI investigations against Kavanaugh could change their minds .	-2.7509
An ongoing FBI investigation into allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh postponed the final vote to appeal the judge to the Supreme Court at least one week , and raised the question of whether the investigation results of the FBI could lead Republican senators to abandon their support for Kavanaugh .	-5.2920
In an interview conveyed on Sunday , Scott Pelley , correspondent of “ 60 minutes , ” consulted Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham about whether the FBI ’ s investigation could persuade them to change their mind .	-4.2255
Kennedy appeared more open-minded than his colleague from South Carolina .	-1.5514
“ In any case , ” Kennedy said .	-1.6619
" I said at the beginning of the hearing that I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh .	-1.7271
I called him after that happened , after that assertion came out , I said : ' Did you do it ? '	-8.7481
He was determined , targeted , unambiguous . '	-2.5384
Graham 's voice , however , seemed to be in stone .	-3.4117
" I have an opinion on Board Kavanaugh and it would need a bomb charge , " he said .	-2.6331
“ Dr. Ford , I don ’ t know what happened , but I know that Borett strongly disputed the charge , ” added Graham with a reference to Christine Blasey Ford .	-4.0038
" None whom she called it could confirm it .	-2.7315
It is 36 years ago .	-1.0246

'What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it ensured that poverty is reduced ? '	-2.0030
This Saturday the Global Citizen Festival will take place in New York , an annual music event with an impressive selection of stars and an equally impressive mission to end poverty in the world .	-3.2230
This year ’ s seventh Global Citizen Festival will bring together tens of thousands of people on the Great Lawn in Central Park to experience not only stars like Janet Jackson , Cardi B , and Shawn Mendes , but also to draw attention to the true objective of the event : to end extreme poverty by 2030 .	-4.1520
The Global Citizen Festival , which took place in 2012 , is an expansion of the Global Poverty Project , an international interest group aimed at combating poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it .	-2.9601
To obtain a free ticket for the event , the concert visitors had a whole series of tasks or " actions " , such as volunteering , e-mail to a world leader , telephone calls or other useful ways of raising the goal of combating poverty and raising awareness of it .	-5.6423
But how successful has Global Citizen been at the age of 12 to achieve its goal ?	-2.7637
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert , a real way of persuading people , calling for action , or simply another case of so-called " clicktivism " - people who feel like they are making a real difference by signing an online petition or an online application or thereby sending a tweet ?	-4.8514
Global Citizen says that it has recorded more than 19 million “ actions ” from its supporters since 2011 , pushing for a variety of different targets .	-9.2533
It is said that these actions have motivated world leaders to make financial and political commitments worth more than $ 37 billion , which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030 .	-2.9708
In early 2018 , the group led 390 missions and announcements from its actions , of which at least $ 10 billion have already been paid or financed .	-3.6003
The group estimates that the funds allocated have had a direct influence on nearly 649 million people around the world .	-3.2526
The Power of Nutrition , a UK based partnership of investors and executive organizations committed to “ helping children to develop their full potential , ” has promised to support Rwanda with $ 35 million in ending malnutrition in the country after Global Citizens have entered over 4,700 tweets .	-19.9463
“ With the support of the British Government , donors , other governments , and global citicians like you , we can make the social injustice of malnutrition one day history , ” The Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman announced the crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018 .	-10.5819
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions in the United Kingdom to improve the nutrition of mothers and children , the government will reach the financing of the Power of Nutrition project 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions .	-12.8500
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on your website , “ Why do you think that we can end extreme poverty ? ”	-2.5371
Global citizens replied : it will be a long and difficult path - sometimes we will fall and fail .	-2.7153
Like the great civil rights and the anti-apartheid movements ahead , we will succeed , because we are more powerful together .	-2.6060
The stars Janet Jackson , Weeknd , Shawn Mendes , Cardi B and Janelle Monáe will perform at this year 's event in New York , moderated by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman .	-3.1676
US could use the navy to build a “ blockade ” to hinder Russian energy exports – Home Affairs Ministers	-3.9708
Washington can use his navy “ if necessary ” to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets , including in the Middle East , US Secretary of State Ryan Zinke is quoted by the Washington Examiner .	-3.1901
Zinke said that Russia ’ s engagement in Syria – especially in activities at the invitation of the legitimate government – was a pretext for exploring new energy markets .	-3.5320
“ I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is as follows : they want to negotiate energy , as they do in Eastern Europe , the southern part of Europe , ” he said .	-2.7707
And , according to the officials , there are ways to deal with this .	-3.2023
" The United States has this capacity to ensure with our navy that maritime routes are open and , if necessary , block to ensure that their energy does not come onto the market , " he said .	-4.6902
Zinke spoke to the participants of an event of the Consumer Energy Alliance , a non-profit organization that calls itself the “ voice of energy consumers ” in the US .	-3.5690
He compared Washington ’ s approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran and found that they are indeed the same .	-2.9688
" The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less to use and replace fuels , " he said , while he called Russia a " one-trick pony " with a fossil-fuel-dependent economy .	-11.5982
The opinions come , while the Trump administration was on the mission to boost exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe and to replace Russia , the much more favourable option for European consumers .	-3.3688
Therefore , members of the Trump administration – including US President Donald Trump himself – are trying to push Germany to stop the “ inappropriate ” North Stream 2 pipeline project that , according to Trump , would make Berlin “ prisoner . ”	-3.7959
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $ 11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline , which is supposed to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres , is a purely economic project .	-9.8091
The Kremlin argues that Washington ’ s resistance to the project is simply driven for economic reasons , and is an example of unfair competition .	-2.0794
“ I believe we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument to exert pressure , and that consumers should be able to elect suppliers , ” said Russian Energy Secretary Aleksandr Novak , after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September .	-10.0212
The attitude of the US has led to a backlash from Germany , which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project .	-3.6227
Germany ’ s leading industrial organization , the Federal Association of German Industries ( BDI ) , has called on the US to keep away from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow .	-3.4496

Warren burdened President Donald Trump during the Rauthaus meeting , saying that he is leading ' this country in the wrong direction ' .	-3.5405
" I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy , " she said .	-1.7255
Warren ’ s criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court of Candidate Brett Kavanaugh did not take a leaf in front of her mouth .	-5.0847
Warren said in a tweet on Friday : ' Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote ' .	-2.3091
But a poll published on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren ’ s own voters do not believe that it should run in 2020 .	-2.8741
According to a survey by the Suffolk University Political Research Center / Boston Globe , 58 % of the " likely " Massachusetts voters said that the senator should not stand .	-2.6451

Track Palin , 26 , spent a year in Iraq after being convened in September .	-1.9415
He was arrested and indicted for an incident of domestic violence on Monday evening .	-8.2442
“ Against the background of what my own son understands , what he is going through after he has returned , I can understand other families who feel the effects of PTSD and some of the injuries with which our soldiers return , ” she said to the audience in a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa , Oklahoma .	-4.9012
Palin described his arrest as “ the elephant in space , ” saying to her son and other veterans : “ They come back a bit differently ; they come back harder and wonder whether the work of her fellow soldiers and the air force and all other military members is respected for the country . ”	-5.9897

18 DC countries support the challenge of a new asylum policy .	-2.0111
18 states and Washington , DC support a legal challenge to a new US policy that refuses asylum to the victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence .	-2.9151
According to NBC News , representatives from the 18 states and the district submitted an Amicus Curiae ( Friend of the Court ) on Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker in the challenge of law .	-3.8110
The full name of the plaintiff in the litigation Grace against sessions submitted in August by the American Civil Liberties Union against the Federal Law is not known .	-3.4894
She said that her partner " and his violent sons of gang members " had abused them , but on 20 July , US officials refused to apply for asylum .	-2.9092
It was arrested in Texas .	-1.1760
The lawyers of the states that support Grace described El Salvador , Honduras , and Guatemala , which include a large number of asylum seekers in the United States , as nations that face deep problems with gangs and domestic violence .	-3.8349
The US ’ s new asylum policy has reversed a 2014 complaint chamber decision that undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence can apply for asylum .	-3.3089
The Minister of Justice of the District of Columbia Karl Racine said in an opinion on Friday that the new law ignores decades of national , federal and international law .	-2.6337
The Amicus Curiae states that , according to federal law , all asylum applications must be assessed in accordance with the circumstances of the respective complaint and that such action violates this principle .	-9.3786
Lawyers further argued in the letter that the policy that denies immigrants entry hurts the US economy , because it is more likely that these immigrants will become entrepreneurs and “ do necessary work . ”	-9.8532
Prosecutor General Jeff Sessions instructed immigration judges in June not to grant asylum to persons fleeing domestic or gang violence .	-3.7119
“ Asylum is entitled to those people who have to leave their homeland for persecution due to race , religion , nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political opinion , ” said Sessions in his statement on the law on 11 June .	-4.9960
Asylum was never intended to alleviate all the problems , even the serious ones that people face every day around the world .	-3.6118

US ambassadors accuse China of “ harassment ” with “ propaganda advertising . ”	-3.1962
A week after an official Chinese newspaper gave a four-page ad in a US daily newspaper on the mutual benefits of US China trade , the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda .	-4.4678
U.S. President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to the paid supplement of China Daily in the Des Moines register , the state with the most sold newspaper in Iowa , after accusing China of interfering in the US Congress elections of 6 November , which China denies .	-4.4339
US officials claim to Reuters that Trump ’ s accusation of Beijing attempting to interfere in the US election is a new phase in a escalating Washington campaign to put pressure on China .	-3.3554
It is normal for foreign states to place ads to promote trade , but Beijing and Washington are currently in an escalating trade war with several rounds of tariffs on imports .	-3.9321
In an early stage of the trade war , China ’ s retaliation tariffs on Chinese and US experts indicate that exporters in US states like Iowa , where many supporters of Trump ’ s Republican Party live .	-3.6442
Terry Branstad , US ambassador to China and former long-standing governor of Iowa , a major exporter of agricultural products to China , said that Beijing has injured American workers , farmers , and businesses .	-3.2631
China , wrote Branstad in an article of opinion in the Des Moines Register on Sunday , “ is now pushing this harassment through propaganda ads in our own free press .	-4.5540
“ By spreading propaganda as a paid ad in the Des Moines register , China ’ s government is taking advantage of the esteemed American tradition of freedom of expression and press , ” Branstad wrote .	-3.7459
" By contrast , you will find only limited differing voices in the streets of Beijing , and you will not see any real reproduction of differing opinions that the Chinese people might have on China ’ s worrying economic development , considering that the media are firmly in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party , " he wrote . the , , , , , , , , , , , or , , , , , , , , , ,	-10.6577

Republicans gray with the Kavanaugh debacle voters before the Midterm elections , warning analysts	-9.2573
Many of the top Republicans defended Brett Kavanaugh , a nominee who is elected to the Supreme Court , despite being accused of sexual assaults , and the analysts warn that they will see a retaliation in the upcoming elections , especially of women .	-5.4417
The emotions were high , most Republicans have already said they want to vote for him .	-2.6432
These things cannot be returned , said Grant Reeher , Professor of Political Science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University , on Saturday in an article published by The Hill .	-2.4299
Reeher said that he doubted that last minute support from Jeff Flake ( Republican MEP for the state of Arizona ) was sufficient to reconcile angry voters .	-3.7961
“ Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow , nor will they forget it in November , ” said Karine Jean-Pierre , senior consultant and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday , as a Washington newspaper reported .	-3.4798

“ Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be immeasurable , ” said Stu Rothenberg , an impartial political analyst , journalists .	-1.8027
" People say that it is quite advanced , that is true .	-3.1708
But the figure may be higher , especially among suburban and younger voters , 18-29 year-olds who may not suffer the president , but often do not vote . ”	-4.4189
Even before Ford ’ s public statement , in which she executed her charges of sexual violence against the candidate for the Supreme Court , analysts noted that a backlash could follow when Republicans pushed the candidacy forward .	-11.4633
“ This has become a confusing chaos for the COP , ” said Michael Steele , former chairman of the Republican National Committee , at the beginning of last week , according to NBC News .	-3.0932
“ It ’ s not just about the committee election or the final election , or whether Kavanaugh is placed on the replacement bank , it ’ s about how the Republicans handled this and how they handled it , ” Guy Cecil , director of US priorities , told the news station a group that helps elect Democrats .	-6.0001
But the Americans are divided by what Ford and Kavanaugh have said .	-3.0486
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 % of respondents definitively or probably believed Ford ’ s testimony , while 35 % said that they definitely or probably believed Kavanaugh .	-4.2951

The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning a new Internet to challenge Google and Facebook	-2.0820
Tim Berners-Lee , the inventor of the Internet , founds a startup company to compete with Facebook , Amazon and Google .	-2.5398
The current project of the technology leaders , Inrupt , is a company based on the open source platform “ Solid ” by Berners-Lee .	-3.5136
Solid enables users to determine where their data is stored and which persons can access what information .	-3.9824
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company , Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt ’ s goal was to take over world rule .	-3.2336
“ We must do it now , ” he said about the startup .	-2.0489
“ It is a historic moment . ”	-1.2036
The app uses the Solid technology to help users create their own personal online storage or POD .	-3.4533
The data storage can contain contact lists , task lists , calendars , music libraries and other personal or professional tools .	-2.3809
It is like Google Drive , Microsoft Outlook , Slack and Spotify all available on a browser and all at the same time .	-1.9803
The special thing about the personal online data storage is that it is entirely up to the user what access to what kind of information is possible .	-4.0989
The company calls it “ persons enable by data . ”	-3.4028
According to the CEO of John Bruce , Inrupt will provide resources , processes and appropriate know-how to make solid accessible to broad users .	-3.4178
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee , Bruce , a security platform acquired by IBM , some employees involved in the project and a community of voluntary programmers .	-3.0288
As of this week , technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website .	-3.1776
Berners-Lee said that neither his team nor his own will talk to Facebook and Google about the comprehensive changes that all previous business models will put on their head overnight .	-3.4263
“ We will not ask for permission ” .	-2.0590

The only priest of the Church of England who received a Victoria Cross during World War I was celebrated 100 years later in his hometown .	-3.8524
The Lieutenant and Reverend Bernard Vann earned the award on 29 September 1918 at the attack in Bellenglise and Lehaucourt .	-3.4805

A memorial stone was revealed by his two grandchildren on Saturday at a parade in Rushden , Northamtonshire .	-2.5809
One of his grandchildren , Michael Vann , said that it was “ incredibly symbolic ” that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after the heroism of his grandfather .	-2.4026
According to the London Gazette , Oberstlietnant Vann led his Bataillon in September 1918 over the channel of Saint-Quentin “ in very dense fog and under heavy fire by field shooters and machine guns . ”	-5.6659
Later he stormed up to the shot line and led the line forward with the “ biggest galantery ” before moving a field gun one-handed and pushing the draw three times .	-7.4502
Oberstlieutnant Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4 , 1918 – just a month before the end of the war .	-3.7020

At 6 o 'clock in the morning , just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared to meet , the viewers in the United Kingdom were able to look at how the reporting was changed to Peppa Pig .	-5.8885
Some were unimpressed after they had remained awake until the early hours of the morning , especially for the fight .	-4.4324
A fan on Twitter described the change to the child cartoon as " some sick joke " .	-2.8594
" It is a state regulation that at 6 o 'clock in the morning these contents were not suitable so that they had to change to children 's programmes , " said Dave Schwartz , Bellator Senior Vice President of Marketing and Communication when asked for the transfer .	-4.2197

Desert Island Discs : Tom Daley felt inferior due to his sexuality .	-8.6679
The Olympic diver Tom Daley says that he grew up with the feeling of being inferior to everyone because of his sexuality - but that gave him the motivation to succeed .	-10.4906
The 24-year-old said that he had only become aware at secondary school that “ not everyone is like me ” .	-3.4005
In the first edition of Desert Island Discs at Radio 4 presented by Lauren Laverne , he said that he spoke publicly about the rights of homosexuals to give other “ hope . ”	-3.3958
He also said that victory in the Olympic Games after the birth of his first child would have become less important for him .	-2.5463
The regular presenter of the long-running show , Kristy Young , has released several months due to a disease .	-3.4918
Daley appeared in Laverne ’ s first program , saying that he felt “ less worth ” than the others , because “ it was not accepted by society to stand on men and women . ”	-4.1921
He said , “ To date , these feelings of less value and difference have given me the strength and strength I needed to be successful . ”	-3.8705

The two-time bronze medal winner has become a high-class LGBT activist and used his appearance at this year 's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality .	-3.8046

The weak Mickelson sat on the Ryder Cup Saturday at the bank	-3.9455
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game , but he does not need to dramatically improve his shape so that it will not become a sad milestone .	-4.5355
Mickelson , who played for the 12th time at the event , which takes place every two years , was put on the bank by captain Jim Furyk for the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday .	-4.1605
Instead of , as is so often the case for the US , the five-fold Major winner split his day between fires and practice rounds in the golf course , hoping to overcome its depth .	-5.4052
The 48-year-old is never the straightest driver even at the peak of his career and is not suitable for the narrow Le Golf National Square , where the long rough regularly punishes failures .	-3.8474
And as if the place alone would not be challenging enough , Mickelson meets the British Open Champion Francesco Molinari , who won all four matches this week together with Neuling Tommy Fleetwood .	-4.7865
If Americans lag four points behind the 12 single games and have a hot start , Mickelson ’ s match could be absolutely crucial .	-4.2915
Furyk expressed his confidence in his husband ; what remained for him .	-4.2081
" He fully understood the role he had today , gave me a slap on my back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow , " said Furyk .	-3.6913
" He has a lot of confidence . . .	-9.6016
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has done so much for these teams in the past , and this week .	-2.2248
I probably would not have thought he was playing two games .	-2.8714
I had wished for more , but it has emerged and that is the way we felt we had to tackle it .	-5.7990

Mickelson won 18 times , lost 20 times and played seven times undecided , but Furyk said that his presence would have been invaluable for the team .	-4.5085
" He is funny , he is sarcastic , funny , he loves to entertain people and he is a great guy he can have in the team room , " he explained .	-3.1110

The European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great lead can soon disappear .	-2.9615
Thomas Bjorn , the European captain , knows from experience that a great advantage in the single games of the last day can quickly become an inconvenient ride at the Ryder Cup .	-4.2520
In 1997 , the Dane debuted in the Valderrama game , where a team trained by Seve Ballesteros had a lead of five points to the Americans , but only scarcely reached the finish line and won a highly thin lead from $ 14 to $ 13 .	-6.3140
" Remember that Valderrama was leading ; we had a great lead in Brookline , where we lost , and in Valderrama we won but only scarce , " said Bjorn , after he won the Class of 2018 , now leading 10-6 in the Le Golf National , Friday and yesterday at a 5-3 victory .	-5.8820
History will show me and everyone in this team that it is not over yet .	-2.6570

Go out and do the right things .	-2.5734
It is only over when the points are displayed on the board .	-3.4390
Our goal is to win this Cup and we focus on it .	-3.2719
I have always said that I firmly believe in the 12 players in our team , but we are dealing with a strong opponent , the best players in the world . ”	-2.5223
Enthusiastically , as his players played on a hard golf course , Björn added : " I would never be premature .	-4.5261
Tomorrow is another day .	-1.9288
Tomorrow are the personal appearances , and that is another thing .	-2.7733
It 's great to be outside with a partner if things go well , but if you are out there alone , your skills will be tested as a golf player .	-5.6076
This is the message you have to convey to the players : to get the best out tomorrow .	-3.8011
Now you pass over to your partner , and he has to do the same as you do . ”	-6.0654
Unlike Björn , the opponent Jim Furyk will strive for his players to perform individually better than they do as a partner , with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas , who have raised three out of four points .	-4.7026
Furyk himself experienced such a sensational turn on the last day , when he was part of the winning team in Brookline , now he is one of the losers after the European team has carried out the “ Miracle of Medina ” .	-5.5262
“ I remember every damned word , ” he said on the question of how Ben Crenshaw , the 1999 captain , gathered his players on the way to the last day .	-4.0224
We have 12 important games tomorrow , but we want to get started as soon as possible , as we saw in Brookline , in Medinah .	-8.7134
Once a self-dynamic has evolved , the pressure on the middle matches exerts .	-5.1563
We have built up our list accordingly and put the guys out as we felt , you know we are trying to create something special tomorrow . ”	-11.5527
Together with Paul Casey , Justin Rose , Jon Rahm , Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter , the other European in the top ranking , Thomas should lead the counter-strike against Rory McIlroy in the top .	-11.2959
I put this group of guys in this order because I think it covers all the way , " said Bjorn about his individual selection .	-2.9269
Renewed postponement of the schedule for Germany ’ s new warship	-3.5813
The latest frigate of the German Navy should have been put into service as early as 2014 to replace the years of Cold War warships , but it will take at least until next year , owing to faulty systems and escalating costs .	-6.1329
The launch of the “ Rhineland-Palatinate ” , the leading ship of the brand new frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class , has now been postponed to the first half of 2019 , according to the newspaper “ Die Zeit ” , invoking a military speaker .	-4.3241
The navy should have launched the ships in 2014 , but serious problems after the first delivery burdened the ambitious project .	-3.4826
The four frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class , ordered by the navy in 2007 , will replace the older Bremen class vessels .	-4.0955
It is assumed that they have a powerful cannon , a series of anti-flight and anti-shipping missiles and some Stealth technologies , such as reduced radar , infrared and acoustic signatures .	-4.2536
Another important advantage is longer maintenance intervals : the latest frigates should be used for up to two years without starting the port .	-4.4229
However , the state-of-the-art warships that Germany is supposed to enable overseas power projections will already be outdated by constant delays when they are finally put into service , as the weekly newspaper “ Die Zeit ” notes .	-5.6064
The unfortunate F125 frigate caused headlines last year , when the German navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg .	-3.3004
This was the first time that the navy returned a ship to a ship builder after delivery .	-3.1734
Little was known about the reasons for returning ships ; German media mentioned a series of critical “ software and hardware defects ” that would make the warship useless in combat operations .	-3.7942
Software shortcomings were particularly important because the ships of the Baden-Württemberg class are served by a crew of around 120 seafarers - only half of the crew on older frigates of the Bremen class .	-3.9295
It also turned out that the ship has a considerable overweight , which would limit performance and make future upgrades difficult for the navy .	-4.8058
It is assumed that the 7,000-tonne “ Rhineland Palatinate ” is twice as heavy as ships of the same class used by Germans in the Second World War .	-4.0865
In addition to faulty hardware , the pricing tag of the entire project - including the training of the crew - will also be addressed .	-5.0802
Instead of the initially estimated EUR 2.2 billion , the cost now seems to have reached the dizzying amount of EUR 3.1 billion ( around USD 3.6 billion ) .	-3.2087
In the light of the recent warnings that Germany ’ s maritime power is disappearing , the problems with the latest frigates are of particular importance .	-5.3281
Earlier this year , Hans-Peter Bartels , Chairman of the Defence Committee of the German Parliament , admitted that the war fleet actually “ started the operational ships . ”	-3.6960
The official said that the problem has grown in an avalanche way over time , as old ships have been left out of service without replacing it .	-10.9031
He complained that none of the Baden-Württemberg frigates were put into service by the navy .	-2.5201
The National Trust lights the secret life of bats .	-1.7740
New research on a property in the Scottish Highlands is trying to find out how bats use the landscape for food search .	-3.4908
It is hoped that this will give new insights into the behaviour of unique flying mammals , which will guide future measures to protect animals .	-4.6275
The study by scientists of the National Trust for Scotland will be followed by soprano pistes and brown longohrig and Daubenton bats in the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross .	-4.7700
Special recording devices are placed at the main points of the accommodation to track bat mouse activities throughout the season .	-3.4995
NHS employees and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys with hand detectors .	-1.8768
An expert sound analysis of all recordings determines the frequency of the bat mouse calls and assigns the calls to the species .	-4.4885
The habitat card and the corresponding report should provide a detailed overview of the behaviour .	-3.4195
Rob Dewar , Nature Conservator at the National Trust for Scotland ( NTS ) , hopes to find out which areas of habitat are most important for the bats and how they are used by the respective species .	-3.6561
This information will help to identify the advantages of habitat management , how best to preserve meadows and how to preserve the forests for bats and other related species .	-4.5248
There has been a sharp decline in bat populations in Scotland and the whole of the United Kingdom over the past hundred years .	-3.3992
They are threatened by construction work which affects their sleeping areas and the loss of habitat .	-3.0705
Wind power plants and lighting can also pose a risk , as well as fly-fishing strips and some chemical treatments of construction materials , and attacks cats . the the , , the , the , the the , the , , , , , , , ,	-11.0926
Bat bats are not actually blind .	-2.3406
Adjusted to their nightlife hunting activities , the ears are more useful when catching the loot than the eyes .	-5.0057
They use sophisticated echo-positioning technology to locate flight errors and obstacles .	-3.7365
The NTS , which is responsible for caring for more than 270 historical buildings , 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country , takes the bats very seriously .	-3.1025
There are ten trained experts who regularly conduct surveys , inspect sleeping places , and sometimes make rescues .	-3.5049
The organization has even set up Scotland ’ s first and only dedicated bat reserve in the threaded property in Dumfries and Galloway , where eight of the ten Scottish bats are home .	-3.7442
According to administrator David Thompson , the property is an ideal habitat for them :	-1.7566
“ Here in Threave we have a great area for bats . ”	-1.8591
" We have the old buildings , many old trees and all the good habitat .	-2.2759
But there is still a lot of unknown about bats and the work that we are doing here and on other plots helps us to understand better what they need to live . . . a . , the , the . , the the , , or , the . , the ,	-16.2705
He stresses that it is important to check before maintenance work in buildings whether bats are there , according to which it is possible that when a single sleeping place is unintentionally destroyed , up to 400 females and boys may die – a whole local population may be erased .	-6.0178
Bat bats are protected ; it is forbidden to kill , harass or disturb them and destroy their sleeping areas .	-13.2876
Elisabeth Ferrell , Scottish employee of the Bat Conservation Trust , has encouraged the public to help .	-2.0560
She said , “ We still have much to learn about our bats , and for many of our species we simply do not know how their populations are . ”	-2.6325
Ronaldo rejects rape claims when lawyers sue the German magazine	-2.7173
Cristiano Ronaldo has branded rape claims against him as " fake news " and claims that people want to " promote themselves " by using his name .	-3.0399
His lawyers will sue the German news magazine “ Der Spiegel ” , which published the accusations .	-3.0485
The storm from Portugal and Juventus was accused of raping an American woman called Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009 .	-3.0241
He was then reported to have paid $ 375,000 to keep silent about the incident , The mirror on Friday .	-4.3571
Hours after the claims were reported , Ronaldo , 33 rejected the reports as “ fake news ” in an Instagram live video to his 142 million followers .	-2.9770
No , no , no , no .	-0.7596
What they say today , fake news , ” said the fifth Ballon D 'Or winner in the camera .	-2.4327
" They want to apply for themselves by using my name .	-1.7058
“ That is normal .	-1.2899
They want to draw attention to themselves when they say my name , but it is part of the job .	-2.3285
I am a happy man , and everything is good , ” the player smiling added .	-2.8007
Ronaldo ’ s lawyers prepare a complaint against the magazine “ Der Spiegel ” because of the claims ; according to Reuters , you spoke of “ inadmissible reporting on privacy suspicions . ”	-5.4735
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player will demand compensation for “ intangible damage equal to the seriousness of the injury , which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years . ” .	-13.1530
The alleged incident will have taken place in June 2009 in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas .	-3.0373
According to documents submitted to the District Court of Clark County in the US state of Nevada , Ronaldo and Mayorga moved back to the player 's room after learning about it in a night club , where he raped it anally .	-5.5119
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo had fallen to her knees after the alleged incident , saying that he was “ 99 % ” a “ good guy , ” abandoned by the “ one percent . ”	-4.3748
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex , but it was agreed .	-2.2134
Mayorga also claims that she had gone to the police and had photos taken from her injuries in a hospital , but later agreed to an extrajudicial agreement because she had " fear of retaliation " and worried about " being humiliated publicly " .	-4.8740
The 34-year-old says that she is now trying to declare the agreement invalid , as it remains traumatised by the alleged incident .	-3.3282
Ronaldo stood just before he switched to Real Madrid of Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack and switched to the Italian giant Juve this summer with a 100 million euro deal .	-4.4862
Brexit : Britain would forever regret losing car manufacturers	-1.6207
“ The United Kingdom would regret it timely if it lost its position after Brexit as the world ’ s leading car manufacturer , ” said Economic Minister Greg Clark .	-3.5483
He added that it was ' worrying ' that Toyota UK told the BBC that they would temporarily stop production at their plant in Burnaston , near Derby , if the UK left the EU without a deal .	-3.7912
“ We need an agreement , ” Clark said .	-1.4992
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of delays at borders in the event of no-deal Brexits could cost jobs .	-3.4222
The plant in Burnaston , which manufactures the Auris and Avensis brands for Toyota , produced almost 150,000 cars last year , 90 % of which were exported to the rest of the European Union .	-3.0687
“ When Britain leaves the EU at the end of March without an agreement , I believe that there will be production stops in our plant , ” said Marvin Cooke , CEO of Toyota in Burnaston .	-4.3003
Other British car manufacturers have expressed concerns about leaving the EU without agreement on the modalities of cross-border trade , including Honda , BMW and Jaguar Land Rover .	-2.8611
BMW , for example , has already announced its closure in Oxford for a month after Brexit .	-2.5144
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers say about the risks of the supply chain in the event of a ' no deal Brexit ' .	-3.0001
Toyota production facilities are based on demand-oriented production , i.e. , the parts are delivered every 37 minutes by UK and EU suppliers for special manufacturing .	-4.3192
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU on 29 March without an agreement , there may be delays at the border which , according to industry data , can lead to supply shortages and partial shortages .	-4.0241
It would be impossible for Toyota to hold more than one day of stock in his plant in Derbyshire , said the company , and so production would be stopped .	-3.5899
Mr Clark said that Theresa May ’ s Chequers Plan for future relations with the EU is “ precisely calibrated to avoid these border controls . ”	-10.9163
We need to have a deal , and we want the best deal that not only enables us to succeed today , we want to seize this opportunity , ” he said to the Today programme of BBC Radio 4 .	-5.4127
“ The indication not only of Toyota , but also of other manufacturers , is that we must be able to continue with what has become a very successful series of supply chains . ”	-10.4118
Toyota did not indicate how long the production stop could take , but warned that the increase in costs could , in the long term , suffer the competitiveness of the plant and eventually lose jobs .	-5.7893
Peter Tsouvallaris , trade union representatives and employed in Burnaston for 24 years , said that the trade union members are increasingly concerned : “ In my experience , once they have been reduced , jobs are forever lost . ”	-4.9421
One government spokesman said : ' We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU ' .	-2.7814
Trump ’ s meeting with Rosenstein could postpone again , says the White House	-3.1551
Donald Trump ’ s top-class meeting with Deputy Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein could “ be postponed another week , ” as the battle for Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues , the White House read on Sunday .	-3.8119
Rosenstein supervises the work of the special adviser , Robert Mueller , who examines Russian intervention in the elections , the links between Trump and Russia , and the possible obstruction of the president ’ s judiciary .	-3.9165
Whether or not Trump will fire the Deputy Public Prosecutor , and thus jeopardize the independence of Müller , Washington has gained a lot of trap for months .	-4.4123
Earlier this month , the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the wearing of a cable to record talks with Trump , thereby allowing the president to remove the 25th addition of the Constitution .	-3.7093
Rosenstein rejected an opinion .	-1.4049
But last Monday he went to the White House , while reports hailed that he was on the verge of resignation .	-3.9703
Instead , a meeting with Trump was announced for Thursday at the United Nations in New York .	-2.5333
Trump said that he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein , but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a clash with the Senate Justice Committee hearing in Kavanaugh and one of the women , Dr Christine Blasey Ford , who accused him of sexual misconduct .	-3.8152
On Friday , Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into the claims against Kavanaugh , and continued to delay a full senate vote .	-3.5527
Donald Trump ’ s press spokesman Sarah Sanders was on Sunday at Fox News .	-2.2266
After the Rosenstein meeting , she said : ' A date has not yet been set , it could be this week , I could see that I am postponing another week , given all the other things that are going on with the Supreme Court .	-4.7847
But we will see and I keep the press informed . '	-3.0571
Some reporters would challenge this claim : Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September .	-2.2275
The guest Chris Wallace asked why .	-1.0898
Sanders said that the lack of briefings is not a displeasure to television reporters who behave like self-performers , but she also said : ' I will not be opposed to standing in the gallery ' .	-5.3921
It then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase .	-1.9654
'The President carries out more questions and answers than any president before him ' , she said and added without citing evidence : ' We have looked at these figures ' .	-4.0712
Briefings will still take place , said Sanders , but if the press has the chance to ask the President of the United States the questions directly , that is infinitely better than to talk to her .	-4.3587
We are trying to do much of that , and you have seen how we have done it in recent weeks , and it will replace a press conversation if you can speak to the President of the United States itself . ”	-4.4311
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends public meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries .	-2.0190
Press conferences with one person are rare .	-0.8839
In New York , the president perhaps showed why this week , by making a free-running and sometimes bizarre appearance before assembled reporters .	-4.1882

The summer heat wave has increased revenue for British pubs , but has increased pressure on the restaurant chains .	-3.6777
Pub and bar groups experienced a sales increase of 2.7 percent in July - but revenues in restaurants declined by 4.8 percent , according to the figures .	-3.9039
Peter Martin , from the consultancy CGA , which compiled the figures , said : " Sustained sunshine and England 's longer than expected lasting participation in the World Cup , led July to follow a similar pattern as in June last month , when pub visits increased by 2.8 % , only that the restaurants were even more affected .	-5.7907
The 1.8 % decline in the gastronomy business in June only worsened in July .	-4.0542
Pubs and bars dominated by drinks were by far the strongest , with the Like-for-Like numbers rising more than the restaurants fell .	-4.4834
Pubs dominated by food also suffered from the sun , albeit not as dramatic as the restaurant operators .	-3.4760

Paul Newman , an RSM analyst for leisure and hospitality said : " These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April .	-2.6815
The weather and impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the outside house market .	-3.8865
It is not surprising that the restaurant groups are still under pressure , although a 4.8 % decline in sales will be particularly painful compared to last year ’ s persistent cost pressure .	-4.6958
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food operators , and time will show whether the more moderate temperatures that we experienced in August will ensure the much-needed break .	-3.9885

Milk pump advertising , where mothers are compared to cows , led to controversial online discussions .	-2.7868
A milk pump company has caused controversial online discussions due to an advertisement that compares quiet mothers with milk cows .	-4.1914
On the occasion of the market launch of the supposedly " world 's first noiseless and portable milk pump " , the consumer tech company Elvie published an ironic advertising inspired by music videos to show which freedoms mothers are offered with this new pump .	-11.0429
Four real mothers dance in a barn in the midst of cows to a number with the following song text : " Yes , I milk me , but you don 't see a cock " and " If you haven 't noticed that it 's not a euter , it 's my breasts . "	-5.1838
The slogan goes on : ' pump off , pump off , I feed the babies , pump off , pump off , pump off , I milk my ladies ' .	-3.6971
However , the ad published on the company 's Facebook page has caused controversy online .	-3.6971
With 77,000 calls and hundreds of comments , the video has received mixed reactions from spectators , many of whom say that it illuminates the " horrors " of the dairy industry .	-3.1766
'It is a very bad decision to promote this product with cows ' .	-2.5389
Like us , they must become pregnant and bear to produce milk , except that their babies are taken away within a few days after birth , " a person wrote .	-3.6793
The Elvie Milk Pump fits unobtrusively into a Still Bra ( Elvie / Mother ) .	-3.7693
Another commented : " Understandably traumatic for mother and baby .	-1.2468
But yes , why not advertise with them for a milk pump for mothers who can keep their babies ?	-2.8574
Someone else added : ' Such an external acquisition ' .	-9.0010

The ad is a bit crazy , but I took it as what it was .	-2.1088
This is a brilliant product , " wrote one person .	-2.7237
Another commented : ' This is a funny advertisement for mothers who feel abpumped ( often in their jobs or toilets ) and like ' cows ' .	-3.7230
This is not advertising that praises or judges the dairy industry . '	-3.1226
At the end of the video , the group of women reveals that they all danced with the discreet pumps in their bras .	-2.7968
The concept of the campaign is based on the recognition that many women pumping milk say that they feel like cows .	-2.6449
The Elvie Pump , however , is completely noiseless , has no wires or hoses and fits inexhaustibly into a quiet bra , giving women the freedom to move , keep their babies and even go out on pumping .	-5.5493
Ana Balarin , partner and ECD at Mother commented : " The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that deserves a bold and provocative market introduction .	-3.2350

Hundreds of migrant children moved quietly into a camp on the Texas border .	-3.0547
The number of imprisoned children with migratory backgrounds increased , even though monthly crossings remained relatively unchanged , partly because the Trump administration ’ s hard rhetoric and policy made it more difficult to find children ’ s sponsors .	-3.8158
Traditionally , most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves , and fear that they will risk being referred to the country when they work for a child .	-4.3392
The risk increased in June , when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to fingerprint and that the data would be passed on to the immigration authorities .	-10.0070
Last week , Matthew Albence , a senior official within the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Authority , testified to Congress that the Agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to support unaccompanied minors .	-2.7611

" Almost 80 percent of the people who are either sponsors or household members of sponsors are illegal here in the country , and a large proportion of them are criminal alien .	-10.0025

Proponents said that these concerns are being reinforced in a larger institution such as Tornillo , where signs that a child has to fight are more likely to be overlooked because of its size .	-5.1156

Foreign Secretary Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home before the UN General Assembly , even though the war in the country has been going on for eight years .	-3.3029
Moualem , who is also Deputy Prime Minister , said that the foreign armed forces are illegal on Syrian soil under the pretext of combating terrorism , and “ they will deal with it accordingly . ”	-4.0759
“ You must withdraw immediately , ” he said to the Assembly .	-2.5709
Moualem claimed stiffly and firmly that in Syria , the “ war on terror was almost over . ” More than 360,000 people have died in the country since 2011 , millions more have been displaced from their homes .	-4.0847

On the question of refugees , Moualem said that the conditions for return are right , and he accused “ some Western countries of irrational fears ” that led refugees to stay away .	-4.1576
“ We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate return , ” Moualem said .	-2.7763
“ They are actually politicizing a purely humanitarian issue . ”	-2.3882
The US and the European Union pointed out that only when a political agreement between Assad and the opposition on an end to the war could there be reconstruction aid for Syria .	-4.1680
UN diplomats said that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last major rebel fortress Idlib created the possibility of promoting political talks .	-4.1749
The Russian-Turkish deal prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian troops on the province where three million people live .	-2.8750
Moualem , however , emphasized that the agreement provides for “ clear deadlines , ” hoping that military action will be directed against jihadists , including fighters from the Nusra front associated with Al Qaeda , who are “ wiped out . ”	-5.6782
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes soon to convene the first meetings of a new committee of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way to elections .	-3.3654

Paul Rowlett , an analyst at the US Department of Justice , announced several hours as an expert in the field of information evaluation .	-3.4489
He outlined for the jury how he compiled the movements of the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim , Jessica Chamber , on the night of her death using mobile phone records .	-4.3548
Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones showing that Tellis was at Chambers in the evening of her death , which contradicted his previous claims , The Clarion Ledger reported .	-3.9042
The analysis of the data on Chamber ’ s mobile phone showed that he was in the society of his friend Michael Sanford , and then Sanford was interrogated by the by the police .	-4.6940
Sanford said on Saturday and explained that he was not in the city that day .	-3.1760
On the question of prosecutors whether Tellis spent the night in Sanfords Truck , he replied that he had lied because his truck was in Nashville at that time .	-4.1188

A children 's girl from New York sues a couple for discriminatory redundancy , having received a letter not to them from the mother who complains that she is " another black person " .	-4.7253
The couple denies that they are racist and considers the complaint for " blackmail " .	-2.7448
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman , a mother of two children , was dismayed when she discovered that her new childcare , Giselle Maurice , was black when she took her first day in 2016 .	-3.6110
Mrs Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a short notice : " Neiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiin NOCH A SWARZH<unk>UTIGE PERSON " .	-3.9039
Instead of sending him to her husband , she sent him twice to Mrs Maurice .	-1.9371
Having noticed her patzer , a " inconvenient " plasco-flaxman dismissed Ms Maurice and explained that her outgoing child , who was Afro-American , did a bad job and that she wanted to hire a filipino instead , according to the New York Post .	-5.5809
Mrs Maurice was paid for her work on one day and then sent home for a Uber .	-3.5180
Now Maurice sues the couple for compensation for redundancy and demands compensation of $ 350 per day for the six-month full-time recruitment for which it had originally been stopped , albeit without a contract .	-4.7399
" I want to show them , look at them , what is not done , " she said the post on Friday and added : " I know that discrimination is . "	-4.0392
The couple contrasted the claims and said that the decision to end Maurice ’ s working relationship was reasonable and that they acted for fear because they could not trust them after they insulted them .	-4.9733
" My wife sent her something she did not want to say .	-2.2612
It is not racist .	-0.6707

Paddington publishers feared that readers could not identify with a speaking bear , revealing a new letter .	-2.2521
Bond ’ s daughter Karen Jankel , who was born shortly after the acceptance of the book , said about the letter : it is difficult to enable someone to read it for the first time before the publication .	-3.8127
“ It is very amusing – now that we know about Paddington ’ s great success . ”	-2.5868
She said that her father , who had previously worked as a BBC cameraman and was then inspired to write a children ’ s book from a small toy bear , would have remained optimistic if his work had been rejected , adding that the 60th anniversary of the book publication after his death last year was “ bittersweet . ”	-4.2711
On Paddington , whom she calls “ very important family member , ” she still says that her father was silently proud of his ultimate success .	-3.6846
" He was a pretty quiet man , and he was not a bostache person , " she said .	-2.8805
" But because Paddington was so real for him , it was almost like having a child that achieves something : you are proud of the child , although it is not really your actions .	-4.3847
I think he has seen Paddington 's success a little like that .	-2.2919

The FBI investigations have begun , and Board Kavanaugh ’ s future is at stake .	-2.3821
“ I thought that if we could actually get something like what he asked for - an investigation that is limited in time and scope - we could perhaps reach a little agreement , ” said Mr Flake on Saturday and added that he feared that the committee would “ disintegrate in the midst of a deep-rooted party political blockade . ”	-6.4909
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to be determined ?	-1.9772
Their restraint is simply due to the timing .	-2.1936

North Korea ’ s Republic Volition Number has fallen under Kim	-4.0769
The number of North Korean survivors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago , a South Korean MEP said .	-2.6108
Based on data from the South Unification Department , Park Byeong-seug stated that last year there were 1,127 of loyalty breaks – compared to 2,706 in 2011 .	-4.4532
Park said that stricter border controls between North Korea and China and an increase in prices among human smugglers play an essential role in this .	-3.4702
Pyongyang has not spoken in public .	-2.2371
After all , the majority of refugees from North Korea receive South Korean citizenship .	-2.5009
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953 .	-2.3514
Most flee China , which has the longest border with North Korea , which is easier to cross than the strictly guarded demilitarized zone between North and South Korea .	-2.4970
China considers the survivors to be illegal migrants , not refugees , and often forcibly returns them .	-3.1537
Relations between the North and the South , which are still formally in war , have improved significantly in recent months .	-2.6851

Nancy Pelosi describes Brett Kavanaugh as hysterical and says that he is unsuitable for the Supreme Court service	-3.3495
The Chairman of the Democratic Minority Group , Nancy Pelosi , called Brett Kavanaugh , “ hysterically ” the candidate for a seat at the Supreme Court , saying that he was unsuitable from the temperament to serve the Supreme Court .	-3.8364
Pelosi made the comments on an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin , Texas .	-1.8222
“ I could not think otherwise that if a woman had ever behaved like this , she would have called it “ hysterical , ” said Pelosi about her response to Kavanaugh ’ s statement to the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday .	-4.3167
Kavanaugh denied the claims that he had sexually attacked Dr. Christine Blasey Ford , .	-12.9831
During his opening speech , Kavanaugh was very emotional , sometimes he almost cried and fought with the tears when he talked about his family and his high school years .	-11.7192
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in committee , calling the charges against him a “ grotesque and coordinated reputation campaign , ” organized by Liberals who are angry that Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election .	-3.9162
Pelosi said that she believed that Kavanaugh had proven that he could not serve before the Supreme Court , as he showed that he was biased against Democrats .	-3.2031
“ I think he disqualifies himself with such statements and the way in which he can be influenced by the Clintons and Democrats , ” she said .	-3.3727
When asked whether , in the event of its confirmation and a democratic majority in the House of Representatives , it would seek an impeachment proceedings against Kavanaugh , Pelosi was reluctant .	-5.2754
“ I want to say the following : if he tells the truth neither to Congress nor to the FBI , he is not only unsuitable for the Supreme Court service , but also for the service to the court at which he is currently employed , ” said Pelosi .	-5.7196
Kavanaugh is currently a district judge in D.C. Court of Appeal .	-2.6188
Pelosi added that she , as a democrat , is concerned about possible Kavanaugh judgments against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade , because he stands for conservative justice .	-10.5924
In his confirmation hearings , Kavanaugh has avoided questions as to whether he would tip certain decisions of the Supreme Court .	-10.0895
“ It is not time for a hysterical , biased person to go to court and expects us to say , “ Is not wonderful , ” Pelosi said .	-3.8089
And women must keep it .	-3.9453
It is a real speech of rage , months and years of anger , and it cannot get it out without crying .	-4.7998
" We cry when we become angry , " Mrs Stein said 45 years later to me .	-2.6070
'I do not think this is unusual , or ? '	-2.2830
She continued : “ I once helped a woman , in the executive , who told me that she also wept when she became angry , but she developed a technique in which she began to cry every time she became angry and started to cry , to the person she spoke to , saying , “ They like to think that I am sad because I cry .	-6.1249
