Munich 1856 : Four cards that change your view of the city	-2.6193
A wrong place where young people are to meet today .	-4.0059
A greyhound chapel where the S-Bahn tunnel is now digged .	-4.4120
Small gardeners manage the former cause of farmers .	-3.5720
The oldest official map in Munich promotes exciting stories .	-2.4484
It nerves if maps are not current .	-3.4142
Everyone knows this because the Auto-Navi showed a green meadow instead of a bypass road .	-4.8174
The historical maps of the digital Bavarian Atlas , an offer of the Geoportal Bavaria of the State Government , are far from topical - but this is precisely why very revealing .	-5.7244
Especially when comparing them with current online cards .	-2.3689
Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the Munich Merkur spread since the 19th century .	-3.7181
The digital Bavarian Atlas is a patchwork that is not identified as such .	-3.4222
The large overview map included more detailed maps for cities and municipalities , so-called Urposition sheets .	-4.8645
These were created according to the Bavarian survey management between 1810 and 1864 and stemmed from the first survey in Bavaria .	-10.9625
Your client : Napoleon .	-1.0384
The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .	-2.2450
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic reception of Bavaria - for military purposes , of course .	-3.1053
Even though the French troops eventually withdrew with the peace of Lunéville on 9 February 1801 , it was today ’ s neighbors who created the idea of a comprehensive Bavarian map .	-4.3448
Kurfürst Max IV Joseph continued the project , founded the " Topographische Bureau " - and thus the Bavarian survey management .	-3.6178
The Urpositionsblatt für Munich dates back to 1856 and can be found on the website of the Bavarian State Library , like all others .	-5.4312
The comparison earlier / today is most impressive in the example of the state capital .	-3.6517
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .	-3.0196
An example of this is Untersendling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856 .	-3.2946
Sendling was incorporated into the Munich district 21 years after the map was created , i.e. 1877 .	-4.4683
Today Untersendling lies in the middle of the city .	-2.7253
Untersendlings houses concentrate around 1856 along the current Plinganserstra<unk>e , named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878 , a leader of the insurgency of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705 .	-8.2426
Where the Westpark is today , nothing is seen as fields - at first sight : a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears when zooming in : handwritten numbered corridors from the so-called " Uraufnahme " , from which the land tax was derived .	-6.5049
Small parcels no longer occupy farmers there - but small gardeners of the " Land in Sun " plant .	-4.7817
A large green area is north of subsendling .	-3.8656
The Theresienwiese , the site of the Oktoberfest since 1810 , was in fact still a meadow in the 19th century - not a concrete desert .	-4.4279
On the other hand , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine .	-2.2579
In the Urpositionsblatt , in the area of today 's Au-Haidhausen district , one reads not only the street name " am Gasteig " or the hill " On the air " - but also in large letters " Irren Anstalt " .	-5.8920
Yes , here on Auerfeldstra<unk>e , people were once locked in with madness .	-4.1533
In 1858 / 59 the Munich-Kreis-Irrenanstalt " Auer Lüften " was established .	-4.0752
From 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the institution - the psychiatrist who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .	-4.0777
" He was progressive for his time and ended , for example , the chain of so-called mistakes .	-2.9158
He has also prohibited the staff from using violence against the occupants , " says Hermann Wilhelm , Head of the Haidhausen Museum , who has dealt with the institute for an exhibition .	-4.7105
For 280 patients , there was first room and later 500 seats were extended .	-5.4658
At some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the circular installation in Haar 1905 .	-4.5414
Since 2006 the Isar Amper-Klinikum München-Ost , one of the largest psychiatrics in Germany , is located there .	-3.9213
On the grounds of the former Auer Anstalt young people meet in the Munich Salesianum .	-4.3592
The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth home with training companies .	-9.7640
Western lies the football square of the TSV Munich East , eastern residential houses from the 1980s .	-4.6141
In 2015 , the children 's house " Casa Don Bosco " was built in an architectural fashion with the original construction of the Irrenanstalt , which had been destroyed during World War II during bombing .	-6.4787
Marienplatz was recorded in 1856 as " Hauptplatz " , the Kaufingerstra<unk>e was called " Kaufinger Gasse " .	-3.5260
The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .	-2.5276
The bombs of the allies torn many holes into the city centre in December 1944 .	-2.9936
One big remained to this day - at the Marienhof .	-12.4162
The English Institute , Small Business Houses and a Middle Ages Greyhound Chapel once stood at the Marienhof , where preparatory work was carried out and on 5 April 2017 the sponsorship for the second S-Bahn road was carried out .	-7.5999
With the slider you can compare the old Munich card with today 's aerial image - and fill up the hole at the Marienhof .	-3.7240
Civil Rights Group publishes travel warning for Missouri	-2.2408
The National Association for the Promotion of Colors has issued a warning for coloured people travelling to Missouri because of the discriminatory policies and the racist attacks of the state .	-3.9543
" The NAACP Travel Advisory for the Federal State of Missouri , which is due to enter into force until 28 August 2017 , calls on Afro-American travellers , visitors and Missourians to pay special attention on travel by the State and to be extremely careful , as a number of questionable , racial incidents have recently occurred throughout the state and are noted here , " says the Group 's opinion .	-6.4763
A recent law of Missouri , which makes it more difficult for people to win discrimination actions , and the law enforcement authorities of the state , which disproportionately target minorities , led the group to issue the travel warning , said NAACP .	-4.8846
" They have violations of civil rights , people happen .	-3.2690
They are stopped because of their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , " said the President of Missouri NAACP , Rod Chapel , the Kansas City Star .	-3.5466
'We hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not yet heard ' .	-2.2618
It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States .	-7.3972
The group cited incidents such as racist offences against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .	-2.2911
Sanders died in questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year , when he had no petrol during his journey through the state and was detained by the Missouri police without being accused of a crime .	-4.3709
The Council also points to a recent report by the Office of the Prosecutor General of Missouri , which shows that black drivers in the state are stopped 75 % more than whites .	-4.4618
" The recommendation is that people are aware of what might happen in Missouri , " said Chapel .	-2.2975
'People must be prepared , whether they bring deposit money or let the relatives know that they travel through the state . '	-4.4047
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FBI ’ s hate crime reporting program , which classify the state ’ s 16th rank in terms of the number of such injuries .	-4.1359
Travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law , which would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination .	-2.6287
Previously , the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states had adopted immigration laws obliging local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for infringements of immigration , which the ACLU believes will contribute to further racial profiling .	-4.1016
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Department of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but recently stakeholders have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US .	-3.3252
Pasture fence project is elementary	-3.2432
The Fischerbacher Weidezaun project is a success project and will continue next year .	-2.1042
The CDU federal parliamentarians Peter Wei<unk> and Kordula Kovac have taken a picture on the ground .	-10.4628
Representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU local association met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MEPs at the Schwendemann Family Rightgrabenhof .	-4.6765
Markus Schwendemann initially gave insights into his farm , where he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , supplies 40 milk cows and just as many young animals and houses holiday guests in five apartments .	-4.8204
The " Black Forest Milk " is for him the alternative marketing route for the milk of his cows , says Schwendemann .	-3.3511
On the table of tourists comes only regional ones .	-5.0526
Since he is also BLHV chairman of Fischerbach , he called the pasture fence project " fundamental " .	-3.4263
I cannot profit on such steep areas .	-3.2436
The green landscape provides a lot of work , a lot of work needs to be done with the motor sen.	-5.2824
" We have to fight here with the conditions and topography , " said Schwendemann .	-3.5482
In 2003 he took over the parental farm and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if he does not operate biofuels .	-5.1144
For mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : " The municipality has recognized the importance of the pasture fence project and is glad about leader promotion " . the , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-10.3378
At the cost of EUR 3000 to 4000 per hectare , farmers should be supported .	-2.8876
It is to be hoped that this will allow the reforestation of the land to be extended for a while .	-6.1613
" The greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and are concerned about how they continue to operate , " the mayor stressed .	-5.0411
Farmers are often criticised for promoting them .	-3.1156
In 2013 , a total of 25 pasture fences were fenced by eleven participants .	-3.9990
The open-air area is therefore 40 hectares , which must not be reformed by at least 2023 .	-4.4899
Of the total cost of EUR 71 500 , half was supported by leaders , a quarter was borne by the municipality of Fischerbach .	-4.4767
Thus , farmers remained 12 610 euros , which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of pasture fences .	-10.5732
" The big advantage is the longevity of fences , " explained Schwendemann .	-2.4188
Kordula Kovac emphasized : " You are doing a good job , without farmers and farmers it is not possible " .	-4.6989
Peter Wei<unk> also stated : ' Here the best food is produced ' .	-4.4685
The Landscape Court ( LPR ) Baden-Württemberg enables the state to promote pasture fences .	-3.4924
The aim is to keep the Black Forest open .	-1.6867
A prerequisite is the existence of a backdrop of funding designated by the LPR .	-4.7622
Furthermore , the fencing area must not be slow-manageable ( slowdown above 35 % ) and must therefore be threatened with afforestation .	-5.5581
For the Fischerbacher Weidezaunprojekt 2018 , the application of eight participants with 24 plots is currently under way , which want to build just under 16 kilometres of fence .	-5.0516
The open-air area is 35 hectares , with calculated costs exceeding 112 000 euros .	-4.0560
Is nothing more sacred ?	-1.0827
Now the Trump White House is Statue of Freedom	-2.9608
The safest sign of regime change is when they start to attack the statues .	-2.3437
The Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein in Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003 .	-3.8762
Stephen Miller , one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN on the President ’ s proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty .	-4.0616
To remain fair , Miller did not attack the statue itself .	-1.5022
A horde of boat owners and liberty imitators would have liked him if he had done so .	-2.5341
But he attacked their meaning , and especially the importance attributed to it when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus was added to its base in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument .	-4.2317
When Miller Acosta insulted : " I do not want to go into a complete thing about history here , but the statue of liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world .	-4.0061
The poem you refer to , which was added later and is not part of the original statue of freedom . '	-3.0865
Miller is factually right , but as he himself put it , it is not really about history .	-3.1275
It is about contemporary resonance to the shattering words of Lazarus , the only one in which a state not only invites any old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : ' Your murders , your poor , / your afflicted masses , who want to breathe freely , / the miserable waste of your rich coasts ' .	-6.3900
There was never a time when the ' miserable waste ' on our screens was better to see .	-3.2684
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump ’ s US .	-2.6838
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate : it is indeed a conflict about America 's importance .	-3.0956
Lazarus - and her friends who campaigned to place their words on the ground after their death - knew very well that they did a highly political act .	-4.3384
The sculpture should show the links between French and American Republicanism by representing the female embodiment of freedom in a depleted classical picture .	-4.1741
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem , the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .	-2.9911
And she gives herself a very different name : Mother of the exiles .	-2.8053
The combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism .	-2.4996
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , people on the right wanted to change it back for a long time .	-3.7893
The great script Rush Limbaugh , a kind of John the Baptist for Trump ’ s coming , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Freedom is not inviting anyone , but rather an early neo-conservative that brings the American flame to the surrounded world : “ Lady Liberty is moving forward .	-5.1255
It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .	-2.0245
The torch should not illuminate the way to the United States . '	-2.9430
Limbaugh has found something quite unusual here .	-3.8744
The importance of the statue is absolutely a matter of the position of perception .	-3.0928
The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see it as seen by the exhausted , miserable but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships .	-3.6465
In the truest sense , it is a question of seeing the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and an opportunity to improve their . the , , , , or , , . , , , ,	-8.9572
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome that they must hear .	-2.6816
Of course , that is not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to recognise .	-3.0514
Their torch should not illuminate the way , but inflame hatred , which is their only source of power .	-3.3587
World Championship 2017 : Neil Black praises Scottish members of the British teBthe B. the the . the the , the the the the .	-11.5230
Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when only two Scots belonged to the British team	-2.5244
The United Kingdom 's Director of Light Thletics , Neil Black , says that the 16-member Scottish contingent in the World Cup ' will make a massive contribution to the team ' .	-4.3964
A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which will start on Friday .	-2.3835
Black believes that ' something special develops in Scotland ' and the United Kingdom 's athletics must learn something from it .	-3.7348
" We welcome it , and we try to understand it , and we will continue until we find it out , " said Black .	-2.9335
" I speak to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think that it has something to do with what they have done .	-9.7992
The Scottish athletes think that it has something to do with what they have done .	-2.1447
British athletics : It has something to do with what they have done .	-2.0337
And also with the type on the street corner .	-2.7578
Whatever the combination of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . '	-1.6201
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal candidates , including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track , while Eilidh Doyle was elected team captain by the team .	-4.3661
" Eilidh is quite modest .	-1.2809
Her captain speech was incredible , " says Black .	-2.1581
" A number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or whatever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .	-2.6928
The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh naturally introduced were great . '	-3.4406
The Commonwealth Silver Medal winner , who will compete at the 400-m hurdles in their fifth World Championships , says that it is " incredible " that 16 Scots are in the British team .	-11.3460
Scotland ’ s best total number of athletes at the World Cup was seven , reached in 1983 and 2015 .	-3.4458
The medium-haul runner Muir is on this path and has drawn up five British and two European records last year .	-4.1790
It will participate in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs .	-10.4335
Chris O 'Hare , who runs 1,500 metres , is another Scot that should be observed after a great season involving the victory with the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games .	-4.2755
Doyle recalls her first World Championships when the only other Scot in the Team Lee McConnell was .	-3.4347
The team captain says that they are " enormously proud " of the fact that many of their compatriots will not only be part of the team , but will in some cases also be involved in the medals and finals .	-5.5479
" The special feature of being a team captain is that she was elected by the other members of the team , so it was a great honour anyway , but knowing that my team colleagues voted for me and elected me , it makes something very special for me , " she added .	-5.0191
" Obviously I am very proud of all the Scots who belong to the team .	-2.0407
It only shows how far we have come .	-2.0347
And they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to rise to podiums .	-2.9384
As far as my speech as a captain is concerned ?	-2.0371
Yes , I think she went well .	-1.2849
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation , because we have a World Home Championship .	-4.0076
It is therefore really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back in the Olympic Stadium .	-3.6000
I get a second chance to go out and compete there and it will simply be such a great atmosphere outside . '	-4.4889
Block critics on Facebook : Do not apply for a public office if you cannot bear the heating of voters .	-4.1645
The father of our country knew something of bad press .	-1.7577
Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long for newspapers to beat him for everything , from domestic politics to his political principles .	-8.8162
He shouted in critique , certainly .	-3.8109
But he did not silence his critics .	-1.2303
Because in 1783 , Washington said : ' Freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and silent , we are led to battle like the sheep ' .	-4.0694
This brings me to Governor Larry Hogan , Maryland , who must work to be more like Washington .	-2.3497
Hogan 's employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .	-3.1010
And the American Civil Liberties Union therefore sued him earlier this week .	-2.4236
The Governor 's staff released the complaint as frivol , and the online comment was full of a backlash with " Well , and ? " .	-2.8856
" It 's just Facebook , " said many people .	-2.1005
But it is important .	-0.7615
And it is particularly important when it is a type like Hogan .	-2.2894
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state that is amazingly popular .	-2.1909
He has the second highest consent of the 50 governors of the nation .	-2.3333
Hogan is not a reactionary heat head .	-1.1495
He has shown a firm hand in leading his state and strict compliance with principles .	-10.9787
He was also very skilful in using Facebook as a primary tool to connect with his constituents and to debut his hairless head on his side after chemotherapy .	-4.6586
Therefore , the blocking of people who come to the Governor 's side - a public forum that is called official and paid by employees with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .	-5.2580
In an interview with The Washington Post , Hogan ’ s spokesman Amelia Chasse defended the governor ’ s actions , arguing that blocking comments is nothing more than a moderation .	-2.7408
But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hate-filled people who swing the stick online .	-3.8653
The post talked to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan .	-10.2150
And these are only real people who speak to their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur , and a priest , not a troll .	-3.2141
They all said that their comments were respectful , thoughtful and not profan .	-1.6996
The parish quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan 's Catholic faith .	-2.4955
Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie , Md . , was not hateful , but she asked about hate crimes .	-2.8569
" I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other current news , " she wrote in the commentary area of the news broadcast " The Post " .	-3.1739
" I do not appreciate this idea , either , when a number of people take a position on the same subject , they are disregarded by some as a so-called collective effort and not recognised as a large group of citizens concerned " .	-6.3812
What the governor ’ s staff called “ concentrated spam attack , ” others would probably call “ advocacy . ”	-3.5109
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message simply by blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment .	-2.1600
It is much cleaner than in the past if we had done the same thing that staff were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical guidelines or arrest and silence protesters .	-3.8434
But that is exactly what is happening digitally .	-7.4898
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticised for insulting Facebook and other social media .	-2.3583
President Trump is sued by Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed .	-2.0047
One of the first milestones on this issue fell in Virginia last week .	-1.9630
The Loudoun County Board Chairman injured the First Amendment , according to US District James C. Cacheris in Alexandria , when she banished a voter from her Facebook side .	-4.1237
And in Kentucky , Governor Matt Bevin ( R ) also received a visit from ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter .	-2.4777
That should not be so difficult .	-1.5564
At the time of Washington , the time of affordable porto had a similar effect to the Internet .	-3.3533
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800 , and anonymous letters beat his leadership .	-3.5617
Even then , Washington had anonymous trolls .	-1.0527
The people who used pseudonyms such as " Juricola " , " Valerius " , " Belisarius " and " Portius " wrote all the letters to newspapers that made Washington 's decisions .	-3.2542
Petitions that criticized his position on the Amity Treaty , trade and shipping with Britain overwhelmed his office , according to the historical documents collected by the George Washington Project 's online papers .	-4.1237
But he did not silence them .	-1.5082
Freedom of speech , disagreement and discourse belong to the foundation of our nation .	-2.6833
And true leadership means accepting that .	-7.1258

In the past two decades , fewer and fewer people have died of lung cancer because of passive smoking .	-2.4694
Scientists at the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf ( UKE ) are coming to this conclusion in a study .	-4.2935
" According to our estimates , 167 lung cancer deaths are due to passive smoking per year , " said study leader Heiko Becher .	-3.6233
As a comparison , he drawn up his own study on this subject from 1994 .	-3.6407
At that time there were 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking per year in Germany .	-3.0738

On December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children was out and Christmas songs sang in front of a campfire in Enarotali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle .	-3.5512

One of the soldiers took offense at their tone and later came back with four soldiers , according to the local pastor Yavedt Tebai .	-3.9077
The soldiers who had drinked hunted and beaten the group with their guns , said victims and witnesses .	-2.9251
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .	-1.6255

When the mood was heated up , a command was sent to the soldiers via an internal radio : " When the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , " said an official document by TIME , which was not released to the local media .	-4.8462
Yeremias Kayame , 56 , head of the Kego Koto district of Enarotali , saw the threat and called for calm and called for the crowd to return home .	-3.2925
Nobody was listening in the mood .	-1.8515
" When I turned around , I was suddenly shot in my left wrist , " he said TIME on the veranda of his colourful wooden house .	-3.1926

Three weeks in Jayapura , Jokowi made a passionate speech in which he expressed sympathies for the families of the victims and vowed to address the historical maladministration in Papua .	-3.3678

" Most injuries occurred a long time ago .	-1.5591
Some were in the 90s and early 2000s .	-1.6760
The point is that we have committed ourselves to tackling these infringements , but there are processes that must be undergone , " he said .	-3.5497
Then Wiranto retreated when he spoke to TIME on 5 June in Jakarta and said that he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua .	-3.3778
Instead , ' everything is regulated by law ' , he said .	-2.3609
Wiranto , who charged the UN for ' crimes against humanity ' , which claimed more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor 's bloody 1999 independence vote , said that 11 cases of human rights violations had already been resolved in Papua , including the Paniai incident .	-3.4340
Families of the Paniai victims received such claims with grim infidelity .	-2.9457

On Tuesday the Indonesian police launched villagers in Paniai ’ s neighborhood Deiyai .	-8.7685
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company that refused to bring a conscious man to hospital , one person died and 17 others were injured , including children .	-3.1977
The man , the 24-year-old Ravianus Douw , who was drowned when he fished in a nearby river , died on his way to the hospital .	-7.9240
Excited villagers protested in front of the company ’ s office .	-3.1385
The police said that the villagers threw stones to officers who responded by firing warning shots .	-2.4438
But locals say that the mobile brigade ( Indonesian paramilitary police ) began to shoot on the crowd and killed one .	-2.3047
" We were so panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , " says Dominggu Badii , 29-year-old , living near the hospital and witnessing how the injured was quickly delivered here , says the TIME .	-4.9021
'I have hidden myself in my house for two days ' .	-2.8381
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the officers involved to be held accountable and to withdraw the mobile police brigade from the territory .	-3.3560
Paniai has always been a source of concern for the Indonesian Government .	-10.9009
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the dissatisfaction of tribal members Mee , Moni , Dani and Damal , who live in the green highlands of Papua .	-3.6006
Many joined the " Free Papua Movement " ( OPM ) , the rebel army , which claims to defend the rights of the Papua by launching sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers . the the the the . the the the the the the the the . the the	-8.5873
Some of the top OPM guides come from Paniai , including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya .	-1.7861
In response , thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and arbitrarily detained in recent years , on the pretext of ' safeguarding national sovereignty ' .	-2.6433
Some never reappear .	-2.2832
Among the people of Papua , Paniai is known as " a tragic , forgotten place " .	-2.5385
Poverty strengthens discontent .	-1.6533
The bit of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals .	-1.7701
Bread is just as out of reach .	-2.2614
People here grow everything they eat : especially nota and fruit and leaf vegetables .	-2.8780
Agriculture is the task of women who can handle four or five fields of sweet potatoes .	-10.2956
They retain the majority of family harvest while the rest is sold on the local market .	-3.5727
Ten pieces of nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees ( 75 cents ) .	-1.8098
Over time , economic inequalities have grown between the indigenous Papua and the new migrants , who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to Nabire Airport .	-4.3791
The few jobs that exist in the region usually go to better educated and wealthier migrants .	-2.4783
Papua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to run their own companies competitively .	-3.1416
" Young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money here , " says John Gobai , Chairman of the Tribal Council of Paniai .	-3.2478
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua .	-1.6249
Furthermore , restrictions on reporting on international media remain tense .	-2.5367
At the beginning of the year , French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported for lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua , although they were given the rare permission to film .	-11.9408
According to Phelim Kine , the Deputy Asian Director of Human Rights Watch , Jokowi ’ s campaign to lift reporting restrictions in order to promote transparency and development has not been implemented .	-3.4958
" There are new threats to foreign journalists trying to report to Indonesia 's most troubled eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua : visa denial and a black list , " he said in a statement .	-3.4143
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian Government remains largely limited to the immediate neighbours of Papua .	-2.8008
In March , six Pacific states - Tonga , Nauru , Palau , Tuvalu , the Marshall Islands and the Salomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the ' different and widespread violations ' in Papua , including the Paniai shooting company .	-2.9801
The same countries have historically supported the OPM .	-1.5804
The spokesman of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Arrmanatha Nasir rejected the group 's accusations and said journalists in Jakarta : ' There is still a democratic system in Indonesia , and there are free media , so it is difficult to cover up evidence of human rights cases ' .	-4.2798

Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua say that they are unlikely to vote for Jokowi again .	-2.3964
" Jokowi is a person who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Paniai shots , " says Gobai , Chairman of the Tribal Council .	-12.3140
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people , apart from living under the constant threat of a predatory military , are in poor educational and health services .	-3.0662
Gobai says that the Paniai people , like other Papua , regard their voice for Jokowi as a " guilt " that he must repay .	-3.4428
" They do not need money , they just want justice , " he says .	-2.0043
Despite the threats and intimidation , the Paniai victims ’ families carried out a final symbolic act of defiance : the corpse of a victim was buried on an area precisely opposite the police and the military station .	-4.9959
They know that they may never be justified , but at least they do not let those responsible forget their crimes .	-3.2396

Fire captures the Torch skyscraper of Dubai for the second time	-2.6617
A fire took place on Friday in one of the highest residential towers in the world in Dubai , forcing hundreds of inhabitants to flee from the 337 metres high 79-storey building .	-4.3442
It is the second fire that sweeps through the high house in just two years , which is accidentally called the Torch Tower .	-4.8678
The building was evacuated , injuries were not reported and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .	-2.1672
" We slept and we stood up at the fire alarm and the cry of the people .	-10.3203
We ran down the staircase and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor , " a resident who indicated his name as George , Reuters .	-3.9226
Dubai ’ s civil protection authorities said that the fire fighting units erased fire at 4.00 p.m. local time ( 00.00 p.m. GMT ) and cooled the building .	-4.5100

No Davis Cup reform : Next Best of Five	-2.3159
The president of the International Tennis Federation ( ITF ) has fallen through with his large Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly .	-3.6217
At the Ho-Chi-Minh City meeting , the revolutionary proposal for this sport to play Davis Cup individuals only on two rates was not supported by the required two-thirds majority .	-4.9354
The five-set classics , which are often very long but also very appreciated for this reason , remain the traditional application .	-6.6964
63.54 % of member states voted in favour of the reform , so the ITF President David Haggerty ’ s objective was barely missed .	-4.0020
" We respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members have not adopted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and the Fed Cup .	-2.5592
We need a change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historical competitions , " said Haggerty .	-9.7774
We will continue to work to improve the applications .	-2.8331
It was not until the vote , after many objections , that the proposal had already been put to the final in a neutral place .	-6.7985
New from 2018 onwards are only comparatively smaller details : Thus , the finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have host law in the first round in the following year .	-5.7485
In order to reduce the cost of the organizers , the requirements relating to training courses etc. will be facilitated and players will have to complete less official media appointments before the Davis Cup .	-5.4967
More than 1 out of 5 US travellers bring forbidden items to the plane , finds a survey out of a poll .	-5.3239
A survey among air passengers revealed that more than 20 percent consciously or unconsciously prohibited items were smuggling past the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent that entered the aircraft while carrying accidentally banned knives or other items with blades .	-5.3311
Less than 1 % claimed that they had late discovered that they were mistaken with firearms , ammunition , or explosives .	-3.5729
The survey of more than 1,000 people - carried out by a jet charter service , Stratos Jet Charters Inc . - also found that younger travellers are more likely to disregard the rules .	-4.6221
Of those respondents who admitted that they knowingly tried to fly with something prohibited by the TSA , 19.7 % were millennials , compared to less than 15 % of Generation X members .	-4.0539
The most common items deliberately passed by TSA agents were food and liquids .	-3.1424
More than 3 percent admitted to have knowingly carried objects with blades through security control , while 2.2 percent of female respondents and 3.7 percent of male respondents also confirmed that they had deliberately brought prohibited drugs to the plane .	-5.0114
The company said that it asked travellers all over the country to find out how many accidentally smuggling goods had brought about airport safety and how many would have done it intentionally .	-4.9259
It is no surprise that the people who wear smuggling goods - knowledgeably or ignorantly - by safety were those who fly most frequently .	-5.0212
However , the company points out that the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing .	-2.8263
People are often unsure what liquids they can take with them or how much of them .	-3.7267
So it is no surprise that the greatest amount of liquids seized by TSA are prohibited .	-3.5751
For a while , people thought that the TSA could see books as smuggling goods .	-2.9358
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .	-1.7787
Elon Musk doesn ’ t care : tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel orders	-2.8416
Electro-thousandsassa Elon Musk likes to show the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla " Model 3 " .	-3.8726
He has hitherto failed to recognize that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation .	-5.2786
In addition to the constantly triumphant figures on increases in sales and even more gigantic sales targets , Tesla Chief Elon Musk has for the first time betrayed a different , less splendid figure in announcing the latest quarterly balance sheet : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 .	-13.0810
In recent months , Musk has often advertised more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car , whose delivery is just beginning .	-4.2617
Now Musk acknowledges : 63,000 of the 518,000 pre-orders have been withdrawn . . the the the . the the the . the the the . the	-11.0149
Critics repeatedly pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations .	-2.6619
In case of cancellation , Tesla will return the 1000 euros ( in the U.S. $ 1000 and in the UK $ 1000 ) " reservation payment " in full .	-5.6905
There are currently 455,000 such non-binding reservations , Musk admitted to a telephone conference with analysts .	-3.5412
However , the Tesla boss does not believe that the cancellation of around 12 percent of all orders could become a problem .	-4.5352
His argument is that the challenge of ambitious growth targets is not demand , but the production side .	-3.2207
Last year Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles .	-1.3470
In 2018 , all models will be 500,000 , in 2020 one million .	-4.2872
The demand for this is obvious .	-1.8895
According to Musk , there are currently 1800 reservations per day .	-2.4408
Anyone who orders a " Model 3 " today can expect delivery in the second half of 2018 at the earliest - if Tesla manages to drive its brand new , unprecedented production roads without major interruptions with maximum utilization .	-6.0315
Many experts doubt that this is possible .	-1.4506
But if there are major delays , the non-binding reservations could become a problem for Tesla .	-10.2577
Because then the company cannot prevent unsatisfied customers from running away in Scharen .	-11.2182
EPA Chief Pruitt withdraws to reduce emissions due to the delay in Obama Era ’ s rules .	-3.6415
One day after he was sued by 15 states , Scott Pruitt , the head of the Environmental Protection Agency , withdrew his previous decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules to reduce emissions of air pollutants .	-3.7075
Pruitt presented the change when his agency proved more responsive to the needs of the state environmental authorities than previous administrations .	-3.7575
He did not mention the lawsuit that had been brought against his previous post in a federal appeal court .	-3.4480
It is a deadline for states on 1 October to meet the 2015 standards for soil ozone .	-3.7107
In June , Pruitt announced that he would delay compliance by a year to give his authority more time , study the plan and avoid " interfering in local decisions or hindering economic growth . "	-3.2788
Pruitt , who was President Donald Trump Public Prosecutor of Oklahoma prior to his appointment , has long been a reliable opponent of more stringent environmental regulations .	-3.3718
Since his arrival in Washington , Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations that the chemical industry and the fossil fuel industry are opposed to .	-3.0543
The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the recent legal setback for the Pruitts regulatory rollback agenda .	-1.7169
Last month , a Federal Appeal Court in Washington decided that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration that committed oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leakage .	-10.7951
In a statement published on Wednesday evening , Pruitt suggested that his reversal of ozone standards simply reinforced EPAs ’ willingness to cooperate with the States through the complex process of meeting the new standards in time .	-4.7972
" Under previous administrations , EPAs often failed to meet the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be charged by activist groups and others , and in an agreement to set the deadline for implementation , " said Pruitt , who sued the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job .	-4.9531
" We do not believe in legal regulation and we take deadlines seriously .	-2.6156
We also take seriously the law and the authority we have . '	-2.2768
Nevertheless , the EPA 's opinion said that Pruitt will eventually use its ' powers of delay and all other legally available powers ' to ensure that the rules are ' based on a solid policy and the best available information ' .	-5.3000
Congress Republicans are pushing for a more comprehensive recast of the ozone rules .	-8.0046
A draft law approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .	-2.6674
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate .	-1.4309
The New York Public Prosecutor Eric Schneiderman , who headed the coalition of the states that sued the EPA this week , said that the group intends to maintain legal pressure .	-3.7803
" The reversal of the EPAs - according to our complaints - is an important benefit to health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities , " said Schneiderman .	-4.6505
New York joined California , Connecticut , Delaware , Illinois , Iowa , Maine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Pennsylvania , Rhode Island , Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia .	-1.7965
Soil ozone arises when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil refineries , chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere respond to sunlight .	-3.2149
The emerging smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people and contribute to thousands of premature deaths every year .	-2.7916
Representatives of public health and environmentalists cheered Pruitt ’ s surprising change of course .	-3.5141
" It is worrying how much pressure it takes to get this sensible step from the person responsible for the protection of the air we breathe in , " said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity .	-3.5998

In 1267 the St. Hilarius Chapel was first mentioned in the document book in Württemberg : Count Hermann von Sulz sold " the mountain with the parish church of Tumlingen and the Vogtei " to Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver .	-12.4115
According to the text of the document , on the Tumlinger Berg , apart from the former parish church , there was also a dominant court , to which the church or patronage law belonged and not vice versa .	-5.4283
So people lived there too .	-1.9943
As the description of the Office of Freudenstadt of 1858 shows , besides the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf , which are still visible today in the village scene of Tumlingen , the " Mountain " was the third , the dominant settlement centre of the village .	-6.7703
Old maps dating back to 1600 underpin these historical circumstances .	-9.2772
The patronage law was born from the early Middle Ages own church law .	-4.9924
A Lord who built a church , equipped and occupied with a priest , remained the owner of this church and was able to inherit this church .	-4.4793
This was the right to use a priest or to propose a new priest to the bishop .	-4.2747
Three altars existed in the church and two bells on the tower .	-2.0456
The larger of the two crushed on Christmas 1673 .	-8.4532
The newly acquired bell first sounded in 1692 , but later in the Second World War in 1942 had to be abandoned .	-5.0313
In the 30-year war ( 1616 to 1648 ) , the windows were beaten and the bell ropes were stolen .	-4.1548
The roof was leaky .	-4.0110
In 1796 , French troops camped near the church .	-2.5474
They erupted the canzels and church chairs and used them as firewood .	-3.8733
The remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809 .	-1.8750
Until 1869 , the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler .	-3.1887
In 1823 the cemetery was expanded and the Hilariuskirche broke off .	-6.9312
Only the church tower was stopped .	-3.0041
In the New Year ’ s Night in 1834 , a storm divided the church tower and half collapsed .	-3.0589
To prevent an accident , the tower was aborted .	-3.0995
Only the tower fortifications still existing today were preserved as a witness to the 750-year-old church history .	-5.2458

As an organiser , the friends and sponsors Tumlingens invite to the sixth serenade to the old cemetery to the St. Hilarius Chapel on Sunday , July 16 .	-4.8195
It is designed by the combo of the Kepler Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with contributions from Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis .	-3.2277

Association wants to check the approval of wind wheels	-3.1513
" Boisheim defends itself " does not see any legal requirement for the construction and has therefore turned to the council .	-5.0728
The association " Boisheim defends itself " has asked Landrat Andreas Coenen ( CDU ) to withdraw his permission for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheim Net .	-4.0874
It has been unlawful .	-2.1954
The association argues that at the time of the approval on 30 December 2016 , no wind power plants could have been approved in the Boisheimer Nette , since at the time in Viersen there was only a wind power concentration zone on the city border with Schwalmtal .	-5.9912
Within this concentration zone , the construction and operation of wind turbines is generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone excludes the use of wind energy for the rest of the city .	-4.7997
Such zones should prevent the landscape from being ' saved ' .	-3.6836
The city of Viersen had decided a second wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette a few days earlier by changing the area use plan - but the district government of Düsseldorf had not approved it because of a form error .	-6.3581
" Due to the lack of planning requirements , the authorisation notice granted is still illegal and therefore to withdraw , " said Christoph Erkens , Chairman of " Boisheim defends himself " .	-5.2568
Current state of affairs : Before the summer recess , the city council has once again decided on the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette ; an authorisation from the district government is still out .	-7.0570
Erkens : " This excludes the granting of authorisation for the construction of wind turbines " .	-5.0560
The circle confirms the receipt of the request .	-1.7532
" The corresponding letters have been received at the Viersen County since last week , " said a speaker .	-4.1963
The circle takes it as an occasion to re-examine . the . . , , , , , , , , , , ,	-8.3576
However , they are not likely to cause the procedure to be stopped .	-3.2797
With regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court , the circle did not want to comment on the content of the argument of the association " Boisheim defends itself " on Thursday .	-5.1115
NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , plans to build four 200 metre-high wind wheels on an area on the Boisheimer Nette .	-4.3669
Last year , the company in which the city of Viersen is indirectly involved had signed leased contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land .	-4.7291
With the establishment of the four wind turbines , the electricity requirement of around 11 400 households is to be met - roughly one-fifth of the electricity requirements of all four households .	-10.3209
The NEW Re wants to invest around EUR 20 million .	-2.1092
Last summer , Viersen ’ s City Council gave the green light to purchase three wind turbines at the Linnich wind farm near Aachen and to participate in a wind turbine plant in <unk>bach-Palenberg in the Heinsberg district .	-4.0582

City and dealers are planning " home shopping " weekend	-3.1210
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region will rediscover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September .	-3.3711
The trade association and the city administration want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to attract the inhabitants to shopping in the city centre .	-4.7113
As the Chairman of the Trade Association , Christian König , announced , the " Home-Shopping " weekend is intended to raise awareness to customers of what offers their own city has to offer beyond the usual supermarket goods .	-6.3987
A market with regional suppliers is therefore planned , similar to the weekly market .	-3.3824
Furthermore , domestic companies should present themselves with their training places .	-3.9657
Moreover , the shops of the city centre are to be invited to " midnight shopping " .	-4.4666
The action is aimed not only at residents of the city and the nearest region .	-4.5105
In preparation are advertising spots on the radio , an Internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend , Christian König said .	-3.8096
City administration and trade association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce .	-2.5818
Thus the trade association and the city enter another stage of the project " Attractive City " .	-4.4599
This includes new offers such as the first " Active Day " to the Well Festival and selling open Sunday , conversations with all traders and hosts to make them participate actively .	-6.4030
Also attractive offers on Saturday and the abandonment of parking fees on this day are part of the concept .	-3.6645
In addition , customer potential should be re-exploited or re-exploited .	-4.6719
These include spa guests and tourists .	-2.7164
But many locals would have lost sight of the city ’ s city centre when shopping .	-4.3120
In the end , everyone would have to contribute to revitalizing the city centre - up to landlords , businesses of the whole city and clubs .	-6.6408
It is true to overcome the lethargy with a network , which has partly spread , King had said in spring .	-12.3822
Birgit Streich , Head of the IHK Center in Mühlhausen , announced that five Thuringian cities participated in the third " home shopping " day in Germany for the first time .	-5.0716
Besides Bad Langensalza these are Weimar , Sömmerda , Holy City and Bleicherode .	-2.8879
The day should " promote the appreciation of local commerce and emphasise its importance for the common good of our cities " , String said .	-5.4284
The action under the leadership of the IHK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen with his or her purchasing behavior can influence his or her own direct environment .	-5.2425

Trump put pressure on Mexico after leaked transcripts of telephone calls for the payment of the border wall	-3.5653
Transcripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been published by the Washington Post .	-2.0371
On January 27 , in a telephone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto , Trump called on him to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall .	-3.0211
The US President insulted him for publicly denouncing the wall , according to reports he said to him : ' You cannot tell the press . '	-4.9661
Trump launched his presidential campaign promising to build a wall on the southern border of the US , and vowed to pay Mexico for the project .	-2.6893
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and revealed a tense exchange .	-2.5636
Mr. Trump said Mr. Turnbull that trafficking for the US refugees emigrating to Australia would be " ridiculous " , " mies " , and " stupid " , and that the insistence on trade conveyed by the Obama administration would make it look like a " Depp " after proposing a ban on the resettlement of refugees to the US .	-5.5997
Mr Trump ended the call after he had told Mr Turnbull that ' this is the most unpleasant call for the whole day ' .	-4.2405
Moore ’ s Ford Massacre : Activists revive racist lynchact as a call for justice	-8.7222
A 1948 Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in rural Monroe , Georgia , and rumbled to the Ford Bridge of Moore .	-3.9622
Before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men emerged with guns to block his way .	-2.8756
The leader of the mob - a middle-age man in a needle strip suit - took a long train on his cigar and looked through the windscreen testing .	-4.4187
Inside , the occupants floated in fear .	-2.7765
" We want this n ---- r Roger ! " the man broke .	-3.0082
'Get him out of the car ! '	-2.1882
Screams torn the silence when a young black man was destroyed by the front-passenger seat . . the the . the the , the the . the the	-9.3274
Fortunately , this terrible scene , which was played on 22 July , is just a reproduction .	-3.2710
But when a loop is thrown around the neck of " Roger " , almost everyone in the audience shot very real sighs .	-5.0940
Since 2005 civil rights officers have returned to the Moore 's Ford Bridge to imitate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom , George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were synchronized by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946 . the , , , , or , , , or , , , or . , , , or the the	-11.1465
Nobody has ever been accused of murders .	-2.3643
" It is truly inconceivable that in all these years not a single person has been arrested - although we see them in our communities , although we know who they are , " said Tyrone Brooks , who helps organize the reporting .	-4.9950
'It is a spot of dirt on a history , but it is a burden on our souls . '	-9.8948
Brooks is a 71-year-old former congressman of the State of Georgia and a life of civil rights .	-10.4478
For him , the replica serves as a dramatic call for action and is an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected .	-4.0019
" We want prosecution , we want the end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we need justice , " he said .	-2.9266
'We cannot heal and reconcile until we get justice ' .	-2.5450
A court medical practitioner places a sheet on the corpse one of the victims of the Moore Ford lynch on 27 July 1946 .	-4.5419
According to FBI files received by the NBC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the lynch process .	-3.0355
But no one has ever been charged .	-2.2562
Although the suspects have remained free for decades , civil rights officials say that the double motivation for the lynch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex .	-10.9662
In April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court allowed black citizens in Georgia for the first time to vote in the summer primary campaign .	-3.4496
Approximately at the same time as the election , according to the FBI , the black farmers Roger Malcom spoke down a white landowner , Barnett Hester , during a fight , allegedly because of a woman .	-5.2986
Brooks said that the rumour in the city had been that Hester slept with Malcom 's wife Dorothy and that the baby she carried did not come from her husband .	-2.8096
On July 25 , 1946 , Loy Harrison , a prominent white landowner , paid $ 600 to liberate Malcom from prison , according to the FBI . the the . the the the the . the the the the . the	-7.8916
He was accompanied by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey to prison .	-1.7970
But when they moved away from prison and approached the Moore 's Ford Bridge , a lynchmob surrounded the car .	-2.8527
" As it turns out , it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murders , " concludes a FBI report .	-2.8799
" It is also obvious that there was a plot between state and local prosecution , which was not only involved in the murders , eliminated evidence and covered up the identity of witnesses " .	-3.6855
Brooks put it even more concise .	-2.7272
" It was an electoral massacre , " he said .	-1.5090
'You have all been killed to send a message to black people in this community : ' If you register and if you vote , you will happen here . '	-3.9604
For almost a decade , Cassandra Greene has led the annual record of Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murders .	-3.2195
Their presentation is vivid , seizing , and is based on a kind of deep racism that many want to believe does not exist in America anymore .	-5.6213
It is hard to watch and even more difficult to look away , but Greene said that this is the point .	-3.5241
" We do not want to talk about the lynching , because we are then faced with its ugliness in all of us , " she said .	-3.8913
" But I cannot establish a relationship with you if you do not want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have done " .	-3.8401
The samples for this year 's production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest of the black - entered a space and listened when Greene launched a well-recorded overview of the piece .	-4.4226
Wade Marbaugh is here Greenes co-director .	-2.5203
He has played the role of Chief Clan member for years , but he said that the role never becomes easier .	-3.0479
" I feel dirty because I am not so , " said Marbaugh .	-1.6573
'But I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return to these times ' .	-2.8075
On the other side of the room , the actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona , who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester , tested their lines .	-2.8156
The piece begins with Malcom , who screams and pushes him , angry that he slept with his wife Dorothy .	-3.7502
'I said n --- he , disappear from my property ! '	-2.0555
Rascona returns the fire .	-1.4266
There is a break .	-1.2127
And then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .	-2.5011
Greene laughs the loudest .	-1.2881
" What ? ! " , asked Rascona .	-1.9579
It is alarmed and confused .	-1.0385
Was I too hard ?	-1.0942
" No , " Greene said , still biasing .	-3.5799
'I simply do not believe that white people then said ' n -- he ' .	-3.2205
" But " , one of the other black actors joked .	-2.7277
'You only have to meet the hard ' R. ' .	-2.4656
And that is exactly where the energy shifts in the room , a feeling of comradeship replaces the unease .	-4.9383
Everyone is busy getting this right , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four people killed .	-3.1321
The scene is starting again .	-8.7624
This time , when Rascona says the N word , he says it sharply and forcefully .	-2.7963
Absolutely nobody laughs .	-1.3975
This repetition ends violently and quickly .	-2.3705
There are shouts , shots and then silence .	-1.4417

About a hundred meters behind it , a group of about four dozen spectators wipes out of sight sweat and tears .	-4.4260
The audience is almost uniform between black and white .	-2.0612
A couple is coming from Ithaca , New York , to see the performance , many just come down the street .	-2.5262
They have all experienced moisture for almost eight hours , when Brooks leads them to the tombs of the Malcoms and Dorseys on a pilgrimage .	-18.1559
Up to this point , the murders have remained an anecdote , but now , when you are standing in the same country where the lynch murders took place , the air feels spectacular .	-4.7044
When the last notes of the song end , Greene invites you to come closer and inspect the corpse name .	-2.8815
Children hock to their heads , register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whisper each other .	-3.2672
" They are not really dead , " a young boy murms as if he wanted to remember .	-4.1095
After a few minutes Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it is over .	-2.4695
The actors throw away the lynch rope and wipe their tears .	-3.2437

You did so for one reason . '	-2.0467
Later , the audience meets the actors for dinner .	-3.5759
At a table , a white couple from Atlanta talks about the reproduction with a black couple they have just met .	-4.7601
Denise Duplinski fought to find words that left the performance feeling .	-2.8162
" It is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... from people who look like you and who do that because they look like you , " she said .	-3.4519
'What really does with me makes me believe that the lynch continues ' , she added , ' today it is only called police shooting ' .	-5.5040
In the same room , Tyrone Brooks Hof stops at his table , eats and reminds of civil rights .	-3.3520
He said he had already started planning the performance next year .	-2.2135
" The replication is in a way inspiring , because it describes the horror of what we have endured , but it is also a moment of learning , " he said .	-8.9831
" It is so if we do not learn anything from it , then it can happen again .	-3.9537

Sturmically celebrated are Foster , Milling , Vinke and conductor Janowski , who modestly bows the hands to the Merkel-Raute .	-4.9646
There is great applause for the Festival Orchestra , which is shown on stage for the first time - in the face of the great heat again in leisure clothing .	-5.8411
The performance of Frank Castorf and his director was awaited with excitement .	-3.7661
In 2013 , he had to have a yellow pipe concert surrounded him , and five years later , there was great crowd in which the individual buh calls were subjected .	-9.2774
Chief of the festival Katharina Wagner should have been pleased about this .	-4.3955
" One realizes that the audience has somehow coincided with the " ring " , she said just before the performance of dpa .	-4.8626
The audience not only made a form of peace with Castorf , but also an understanding of its perspective .	-3.8042

The British Education Group Pearson said on Friday that it will reduce another 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividend by 72 % , as another restructuring programme is being launched to overcome the pressure that the company faces .	-4.3975
The job reduction , which Director-General John Fallon mainly announced for the end of 2018 and early 2019 , comes in addition to its previous restructuring , which already lost 4,000 jobs .	-4.5958

On Monday , a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul .	-1.7785
NATO 's opinion states that the explosion had happened on Thursday evening , when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by a ' improvised rate of explosion carried by people ' .	-5.2366
The statement states that all injured persons are in a stable state and are treated in the US military hospital at Bagram Airport .	-3.6071
Correspondents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State ( IS ) in Qarabagh is a great concern for the NATO troops in nearby Bagram .	-9.0132
According to the United Nations , Afghanistan had at least 1,662 civilian deaths in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital .	-2.9368
At the end of July , a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shia district of Kabul .	-1.8333
The Taliban said they had carried out this attack .	-2.1414
On May 31 , a huge bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the country ’ s deadliest militant attack since US leaders displaced the Taliban from power in 2001 .	-3.5239
The violence underscores the precarious security situation in Afghanistan , as US President Donald Trump is weighing up the number of US troops supporting the military and police in the country .	-3.1963
Correspondents say that the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , its policies and , in particular , President Ashraf Ghani 's reputation .	-3.1486
EPA reverses its decision to delay the smog rule by complaint	-3.9450
The US Environmental Protection Agency has lifted a decision to delay Obama ’ s administration ’ s regulation , whereby states are obliged to contain smog-causing emissions , a day after 15 states sued the Agency for the move .	-5.6374
Late on Wednesday , the EPO announced the decision to advance the so-called ' ozone regulations 2015 ' and said that it indicates the Agency 's commitment to cooperate with states .	-5.0134
" We believe in dialogue and in responding to our state partners , " said EPA Chief Scott Pruitt in a statement .	-3.3535
In June , Pruitt announced the EPAs ’ intention to delay ozone regulations - in which pollutant emissions should be measured in part of the country to determine where cuts must be made to meet stricter air quality standards - by one year until October 2018 .	-4.4906
A group of 15 largely democratic states , together with the district of Colombia , submitted complaints on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .	-2.9703
President Donald Trump ’ s administration has tried to reduce a broad range of environmental requirements imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda , which Trump is supposed to stimulate economic growth .	-3.6141
However , the efforts have triggered the setback of the Democrats and Nature Conservation Groups , which are worried about the impact of greater emissions on public health .	-3.9391
The website of the EPA says that inhaling air containing ozone can " reduce the lung function and reinforce the respiratory symptoms " such as asthma .	-3.5638
The Council of Communities wants Community Area	-4.3737
In the end , the decision was clear : with two votes against , the municipal council of Fluorn-Winzeln decided to set up a Community area in the future senior residential complex .	-4.5397
Before the discussion there is an important information : the purchase contract for the still missing plot is signed , reports mayor Bernhard Tjaden .	-4.2796
While it will still take time for the area belonging to the parish to date to be in the municipality ’ s possession , there is no longer a planning obstacle to the project to be stemmed by a private investor .	-6.5451
There is a discussion on a Community area for this .	-3.2362
One of the two investors still on board has offered to meet the community .	-2.8961
On the ground floor it would provide a living area - about 55 square metres - and a neighbouring terrace with a surface area of 70 square metres for a special price . .	-11.3371
The administration and the majority of the municipal council are prepared to provide such a community area not just as a meeting point for the people of senior residence , but open to the municipality .	-6.8037
As an example , the word " Strickcafé " made the round .	-3.3141
The decision , which was decided by the allocation of funds to the current budget last autumn , will be swept away by funding .	-9.4717
The building is located in the rehabilitation area .	-3.2386
The establishment of a Community area , Tjaden reports , would be eligible to support 60 % of 30 % .	-3.5520
The proposal for a decision provides for a signal to the investor that in this respect they do not want to throw a tie between their legs , the conclusion that both saddle - which is similar to the surroundings - and pult roof - which reduces the ceiling height and makes the construction more economical - would be possible .	-9.0515
Unnecessary , Wilfried Sohmer says , is this addition .	-3.2605
If it is helpful , it unanimously happens to the body .	-4.2225
It is not as easy as the Community area .	-3.3211
Daniela 's reputation refers to the many buildings with which we do not make such progress , for which we are now opposed to the common room from the window , saying : ' I am hard to do with it ' .	-7.5427
Yvonne Staiger is absolutely in favour of the Community area - but absolutely against municipal involvement .	-10.3027
It sees a hidden subsidy to already wealthy or even foreign investors .	-3.9798
This is not the case , because the acquisition of the area is not a subsidy , but rather a genuine value marketable in case of doubt , is the counter-speech .	-7.6907
Staiger 's request to split the proposal for a resolution accordingly has three supporters .	-4.2810
In the case of two votes against the original programme , Stefan Haller sums up : ' If we take the decision in this way , we will take a giant step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure ' .	-5.1154

Trainer Carlo Ancelotti must also refrain from David Alaba in duel with the BVB .	-3.8170
The Italian confirmed this on Friday .	-1.7415
Moreover , Manuel Neuer , James , Thiago , Jerome Boateng , Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat are missing .	-2.2009
For the five defeats in the past six test matches , Ancelotti has blamed the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team .	-4.0844
" We know that we are not in the best physical constitution , " said Ancelotti and added : " The most important point is the balance in the team .	-2.5776
It was not good at the end . '	-8.1070
The 58-year-old , however , believes in an increase in performance in the first official duty game of the season .	-10.2403
" Football is also tactic , strategy , personality and motivation .	-1.3593
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .	-1.8293

Hiking in the resin from star to star	-2.1955
In the resin , the first " Star Trail " is to be created nation. the the the the . the the the the the . the the the	-9.2260
This is planned by the Association Sternwarte Sankt Andreasberg .	-2.8162
There is a planetary route in Göttingen - since 2003 .	-2.7833
A " Star Trail " meets the need for information from many resin visitors , it was said .	-10.8581
It combines nature , science , movement and sporting performance .	-2.0889
Members want to set up boards along the planned route and inform about stars and constellations .	-4.3884
In a first phase until 2018 the association plans " well-accessible installations in five to six places " in the upper resin .	-3.8366
St. Andreasberg , Braunlage , Hohegeiss and Sieber would be called into question .	-3.4928
The information on the boards should be supplemented via the Internet .	-3.0491
Therefore a good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of locations .	-4.2949
Accessibility is also a criterion .	-1.1849
Later , the star trail will be extended by train .	-4.1991
" On the star path , the viewers learn a lot about the physics of each star " , explained the association .	-4.8927
Moreover , they learned why stars have different colors or why a star shines more than another , even though it is far further away .	-4.4290
It also provides information on the constellation of a selected star and when it is best to see it .	-5.6311
Since 2014 , the association has been operating the highest star warehouse in northern Germany in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg .	-4.2629
According to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany .	-3.2419
From there , the Milky Way and even the Andromeda galaxy are often clearly visible .	-4.0514
Since 2003 , the University of Göttingen has had something similar to the planetary path planned for the University of Göttingen .	-5.9299
Starting in front of Gebhards Hotel in the Goetheallee , which forms the interior of our solar system , the Planetenweg with its steles leads up to the Hainberg and to the Sternwarte - as well as an " alien " location in Diemarden ( municipality of equals ) with the planet Sedna .	-5.8890
The steles with the planets - including the Pluto degraded to the Dwarf Planet at the end point - are precisely situated at the distance and scale of one to two billion .	-5.4143
The Earth thus shrinks to a sphere of 6.5 millimeters in diameter , while the exactly 75 metres away sun measures 70 centimetres .	-11.0037
The entire distance of the planetary route is about four kilometres .	-3.3349
While the light from sun to pluto takes about eight hours , pedestrians need a good hour to stele with Pluto .	-3.0864
So pedestrians are faster than the light in space .	-2.4949
But the march to the next fixed star would last for six months .	-3.2635
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time , discuss a possible showdown .	-1.6049
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia , who should be in a collision course to stage the most exciting box fight in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .	-3.1009
They were in separate rooms in ESPN offices in Los Angeles , until Garcia , the unbeaten World Boxing Council lightweight champion , went down to welcome Lomachenko , the World Boxing Organization Super-Federweight Champion .	-3.6682
After Garcia ’ s victory by unanimous decision on the former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday , both fighters are members of the top five pound-for pound list .	-3.8007
Garcia stretched the right hand and said : " How do you , Champion ?	-2.9015
I wish you good luck . '	-1.3831
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday evening at 7 p.m. on ESPN .	-1.9089
When the couple positioned for photos , Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas noticed that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the " perfect magnitude " .	-3.1262
" I am a former spring weight " , reminded Garcia .	-2.2639
" I have risen for broner [ to 140 pounds ] , but I am not so big .	-3.3809
I am small for 140 .	-1.0140
I would like to lower weight .	-3.7241
And he must move on lightweight [ 135 pounds ] and then we fight .	-1.9026
That is what fans demand .	-2.7687
Let us give them that . '	-1.5926
Lomachenko agreed .	-0.8212
'Boxes need this fight . '	-2.4757
Klimas asked if it should be on pay-per-view , part of a strategy that Lomachenko has to fight with a 135-pound debut this year to agree a date next summer with Garcia ( 37-0 , 30 Knockouts ) which also has an interest in fighting the winner of Jorge Linares Luke Campbell for their lightweight title battle in the forum on September 23 .	-5.1692
" This battle could take place in pay-per-view mode because all fans asked for it , " said Garcia and later expressed openly to fight with the network that offers the best financial package .	-3.8692
We are the best .	-0.6307
No other name can generate this type of attention .	-1.5951
Whenever they are ready ... '	-1.2560
Garcia said he appreciated Lomachenko as " a huge fighter , " and he may be participating in his Saturday struggle .	-3.9568
But Lomachenko stopped at the generous praise for Garcia and said that he think the tri-combat champion from Riverside look " very slow , sorry Mikey ... you wanted the co-out " .	-3.9750
Garcia said that the focus is to show stroke , then boxes .	-2.9633
Both said they could feel the momentum that built up for their own struggle .	-2.7884
" This is the struggle that must be carried out .	-6.4179
No other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .	-8.6437
I am more than happy to work on this , " said Garcia .	-1.5785
Lomachenko said : " I waited for the top fighters , and that is Mikey .	-2.1851
It will be a great battle . '	-1.7647
Four Injured After Tyre Places	-2.4698
In the event of an accident on the A7 , on Thursday afternoon four people were partly seriously injured .	-3.3999
According to initial information , the driver of an Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle at 4.30 p.m. just before the connection point Market Width probably after a tire place .	-6.1653
The car swept to the right , where it swept over and then stayed on the roof in the green strip .	-6.3257
The four occupants - two adults and two children - were partly seriously injured in the accident .	-2.9104
During the initial supply of the injured by the rescue service , the A7 was closed to the north for about an hour , and the traffic could then be passed by the left track at the accident point .	-11.4230
Fortunas Hoffmann : ' Triple Chain works better '	-1.9733
After 2 : 2 , Andre Hoffmann hopes to start the season against Braunschweig that optimizing the defensive formation will bring points to the eye .	-11.3879
Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the first season game , and the result would not have been the two opposite games at the 2 : 2 against Braunschweig. the the the . the the the the the . the the the the	-13.5538
" These were two opposites too much , and we need to be even more careful in the eye , " says Fortuna Düsseldorf 's defensive player .	-4.7310
In the Orzgebirge , the tripartite chain is also to be optimized further .	-10.5154
And a gate after a free fall , the fortunes no longer want to catch up .	-5.3955
'For the future , it will be the case that no one will be on the line alongside Michael ( Rensing ) . '	-5.1983
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will do better than with the four-chain , even after the experience in preparing the triple chain .	-5.5874
" I still do not know how we will act in the eye , " says his coach Friedhelm Funkel , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , " because we have players in the triple chain in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gie<unk>elmann who can build well , " said Hoffmann .	-5.3470
'It is a prerequisite , but that we harmonise even better and that we do not afford so many playback errors in the construction . '	-5.7179
Of course , Hoffmann also drives to the eye to win the game .	-3.4718
" But if you can speak of a failed start after a draw , you don 't know .	-4.1644
The performance could well be okay , " said Hoffmann .	-3.1611
'If , however , we have four points on Sunday and can concentrate on the trophy , we will certainly be able to talk about a proper start to the season ' . the . the . the . the . the . the	-12.0192
His trainer did not want to know anything about this .	-8.4464
" I judge the start of the season only after six to eight days , " said Friedhelm Funkel , who does not want to speak of an advantage over the eye , just because the game of the Saxons in Heidenheim had to be broken prematurely because of a storm .	-5.5987
" Now they can start the season with a home game , " said Funkel and Hoffmann believes that players from the eye might even be a little fresher , because they don 't have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against a rise favorite in the bones .	-6.1218
" But they don 't know where they are , " says Fortuna 's interior defender .	-3.9187
Although the guests from the Rhineland go as a lighter favorite on Sunday to meet at the final ( almost ) finished stadium of Aue .	-5.1589
" Funkel sweeps them away simply because we are entitled to come under the first six is nonsense , " says Funkel , whose balance sheet is very positive in only one defeat against eye from nine games .	-5.4012
" There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga to be beaten from the start " , explains Fortunas Chiefcoach .	-4.1701
" To make such a statement would be arrogant and overwhelming " .	-3.2147
And so Funkel doesn 't want to experience his players on Sunday .	-3.7531
New results of the Swedish asylum age assessment tests published	-2.9671
The recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , subjected to a new method of medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 % of tested people are older than 18 years , but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .	-4.1178
The Swedish Forensic Medicine Authority ( Rättsmedicinalverket ) has begun to carry out the tests last year .	-3.8777
During the asylum procedure , they should make the assessment of age more accurate , after the Swedish Migration Authority ( Migration Calculation ) was criticised for mistakes in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were underage .	-5.2203
To date , Migration Verket 6,880 has sent cases to be tested and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31 July 2017 .	-3.9800
Eighty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was " possibly 18 years or older " .	-2.9554
In 432 cases , the conclusion was that the person ' may be under 18 years old ' .	-2.6839
The tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .	-2.5815
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency , the results are constant in recent months .	-2.4265
" We see no great difference in the statistics of recent months , the figures are quite constant , " he said the magazine The Local .	-3.3253
The high proportion of cases in which the person was assessed as over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has lied above his age .	-8.7974
In May , the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases that ' suggest that the person investigated was 18 years or older ' .	-3.2381
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 results published , she found that in 243 of these cases , the person honestly said that she was 18 years old this year .	-4.1149
The method of medical age assessment , in which x-ray images of wisdom teeth and MRT images are taken from knee joints , which are then analysed by dentists and radiologists , has also been criticised in some areas .	-4.5836
A skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute , whose work includes the assessment of human biological maturity to see whether they sooner or later went through puberty as usual .	-3.5180
" I had reason to think about it , and I do not believe that the type of measurement should be used .	-8.5604
Judging biological age in this way is very uncertain .	-2.5014
If we cannot say it safely , we should not pretend that we could , " he said to the Metro newspaper .	-3.9116
Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of the tests : " In general , you can say that the risk of a child being inaccurately assessed as an adul. the the the the .	-10.0465
The greatest risk lies in the fact that the person is less than 18 , in this case it is approximately 10 % . ' .	-10.1841

Work on the three bridges of the Landstra<unk>e 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is making good progress .	-8.8328
On Wednesday , a seven tonnes of concrete was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach .	-2.6348
" We are very well in time , it is running super " , says Reinhold Leicht , construction manager at the Department of Road Traffic and Transport at the Government Bureau of Freiburg .	-5.2077
In April , the work began at the same time on all three needy bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach .	-3.2188
Building is scheduled for October and it is easy to keep to the timetable .	-3.7900
The first bridge , coming from Schramberg , passes through the Trombach .	-2.6665
It is a concrete vaulted arc bridge , covered with red sandstone and has a total length of 4.80 meters .	-4.0802
It was built in 1900 .	-1.0624
Like the other two bridges , it has come into the years .	-3.3451
To ensure stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly rehabilitated .	-3.7482
The other two bridges pass the Lauterbach .	-2.1956
They are made of red sandstone .	-1.9805
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10.60 meters long .	-9.4247
The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach has now received a bridge cap of 1.30 metres wide and seven tonnes on Wednesday morning on the north side .	-4.1111
This is a marginal attachment which is also used as a mode of operation .	-4.1929
On the southern part of the bridge a 2.20 metre wide bridge cap is to be used on Friday .	-3.3851
That is what the pedestrian route is supposed to be .	-4.4335
The most important thing is that these are finished parts , a patent of the Schramberg company Dizvo .	-4.3003
The other two bridges are already patented bridge caps .	-2.0883
The laying of lines through the building in Lauterbach requires special sensitivity .	-4.3504
There is also a glass fibre cable , to which many companies are connected .	-4.0681
The residents were informed about the project in the run-up to the work by hand papers .	-4.0647
Furthermore , fish and cancer had to be caught first .	-2.8481
For the bridges between the Bauhofgebäude and the Sammelweiher in the direction of Schramberg , traffic is regulated by a traffic light .	-5.3069
For the construction work on the bridge at the entrance to Lauterbach , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels " Tannenhof " and " Sieben Linden " is closed .	-4.4810
The cost of the three bridge renewals is EUR 700 000 .	-3.4260
The whole thing is financed by the country .	-2.1261
AfD in Gerolstein : Bunter Protest at German potato salad	-2.1072
It does not happen so often that parties pull together , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( AfD ) , what else is hard to reconcile .	-4.1923
The parties represented in the Kreistag Vulkaneifel ( CDU , SPD , Greens , FDP , FWG , Left ) belong to a broad alliance that this day peacefully shows flag because the AfD invites the Gerolstein Stadthalle Rondell to the " great campaign " , according to the the poster .	-6.2315
And well-known names will be launched - like Alice Weidel , who , together with Alexander Gauland , is the top duo for the federal election on 24 September , and Deputy Chairman Beatrix von Storch .	-4.9736
But those who are already on the ground hours before the event begins do not want to listen to the AfD-lers , but to demonstrate .	-4.4309
The motto " The Eifel remains colourful " .	-1.9772
Originally the city picnic was planned under the motto " Everyone at a table " on the fountain , but now takes place on the car park below the round - right in front of the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the city hall .	-6.1586
A colourful picture that can be found here .	-10.1806
And what Christa Karoli , chairman of the Ein Welt Forum and one of the relevant organizers , is really pleased : " How many people have met here " .	-4.4086
There is music and a lot of food , including a " Urdeutscher potato salad , which the AfD could eat without problems , " says the woman who brought him with him .	-4.5535
The police have ordered many officials to Gerolstein , showing their presence at the train station , which is only a few metres away from the venues .	-4.7069
How did the AfD actually come to Gerolstein ?	-2.4987
Mario Hompes of the AfD Volcanic Eifel reported that he tried to get such an event and received the surcharge .	-5.1977
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had initially requested Daun but got a cancellation there because of the already built Laurentiuskirmes there were not enough parking spaces .	-6.1742
So now the torch , Hompes is pleased that " we can have such a beautiful event here " .	-16.8245
With a view to the event at the toboggan square , he says : ' This is the good right of people , the main thing , it remains peaceful ' .	-4.8520
This is also true : at 8 p.m. the toboggan square provides a band for entertainment , in the city hall various speakers , including the Rhineland-Palatinate AfD chairman Uwe Junge .	-6.0684
There are about 200 listeners waiting for the top candidate for the federal election , Alice Weidel , and Deputy Chairman Beatrix von Storch to speak .	-4.3962
The police presence is unchanged , but so far the officials had a quiet evening .	-2.8011
The AfD event takes a little more than an hour , the guests on the pre-square have a longer breath , but there is also a short break after 9 pm .	-16.0719
The police can move away - no special events .	-2.8156

Coe praises " honest " Russian excuse for doping scandal	-1.4499
The global leader of athletics , Sebastian Coe , praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia for a doping scandal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be re-entered into sport .	-4.3762
Russia ’ s athletic chief Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Championships that his country ’ s exile from sport was correct and that he was determined to fight do.	-3.8750
He said he was sorry for ' all athletes who were snapped away in competitions of gold and silver medals ' .	-3.7218
Despite his comments , the IAAF Congress voted in favour of maintaining the ban imposed in November 2015 , after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) found references to state-sponsored doping in Russia .	-3.0000
" I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , " said IAAF President Coe the reporters .	-2.1191
'The entire Council and Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized itself that it has experienced some rather hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is redesigned . '	-4.5429
Coe said that he was also ' pleased ' that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction .	-2.9063
" I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been made , but Congress supports the recommendations of the task force that this is not the moment to restore Russia , " said Coe .	-3.1845
" We must do everything in the coming months to normalize this situation .	-2.9095
The guiding principle has always been that we wanted to separate clean athletes from the spoiled system , " he added .	-2.8419

Sadly for soldiers crashed in Mali	-2.4227
During a mourning ceremony in the North Hessen Fritzlar , around 1000 people thought of the two soldiers killed during a helicopter crash in Mali .	-4.6430
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the Domstadt under high safety precautions .	-2.9952
Secretary of Defense Ursula of the Leyen ( CDU ) said nothing about the still unresolved crash cause .	-3.6744
She described the two pilots killed , however , as the ' expert of her profession ' .	-5.3973
" We bow to this highest sacrifice they have made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany , " she explained .	-4.2863
The 33-year-old Major and the 47-year-old Head of Staff from North Hessen died a week ago in West African Mali .	-3.9763
Their coffins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a death guard of the German Armed Forces in the Fritzlar Dom Sankt Peter .	-4.4251
At noon only the relatives in the church took leave .	-4.8329
After that the mourning ceremony began in the family circle , closest friends , representatives of the Bundeswehr and politics .	-4.3563
Among them were Hessen ’ s Prime Minister Volker Bouffier ( CDU ) and the general spectator of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker .	-2.9992
Sad guests settled roses , the relatives stood arm in arm with the coffins .	-4.9508
In front of the church , Fritzlarer and numerous soldiers pursued the ceremony on a screen .	-2.9420
Secretary of Defense of the Leyen described the killed soldiers as " highly decorated " and operational experience .	-3.9722
The Stabshauptmann had established the flight operation of the Tiger fighter helicopter in Fritzlar and was one of the first six trained tiger pilots of his regiment .	-5.6620
Volker Bauersach , commander of the regiment to which the soldiers belong , also declared : " If this crew could not avert the crash , no one could have done it " .	-5.0209
Doubts about the UN mission in Mali did not show Minister of the Leyen : the deployment is dangerous .	-3.4243
But it is also of great importance ' for a country from which we are only separated by two states ' , she said .	-3.5334
After the mourning ceremony the coffins were brought out of the cathedral .	-3.3023
When and where they are buried , the Bundeswehr gave no information about this .	-4.1250
Prince Henrik does not want a grave next to his wife .	-2.3000
The man of the Danish Queen Margreth ( 77 ) , Prince Henrik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death .	-10.5473
This was announced by the Königshaus on Thursday .	-2.2653
Traditionally , the Danish royal pair is attached to the Cathedral Church of Roskilde .	-3.5966
The sculptor Bj<unk>rn N<unk>rgaard made a sarcophagus for the two .	-2.1606
The Queen agreed with the decision of her husband , it was said in the communication .	-3.7675
Where Prince Henrik is buried , it is still unclear .	-2.3318
But he does not intend to be attached to his French homeland .	-3.8792
Prince Henrik had never made a hide from the fact that he was not happy with his title .	-3.1742
After the throne ascent of his wife Margreth in 1972 , he would have liked to become king .	-8.5034
In 2016 , he went to retirement , with the title " Prince Mistress " .	-5.5816
Since Henrik did not get the title and function he wanted in Denmark , he did not see himself as equal to his wife - even after death , Lene Balleby , the chief spokesman of the Danish King 's House .	-5.0544
Where the last resting place of the 83 year old will ultimately be , it is still unclear .	-9.5108
But he does not intend to be attached to his French homeland , but to Denmark .	-4.0100
He likes the country for which he has worked over the last 50 years .	-2.1895
The born Henri de Laborde de Monpezat , son of a French nobility , had met Margreth in London in 1965 .	-3.6327
He worked on the Thames in the French Embassy .	-1.8770
During his later wife , Prince Henrik had a heavy state of affairs in the Danes in his rule of nearly 50 years .	-6.2686
In an autobiography , Henrik said over the first years in Denmark : " A few months after my arrival , everything I did was criticized .	-3.5624
My Danish was fluctuating , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk stockings instead of knitting socks , citro<unk>n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .	-2.6991

Prime Minister Weil wants rapid re-election	-2.5268
CDU and FDP before possible majority in Lower Saxony	-1.7964
Lower Saxony ’ s Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) is in favour of a rapid re-election of the country after the loss of the red-green majority , but he does not want to resign .	-4.0212
Because , on Friday , it advocated the dissolution of Parliament .	-3.4057
Previously , the surprising leaving of a Green MEP from her country 's group in Lower Saxony had plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) into a severe crisis .	-4.3315
Five months before the official election date , the red-green coalition in Hanover lost its narrow one-vote majority in Parliament to the opposition from the CDU and the FDP .	-3.5351
Previous Green MEP Elke Twesten justified her step with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg ( Wümme ) .	-4.2773
" I see my political future in the CDU , " she explained in Hanover on Friday .	-2.2362
CDU leader Björn Thümler wishes to recommend to his group that it be included .	-3.1214
With this , CDU and FDP together have 69 seats in Lower Saxony ’ s Landtag , SPD , and Green 68 seats .	-4.5603
So far , the relationship has been the other way around .	-2.6007
The new country day will be elected on 14 January next year .	-2.9941
Thümler said that the red-green government must now decide whether it can continue to govern without a majority in this situation .	-3.2145
However , Stephan Weil considers it essential that the country 's day be decided as quickly as possible .	-11.6150
The CDU Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .	-2.5115
The country 's constitution also provides for the possibility that the country 's day will withdraw the Prime Minister 's confidence and elect a successor .	-10.7262
" Our constitution offers several options .	-1.3374
These opportunities must be examined in a clean legal way , " said Thümler .	-4.1798
'You will discuss all the questions quietly when they are legally reasonable . '	-5.7017
Thümler called Twesten step " something curious " .	-2.3924
The politician himself stressed : " I am not a traitor .	-2.0070
I feel very good ' .	-1.4425
She was the supporter of Schwarz-Green .	-3.4025
The Greens asked the dissenting MEPs to return their country 's mandate .	-3.7988
" We assume , of course , that she will return her country 's mandate , which she has received through the green country list , with immediate effect , " said Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner .	-5.0079
The chairman of the Green Anja Piel group said : ' We regret the decision of Elke Twesten extremely ' .	-3.5277
You have deliberately decided not to hold a debate in the group .	-2.8596
'Nor can we understand this step , given that there were no differences in substance ' .	-4.4984
SPD Chancellor Martin Schulz condemns the transfer of Lower Saxon Green MEP Elke Twesten to the CDU as a betrayal .	-3.3077
" The behaviour of former Green MEPs in Lower Saxony is not only betrayal of the electorate , but also betrayal of the Red-Green , " wrote the Federal Head of Social Democrats on Facebook on Friday .	-4.5563
He supports Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) ’ s decision to re-elect the country ’ s day quickly .	-2.8634
The exit of Twesten costs the majority of red green in Lower Saxony .	-4.1553
The politician puts " in her injured vanity and frustration her personal interests before the well-being of the country " , criticized SPD Secretary-General Hubertus Heil .	-3.7399
" It is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony is participating in this dirty intrigue game and is trying to capitalize on it " .	-3.8854
Lower Saxony ’ s CDU leader , Björn Thümler , wishes to recommend to his MEPs that Elke Twesten be included in the CDU .	-3.5472
The leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Oppermann , accused Twesten of distorting the outcome of the 2013 election with personal career thinking .	-4.5145
The CDU was then the strongest force before the SPD , but the SPD and Greens had a very thin majority of one vote in the country 's day .	-5.1084
Agriculture Minister in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from toxic eggs , Mr Schmidt ?	-3.1584
Germany discusses contaminated eggs .	-7.9247
How could the scandal happen ?	-1.3248
How can consumers protect themselves ?	-1.2047
Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt ( CSU ) is interviewed with the editorial network Germany ( RND ) .	-2.8107
Mr Schmidt , how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs ?	-1.2256
I can only encourage all consumers to look closely at the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp print .	-3.0187
On the Consumer Protection Portal www.Flughaften Warnung.de , the federal states provide the latest information on the egg charges concerned .	-6.6139
Such eggs should be destroyed or returned .	-2.2457
Even if , after everything we know at the moment , a health threat is virtually excluded .	-3.7877
Does Aldi now take the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of supply - because the Federal Agriculture Minister does not really play the central role of the enlightener ?	-5.1208
Food monitoring is the responsibility of the federal states .	-2.7096
Nevertheless , my house has immediately started and has been in close exchange with the authorities of the countries since it became known to Germany 's concern .	-6.7052
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers .	-1.9255
Trade , like manufacturers , must ensure that the products sold are trafficable and safe to health .	-4.6103
If the maximum residue content of 0.005mg / kg is exceeded in eggs , they are not traffic capable .	-4.3447
However , unloaded eggs can be sold and consumed .	-2.8855
This time , farms are not to blame .	-2.1236
Are production companies and consumers on the same boat ?	-2.3714
According to current knowledge , production factories are not directly responsible .	-4.7593
Instead , they must expect economic damage due to allegedly illegal practices of service companies .	-3.9348
As always , there are too few controllers in the event of seriousness .	-3.4160
Is there only a lack of personnel or coherent competence ?	-4.0544
It was precisely the official controls that revealed the process .	-3.1160
The truth , however , is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded 100 % .	-2.6100
It is precisely for this reason that a consistent clarification of such events and the transfer to public prosecutors in cases where crimes can occur is crucial .	-5.9974
I have already made it clear on several occasions that I expect the responsible authorities to provide a complete information .	-4.6938
Is the regular alarm of food scandals really necessary ?	-2.7253
Consumers have the right to receive only safe and transport food .	-3.1461
If an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly outraged .	-2.4698
Thanks to the fixed means , manufacturers , traders and consumers have come into a situation that is absolutely unnecessary .	-5.8189
In principle , it must be clear that the illegal use of the Fipronil insecticide in the attitude of food suppliers is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately .	-4.7613
This needs to be worked consistently and with high pressure at all levels .	-10.2165
I expect all the competent authorities to clarify the situation quickly and completely .	-3.6080
How the financial rules of football affect Neymar ’ s move to Paris	-2.0871
The rules aimed at preventing unhindered spending by European football clubs will not disturb Neymar ’ s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to French Paris-Saint Germain .	-3.3075
Any consequences will come for Paris Saint-Germain of UEFA , because the leading organization that monitors the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .	-4.2413
Financial fair play rules launched by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG must eventually prove that the transfer of Neymar was financed without major losses .	-3.3707
Barcelona has paid EUR 222 million ( $ 262 million ) to buy the Brazilian out of his treaty , and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several million dollars a year .	-9.5183
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar 's move to France .	-1.5856
PSG can certainly make the money loose so that Neymar signs and brings it into a galaxy of other stars , given the funding of the team by the Katar family of rulers rich in energy .	-5.8895
Clubs may spend a lot of money on purchasing players , but must counteract legitimate revenue sources that allow them to break even-point in their football business .	-5.9955
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA president in 2007 .	-2.3822
The former French player believed that clubs that had borne huge debt in their quest for success effectively cheated and risked ruining when banks or owners withdrew their support .	-3.9625
In 2011 , FFP shifted from focusing on club debt to monitoring its losses .	-1.9543
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a tougher matter .	-3.4240
During the current three-year FFP investment period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million .	-3.6741
And , while Platini has fallen into disgrace by the presidency in 2015 , his UEFA successor , Aleksander Ceferin , continues to commit himself to discouraging excessive spending .	-4.0853
" Certainly , FFP is not dead and we will definitely reinforce the rules for the future , " said Andrea Traverso , who is responsible for FFP at UEFA , against The Associated Press last week .	-9.6882
Although the PSG has paid the Neymar buy-out clause in a flat rate , it can distribute the amount for the invoice over the duration of its contract .	-10.9209
Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the replacement amount for the next five years of EUR 44.4 million can be expelled in the annual accounts .	-3.9888
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 hit the PSG , together with Abu Dhabi , owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions .	-2.7437
The PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million ( then $ 82 million ) , which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and it was ordered that team members for the 2014 / 15 Champions League remain limited to 21 players instead of the normal 25 players .	-4.7077
UEFA is looking for clubs that could attempt to outrage their financial supervision by inflating their revenues by companies associated with the owners of a club .	-4.8488
While a catarian company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsoring exceeded standard market rates , UEFA would not make this a legitimate income .	-3.6350
That was precisely what happened in 2014 , when UEFA decided that the value of PSA sponsorship was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .	-10.6390
It has been reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come about payments from the World Cup 2022 organizing committee in Qatar .	-3.7248
But the PSG and Qatar in 2022 have denied that Neymar will become World Cup ambassadors , and such a manoeuvre could be easy to figure out for UEFA regulators .	-3.9724
Previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to bypass the rules .	-2.6564
UEFA had no preparatory discussions with PSG on Neymar 's transfer , said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .	-3.0860
They spoke with The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity , because they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation .	-3.5242
The latest published reports show that PSG achieved a profit of more than EUR 10 million in 2015 / 16 with sales of EUR 542.4 million .	-3.5620
The accounts for the last fiscal year still have to be published .	-2.2049
PSG expects Neymar ’ s arrival to be a blessing for sponsoring deals , merchandising , and tricote sales .	-2.6981
The association assumes that after signing , sales will increase by at least 30 percent .	-3.0143
The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players going , and it tried to prevent Neymar ’ s move by claiming that PSG would infringe the FFP .	-7.8758
" It is a clear case of " financial doping " with the club and the state , " said the President of the La Liga , Javier Tebas , the Spanish daily AS regarding Qatar 's ultimate ownership of PSG .	-3.0811
Arsenal Manager Arsene Wenger , whose association is owned by an American sports tycoon , shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that finances an association .	-3.7063
" It is the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football over the last 15 years , " Wenger said on Thursday .	-3.0257
" Once a country has a club , everything is possible .	-2.1558
It is becoming very difficult to respect the financial fair play , because you can go different ways or have different interests when a country has such a large player to represent a country . '	-13.3880
Swiss is looking for a new Schoggi supplier .	-2.4468
Over the past few years Chocolat Frey has produced chocolate for the Swiss . .	-11.4850
Now the sweet cooperation is facing a possible end : the airline rewrites the order .	-4.1938
Swiss-Speaker Meike Fuhlrott confirmed on request from the news agency sda a corresponding report of the newspaper " Northwest Switzerland " from Friday .	-3.5660
According to current planning , the airline will sign a new contract in the first half of 2018 .	-2.1302
The products would be reviewed every two to three years and subjected to quality control . . the the . the the the . the the the the the .	-9.4981

The Swiss did not want to provide information about the costs .	-3.4794
Industry insiders estimate the volume of orders according to " Northwest Switzerland " to 1.5 to 2 million francs - the Migros subsidiary generates annual sales of around one billion francs .	-4.4163
But , more importantly , the advertising effect is once and for all : it is a prestigious order for a Schoggi manufacturer .	-4.0337
Swiss does not want to betray how many applicants there are in the new tender .	-4.3369
However , only Swiss manufacturers are in question .	-8.8534
According to the newspaper report , Chocolat Frey intends to seek to renew the Treaty beyond the spring of 2018 .	-7.9674
For sda , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion .	-2.8556
Swiss has been distributing chocolate boards on board its flights since 2006 .	-3.1634
Before the Swiss signed a contract with the Migros daughter , Barry Callebaut had supplied the chocolate tablets in cooperation with Hug .	-2.7921
The possibility of placing the logo was introduced two and a half years ago by launching the cooperation with Chocolat Frey .	-3.6611
The airline collaborates with different Swiss chocolate producers .	-11.7248
On long-haul flights , First Class customers are pampered with delicacies by the Sprüngli Confiserie , in the Business Class naked passengers Schoggi von Lindt and in the Economy Class Schoggi of Chocolat Frey .	-4.6179

Nostalgia goes to the niche in " Wet Hot American Summer " and " Comrade Detective " .	-2.2670
This repetition of history is nostalgic simultaneously because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80s , for the 90-year grunge era ( when the previous thinkers David Wain and Michael Showalter turned the Sketch comedy " The State " for MTV ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , such as Elizabeth Banks , Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd , went larger .	-4.7944
As a cultural artifact , it is equally a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook-capable era of permanent memories .	-2.6502
But as a franchise it feels like time is short .	-2.0442
" First Day of Camp " worked surprisingly well , not only because of its absurd humor ( it contained an original story for a speaking cans of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .	-3.1759
By stiffening up at the heart of the gag - middle-age actors play horny children who will grow up - they nevertheless created the impossibility of regaining the last part of the joke .	-5.1391
" Ten Years Later " , with its adults now playing adults , is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more according to the casting principle , including a reef on the Stalker movies of the 90s like " The Hand That Rocks the Cradle " ( " The hand that swings the cradle " ) .	-4.5243
At one point , a character browses through an Apple Powerbook , some inline skates and " a number of other things from 1991 " .	-3.5405
Many of the central stories are the same .	-1.1246
The lovely coop ( Mr. Showalter ) , now Romanauthor , has still not forgotten Katie ( Marguerite Moreau ) .	-3.1434
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost his virginity .	-1.7673
And there is another crazy and malicious plot involved in Ronald Reagan ( also Mr. Showalter ) , now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good impression of Michael Ian Black ) .	-3.9945
As always , the excursions are the best part of the franchise .	-1.6542
It is particularly fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rudd , who shows Matt Dillon 's underlip beard of " Singles " , whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old cracker .	-12.2299
It is the moments of random madness that could fuel this franchise like a kind of repetitive " Seven Up ! " series until he achieves what I accept as his logical conclusion : " Wet Hot American Summer : Twenty Years Later " , whose last scene will show the band how she will visit the film premiere of " Wet Hot American Summer " .	-9.5931
" Comrade Detective " on Amazon is now reminiscent of another type of nostalgia : the revival of the Cold War of " The Americans " , the movie " Atomic Blonde " and even " GLOW " with its east-west ring iconography .	-3.6691
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as as director indicates to be a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two policemen as friends , two officers from Bucharest fighting for truth , atheism and the path of Marxism Leninism .	-3.6777

But " Comrade Detective " is so committed to the truth of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer who wears a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like a single one .	-3.3823
In six long episodes , the comedy is not fast or often enough .	-3.8632
" Comrade Detective " , which has been edited to a lower length , could better deliver his agitprop satire , as Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the American Embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who swallow a pile of Hamburg .	-5.5055

Beat Drug Mafia in the Country	-3.3089
The police succeeded in blowing the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg .	-2.5402
On Wednesday morning in the Black Forest Baar district , in Rottweil , Konstanz , Esslingen and Stuttgart , numerous objects were searched , as the prosecutor Konstanz announced on Friday .	-9.1476
Fifteen accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 and were already issuing arrest warrants against them .	-4.6227
In addition , officials secured larger amounts of marijuana and cocaine , firearms and several hundred thousand euros .	-3.1461
Two people were arrested at simultaneous raids in Italy .	-2.4729
There were German arrest warrants against the two suspects of Italy .	-2.4071
The two are therefore probably delivered to Germany .	-3.2839
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action .	-2.1148
Overall , more than 300 police officers were in operation .	-2.7715
Mafia members are accused of organised drug crime , serious acts of violence , attempted murder , robbery and blackmail .	-3.0416
Since summer 2016 , the Public Prosecutor Konstanz has been investigating the organised drug trafficking in southern Germany .	-4.2702
Between the public prosecutors in Konstanz and Palermo there was an active exchange and the investigators of the Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .	-4.6614
Therefore , the major mission on Wednesday morning was accompanied by four officials from Palermo .	-3.4548
The investigations focused mainly on Italian nationals with close relation to the Italian mafia .	-3.9383
Also an incident on May 27 in Hüfingen , where several shots were fired in a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the band 's account .	-4.5491
In this way , large gaps in the foreigner register complain about	-4.5148
" Citizens ' data that should not appear there " : according to a report , the foreigners ' register in Germany shows significant shortcomings .	-11.0262
This leads to some serious mistakes in asylum procedures .	-3.1522
According to a media report , the Federal Government 's Refugee Management Supervisor , Frank-Jürgen Weise , has drawn attention to major gaps in the Foreign Central Register .	-3.9574
Defects in the data registered there could lead to ' serious mistake decisions ' in asylum procedures and expulsions ' , warned in an analysis provided by the ' Süddeutsche Zeitung ' .	-5.3872
According to the register , ten million people are covered by foreign nationality , including about 5.7 million from non-EU countries .	-4.0280
The data is therefore managed by approximately 600 foreign authorities in Germany .	-3.1527
Because the data has not been adequately maintained , the data quality in parts has not been good .	-3.8548
In individual cases , data from 1921 had been found , " by people who have long since died , or by citizens who have become German citizens and who should not actually appear in the register " .	-5.0916
" Faulty data input can significantly slow down return processes , " said the report .	-4.3063
Furthermore , statistics on people who are subject to departure include EU citizens who do not have to leave .	-5.5020
Such false allocations , however , led ' to a distorted debate on the handling of persons who are obliged to leave ' , it is therefore stated in the analysis .	-6.2841
Meanwhile , it seems that the Federal Government has begun to send refugee families with children under 16 years old back to Italy when they enter .	-4.5038
This is evident from an internal paper by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees ( BAMF ) , reported by the " Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung " .	-3.5288
The paper therefore states that the BAMF has been carrying out such procedures ' concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and micro-children - to Italy since 1 June 2017 ' .	-4.8417
This has been virtually impossible since the end of 2014 , the newspaper referring to the difficult situation on the ground .	-3.5493
Under the Dublin Agreement , refugees are responsible for the EU State they first reach .	-2.9531
If a migrant travels to another EU country , that state can send him back to the country of entry .	-3.1880
On the grounds , the Office now writes : " Meanwhile , the absorption capacity for families with underage children in Italy has increased considerably " .	-11.2842
Italy has given guarantees for the accommodation and accommodation of families .	-2.3421
Even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECHR ) considers these commitments to be sufficient .	-1.9253
Other EU states would also send refugees back there under the Dublin Agreement .	-2.5566
The internal political spokesperson of the Left Group in the Bundestag , Ulla Jelpke , criticized this decision : " Families with children are threatened by the shortcomings in the Italian asylum system of absorption conditions and a threat to child welfare " .	-5.2431
Second Best Result	-2.1502
A total of 220 litres of blood from people living in Oberreichenbach already provided blood donation service to other people .	-3.5395
At least of the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .	-9.3554
Jürgen Greule , who , with his 100 donations , has now split 50 litres of blood .	-4.1137
Traditionally , the municipality honors the multiple willingness to donate blood at the meeting of the municipal council .	-3.9583
" It is brilliant how our body is designed to do this , and we pay respect to donors who provide their blood for strangers , and to do so unselfishly , " emphasized mayor Karlheinz Kistner .	-6.6839
" One single donation of blood helps several people " , explained the circle leader of the German Red Cross ( DRK ) , Holger Maisenbacher , because the canned are destroyed into their components .	-5.0202
Three people could already benefit from a donation of blood .	-11.4429
At the same time , Maisenbacher reported about the actions that will take place in Oberreichenbach in the spring .	-3.5050
" This year we achieved the second best result with 114 donors , " said the DRK circle leader .	-3.5243
Obviously , the change to the theatre house a few years ago led to higher numbers of participants .	-4.0670
Before that , Thomas Bockstadt , Susanne Reichle , Sandra Schöck , Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiple donors and were awarded for 50 donations each .	-3.2883

The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25 %	-1.2931
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and inflation weakening have dampened speculation about rising .	-3.8450
The Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain " sluggish " when it maintained interest rates on family incomes in the midst of increasing pressure .	-2.9640
Policymakers of the Bank ’ s Monetary Committee ( MPC ) voted 6-2 to keep interest rates to 0.25 % , with fewer members seeking a rise this month , as weak economic growth weakened support for an increase .	-4.1693
In its quarterly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts to 1.7 % in 2017 , and 1.6 % in 2018 , warning that pressure on household incomes would continue , with inflation expected to rise to just under 3 % in the autumn .	-3.0361
But it signaled that rate hikes would become necessary in the coming years to curb Brexite-fueled inflation , and it said that borrowing costs might have to rise more than expected in financial markets .	-4.0585
Members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth stimulus package issued a year ago after Brexit .	-2.5116
It will demand time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funding for banks from next February , although it has been said that it is now expected to provide <unk> 15 billion more within the framework of this system - with <unk> 115 billion sterling .	-4.8194
Minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : " In the MPC 's central forecast , GDP remains weak in the short term , as pressure on household real incomes continues to burden consumption . "	-4.5858
On interest rates , she repeated that ' a certain tightening of monetary policy ' would be needed to cool inflation and a ' slightly larger ' scale than the markets expect .	-3.7219
Markets are currently predicting the first rise in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .	-2.5817
However , the Bank stressed that increases would be " gradual " and " limited " .	-3.0538
The Bank ’ s downward growth forecasts for this year and next year are compared to the 1.9 % and 1.7 % forecast in May .	-2.8324
It has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .	-1.8197
After these news , the pound fell against the dollar and the euro .	-2.3896
The pound fell by 0.5 % to $ 1.31 and fell by 0.4 % to € 1.11 .	-2.1024
The decision to change is not made after the recent disappointing growth figures have dampened the rising expectations of a rate hike , and GDP has risen from 0.2 % in the second quarter to 0.3 % in the previous three months .	-5.0282
Growth is likely to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will recover slightly after the bank by the end of the year .	-9.3872
The most recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and slight wage increases , because tightening first becomes even worse before it becomes better .	-4.4194
It added that monetary policy cannot " prevent " income collapse in the coming years , but it added that wages will " clearly " recover at the end of their three-year forecast .	-3.5575
The economy is also strengthened by rising demand for British goods , owing to the weak pound , which will compensate for some of the lower consumer spending .	-3.2665
The decision comes one year after the reduction of interest rates to 0.25 % last August following the shocking EU vote , which caused the pound to fall .	-3.0974
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years for this to be fully achieved by prices and the .	-3.4000
Before the Bank ’ s last judgment on interest rates , the call for a rate hike had risen , as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households , with three policymakers demanding an increase to 0.5 % in July .	-4.0991
Last month , inflation fell from 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % , although the Bank said that this was expected and will attract it again in the coming months .	-3.8397
The Bank said that exceeding the 2 % target was " totally " attributable to the weak pound .	-3.7090
Andrew Montlake , Director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers , said : " Given the recent swap rate decline , the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again , as lenders are looking loud for business and want to end the year in a positive man. the the . the the , the the the . the the the the	-10.8841
The market looks particularly good for those who phase out the existing deals and complete the new mortgages , and many with toll-free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . '	-3.6537
NHS ( The National Health Service ) is intended to prescribe controversial HIV drugs of 10,000 people .	-3.0142
From September onwards , patients will have access to a " transformative " HIV prevention treatment after a struggle before the High Court against the financing of the drug in the NHS .	-4.8829
NHS England announced that a pre-exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) taken prior to sexual intercourse , which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 percent , is now supplied by the health service through an initial three-year study for an estimated 10,000 people .	-4.8779
He agreed to finance the process after last year ’ s Court of Appeal confirmed a Supreme Court ruling that the NHS had the power to pay for the PrEP despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it . the the . the , the the , the the , , , the , , , , ,	-12.5576
The move announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England Chief Simon Stevens as an " important new intervention " , while the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) called this a " crucial moment " .	-11.7105
Sexual health hospitals in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool , and Sheffield will be among the first to enable people to register , and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced across England in April 2018 .	-9.5399
Preexposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .	-2.8455
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces the HIV transmission of infectious people .	-2.8917
Taking PrEP before sexual intercourse means that there are just enough drugs in a person 's body to prevent HIV infection .	-3.8454
Such drugs can be taken every day or two hours before sexual intercourse .	-2.8844
Those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men , transsexuals and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated .	-3.5345
Clinics identify suitable participants who agree to the study , including men , women , transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment .	-3.3407
People living in England and registered with a domestic doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local sexual clinic .	-3.8768
The programme will be $ 10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply medicines this week after an international competitive procurement .	-3.6200
The study is intended to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence , as it is used , recorded and implemented on a large scale .	-4.4956
Stevens said : " This great new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .	-2.5584
It is another milestone in more than three decades of continued progress in addressing one of the greatest health challenges facing mankind . '	-3.9971
Deborah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National Aids Trust ) , said : " This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .	-2.0487
PrEP , if targeted at needy and vulnerable people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic .	-3.5887
From September onwards , people with a high risk of HIV will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiations with a partner , leading to improvements in many , many lives .	-4.4340
We warmly welcome this announcement . '	-1.5566
Ian Green , CEO of the Terrence Higgins Trust , said : " The priority must now be to ensure that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk to HIV is left behind .	-3.7138
Now that PrEP test medicine has been procured , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people . '	-3.4394
Sharon Hodgson , Shadow Health Minister , said : " The beginning of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and hesitant implementation by the government .	-3.0015
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection .	-2.9011
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP .	-2.3333
It is now important for this study to be carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country in order to protect people who are HIV infected and to help us get a step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society ' .	-4.4255
Living the Great Life : Mid-floor and clever designer tricks have transformed this small Earls Court apartment into a generous home .	-3.9412
Joanne Leigh , a former banker with a passion for real estate , reduced from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014 .	-2.6052
It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags .	-3.2044
" Before that I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room , " says Joanne .	-2.6816
" I was looking for something comparable to my price .	-2.0424
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and she had the same high ceilings .	-2.3943
I fallen in love with them and made an offer on this day ' .	-3.0832
Since the first visit the 1,000 square feet large apartment has been completely overtaken .	-3.8141
Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to walk through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne storage room and a mezzanine floor to make optimal use of the generous ceiling height .	-4.6349
" I wanted high blankets , large windows , lots of light .	-1.5203
That was my requirement , " she says .	-2.1658
For this purpose , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place for life for Joanne .	-4.0780
The ceiling was not large enough to place two spaces above each other , so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor where you could stand .	-4.3445
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the requirements .	-2.7689
" The steel plant is quite complicated , " he explains .	-2.5273
" We had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked upon each other without having to move .	-4.6142
It was not just a question of building a simple platform , but of creating steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . '	-4.3808
This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms in full height – with a lot of extra drama .	-4.3856
For the mezzanine floor a classic copper light window of Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area .	-3.6295
Mirrored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage serge mouille lighting set the style for the program .	-2.9245
Using mirrors plays a role in adding theatres , space and light .	-1.9756
At both ends a short corridor is mirrored to make it work longer .	-3.5758
In the kitchen , the mirror feels like a window in another room .	-2.6408
At the entrance there are mirrored units for all cutlery and glasses of Joanne .	-9.8514
By perceiving a more glamorous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .	-2.8989
Foldable kitchens are nothing new .	-2.0459
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door .	-2.9605
" A little engineering art went into it " , explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced , veneered MDF door .	-3.6777
'It is weighty so that when you push the door , it slides very easily . '	-4.5531
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Joanne was able to win additional 16 m <unk> , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .	-10.6528
" At the end of the day you will sell the land or how your property is estimated , " says Erfan .	-3.5019
'In a rudimentary form , a real estate broker will occur and perform a calculation based on the ground size ' .	-3.9415
Here they managed to enlarge the floor area while using high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage .	-5.1886
" The materials are the things you touch and therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home , " says Erfan .	-2.8494
" You don 't fall in love with the electric sockets in the walls .	-2.3744
These are important , but they do not play with your heart . '	-1.9733
It shows that an apartment can be transformed into something quite amazing by good design and increased square meters of something standard .	-4.7596
In fact , like Joanne , you could decide not to leave it .	-2.4224
Brothers are struggling for a $ 500 million real estate emp. . the . the . the . the the . the the the	-10.3350
Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty , in a battle for one of Victoria ’ s largest real estate empires worth more than $ 500 million .	-3.8910
The former director of the ' Carlton Football Club ' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul , who brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets should be shared .	-3.8932
Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp dispute about separation is taking place in the Supreme Court .	-3.8629
Together with her mother Anna , the brothers have 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , accumulated since the family purchased a business in Smith Street , Collingwood in 1973 .	-3.4347
The Westco Jeans family was founded there and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores .	-3.2390
It was sold for $ 85 million in 1999 .	-1.2298
This money has been invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the urban area , the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller , as well as shopping centres in the suburban.	-9.8640
According to an agreement with her late father , Colin - described by Paul as " the main operator and the dominant personality " in the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of the company 's assets and Paul about one-third .	-4.5134
One court case says that this means that Colin owns $ 316 million worth of property and $ 176 million worth of Paul .	-3.8676
The distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .	-2.5248
" The divisions proposed by Colin left him with what I thought were the best objects , " he wrote in a first affidavit in 2015 .	-9.5789
Last Friday , after several failed conciliations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place .	-1.9865
The brothers are now also struggling to control the existing business - of which Colin , as Paul claims , excluded it .	-4.2812
Colin argues that this is not true , but accuses Paul of incompetently managing some ownership .	-10.3128
In an early affidavit submitted by Colin , he says he hopes to settle the dispute .	-2.6776
" My Italian heritage prescribes that the family is the most important priority , " he wrote .	-2.2015
Costs are rising in the event of hundreds of pages with affidavits , e-mails and reports by companies , including Deloitte , Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan Myers , QC , and mutually held law firms .	-4.0421
Ms De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated dairy bars and delicatessen shops from the late 1950 's and bought a business in Brunswick in the early 1970 's .	-3.6136
They used the security to buy the Collingwood property in which Colin opened the first family jeans shop .	-3.2649
Colin says that he started Westco there when he was ' the high school in my last years , when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) . '	-3.8277
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass on their property amicably to their sons .	-2.5968
" Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to end in court , " she wrote .	-2.4301
Two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lutis group , with Colin claiming that $ 10 million and $ 26 million were paid when leaving the company .	-3.7158
Both Lukas and Mark are , Paul says , " became bitter about the conditions of their financial separation " .	-3.3772
Colin was very restrained , although he was a former member of the AFL Board , and after a 2015 biography by Eddie McGuire , he was the best friend of the TV star .	-4.9349
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers .	-1.5184
Only Colin answered via SMS to say " I really can not say much " because the case was before the courts .	-2.9487
" It is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and draw our family name through the courts , " he wrote .	-2.9527
In mid-2016 , Colin wrote in a letter to the Court that he tried to meet his brother ’ s demands .	-3.1285
" Our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end in our current dispute , " he said and added that he " still hopes for a solution " .	-2.7682
This hope seemed to be over on Friday .	-2.3148
" Our affair will be resolved in the near future by the courts , " wrote Colin .	-2.1913
Trump ’ s new head of staff is planning to restrict president ’ s media abstinence .	-2.5745
Others have tried and failed .	-1.5366
Perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it .	-2.0374
If so , it will be the first .	-1.3129
Politico reports that the White House ’ s new Chief of Staff is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Trump – including news media reports – in the hope of keeping the Chief on a more even-handed course . , .	-7.8532
Here is a piece of Reporter Josh Dawsey :	-1.5907
" When John F. Kelly , the new White House Chief of Staff , met senior officials on his first day of work , he presented a major problem in President Donald Trump ’ s White House that he wanted to repair : bad information that goes into the president ’ s hands .	-4.5013
Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he received good information . '	-4.3666
Kelly ’ s diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet .	-1.4756
President Trump ’ s relationship with television dates back decades – and now , where he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong .	-2.7763
" When candidate Trump was annoyed for unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of posts that were to be convinced , " the former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg said to Politico in February .	-4.3474
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that " the key to keeping Trump 's Twitter habit under control is , according to six former campaign officials , to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a constant praise . "	-3.4838
Okay .	-0.4202
But the idea that Trump ’ s Twitter habit has ever been “ under control ” is ridiculous .	-1.8445
Perhaps these campaign officials know something we do not know to others - that Trump ’ s tweets would have contained even more fuel without their interventions .	-14.5074
We will probably never hear about the tweets that Trump has not sent .	-2.2465
If his staff managed to keep him out of trouble several times , their efforts have been worthwhile .	-4.7387
But no one has consistently prevented Trump from causing controversy .	-2.1370
Part of the problem is that people in a White House composed of competing parties keep trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views from the world .	-4.2248
Politico reported in May on the preference of advisers to provide the president with dubious information for strategic reasons .	-4.4201
This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher :	-1.6047
" Current and former Trump officials say that Trump , like a volcano , can respond to negative press cuts , especially those with damaging leaks , and that he is seeking to find out where they come from .	-3.9766
This was precisely what happened at the end of February , when someone maliciously gave the President a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com , the website of the Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh of being " the source behind a pile of leaks " in the White House .	-4.1581
Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter because of harassment , or that he did not offer concrete evidence , or that he had in the past voiced and revoked false accusations .	-5.1161
Trump read the article and began to ask staff about Walsh . "	-2.4890
Goldmacher added that then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Secretary General Rob Porter have " tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork Trump receives " .	-4.0484
How did that work ?	-1.4090
Kelly attempted to do the same three months later .	-1.4734
Perhaps he will prove himself more effective as a priest , but Trump is still his impulsive self , and his advisers are still seeking influence .	-2.9496
These unchanging factors make Kelly ’ s mission very difficult .	-2.1842

They brought horses , babies and an army of transporters , after they were only thrown out in May , but without being deterred by a ditch excavated by the Council to prevent their incidents .	-5.5158
The tactful group found a gap in defence facilities and pressed their vehicles through a section that remained unhindered to find a way .	-3.5867
Anger inhabitants have afflicted the Solihull Council , which said that it is ' useless to address the problem ' .	-4.8518
An anonymous inhabitant said : " They moved there on Monday evening after they were sent by Bentley Heath , where they thrown stones onto the passers-by .	-4.3360
The Council must be forced into action by shame , because it was useless in dealing with the problem .	-3.4581
The travellers were there in May , were moved on and are now back .	-3.3149
More arrived yesterday evening , probably more today . '	-2.8638
She added : ' The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with this by holding long instructions to protect its parks .	-2.9735
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I am not happy to continue to pay my municipal tax if the Council cannot even stop this . '	-3.1112
One resident who did not want to be mentioned said , " It is ridiculous , we have just seen the last round of these travellers , just to be plundered by another round .	-4.1477
The figures have increased this time and even a horse has been seen in the parking area . '	-3.6506
A spokesman of the Solihull Council said : ' We are aware of an unauthorized camp in the countryside beyond the Streetsbrook Road and are working with the Solihull police , and we are taking the necessary legal steps to continue as quickly as possible .	-5.4209
To support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible report an anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101 .	-3.0581
This will help to create a picture of the situation in which the Court must examine when we present our case ' .	-4.2223
Waldhotel Luise becomes from Birkenhof	-2.3775
Former Hotel Birkenhof becomes the Waldhotel Luise .	-2.2975
The house is currently being renovated and will be reopened on 1 March next year .	-4.2645
These are good news for the city .	-1.3350
With the closure of Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH as of April 13 , 2014 , approximately 30 000 nights a year were lost and also revenue from the spa tax .	-5.1018
In the autumn of 2014 , with dramatically increasing numbers of refugees arriving in the district , the hotel building was offered to the Landratsamt as a collection of accommodation , causing controversial discussions .	-4.8096
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by drawing up a plan to secure the area as a hotel location .	-3.4529
The decision was not uncontroversial at the time in the municipal council .	-3.3251
But , above all , Freudenstadt ’ s mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and spoke of serious interested parties at the time .	-5.1142
He should be right .	-1.2423
The group of Luisenhotels with Managing Director Birgit Scherer , headquartered in Bad Bergzabern , acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three-star plus category under the name of Waldhotel Lu.	-4.9536
The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object .	-2.1529
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb .	-1.4067
They are called Hotel Luise , Luisenpark , Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise .	-1.5501
The former Hotel Birkenhof has been in front of the entrance for a long time , and when you enter the house , it becomes clear what extensive renovations are being carried out .	-5.6775
The floors were torn out , ceilings were partly dismantled , old bathtubs removed from the rooms .	-4.6971
The entire hotel building is a single building site .	-2.0910
There is still much to be done by March .	-1.8218
" It is actually a nice hotel " , says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper .	-8.4003
Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style .	-2.5049
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers , the entrance area is redesigned and new windows are installed .	-4.2964
Everything should later become " beautifully close to the citizens " , as Thomas Scherer expresses himself .	-3.7117
'We want to make a jewel out ' .	-9.6036
Facilities include swimming pool , spa and meeting room .	-2.9227
The hotel was very clean and comfortable .	-6.3742
The Waldhotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to be spacious , explains Scherer further .	-4.9693
Individual tourists , groups or businessmen should feel at ease in the hotel .	-10.8070
He has already held talks with OB Julian Osswald and Tourism Director Michael Krause , according to Scherer .	-3.5995
The ideas of the city are equal to those of the hotel group .	-3.9438
'We are on the same line ' .	-1.0207
Asked for the amount of investment , Thomas Scherer does not want to determine exactly . .	-10.1454
Almost EUR 1 million , he expects .	-3.5054
The outdoor facilities are also brought to front , which is already clearly visible .	-4.2087
In a courtyard there is a large terrace , which will be accessible from the restaurant , which is open to the public .	-3.8317
Thomas Scherer is optimistic : " Freudenstadt is a good market " .	-1.7647
Russia affair : U.S. Special Investors Use Grand Jury	-4.0564
In the Russian affair for US President Donald Trump , special investigator Robert Mueller is said to have set up a so-called Grand Jury after a report .	-3.8367
The panel has started work in recent weeks , wrote the " Wall Street Journal " , invoking people familiar with the matter .	-5.1467
The newspaper evaluated the move as a sign that Mueller has expanded and intensified his investigations . the the the . the the the the . the the .	-9.3397
The CNN broadcaster reported that there are already initial submissions from the panel relating to a meeting between Trump ’ s oldest son and a Russian lawyer .	-9.2257
US intelligence services have been accusing the Kremlin for a long time of targeting interference in the 2016 presidential campaign .	-3.5447
Mueller investigates whether there were agreements between Trump ’ s campaign and Moscow .	-2.4199
The investigation is intended to focus on several men acting as a Republican advisor in the election campaign .	-7.1402
According to reports , Mueller also looked at more and more Trump ’ s private and business environment .	-2.2864
The Washington Post wrote a few weeks ago that the special investigator , Trump , personally came to the centre and investigated the accusation of whether the president might have hindered the judiciary in the course of the affair .	-5.3542
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine the evidence available in possible cases of crime and to decide whether to charge it .	-4.5102
Grand Jurys are therefore also called charges .	-3.3840
Most of the time they are turned on when these are larger and controversial cases .	-3.7846
The procedure always takes place behind closed doors .	-1.9581
The board can also be activated by the Public Prosecutor to invite people to speak under oath .	-4.8802
According to the CNN channel , subpoenas have already been issued to meet Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer .	-4.1061
People who took part in the meeting were asked to make a statement , it was said in the report .	-4.1370
They should also provide documents .	-1.0921
Besides Trump Jr. , Trump ’ s adviser and son of inquiry , Jared Kushner , and his then campaign chief , Paul Manafort , were in the discussion .	-5.4588
Legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the setting shows that Mueller is not intimidating in his work and that he wants to act quickly if necessary .	-4.0881
However , it should not necessarily be said that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the charge .	-12.2686
Nevertheless , the setting up of the body is the beginning of a new phase in the investigation and a new cause for concern for President Trump .	-3.7239
In the midst of the new revelations , the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents .	-8.7122
" Russia 's history is a total invention , " Trump said .	-1.5159
The subject gives Democrats a chance to ' feel good because they have nothing else they can talk about ' .	-3.2954
His special adviser Ty Cobb explained in an opinion that he knows nothing about the establishment of a Grand Jury .	-3.5983
However , they usually work in secret , he stressed .	-8.4282
The White House supports any measures that accelerated the work of the special investigator in a ' fair ' way .	-3.6996
The former FBI chief , James Comey , said three times that the president would not be determined .	-4.1159
There is no reason to assume that something has changed , as the declaration said .	-5.6129
But Mueller was only used after Trump fired Comey .	-2.8337
Because of this extraction , accusations against Trump had been made that he wanted to hinder the judiciary .	-4.6149
Comey said in June before a Senate committee that Trump asked him to stop investigating the then national security adviser Michael Flynn .	-3.4381
The President is under great pressure because of the investigation .	-2.5156
After presenting US media , the White House collected material against the special mediator and his staff .	-4.1725
This sparked speculation about whether Trump wanted to dismiss Mueller .	-2.9882
Unlike an independent congressional special investigator , such as the Watergate affair around the later resigned President Richard Nixon , Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired by the Ministry of Justice at the president ’ s pressure .	-4.1643
Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a move .	-2.5721
Two groups of Republican and Democratic senators presented draft legislation on Thursday , according to which special investigators could no longer be easily laid off .	-3.9369
Antarctica : Gigantic iceberg is driving in Antarctica	-2.1043
In the Western Arctic , a gigantic iceberg of the almost seven times the size of Berlin has been solved by the Schelfeis .	-5.5316
This was announced by the Bremerhaven Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .	-2.6432
The colossus , heavy over a trillion tonnes and 5800 square kilometres , is now driving north and will probably take two or three years to melt .	-5.1101
With 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the biggest ice giants that researchers have registered in the last three decades .	-9.4205
He does not pose a danger to people .	-3.4612
The extent to which climate change has played a role in the abortion of the iceberg is unclear according to research .	-9.6883
Overall , however , there has been a series of unusual collapses of ice shelves in the region for about 30 years , writes the US Research Centre for Snow and Ice ( NSIDC ) in a factual background .	-4.0076
Many researchers believe that this can be linked to global warming .	-2.2685
The colossus now broken was part of the Larsen-C Schelfei .	-4.5268
Schelfeis swims on the sea and is fed by large glaciers .	-2.6956
It thus grows ever further into the sea and breaks regularly .	-5.4627
The Larsen-C Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula .	-3.0229
North of this shellfish , the balance of growth and abortion was disturbed a few years ago .	-4.0765
A complete schelfei had disintegrated there , writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen .	-3.4579
There is a lot to say that the Larsen-C Schelfeis is also in danger , because the front edge has never withdrawn as far as it is .	-12.4056
Furthermore , the ice plate is under tension and may disintegrate if a key point breaks off a piece .	-6.1420
Melting Schelfeis and Iceberg does not increase the sea level , because they swim on the water and displace ice as much water as they do after melting themselves .	-5.0952
However , the loss of the shellfish results in the glaciers flowing directly into the sea and flowing much faster than before .	-4.9315
This could possibly increase sea levels , but only to a small extent , writes the British research project to observe Antarctica ( Midas ) .	-4.1774
According to AWI , the Larsen-C Schelfeis is the fourth largest Schelfeis in Antarctica , with almost 50 000 square kilometres .	-3.9898
At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean approximately 200 meters .	-4.0122
It regularly breaks down there .	-3.5247
" Although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change , the ice shield is now coming into a more dangerous position , " said Martin O 'Leary of the British Swansea University .	-4.2548
" This is the widest withdrawal since the records began , " he also confirmed .	-2.7760
Among scientists , it was controversial whether the Larsen-C Schelfeis would grow again or go back in the long term and possibly collapse , his colleague Adrian Luckman said and added : ' Our models say it will be less stable ' .	-5.6906
But this will take decades .	-1.7356
Although these researchers do not attribute the abortion of this gigantic iceberg to climate change , in recent decades a great many icebergs of the Antarctic Peninsula have disintegrated .	-5.3080
This long tip of Antarctica extends to South America .	-2.8970
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey research programme , the Antarctic Peninsula ’ s ice surface has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950 ’ s .	-3.8231
The rise in temperature has contributed to the decline .	-2.6610
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed up by about three degrees over the past 50 years , making it one of the areas where temperature rises the fastest .	-4.3351
CDU wants home rate at staff	-3.6917
Because it is becoming increasingly difficult to fill vacancies , the CDU is calling for the exit of the employers ' association to become more attractive .	-3.8348
Just before the summer recess , the circle day won 41 new posts in the administration .	-4.1178
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann .	-2.3790
Now again 17 trainees have their first working day .	-3.6370
The teaching places at the circle are apparently very desirable .	-4.0338
About 620 applications were recorded for the places to be awarded this year .	-2.6539
Nevertheless , the circle still lacks personnel to manage the increased demands and tasks .	-4.0333
At the moment , the Mettmann county still has 50 unoccupied posts .	-4.2835
Among other things , doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration are sought .	-3.9663
The CDU now wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG in the circle day and counter the shortage of skilled staff in the administration .	-5.4571
According to the parties ' wishes , the administration should ' develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development ' .	-4.8969
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs for specialists , but also to counteract the scarcity of applicants in the future , it says .	-5.1792
The overall concept should be internally and externally oriented , demonstrate concrete measures for cross-border beginners and include a training offensive , demand CDU , FDP and UWG .	-5.0374
This sounds like a good approach .	-1.9817
Because the circle is dealing with personnel problems that were previously unknown .	-4.6932
Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .	-2.1099
There is talk of a real ' competition of public employers ' .	-3.2621
In addition , there are a large number of employees who leave the service due to illness or age .	-4.8839
So it is high time to act so that more posts do not remain unfilled .	-4.8257
But Klaus-Dieter Völker , head of the CDU group , goes beyond the joint motion with his party .	-3.4798
He recently caused a thick surprise in the circular day when he publicly questioned the staffing cost coverage and surprised the other parties .	-6.1357
Peoples want to see all possible ways of leaving the municipal employers ' association checked .	-4.3666
" If we do not find a satisfactory solution in the short term , the circle administration should strive for a home tariff with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with circle cities , " said People .	-6.0803
In doing so , the CDU is trying to pay employees and officials better than it actually provides for tariff forwarding for the Public Serv.	-5.0063
Salaries are currently precisely prescribed , increases or more money exist only if you change to a higher level oriented towards professional years .	-5.2350
But the tasks of the circle have increased in recent years .	-3.0065
Only a few weeks ago , new spaces had to be set up in which employees were concerned about the provisions of the new prostitution protection law .	-4.7589
Last but not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers , Landrat Thomas Hendele and Director Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .	-2.8603
Italy exacerbates the tone of NGO migrant rescue boats	-2.1582
Italy has warned NGOs deploying rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they must not continue this if they do not comply with new rules for their operations .	-4.1379
" If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , " said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa .	-3.0663
Minniti 's warning came one day after the Italian authorities had seized a boat from the German Youth Saving Organization , because their team had effectively cooperated with human traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration .	-4.0558
The aid organization , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to comment on detailed accusations by the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio .	-3.8020
" For us , saving human life is and remains our top priority , so we are very sorry that we cannot currently operate in the search and rescue area , " said the organization in an opinion on the social media .	-4.2720
'We can assess all the accusations that are currently being made only after we have collected all the information and can assess the situation ' .	-4.3059
The Italian authorities have been monitoring the boat of ' Youth Rescue ' , the Iuventa , since October .	-2.9032
It is suspected that his crew takes on board hose migrants who are directly supplied to them by human traffickers , and that smugglers can leave so that ships can be used again .	-5.2981
At least such a meeting was allegedly held just 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the Public Prosecutor 's Act , whose content was published by Italian media .	-3.9964
The occupation is suspected of overlooking the authority of the Italian coastguard , who is monitoring rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other motives .	-3.9032
Under the Code of Conduct , boats such as the Iuventa must , above all , have an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities .	-3.2808
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the code : Save the Children , MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain .	-2.4903
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be regarded as unnecessary , but acceptable , because they would not entail any ' substantial changes or disabilities ' of their bailouts .	-4.2030
Among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel Prize Organization is doctors without borders ( MSF ) .	-2.5569
Minniti has meanwhile said that the number of migrants arriving after the bailouts in Italy has fallen sharply in recent weeks , suggesting that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit .	-4.0128
" In recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , " said the Minister .	-7.5802
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of achieving Europe .	-2.9950
Increases and Trials	-1.5561
Nine hamlet bikers , the " Berlin Outpost " and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the North Palatinate to enjoy trials and sights for four days .	-3.7248
Three friendly guides were available for this purpos.	-2.7993
The accommodation in the Wachenheim Valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .	-2.5886
The Wachenheim castle and wine festival was a welcome extra .	-2.3249
The first tour took place at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michael Chapel above Deidesheim .	-2.6876
The viewpoints followed , partly on towers , from which one could look far beyond the Palatinate forest and the upstream plains .	-6.9525
In between , there have been longer increases , rewarding long trials .	-4.8453
The second day went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and the Volksfest Wurstmarkt .	-3.3796
Again , the viewpoint ran at the viewpoint , connected by " flowering " trials and moderate rises .	-6.0916
On the last two days there were many meters of altitude .	-4.1299
Caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and refuges brought welcome breaks .	-2.3944
In Bad Dürkheim , the bikers breathed healing sole in the outdoor inhalatory .	-8.8897
Neustadt has also been controlled . the the the . the the the . the the . the the	-7.5446

Console instead of lawns - Bundesliga is equipped for e-sport .	-3.4656
In the future , are sports stars sitting in front of computer consoles instead of fighting through the wind and weather over the stadium race ?	-6.0412
The fact is : e-sport has long since become a serious industry , a lucrative business - big stars , millions of fans , and huge tournaments with high gages included .	-4.3951
The first federal league associations have recognized this , which are increasingly involved in this area .	-4.5626
The VfL Wolfsburg began in 2015 , later followed the FC Schalke 04 and most recently the VfB Stuttgart , which founded an e-sports department in mid-July and contracted two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 .	-4.8485
" We hope to inspire new young target groups for the VfB , " says Management Board Jochen Röttgermann .	-3.4271
He is sure " that there are still many clubs on this train " .	-4.5319
Next weekend the FIFA World Football Association in London organizes the first " Interactive Club World Cup " in which the gamers of different clubs compete against each other . the .	-11.5686
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint-Germain or the PSV Eindhoven have qualified .	-10.5796
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sport .	-1.5920
The ex-trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players .	-2.6128
" Real football has to deal with the 14-30-year-olds in particular that young people will continue to go to the stadium in the future , " says the 52-year-old .	-5.3818
And : The clubs tried to conquer all kinds of markets , especially the Asian ones .	-2.9120
With prominent e-sportsmen under contract , you could be much more present online on these markets than just sending the Federal League team to Asia once a year .	-4.4655
What exactly is this about ?	-1.8649
In e-sport , computer games such as " League Of Legends " , " Dota 2 " , " Counterstrike " or just the FIFA football simulation are fought out at competitive level .	-4.8167
As in normal sport , leagues have long established themselves in which professionals compete against each other .	-4.2201
And e-sport is already part of the official program in the 2022 Asian Games .	-3.1057
But is it a real sport ?	-2.4751
For many , the idea is certainly needed to get used to .	-4.0515
Ingo Froböse has also dealt with the issue for a long time .	-3.4606
For the professor at the Deutsche Sporthochschule in Cologne , e-sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in classical sport - for example , increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormonal changes .	-4.5888
It also needs cognitive skills , a technical and tactical understanding and a rapid response capacity .	-8.9427
Professional gamers should train not only at the console , but also their body and pay attention to nutrition .	-3.5372
'The fit player is a good player ' .	-2.1137
But it also sees problems : " Doping is becoming more and more a topic " .	-4.5901
Controls are difficult to perform in online games , and the scene lacked the structures of classical sport .	-4.1706
The scientist positively highlights the high integrative effect of e-sport .	-3.0001
Players travel internationally , this is like a large global family , there are no intercultural barriers .	-3.6606
A study by the Deloitte Consultancy and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software ( BIU ) forecasts rapid growth for e-sport .	-3.6548
In 2016 , it implemented EUR 50 million in Germany , mainly through advertising , sponsorship , and big tournaments .	-3.4819
In three years , sales will be 130 million .	-2.5959
This is not enough against the nearly EUR 2.4 billion of the Football Bundesliga .	-4.0324
However , e-sport is " not far away from other established sports such as handball , basketball or ice hockey " , write the Deloitte consultants .	-3.9193
Many countries are already on the international stage .	-3.0920
Large markets are Asia and the USA , where ex-basketball players Shaquille O<unk>Neal and baseballstar Alex Rodriguez participate in the US Team NRG eSports .	-2.5681
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSports betting company Unikrn .	-2.1511
There is also a great deal in Europe .	-9.4456
In a Norwegian school , e-sport has been introduced as a teaching subject , Froböse says .	-3.1104
In the Netherlands and France , the Football First League clubs , according to Dutt , are now obliged to set up an e-sports department .	-3.5254
" In European comparison Germany lags behind " , explains VfB-Management Board Röttgermann .	-3.3679
Just to fall into nostalgia and to declare the old times is no longer enough .	-4.5755
The aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but at the same time to align the company with the modern market .	-3.8965
" We live in a digitalized world " , also means Dutt .	-3.0727

Almost all federal states are affected by the scandal of toxic eggs .	-3.4251
Aldi South and Aldi Nord reacted and removed all eggs from sale throughout Germany .	-3.4367

Michelle Carter condemned for the texts that Conrad Roy pushes for suicide	-2.7674
A woman from Massachusetts has been sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her friend through texts and calls for suicide .	-2.9799
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of condemnation behind bars and five years have been suspended on proof .	-2.9194
Carter was condemned in June for negligent killing of Conrad Roy , who died on 13 July 2014 .	-2.5959
The father of Roy said at the hearing on Thursday : " My family is uncomfortable .	-2.5306
My son was my best friend . '	-0.8349
Carter was allowed to remain free until the appeal .	-2.7038
She had been confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr. Roy suffered a mental illness .	-2.9553
In red trousers and a cream-coloured blouse , Carter stood in the eyes with tears , with folded hands and downward eyes when convicted .	-4.4699
" Their actions have killed Conrad Roy , " said the prosecutor to the court .	-2.5801
" She ended his life to make her own better .	-2.2435
She has taken no responsibility , " she said .	-2.5110
" She has not shown any repentance " .	-2.9601
But Carter 's lawyer said that it was a ' terrible circumstance that she completely regrets ' .	-3.7877
Judge Lawrence Moniz , however , said that he did not find that her " age or degree of maturity , or even her mental illness , has a significant influence on her actions " .	-4.3680
A prosecutor read a statement by Roy 's mother , Lynn Roy , who said that there is " no day when I am not mourning the loss of my beloved son .	-3.9874
I would like him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything , and I .	-13.4689
Roy 's sister , Camdyn Roy , said that she would " pursue " her knowledge that she would never participate in the wedding of her brother or be an aunt for his children .	-3.9013
" Not having this only person with whom I have been together every day since my birth is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , " she said .	-4.3915
The case seems to set a legal precedent , because there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to call on another to commit suicide .	-3.0283
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in 2014 by carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle .	-2.2917
The case attracted national attention after Carter ’ s text messages revealed that she encouraged him to end his life .	-3.3147
" Hang up , jump from a building , make yourself , I do not know there are many ways , " she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on holiday with his family .	-4.1143
In the moments before his suicide she wrote : ' You must do Conrad ' and ' All you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy ' .	-3.7178
Judge Moniz said that Carter was looking for attention by the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from the case by any press .	-3.5254
The case shared the legal opinion .	-2.0652
One of the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox , who was sentenced to murder her British fellow resident in Italy in 2007 before being released two years ago .	-3.6296
Mrs Knox , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : ' Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not prison ' .	-2.6640
Joshua Kimmich : Learning from FC Bavaria ’ s new mini lame	-3.0861
It is no coincidence that Joshua Kimmich was allowed to run up as a captain at the Audi Cup .	-2.9899
The FC Bavaria has a great season for the Confed Cup winner - extra motivation does not harm .	-11.6807
Something else was on his place in the cabin , which saw Joshua Kimmich immediately , even though the additional clothing was very , very small .	-4.1399
But since there was no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel Neuer on the second day of the Audi Cup , he made the bind assigned to him halfway to the arm. the . the the the the . the the , the the the . the	-15.4759
" The trainer did not announce it , " the Confed Cup winner told behind , after his first bet as a Bavarian captain .	-4.0699
Well , the admission could have been better than the 0 : 2 against the SSC Naples .	-4.3381
But the sign of the coach could also interpret Kimmich .	-3.2686
Not the eight years older Arturo Vidal was chosen as a guide in the C-Elf , which consists of youth players , debutants and just out of holiday professionals , but he was chosen .	-6.1264
Sugar is preferred to be distributed to those who are much trusted to whom we want to keep in mood .	-5.6457
Those who have been chosen to enter the legacy of Lahm can only use a small extra motivation well .	-3.8779
Kimmich confirmed : " This is what you want as a player : take responsibility " .	-3.0066
On Wednesday the 22-year-old flashed over the field as a mini lame .	-3.5049
Right behind , this is his position , the white bond on the arm did its rest .	-5.1664
And Kimmich acted in this starting formation as the one who can best take the rower in his hand .	-5.6797
He gave instructions , tried to steer the unrecorded force .	-3.2356
He looked at the whole , while many others were self-employed .	-4.0874
Vidal with playing his lack of fitness ( hardly worked ) ; Renato Sanches with attaching devils to the performances of the Asian journey ( worked conditionally ) ; and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle with failing to notice negatively in their first appearance in the Bavarian tricot .	-6.7928
That worked very well .	-3.0254
Süle ran alongside Kimmich , Rudy before the defense , both acted sovereign .	-3.5473
The famous Napoli Storm was often difficult , and Süle also tried to succeed in the game building a few times .	-7.3417
His colleague , Mr Rudy , admitted that the result ' was not the way we hoped for it ' .	-3.5600
But he also showed a good performance in the debut .	-3.6402
Game relocation , Tempo change : " For this style I was also fetched " .	-5.0208
How unusual this Bavarian world is for the new entries , one saw after the game .	-5.3702
Rudy , for example , did not give one or two in the catacombs , but certainly gave six or seven interviews .	-2.7846
Kimmich passed after a few cracky statements in the back of his new players .	-4.6546
There he heard an interesting phrase from Süle : " What is going on here I have already noticed .	-4.5299
At Bavaria you simply have to win every game " .	-2.7713
After all , he no longer has to teach the new .	-3.1567

The Bavarian Legionary is almost a club colleague of <unk>FB-Captain Schnaderbeck and fevers with our ladys .	-5.2193
The tweet of the Austrian footballer of the year and Champions League winner should be a special motivation injection .	-2.9976

Companies satisfied with the Rhineland-Palatinate Minister : Economics praises Wissings ’ speed .	-3.6391
It was often inconcilable , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when Eveline Lemke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economics of Rhineland-Palatinate .	-3.2798
This is evident after more than a year when the new Minister for Economic Affairs , Volker Wissing ( FDP ) , is in off.	-3.5219
Chambers and companies from the region speak on T V request of a change in economic policy - and at the same time reprimand the old minister .	-4.0769
Frank Natus , Chairman of the Association of Trierer Unternehmen ( VTU ) , says : " Wissing takes up the wishes of the economy that Lemke has all blocked " .	-3.4798
The biggest turnaround is Natus in infrastructure policy : the gap between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country ’ s list of priorities .	-4.1933
This year , the Ministry hopes for a planning finding procedure , and building law is to stand by 2021 .	-5.1596
The country ’ s plans also include the Western circumvention of Trier , which is in the urgent need of the Federal Transport Plan .	-4.6178
The aim is to start the route in December 2020 , says Ministry Speaker Cornelia Holtmann .	-2.9482
Natus sees this as a signpost to support regional but internationally competing companies .	-10.9237
The Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( IHK ) Trier , as suggested by Wissing , is seeking a Rhineland Palatinate label for wine to increase sales in supermarkets and stop the trend of German wine exports , which have been sacking for ten years .	-11.5777
Moreover , knowledge has an open ear for people who want to set up their own company , the IHK praises .	-10.7347
The Trier Chamber of Commerce sees in the new master bonus an additional incentive for young trainees , says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach .	-3.3692
A premium of EUR 1000 is planned for the master test and EUR 2500 if graduates become independent within ten years of master training .	-5.4820
However , the homework list for the country remains long .	-2.4484
In the planned road construction , facts must be created quickly , while the country lacks the necessary personnel , says Jan Glockauer , IHK Trier ’ s main managing director .	-6.7325
Of the 56 new engineers wishing to hire mobility at the state operation , only 29 posts have been filled .	-6.4652
The IHK calls for more orders to be awarded to external off.	-2.9037
CDU group vice Christian Baldauf refers to calculations by the Court of Auditors that the country invests more than EUR 20 million less in maintaining national roads in 2017 and 2018 than proposed .	-4.1268
Frank Natus is also expecting a country ’ s concept of how to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region .	-4.6778
It is also sobering that broadband has been built up to now in the country .	-4.4200
In 2016 , regional companies assessed network supply in an IHK survey only with the note 3.4 .	-3.5813
They complain about falling Internet connections and abortions .	-3.4052
Ex-Economic Minister Eveline Lemke is currently out of politics and still sits on the Supervisory Board of the wind turbine company Pro Wind .	-3.6947
The Green Group left Lemke on April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where , after four months of disagreement , she had already left the field again .	-5.6407
Audi is supposed to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a backlash .	-3.0338
One day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer to upgrade the software to more than 350,000 vehicles .	-2.5004
The BMW chairman said that the company believes that ' there are smarter options than driving restrictions ' , referring to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles .	-3.8776
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .	-1.7492
None of the companies described the undertakings as a call back .	-3.5633
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules on carbon dioxide emissions .	-3.0039
But nitrogen oxides emitting diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma .	-1.7772
The cost of automobile manufacturers to install plants to neutralise emissions from diesel vehicles is also increasing , making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .	-3.8875
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of hatching the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem .	-3.4431
Companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so-called shutdown devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the rules when a car was tested but reduced in normal driving conditions .	-5.5714
In the United States , several Volkswagen employees have been charged , while others are investigated on both sides of the Atlantic .	-3.3378
Last month , the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .	-2.1015
The former manager , Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be tried in the United States .	-2.5651
At the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen , after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circumvent the emission regulations in Europe , and a request focused on the United States has been extended .	-11.7064
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could burden Volkswagen heavily : the luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to the profit of Volkswagen .	-3.3880
This message was sent to the raft on Saturday in the Isar . on Sthe ra. the ra, the , , or the , , , , , , , , , , . ,	-13.1981
The city wants to protect the Isar .	-1.5958
For the Isar visitors to join , tomorrow Saturday a raft passes through Munich , which has a special message .	-4.7271
Whoever pulls the Isar again on Saturday will see a large raft between Flaucher and Reichenbachbrücke .	-5.1782
And this is not a common raft , with Isar tourists .	-2.7097
The building office wants to explain .	-9.2047
On the raft you can see a big information transparent .	-9.0599
It shows a Müllberg .	-2.1663
The start of a public campaign to appeal to Isar visitors .	-3.0431
With the motto " True Love is ... " the understanding of the Isar as a protective wild river should be sharpened .	-4.2298
Last summer the raft went across the Isar and this year there are other actions and measures to achieve a cautious and environmentally aware behaviour .	-5.1727
Mordillo 's nose and laughter against suffering	-3.1380
Mordillo was sometimes one of the most published cartoon drawings , the noses of his figures are his trademark .	-4.0494
Even with 85 the Argentinian still draws and works on a movie .	-3.9955
His message : laugh , " because there is too much suffering in the world " .	-2.1876
Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .	-1.7780
In the first few years as an artist , he saw himself as a drawing for congratulations cards - which frustrated him .	-5.2294
" The happiest day in my professional life was the day when lost in my job , " he once said .	-2.2024
After stations in Lima , New York and Paris , he succeeded in breakthrough in the late 60s : with the release of his cartoons in " Paris Match " and then also in the " star " and other leading magazines around the world .	-4.6086
Even in China , Mordillo found many fans .	-1.2371
Time and again the artist was inspired by cities .	-2.8533
Large , round figures of Mordillo blend in drawings with the Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .	-4.7169
In the early morning , according to his own data , he still sits on the table today , working almost ten hours a day .	-5.0078
Through calendars , puzzles , books for young and old , t-shirts , plushy animals and watches , his rolling figures continue to be widespread worldwide .	-5.1898
For six years he has also been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters .	-4.0186
The main person in the movie " Crazy Island " is a giraffe - Mordillo 's most popular animal in his drawings - which has a thousand fellow as an opponent .	-4.3122
For the first time , his figures speak in the 3D movie , which will be released in 2019 .	-3.7794
" I do not know exactly what they will say it is strange for me , " says Mordillo .	-2.0724
The script is not written by him .	-1.2808
This is why he is more relying on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced wordless .	-4.2061
Lavender from Provence Threatened by Climate Change	-1.6469
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France , but there is a warning that it is threatened with climate change .	-1.9504
The lavender is declining because of drought-reminiscent conditions and insects transmitted by disease , which causes great headaches to scientists and farmers trying to find solutions .	-4.5312
Eric Chaisse , expert of the CRIEPPAM agricultural research institute in Provence , said : " The lavender in Provence is effectively at risk , because in recent years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change , which brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn .	-4.8208
This has an impact on the life of lavender .	-2.5907
There is also a small cicade , a microbacterium that transmits dwarf cicades , and in very dry weather there are many of them ' .	-3.4244
And there is a lot at stake .	-1.7738
Lavender oil not only attracts tourists , it is also very much in demand for perfume and cosmetics .	-4.2662
Eric Chaisse said : " Instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , underdeveloped and either missing or weakened .	-2.8488
So we have fewer parts of essential oil . '	-1.8582
The solutions that are being considered include better water distribution and the slowdown of evaporation from the soil , but also the spraying of plants with a protective mix of sound and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drought .	-4.5882

The murder of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico	-1.9276
The weekly Riodoce staff usually meet Wednesday to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa through organised crime , corrupt officials and continuous drug wars .	-4.0583
But on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .	-2.0147
They have been informed that it is important to change their routines .	-1.7352
Two high-level journalists are discussing what feels safer : they are supposed to bring their children into the office , who were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009 , or leave them at home .	-5.0193
Security experts have written three words on a board on the front of the room : opponents , neutrals , allies .	-2.4075
You ask the reporters to suggest names for each column - no proof is necessary , perceptions and belly feelings suffice .	-3.3395
There are drug smugglers , politicians , businessmen , journalists who are suspected of being on the government or cartels pay list , a catalogue of criminals who make Mexico 's chaos dangerous .	-7.9496
There is no rest from the violence , and , while the entire country is accumulating , more and more journalists are there : at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012 , 589 after attacks and threats under federal protection , and so far there have been at least seven deaths in seven states this year .	-6.0718
Among the latter are their publisher and inspirer of Riodoce , co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas .	-2.9873
" The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , " Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs .	-2.8391
His absence is deeply felt , although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez showing his middle finger with the word " Justice " hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building .	-5.3394
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the reporters discuss their divided themes , the trauma , their nightmares , sleeplessness , paranoia .	-2.7711
Although a special Federal Prosecutor was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists , according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists , it only launched two criminal proceedings .	-4.2483
As with most thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organised crime every year , journalists ’ murderers are rarely brought to j.	-3.2031
At Riodoce , they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa , although they are uncomfortable and even though the terrain is now even more treacherous .	-4.1607
Without information on the murderers , without justice , the meeting has little use to discuss security , Ibarra says .	-3.1038
" It is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , " he says .	-1.7298
'As long as we do not know why , we all distrust . '	-3.3257
In the morning of 15 May , Valdez left the newspaper Riodoce office in the capital of Culiacan .	-5.5181
He only managed to go a few blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men , forced from his car and shot on him 12 times , probably because of the name of the newspaper , which is translated with " Twelfth River " .	-5.3674
The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .	-1.8758
Valdez was 50 years old .	-0.8161
He left a woman and two adult children .	-1.2669
Rumors tend to fly freely around Culiacan .	-1.5536
But on the subject of Valdez there is virtually nothing but silence .	-2.6104
Since Guzman ’ s arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January , Sinaloa has become one of the country ’ s bloodiest battlegrounds , as rival groups are fighting here to fill the vacuum .	-2.9776
Nothing is that in Sinaloa , someone or several people are shot on the streets every day , or that the cemetery is full of decorated , two-storey mausoleums for drug kings , bigger than many houses for the living . the .	-11.5538
Forget for one minute that there is a state of ' calm ' when only one cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States .	-3.7975
Nevertheless , and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work , Ismail Bojorquez ( 60 ) , a co-founder and director of Riodoce , has broken the blame for not being able to protect his friend .	-3.5889
He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder .	-1.1600
First , in February , there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez , a leader of one of the rival antitrust factions in the war with Guzman ’ s sons .	-3.3246
This publication may have annoyed the sons , suspected gang members bought each copy of the issue once it was delivered to newspaper kiosks .	-3.6699
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own security after the confiscation of another newspaper that had published the same story .	-3.2172
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .	-2.0112
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there .	-2.4400
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined together with five colleagues to found Riodoce and sold $ 50 stakes .	-4.7898
In Sinaloa , " it was impossible to conduct journalism without encountering the drugs problem , " said Bojorquez .	-2.8551
Over time , the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .	-2.7931
Reporters loved to publish hard-hitting investigations without fear of censorship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat .	-3.3072
Eight years after Riodoce was founded , she received the prestigious " Maria-Moors Cabot Prize " for her reporting in Latin America .	-3.0425
In the same year , Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in pursuing Mexican drug history wherever she lead .	-3.9522
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid .	-1.3958
" I want to continue living , " he said at the time of the CPJ award .	-2.2678
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa " is a way of life , " he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV .	-2.3334
" You have to take on the task that accidents to you as a journalist - either that or you play the stupid .	-4.8755
I do not want to be asked : ' What did you do in the face of so many dead ... why did you not say what was going on ? '	-3.3729
The Riodoce team misses Valdez , the fun bird who could flee like a port worker , the friend who was generous with embraces and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .	-3.5711
They trusted in his routine .	-1.8084
He would always bear his guard .	-2.2284
He would always go to El Guayabo , the bar opposite the office , and always sit there at the same table .	-2.6058
Now they ask : Was his love for routine his corruption ?	-2.3212
His death has forced them , too , to question their own assumptions about how best to do their work and remain alive . . the the the .	-11.3931
" You don 't like to work with their women , their children , their clean shops , their secret runways " to move drugs .	-3.8248
" These things were not allowed , " said Bojorquez .	-1.6445
The result , even in the best times , is a high degree of self-censorship and self-maintenance .	-2.7448
Trust his own instincts .	-1.4544
If it smells wrong , remain away .	-2.3990
The trouble is , the editor of Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that ' smell is a sense that can be deceived ... and then the matter happened with Javier ' .	-3.8603
The old rules , as he and others say , no longer apply in Sinaloa , just as in Tamaulipas , Veracruz , Guerrero and other states where a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes , weak institutions , and corrupt government officials is at home .	-3.2606
The landscape is constantly changing .	-1.3796
In the space where the Riodoce staff met for security training , no mobile phones were allowed , and days earlier it became known that spyware sold exclusively to governments was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .	-4.9527
Outside , two policemen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 <unk> C ) in the shadow of a tree .	-2.2951
They were responsible for protecting the Riodoce offices in a four-storey building in a middle class district of Culiacan .	-3.5906
Half in joke , some of the reporters wondered whether these officers were among the 50 % of the police officers who the governor himself called untrustworthy .	-3.5539
It has been months since the reporters entered the mountain landscape , where the drug gangs are de facto under control .	-9.3345
For this week 's edition , Riodoce looked at three main stories .	-2.7794
There was the murder of the brother of the former well-known boxer , Julio Cesar Chavez , in Sinaloa . the the . the the . the the the the . the the	-9.2418
They also had an exposé to government spending , focusing on the governor ’ s home town .	-3.5082
And there was a group that kidnapped one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan , a block from the office of the prosecutor .	-3.3041
There was no official word about who was abducted or how it happened , so caution was needed when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favourite place for drug traffickers and authorities .	-3.9120
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party ( PRI ) , which dominated almost all political levels throughout the century .	-3.1014
Recently , several PRI governors were accused of high-calibre cases of corruption .	-2.4497
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this place , including one in which a son of " El Chapo " Guzman escaped a military attack .	-2.9895
Just a few months earlier , readers would have seen the Valdez column as the best informed source of abduction .	-3.5085
" In the past we knew what happened , " said Villarreal , 46 , with the nickname " El Flaco " because of its slim body stature .	-3.7674
'Now all channels of communication with our sources have broken . '	-9.2684
The Valdez office has been turned into a storage space for signs and stickers protesting against the murders of journalists , because the staff have become something they would never have expected : activists in the name of the press .	-4.2661
Reporter Miriam Ramirez snapped a few signs and went to a demonstration the next morning for another journalist to the office of the prosecutor .	-3.9759
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan .	-2.2086
A burned body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests that it is his .	-1.9395
Throughout the country , journalists have become more vocal by writing in organized protests " SOS Press " on footpaths and buildings .	-3.6494
On that day , the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to gather international support for the judiciary in the Valdez case .	-3.6673
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after the assassination of Valdez , Ramirez accused the authorities of spying and killing journalists because they said the truth .	-2.9886
Since then , she has asked for it to be redivided by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity .	-3.7565
Valdez repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were " surrounded " by organised crime , government officials involved in it , and an indifferent society .	-2.7671
In his last book , " Narco-Journalism " , he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs , but also by orders from politicians and security forces who were under a ceiling with organised crime .	-4.6083
Last year , the Articulo 19 Guardian Group assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists to the police and officials .	-3.3302
" In Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth , " said Ramirez .	-2.0430
Obviously , the murders have a deterrent effect .	-1.6202
Nobody forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago .	-1.7097
Your body was found along with a note supposedly signed by the Zetas cartel : ' Here I am because of my reports ' .	-2.9780
A computer keyboard and headphones lay beside their separate head .	-2.2199
Some branches have chosen to close , like the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the assassination of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March .	-2.5281
Others continue , as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of their director in 2004 .	-2.4110
In 2010 , the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drugs cartels with a leading article on the front page with the heading ' What do you want from us ? '	-3.9926
Some journalists have fled their home countries or even from the country .	-2.7834
It is a painful decision .	-0.7923
It is difficult to find work in exile , and they are still watching the streets and looking for dangers .	-2.7288
And sometimes they are hunted , as apparently the photographer Ruben Espinosa , who was murdered in 2015 with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the flight from Veracruz .	-3.3855
For those who are left behind and continue working , it is a daily dance with risky decisions .	-3.6392
Ibarra , who once wanted to be a poet , admits that the drug trafficking is frightening him .	-7.5079
" Mexico goes to hell , and therefore I became a reporter , " he said .	-2.3316
At midnight last Friday , when the last edition was finished , Riodoce ’ s editors sat on the pavement in front of the office and drank beer when all their phones started to sum up .	-11.6960
A number of shootings with band rivals and security forces near the seaside resort Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed deaths .	-2.8736
The war continued to escalate , as promised by a series of cartel messages in the region .	-1.9492
From the boardstone edge they published the news on the Riodoce website via mobile phone .	-3.9890
The front page had to be changed the next day .	-1.8351
Sirens hoot nearby - another shooting in the area .	-3.8249

'How can you just remember to close this , ' said Bojorquez , ' when , on the same day that Javier was murdered , the internship asked me to send her to the street for reporting ' .	-5.2188
Dinosaurs used barrage to evade his enemies	-9.6096
At first glance , it looks like a statue , albeit a terrifying one .	-2.0280
Now researchers have found that the first insights of the incredible nashorn of a Canadian miner have been received so well that experts described it as " Mona Lisa of Dinosaurs " .	-4.0936
It was so good that they could even find that his scaly skin was of reddish brown - and they said that she had had something of a " troubled past " .	-4.5303
The report in the " Current Biology " magazine called it " the best preserved armored dinosaur ever found , and one of the best dinosaurs in the world " .	-3.5558
The fossil is a newly discovered kind of nodosaur living in the middle of the Credit Age between 110 million and 112 million years ago .	-3.6608
His incredibly well preserved state has astonished researchers who describe it as " truly remarkable " .	-3.0440
According to reports in National Geographic , the armored vegetable eater is the best preserved fossil of its kind .	-9.6282
It was found by Shawn Funk when he grubs on March 21 , 2011 at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta , Canada .	-3.1056
He met something that seemed missing from the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely .	-3.5830
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology .	-2.1769
They spent the next six years revealing the wild animal within the 2,500 pound ( 1,100 kg ) heavy earth club .	-3.7549
After all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .	-1.9724
" If you blink a little with your eyes , you might almost believe it has slept , " said the main author Caleb Brown , scientist in the Royal Tyrrell Museum , where the creature can be seen .	-4.0155
'It will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs . '	-3.6005
Researchers have found that , although it is covered with armor and resembles a changing tank , this vegetable eater has probably been threatened by meat-eating dinosaurs .	-4.0727
The heavily armored dinosaur used a red and white carnage to hide from predators , and used a shielding technique known as counter-shade , which is also used by many modern animals .	-4.7674
This would have allowed to mix better into its surroundings and evade its enemies , say experts , suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs .	-4.3864
The 110 million year-old creature from the Nodosaur family made headlines for the first time in May and is now visible in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology .	-3.8622
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell , one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours discovering it carefully .	-2.8614
The amazing preservation of the copy allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and armor over his body .	-2.9576
They discovered countershading , a common defense method in the Animal Empire , which means that the top of the creature was darker than its bottom .	-3.1448
Although counter-shading is common , the results are surprising , because the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of the animals living today .	-4.4578
It suggests that the dinosaur was hunted by enough pressure from meat-eating dinosaurs that evolution favored the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival .	-3.3848
But most contemporary animals that use countershading - remember deer , zebras , or belt animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey , which signals that this nodosaur was subjected to a real struggle for survival .	-4.4058
" Strong predatory behavior on a massive , strongly armored dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the Credit Age must have been , " said Brown .	-4.4442
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was red brown .	-2.1047
Scientists continue to study the animal for references to his life , including his conserved intestinal content , to find out what it eaten as his last meal .	-3.9582
They believe that when dinosaurs died , the dinosaur came into a river and was driven out into the sea , where it fell on its back to the sea bottom .	-4.5033
At that time , Alberta was as warm as South Florida today , and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland than they are today .	-2.9992
" This nodosaur is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin , but also remains in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal , " said Brown .	-4.0218
" The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as in the early cycle period .	-4.2150
They do not need to use much imagination to reconstruct it , and if you just shoot a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it is on sleep . '	-17.3167
The Circle Age was a time when huge theropods , meat-eating dinosaurs , standing on two legs , passed through the earth .	-4.7440
Although the king of them , the Tyrannosaurus Rex , lived millions of years after Borealopelta , the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors .	-3.2022
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus , a 38 feet ( 11.5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monster .	-3.1614
The scientists whose latest findings appear in the Current Biology journal believe that Borealopelta was sank in the sea after death and mummified in mud .	-11.5197
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he grubs at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta , Canada , on March 21 , 2011 .	-3.1994
According to the museum , it is the best preserved armored dinosaur in the world , including skin and armor , and is complete from the snout to the hip .	-3.4470
The creatures averaged about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,300 kg ) .	-2.6173
It contained two 20 inch long peaks that raised its shoulders .	-3.8630
Researchers believe that the armored plant eater was swamped through Western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea .	-3.4695
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur preserved its armor in exquisite detail .	-2.5102
The fossilized remains of this special copy are so well preserved that the remains of the skin still cover hollow tank plates along the dinosaur .	-4.4914
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic , such a level of conservation is as rare as a profit in the lotto .	-2.9665
The more I look at it , the more confusing it becomes .	-1.6950
Stone remains of the skin still cover the hollow tank plates that carry the skull of the animal .	-3.8748
His right front foot is on his side , his five fingers are spread up .	-3.9349
I can count the scales on his sole ' .	-1.3280
In the thunderstorm : mass carambolage on A8 : Many injured	-2.6478
A serious accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carambolage .	-3.5903
There are many injured , kilometre-long congestion and gaffer .	-3.0965
On the highway Stuttgart-Munich ( A8 ) , about 20 people were injured at a mass carambolage at the late Thursday afternoon .	-3.5332
According to the police , around 5.00 p.m. between the connecting points of Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen ( Aichach-Friedberg district ) during a thunderstorm , almost 30 vehicles , including probably lorries , were crawled together .	-5.9989
There was no information about the exact number of injured persons . . the . the the . the the the . the the . the	-8.9366
These are slight to medium-sized injuries , a police spokesman said .	-3.0529
A large number of rescue vehicles were at the point of accident .	-3.6261
The A8 was completely closed to Munich .	-2.7865
In the direction of Munich , a roughly ten kilometre backstall was formed .	-5.5551
As an AZ reporter reports , massive handicaps also occurred on the counter-handicap track - by numerous gaffers .	-6.8908
The fire brigade noted the characteristics of the vehicle drivers , who now have to expect sensitive penalties .	-5.0388
Shortly after 18 : 45 a second accident occurred on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and Dasing .	-2.4486
There was a collision between a car transporter and a car .	-3.1812
A rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident .	-3.0546
Deutsche Bahn : Group tests " Comfort Check-in "	-1.3772
It is a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced : nothing is suspecting you are sitting in the train and sleeping .	-11.7099
Or you are deepened into your work and have just a brilliant thought .	-4.4896
And then : bufff .	-1.1351
Come and wake up a mellow or tear the passenger out of the workflow .	-5.6990
Ticket control .	-1.2370
But the times of interruption are soon over .	-2.3623
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the uncreated control of tickets .	-3.1660
You simply confirm by mobile phone that you take your seat and thus devaluate the ticket .	-4.3336
Currently a test operation runs on two routes .	-3.2513
" If the offer arrives , we extend it .	-3.2804
It will probably be available at the beginning of next year on many other distance traffic routes in Germany , " said a railway speaker .	-3.8853
" Comfort Check-in " calls the railway the ticket devaluation without Schaffner .	-4.1824
In order to use them , however , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or a tablet .	-4.8000
And you have to book an online ticket - what most passengers already do .	-3.8435
It is also necessary to use the App of the Railway that DB Navigator bought , which is the most convenient way to book tickets anyway .	-5.6276
Finally , you need a seat reservation .	-2.5329
Because the " comfort check-in " works like this : you get into the train , call your ticket under " My Tickets " .	-4.3585
A button for electronic devaluation will appear with the test customers .	-3.5630
The train companions receive a notification on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and has taken the booked seat Y .	-11.0035
The train accompanying the ticket controller arrives at Y knows that there is a passenger with an already devalued online ticket .	-6.0529
We can therefore continue to sleep , continue working , remain silent .	-3.9454
The " check-in " has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the railway - which in turn should be used for passengers .	-4.1470
" If you want to travel relaxed without ticket control through our train accompanying personnel , just check in the DB Navigator yourself .	-5.2156
This allows passengers to make their travel time more personalised in the train , " says Michael Peterson , Marketing Board of DB Long Traffic .	-4.5716
Secondly , " And our employees have more time than they do today to respond to individual customer needs " .	-4.0075
Anyone who travels frequently knows that in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket controls are among the biggest annoyances .	-5.0133
Because you often have all the documents you need to devaluate online tickets , but in any case you do not have one of the passengers .	-6.7103
Either the credit card or the identity card is missing , or otherwise a document that you have to present .	-11.3639
The result is endless discussions between train companions and passengers , which leads to poor mood in the department or space and delays in controlling one ’ s own ticket , and ultimately takes time to address other concerns .	-6.6038
Only a small number of test customers can use the new service .	-2.1126
And that only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen .	-3.1118
Other train numbers on the same route are not yet activated .	-3.0129
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question : ' Whose Streets ? '	-2.1580
On 9 August 2014 , Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core .	-2.4916
Only one day after she arrived in New York City , the born in St. Louis sat on the bed of an airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone .	-3.2960
She stumbled over a post of someone from the high school .	-2.5706
" The police have just killed an 18-year-old child and it is still on the street , " said there .	-3.1405
Confused because nobody else posted the information on their feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .	-2.5365
A user with the handle <unk> TheePharoah was constantly retweeted on their timeline .	-3.1003
The rapper from the territory of St. Louis was in the process of live tweeting the death of Michael Brown , an unarmed black 18-year-old killed by a white police officer in Ferguson , Mo .	-9.0582
He posted a picture of Brown ’ s lively body stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours .	-3.8313
" That 's wild , " Ferrell thought .	-2.5883
But death was nothing new for them and their community .	-1.7250
She took her mobile phone to return to tweets in the evening about people on the canfield drive .	-4.0117
There were photos of the police band and people who shouted , and of a man who claimed to be Brown 's father , who carried a shield with the inscription : ' Ferguson 's police just killed my unarmed son ! ! '	-14.9795
She watched a live feed where a policeman stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a beautiful dog .	-3.2028
In another video , she said , another policeman secured his gun and shouted : ' I will kill you ... Animals all ' .	-3.6155
" This is not usual , " Ferrell remembered her statement .	-2.7491
'This is not the kind of murder we have accustomed to and which we can typically call ' .	-3.4656
At this moment I felt shake-frost .	-2.4460
I was angry and crying . '	-1.4603
She booked a return flight and went home the next day .	-1.6136
After landing at 9 p.m. , she picked her 6-year-old daughter out of her father 's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning .	-3.9961
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the following three years is the theme of a new documentary , " Whose Streets ? " , in the cinemas from the 11 .	-3.2011
It is a history of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resilience that exists from the perspective of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers .	-11.2811
When Ferrell went to Ferguson with her daughter , who carried a flower dress and a suitable crown , the two discussed a conversation that they had countless times before this morning » about black experience and black condition <unk> .	-4.8651
" You remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe in ? " she remembered what she said .	-3.2392
" We are now going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that was not right .	-3.2019
I couldn 't take them with me , " said Ferrell later .	-2.6238
" What happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .	-1.9718
It must know and see it and be brought up in it .	-3.5028
It must be well developed , not only activism and organisation , but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution , and what we need to do to be free to liberate ourselves .	-3.9928
Although I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally has no blatant racism , she is no different from the next black woman 's child .	-4.5927
I have the feeling that I would give her a bad service to keep her away from it . '	-3.5168
The first station , when they arrived in Ferguson , was on the South Florissant Road , a place vis-à-vis the police authority , which became a campsite when the activists waited for the possible non-charge of Officer Darren Wilson .	-4.5440
There , Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch .	-3.4071
They prepared bags and helped pass them on to demonstrators .	-2.1328
Slowly a new kind of activism for Ferrell began to take shape .	-1.8485
" My activism changed completely after 9 August , " she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities .	-3.7388
" I had no experience in organizing .	-1.9198
Everything has come . '	-2.0532
Weeks later Ferrell met during an evening demonstration Sabah Folayan , one of the co-directors of the film .	-2.5823
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado Farrar only wanted to " document " what happened .	-2.1259
One question came to Ferrell 's mind : ' Do you want to document or try to find a story you can exploit ? '	-3.5015
This scepticism was fed by countless cases of people , often white , in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience .	-3.7128
As Folayan recently said in an interview : ' We had heard that people born and raised in Ferguson did not center their votes and we wanted to do it differently ' .	-3.8331
Folayan had already cooperated with the then co-director Damon Davis , an artist from the field known for his activism around death tract inmates .	-4.3496
His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project , along with six other locals , followed the team of " Whose Streets ? " in the years after Brown 's shooting .	-3.9681
" This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us , " said .	-3.5719
'That was the main thing for me , as these people are presented , because that is how I will be presented . '	-4.2666
The aim was not to focus on Ferrell 's experience - to show that the movement was " not a Messias leader but a community that meets " , said Folayan - she proved to be the most open participant in the movie .	-4.3480
As a result , documents of " Whose Streets ? " show surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell 's life as she falls in love and her wife marries .	-3.1208
" I felt like naked , " said Ferrell and laughed when she first saw the finished product .	-7.2818
'But I understood that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanisation of black people ' .	-4.1212
Furthermore , Ferrell ’ s history repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement .	-3.1026
Two of the three founders of the movement who , after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 , marked the film " BlacklivesMatter " in social media , identify themselves as gay .	-3.2398
" Black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the overall movement , " said Ferrell , " and so we are constantly fighting on different fronts .	-3.9396
Black , gay women must bear the main burden of everything . '	-2.0079
Folayan agreed to note that " the movement really is maintained by black women and many black women " .	-2.2053
However , she insists that " this is not an affirmative type of action " in which Ferrell was selected as the heart of the film because of her identity .	-3.6575
" She was the person who shaken this energy , " she said .	-2.2589
" It is no coincidence , although she was at the forefront , because there is so much at stake in a life at these crossroads as a black , gay woman .	-4.2633
You can feel their energy through the screen . '	-2.1986
The news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared , but the racial connections between the community and the police remain .	-3.2576
Ferrell is proven for 2 <unk> years due to the blocking of a motorway during a demonstration .	-3.4739
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area , which she calls her home : " A chaos . the the the . the the the the the the . the the	-9.3550
Nevertheless , she clings to a singing and she feels committed to this memory since she went to the streets in Ferguson three years ago .	-4.7270
" It is our duty to fight for our freedom .	-0.9666
It is our duty to win .	-0.9812
We must love and support each other .	-1.4692
We have nothing to lose - except our chains . '	-1.7919
From " Dream " to " Grö<unk>enwahn " : TV readers discuss bit gallery .	-3.1142
The bit gallery moves people , although it is far from being built .	-3.0137
But the idea of a shopping centre on the southern side of the pedestrian zone has divided the population into advocates and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .	-3.7240
Calt leaves the subject hardly one .	-9.6968
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page " Volksfreund Bitburg " .	-2.5376
While some say to the bit gallery : " That would be a dream " ( Anja Becker ) or " That would be really class " ( Nicole Schausten ) , comes from the other side : " Do not a man " ( Siggi Betzen ) or quite simply : " Grö<unk>enwahn ! " ( Lars Scholz ) .	-5.4595
While advocates are relying on a gallery to move more customers into the city , which also benefits the rest of the business , opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will then bleed .	-5.4115
In addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the plot where the farm market hall is located , where 13 direct marketers offer their products .	-4.7528
This will stop at the beginning of the construction work .	-3.8821
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - and to the beda square with possibility to sit outside .	-4.4859
Simone Rooms : " For many years we have been buying in the farm market hall almost weekly .	-3.7489
Mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the rural wives are always very happy .	-5.0809
We also discovered butchery for ourselves .	-2.7315
We would like to see a chance to maintain this offer during and especially after the construction of the gallery .	-3.9726
Other cities also have that .	-3.5392
The small market hall in Frankfurt is particularly interesting . '	-2.1701
Gerd Densing : " Whether direct marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery depends on the amount of the rent .	-3.3643
However , the new project is not likely to be very low . '	-4.9247
Eva Kilic : " Why shopping palaces in Bitburg ?	-10.1592
Whether clothing , shoes , drugs or supermarkets , I find that unnecessary .	-2.8437
There is enough of this in our city .	-3.4222
You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .	-3.4960
However , as there is not even a proper weekly market here , it is all the more important that we at least remain in the market hall .	-11.3211
After all , the goods offered there are fresh , mostly offered directly by the producer and are cheap above all .	-4.9298
As you can see , shops in a shopping centre are only rented by larger companies , because the rents there are often unsustainable for a retailer .	-4.9980
It is a pity that special shops are almost no longer in place and what remains of them will probably disappear . '	-5.9820
Wolf Fandel : " A shopping centre with a market hall does not match me .	-2.6692
And the gallery does not fit into Bitburg .	-2.0714
Above all : Where should the farm market hall go during the construction period ?	-4.3980
The old edeka would be the solution - even in the long term , if the bit gallery actually comes at some point .	-4.3441
Or does the ghost bit gallery manage to distribute all the shops from Bitburg before ? '	-4.5520
George Marquet : " That simply will not work .	-1.9013
And a shopping centre that is empty does not need anyone either .	-3.1735
I think it would have been better to promote a proper farming market rather than this gallery .	-3.2852
But for a farm market hall there is no place anymore , thanks to the madness of many - I think - pointless construction projects in Bitburg .	-5.1192
When the farm market hall is broken , a piece of culture will disappear again . '	-3.2913
An appropriate similarity : Artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA	-12.5136
In the middle of the space of the Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces - white , black and brown , which are almost imperceptible - that hang on cables from the ceiling .	-4.3376
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheeks and hair cuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning .	-2.9391
Manning sent out the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison , where the former intelligence analyst served a 35-year prison sentence after making public diplomatic reports on the WikiLeaks website classified as secret .	-4.8643
The new exhibition opened on 2 August is called A Becoming Resemblance ( A suitable similarity ) .	-2.7134
It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg , whose discipline combined its expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Manning , a transfrau and groundbreaking dissident whose condemnation was converted by Barack Obama when he had only three days in office .	-4.3037
Dewey-Hagborg , through the algorithmic analysis of the DNA , extracted by manning and created 30 portraits of what one might look like with these genomic data , has created a sharp , albeit somewhat intellectual , commentary not only on the form of DNA data - the many ways in which they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also on identity .	-5.2613
Manning , born as Bradley Edward , but has spoken openly about identification as a woman since her puberty , was sentenced in 2013 for 20 charges , including six violations of the law on spy , computer fraud , and theft .	-3.7718
The prison suppressed her image , so much that there was only one photo - a grain , black-and-white selfie , in which manning seats uncomfortably on a driver 's seat and wears a platinblonde wig - with which she was associated .	-5.8116
In 2015 , Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of her 2012 Stranger Visions project .	-2.6722
In it , the artist produced portraits of forensic artifacts such as cigarette tummel and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to create a picture of what these people might look like .	-4.3534
This was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine .	-2.5335
" They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , " explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition .	-3.0381
And she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed , so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .	-3.2848
The artist and her imprisoned muse became unequal letter friends , who replaced several letters over the course of two years .	-4.1284
They even created a comic " Suppressed Images " illustrated by Shoili Kanungo , which predicted a future in which President Chelsea 's judgment would be transformed and able to see the exhibition personally .	-3.7824
The fact that Obama would demand Manning ’ s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas only a few days after the book was released was a welcome kind of happy gathering .	-12.2532
There is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Trump is waging a war against officials from the government camp and against Transgender troops to find new , tweetable ways to further escape the rigid divisions that he should correct .	-5.5646
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about all these things after the strange timing , she said that " things happen for a particular reason " .	-2.6771
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Manning , with her oversized signature , called for an end to " automatic fragmentation , the basis of which was gender , race , sexuality and culture . "	-4.1812
On the opposite wall is its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand fenders of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .	-3.5920
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show how astonishingly similar , at least in biological terms , we are all , by incorporating the 200 letters ( or nucleotides according to the advanced scientific lexicon of the artist ) .	-10.1931
" What people will hopefully take with them is that our genome does not care about who we are and how open genetic data are for an interpretation and how subjective they are , " said Dewey-Hagborg , whose video work of 2007 , Spurious Memories , is also visible .	-4.1309
'DNA data can tell so many different stories , so that is 30 of these stories . '	-2.5725
The last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in its own room , is a page from the above mentioned comic novel .	-3.7858
She shows Manning how she appears with a free speaker phone in her hand from the disciplinary barracks of the United States like King Kong .	-4.3964
" If they cold your speech , then they have won , " says .	-3.9092
" So never stop the mouth " .	-2.0002
" It came directly from a letter she wrote to me , " said the artist greeting from Philadelphia .	-2.4263
'I still get goose when I talk about it ' .	-3.7840
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition personally - as anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do so , she will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks , by her own genomic simulacres , which are united like hordes of protesters .	-5.7236
This was also targeted , like everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 " 2 , mannings stature ) in which their genetic haplo groups were written with pencil .	-4.2361
" In the past I had it on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , " said Dewey-Hagborg of the portraits .	-2.4332
" I wanted it to feel like a mass movement formed with Chelsea , like the movement that was also behind their liberation . "	-3.0953
Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of the University of Oxford sought for killing	-3.2030
A nationwide human hunt is under way for a professor at Northwestern University and an Oxford University employee , who are sought as suspects after a man was stopped in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries .	-5.4361
On Monday , Wyndham Lathem ( 42 ) and Andrew Warren ( 56 ) issued arrest warrants for murders because of their alleged participation in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau , as shown by the acts of the Cook County Official Court .	-4.0961
The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau , 26 , died after several stitches .	-2.0880
A Community warning system published by the police authority in Chicago states that the body was discovered on 27 July .	-2.5440
Officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .	-2.5880
Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead in the place of event , and detectives investigate the stitch as murder , while the police actively search for the two suspects , officials said .	-4.3876
Lathem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007 .	-2.0433
Alan K. Cubbage , Vice-President of University Relations , said in an e-mail statement that Lathem has now been left in and excluded from entering the campus of Northwestern University .	-3.9202
" This is now a criminal matter investigated by the competent authorities , and the Northwestern University cooperates in this investigation , " said Cubbage .	-3.1618
Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford .	-1.4813
A university and Somerville College spokesman said in an email statement that ' we are in contact with the British police and ready to help the US investigation authorities in every possible way ' .	-4.0814
The statement added that Warren 's colleagues were shocked and want him to stand .	-8.5484
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Authority , Anthony Guglielmi , said that he urges the suspects to face up to the authorities .	-2.9551
" The police have an idea of their place of residence , and our efforts to localize them are stepping up , " said Guglielmi .	-3.3431
Guglielmi said that local , regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects .	-1.7029
Guglielmi said that the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received an enigmatic tip that said that something had happened in apartment 1008 .	-3.6947
The police described the scene as very cruel .	-1.1190
Guglielmi said that it is unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July .	-2.2627
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building .	-1.9465
" We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship , " said Guglielmi .	-1.6617
The Grand Plaza management team published a statement to the inhabitants : ' The police are currently working on the time axis and the background of the victim and are exploring a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident ' .	-4.1153
'We will complete the WADA road map in the near future ' - Russian Vice-Prime Minister Mutko	-2.5334
Russian Vice Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that it will not take long for the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) to be implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency ( RUSADA ) to be implemented .	-3.0258
" At a certain stage of compliance with the criteria of the road map , RUSADA has received the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD ( UK Anti-Doping ) .	-3.4022
The WADA road map has been updated in this regard , " said Mutko on Thursday .	-2.4280
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA timetable for compliance with the code , which describes the criteria for reinstating RUSADA and was recently published on the organization 's website .	-3.5861
According to Mutko , it contains nothing that could give Russia cause for concern .	-2.1480
" Everything has been announced , everything is being implemented .	-2.1659
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and WADA in the near future , " he added .	-1.8422
However , one of the criteria mentioned in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport .	-3.7226
As regards the matter , Mutko said : ' We are carrying out the investigation , because our anti-doping system has admitted a mistake .	-9.1627
All measures have been implemented .	-1.2581
But there were no state programmes and we will not admit anything that does not exist . '	-3.0584
Mutko ’ s words coincided with those of Vitaly Smirnov , head of the independent Russian anti-doping commission .	-2.7166
At the beginning of the day , Smirnov added problems to the past to Russian anti-doping organisations , but then added : " We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .	-4.3998
Nobody intends to accept this report unconditionally , " added Smirnov .	-2.3486
RUSADA was excluded from carrying out doping controls in Russia in November 2015 in the wake of the doping scandal .	-2.9834
However , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping ( UKAD ) .	-2.1858
After a visit to the headquarters of the organization in Moscow in July , WADA Director-General Olivier Niggli declared that RUSADA is " moving in the right direction " to be reinstated .	-3.2767
For now , Aldi no longer sells eggs .	-9.5091
The group of companies told us this .	-4.1820
It was a purely precautionary measure , and no health impairment could be assumed , as the communication says .	-6.2398
From now on , only eggs are likely to be delivered to Aldi , which have been demonstrably negatively tested on fipronil-containing anti-lubricants .	-5.6120
Aldi wants to make clarity and transparency with its customers .	-3.3214
The start-ups that will help your company not to become the next Uber .	-3.3021
Amy Errett wanted to measure happiness with your employees in your e-commerce start-up , but surveys did not work .	-3.4893
Answers were often vague , little helpful or , worse , fraudulent .	-2.3162
And even if you promised anonymity , some workers did not dare the process .	-1.6926
" There was simply never consistency and objectivity , " said Errett , who runs the 75 person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care company Madison Reed .	-2.5388
She has called for help from outside .	-10.6662
A new breed of Human Resources Start-ups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel .	-2.7999
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee commitment , it enables companies to conduct surveys , address specific groups and demographic groups , provide employees with anonymity and complaint hotlines , and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass the C-Suite executives and directly contact the Board of Directors .	-4.7338
" You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit to track your health , but where is the fitbit for your company ? " said Jim Barnett , co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee commitment .	-3.3470
Saved said that they gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint .	-2.7522
In addition to the snap surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat card from the company that shows at a glance what units most complaints have and which executives have low consent results - so you can drill why .	-4.8090
Companies come to realise that they must remain at the top of the workplace culture , so that you do not become the next Uber involved in scandals since a former employee published a blog post describing an environment of harassment where those who spoke were punished .	-5.1988
For start-ups like Glint , this desire for an overview is a lucrative business option .	-2.5689
The global governance , regulation , and compliance industry could have more than $ 118.7 billion in 2020 , according to the Let 's Talk Payments financial site .	-2.8583
Denver , Colorado , Start-up Convercent , which helps companies prevent and recognize bad behavior , saw a rising interest and activity in the midst of the Uber case in discredit earlier this year .	-3.7927
Convercent has almost 600 clients , including Airbnb , Microsoft and Tesla .	-1.5742
Uber registered as a client recently .	-9.1774
Like Glint , Convercent allows companies to send tailor-made " pulse " surveys , collect confidential answers in real time , and view the heat cards of your problem areas .	-9.6634
It also provides an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior .	-3.0684
And if the main manager is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .	-2.9087
" The court of public opinion has recorded the regulators , " said Patrick Quinlan , the founder and managing director of Convercent .	-2.7849
When a company is found that treats its employees poorly or behaves unethically , it can experience expensive consequences from consumer boycott , worker fluctuation and complaints , Quinlan said .	-4.2337
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations , has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to reach their headquarters .	-3.7084
Earlier , when an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or e-mail for the headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .	-3.8012
It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vitrano , Ruby Tuesdays 's General Counsel , who said that there was no good way to follow the complaints of employees .	-3.7113
Now that the company uses Convercent , problems previously hidden by executives sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , harassment or unfair practice - can be identified and addressed more quickly .	-4.6044
" I can get closer to this holistic , 360-degree view of employment , " said Vitrano , who heads Ruby Tuesday 's risk management group .	-4.3930
'And we protect our shareholders from employment disputes ' .	-2.4938
Companies began to take ethics , values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 , after the accounting company Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations by the Enron scandal , said Quinlan .	-3.3642
But it took until the " social media came to their right " that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry from going online .	-3.4092
" Before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , " he said .	-1.4582
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service and charge companies recurring fees for the use of their products .	-9.3583
It is a business model and an opportunity that will find the approval of Venture Capital investors who have both supported start-ups .	-4.1063
Convercent received $ 10 million in February funding from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital , raising the total capital to $ 47 million .	-3.1207
Glitzern secured $ 10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners and brought its entire funding to $ 60 million .	-3.0309
These investments are hardly surprising , given the interconnected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .	-2.4714
There is a growing complex of research showing that today ’ s employees expect more from their jobs than they have done so far .	-3.7605
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley , high salaries and interesting projects are only operations .	-2.8439
The employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .	-3.3834
" If people are happy to be in a company , feel their votes , and that the work you do is worth , then they feel more committed to making this company successful , " said Nina McQueen , Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn , which uses both Convercent and Glint .	-3.9253
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies are running well , and companies are running well when employees are engaged and committed .	-5.2719
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase commitment and employee commitment , it is no wonder that you will find support .	-4.1900
The data on employee commitment according to the experts of the workplace culture important .	-3.5883
But the data are useless if the managers of a company do not take action .	-3.0377
In fact , when a company asks staff for your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way .	-3.8931
And if change does not come quickly enough , or at all , it can breed disappointments and demotive employees .	-4.9748
" If you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be prepared to have 4,000 conversations , " said Russell Raath , President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kotter International , who has seen companies that have relied too much on collecting data .	-4.2072
" For if you do not follow staff will ask themselves , " Did you really hear me ?	-3.5168
Are you concerned about this ?	-2.0971
Who you are not concerned about , why should I ? '	-3.3409
Madison Reed , who is now conducting monthly employee surveys , was able to take action the same day when a problem is reported about Glint , saved .	-3.7850
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees , it was able to reorganize several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems .	-3.8377
At Ruby Tuesday , the company gets new insights about its employees , and it hopes that in the long term , this will lead to a better bond of workers in an industry known for high sales .	-5.4746
" If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , " said Vitrano .	-2.3032
" And if you lose people , you also lose customers .	-1.6717
And if you lose customers , you will lose business .	-2.4659
The NCAA eliminates two-day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins .	-2.7671
It goes to 23 p.m. when a lot of UCLA football players talk on one side of the team 's new practice fields on the campus .	-5.6353
Some have pulled out their tricot parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .	-3.9987
For a good part of the team , these inactive minutes are a lunch break .	-3.2287
Players registered for the summer courses will return to their final exams after the three-hour exercise before returning to the Wasserman Football Center at 6 : 30 a.m. the next morning .	-11.5397
" This is a real treat mill for the guys the next three days , " said Bruins coach Jim Mora just before Monday became Tuesday .	-3.4754
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to facilitate the burden of players , and it has actually extended its days - at least until the final on Friday .	-3.8941
Therefore , the first three UCLA training sessions should begin at 19 : 15 in order to meet the already packed timetables of the players .	-5.6170
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the bruins postponed the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season , and for the first time during the summer school six times in Westwood .	-4.6295
During August 18 exercises will be held , 20 before the formal preparations for their start against Texas A & M in September .	-5.1072
Mora said that he supports the NCAA change , even if they add another point to players ’ busy routes .	-4.9982
" We put this enormous burden on them three or four days , and it is very challenging , " said Mora .	-2.3651
" And they have just pushed it through , they continue to plague , they are great people .	-4.7794
I think that as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will really be great . '	-3.5902
UCLA will end its practices once the camp has finished , which will not be an easy task , given the clear visibility lines of its fields , from a neighbouring parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center , a hotel of the upper class , which has already been thrown with footballs that cleared a protective network behind a peat post .	-7.3452
Bruins players are supposed to occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mora admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .	-3.7479
" We will use our security , " said Mora .	-1.8141
" This is a real problem and it is not far-fetched to think that people rent a room there and then prepare to record an exercise there .	-4.0479
If you have the video band of an exercise , it is pretty good business . a .	-13.2988
But we have security forces there , and we have security forces in parking 8 .	-2.0755
We will do the best with what we have .	-1.4066
I am not therefore very concerned .	-2.4801
We have a plan . '	-1.0273
Facebook intends to intensify factual review in the fight against counterfeit messages .	-2.9464
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false messages to third-party fact-reviewers and then display their results under the original article , said the world ’ s largest online social network on Thursday , one of its efforts to combat so-called fake news .	-5.5350
In an opinion on its website , the company said that it will begin using updated machine learning methods to identify possible false messages and send them to fact-reviewers who may display the results of the fact-review from the original article .	-5.5905
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news , many of which believe that they have also influenced the 2016 US presidential election .	-2.8225
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with French voters flooded with false stories in the run-up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan for punishing social media networks if they fail to eliminate hateful postings as they did before the September elections .	-15.0200
On Thursday , Facebook , in a separate statement in German , said that a test of the new facts review will be launched in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany .	-12.6880
" Besides knowing which stories are contested by fact-reviewers of third parties , people want more context to make sound decisions about what they read and share , " said Sara Su , product manager for Facebook messages in a blog .	-4.1601
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the " related article " and work on other changes to his news feed to reduce wrong messages .	-3.3632
Creating a comic novel : A castle in the history of England	-1.9618
In his recent past , the small Scotney Castle was shown in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s .	-3.4199
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cosy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes , a mophaarian Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents .	-3.6982
" I think it is so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years , " he says horribly .	-8.5380
'What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand ' .	-2.1355
" A Castle in England " spans the time from the Middle Ages to the Age of Edward and documents the families living in Scotney .	-3.5483
It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive : he wrote 2014 ' Dead Men 's Teeth and Other Stories ' , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly emotional .	-3.0903
" I only reacted to the thumb print on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700s working for the Jacobiners , " he says .	-4.0141
" This is his thumb print !	-3.0106
And letters always smell of smoke , for at that time a fire was lit because of light .	-3.4343
For someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if it were there .	-3.5081
Oh , I love archives ! '	-1.3143
For someone who has been beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle almost four months ( " To be honest : I have a little overvalued my welcome " ) , this seems to be all too nice to be true .	-5.6095
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian " new " castle , looking through the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle , such as the mounted heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the grave .	-4.2490
He walked through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle and talked to landscape maintainers , gardeners and sometimes also to the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .	-4.3031
Then , at night he drank " Whiskey and began to write " .	-2.4024
The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown , as the National Trust only gained full access in 2006 , when the last heir , Elizabeth Hussey , died .	-3.3403
When Rhodes arrived a decade later , the employees just began to look after the archive he described as " hundreds of years when aristocrats said " Oh , throw it on the attic " .	-12.5685
Diaries , letters from the time of the English Empire , maps that represent who possessed what : " You might think that land conflicts would be boring , " says Rhodes , " but there was a birch to which two families fought .	-4.0252
Guys , let everything go ! '	-2.9670
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive into English history on a broader basis , including ' The Labourer ' , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the 1381 farmer uprising .	-4.3813
" There is a record of a turmoil that occurred in the castle in 1380 , in this book entitled ' Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex ' , says Rhodes .	-2.4928
" The farmer uprising began in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start .	-3.2214
Perhaps the two are linked ? '	-2.2784
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle , such as ' The Priest ' , which tells the history of the Jesuit patron that the Darrell family hidden for seven years during the English Reformation .	-4.3453
Or ' The Smuggler ' , in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell was represented from the 18th century , who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones ( a discovery that was only made years later when his coffin was excavated ) .	-4.0336
The Darrells are Rhodes ' favorite family of Scotney : " The lords seemed to be fairly palatable , constantly debt and spend money on things they could not afford .	-5.4041
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marriing rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well-looking boys , with a talent to advertise heirs . '	-3.7767
After the end of his deployment in the castle , Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experience .	-9.9776
He has brought a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämäki , the site of a sanatorium from the early 20th century , which has since been reclaimed by nature .	-5.0035
But Scotney has a special place for him .	-1.4404
" I was sad to go again , " he says .	-1.3763
It was like : ' Oh , now I have to deal with the damned life ' .	-3.5231
Started campaign : More than 300 years old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf covered up !	-11.7887
With the covering of the 301-year-old Marian Chapel in Rhöndorf , the city of Bad Honnef launched its campaign on Friday to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Thursday circuit ) .	-5.0726
By Thursday , mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and slogan secret .	-2.8879
At the end of August there will be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth as the highlight of the campaign .	-3.3946
" Too Beautiful for us .	-8.5565
Or ? " , the actors of the action since yesterday asked on the posters at the Rhöndorf Chapel .	-4.2007
" We don 't think this ( of course ! ) really " , write it on their website activated yesterday .	-3.9848
" But we use this measure to attract your attention .	-1.8790
And to make it clear that some are better than it seems .	-2.5177
Basically , we are firmly convinced that we , as Bad Honnefer , know citizens well about the beauty and attractiveness of our city . '	-3.9174
The action is more than " just " a logo and a slogan , it is said .	-10.2261
" It is important to formulate a single promise , one that gives the city a unique unique attitude " .	-4.9145
After all , they compete with other municipalities .	-1.9904
The city of Bad Honnef can taste a middle five-digit amount of its new roof brand and campaign .	-3.9358
Military Reform in Turkey - Erdogan 's Fear of the Army	-1.9068
Every year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( YAS ) in Ankara advises on retirement and promotion in the Officer Corps .	-3.5909
This week too .	-2.1494
At first glance a normal process .	-1.7147
But nothing is routine with the Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt .	-2.2078
The meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff , as in the past , but in the office of the Prime Minister .	-3.6051
The five Vice-Prime Ministers and the Ministers for Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs have now taken part in the discussions under the chairmanship of the Head of Government .	-4.2460
Thus , the civilians in the YAS were in the vast majority .	-4.1353
The government is attracting the reins in the military .	-2.4507
Head of Staff , Hulusi Akar remains in office , but the commanders of the army , the air force , and the navy were deposed .	-4.3356
Since the failed coup , Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals .	-2.2376
More than 10,000 soldiers have been removed from the army ranks , mostly because of alleged connections to the exile preacher Fethullah Gülen , who Erdogan sees as the wire driver of the coup attempt .	-4.7991
There have been negotiations in Ankara this week against 486 people who should have been directly involved in the coup attempt .	-4.3837
The day after the coup , Erdogan described the attempt to overthrow as a " God 's Gift " because he gave him the opportunity to " clean the armed forces completely " .	-6.1235
But does Erdogan really have the army under control ?	-2.6343
At the end of February , the newspaper " Hürriyet " published an article entitled " Unease in the Military Headquarters " .	-2.8196
There are concerns in the General Staff about the increasing " Islamisation " of the army , which manifest itself , among other things , in the lifting of the ban on soldiers , the newspaper wrote .	-5.5889
In any case , large-scale purification by the army and the security forces continues .	-3.7412
In mid-July , Erdogan fired a further 7395 state servants , including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers .	-3.9415
It seemed that Erdogan tamed the military .	-1.9498
The generals used to be regarded as the real masters of the country .	-3.8950
Three times they swept on their role as guardians of the secular order of the state .	-5.2552
Following his 2002 election victory , Erdogan pushed back the military ’ s power step by step , not least by invoking the European Union ’ s reform targets .	-4.6647
Former officers say that Erdogan is targeting Islamization of the armed forces .	-3.1012
In the magazine " Vocal Europe " , a nominally unnamed officer who sought asylum for the coup attempt for fear of persecution abroad , warned that the Turkish army would be " full of extremists and salafists " in a few years ' time .	-5.2375
If so , such a development could not leave NATO cold .	-3.2741
There is no doubt in the Alliance , after the cleansing , about the Turkish army 's willingness to .	-4.8573
The leadership structures and operational skills are " weakened " , say NATO diplomats .	-2.4598
Washington changes the Green Card rules	-1.8149
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Trump , quoted by the media .	-2.0497
It provides for a reduction of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stricter rules for obtaining visas for temporary work permits and restrictions on family oriented visas .	-3.7673
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the president .	-8.5943
The bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .	-2.3769
" This law will reduce poverty , increase wages , and save billions of dollars for taxpayers , and will do so by changing the way the US spends Green Cards to citizens from other countries . "	-2.9675
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .	-1.3579
This new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English , who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , " said Trump , quoted by the American media .	-3.2786
Ministry wants to repair track for racetrack shuttle	-3.8871
Time and again over the past few months , the future of the racetrack shuttle had been confronted - now it should go very quickly .	-6.8570
Before the end of the year , we are planning to build on the marody route on which the tourist railway runs .	-12.4695
In order to secure the future of the racetrack shuttle in the long term , according to the Ministry of Transport , construction work will begin this year .	-5.1017
" With the decision to continue ordering and rehabilitating the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route , the country commits itself to this connection , particularly important for tourism , " said Secretary of Transport Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt .	-6.1179
The cost of repairing the route was about EUR 2.5 million .	-3.1601
Of this sum , the country accounts for 75 % .	-3.2374
The contract , on the basis of which the shuttle will continue to be ordered by the country in the future , is currently being finalised , declared Sühl .	-4.8690
The Ministry and the South Thuringia Railway as operators are already agreed on the technical details .	-2.8467
" This negotiates the timetable , the vehicles used and the quality standards " , said Sühl .	-3.0884
The planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be concluded for a period of 11 years .	-10.8502
This will regularly order the racetrack shuttle on December 2017 .	-3.5208
The Rennsteig-Shuttle is a popular railway connection between the railway stations Ilmenau and Rensteig .	-4.4034
In recent months , a pilot operation has tested whether the route is being used by enough people to order it regularly in the future .	-4.8549
The route is also highly unfair in parts .	-4.0994
The rise of sex robots is real , and we should worry about it .	-2.2020
Just when you thought that it cannot become even more crazy in 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots comes .	-4.3050
Yes , indeed .	-1.0501
Sex robots are currently a big thing .	-2.0605
Recently , the Foundation for Responsible Robotics ( FRR ) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years .	-1.8586
According to Noel Sharkey , emerited professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR , we must begin to take their rise seriously .	-2.4205
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its form of chest black and the type of fingernail .	-3.0559
'People make themselves funny about them , but companies deliver a lot of it , and we will see it much more frequently , ' said Mr Sharkey in publishing his new report .	-5.1867
Modern sex puppets have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with deliberately human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence .	-3.3194
The user can also " customize " his robot according to his convictions and choose everything from the eye color of the robot to the shape of the chest warts to the type or color of his finger nails .	-5.4653
But it becomes even more disturbing because many robots have the " personalities " that would make a Stepford woman look progressive .	-3.5304
Modern sex puppets have become robots with a silicone skin .	-1.7928
For example , the RealBotix robot allows users to adapt their robots to the characteristics they find attractive , such as shyness . the the the the robothe robot . the the the the the . the the the the the	-9.2292
And then there is the Roxxxy Gold Sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as " Frigid Farrah " , which gives the impression of shyness and " Wild Wendy " with an " adventurous " personality .	-4.1744
" Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is as well adapted to your personality as possible , " swarms the website of True Companion .	-3.3764
So she likes what you like , and she does not like what you do not like , etc .	-2.3161
During the day she also has her moods - just like real people !	-11.0497
It can be tired , fixed on conversation , or it can be ' in mood ' !	-9.0308
There are many worrying aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relations - but the submissive female characteristics that allusions to rape when taking a step towards Frigid ( that is , reluctant ) Farrah worry one most .	-5.0182
On his website compared True Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator , but for men .	-1.9289
" If women ( sic ) can have a vibrator , why can men not have Roxxxy ? " says the site .	-3.5802
However , these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy .	-2.4803
Their emergence and their increasing refinement indicate something darker and lower in our culture , a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with subjugation as an optional addition .	-3.9590
Most men will , of course , not hold sex robots , and while the FRR notes its rising popularity , they remain on the brink of consumer culture for the time being .	-4.1055
But what leaks through the peripheral zones can be very instructive in the spirit of the time in which we live .	-3.5893
And many people are not strange or offensive until the free market gives them permission to do so .	-2.4000
There is a certain overlap that these advanced sex robots emerge at a time when women ’ s rights are under threat worldwide , when there is a president in the White House who has boasted that women have been sexually attacked .	-5.1503
The most deterrent aspect of the television series ' The Handmaid 's Tale ' ( ' The Report of the Magd ' ) is not the graphic images , the swallowed body and the eyes spotted , but how realistic this vision works .	-5.2759
The Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment this does not feel like a big leap .	-2.8620
The aim behind these sex robots is to make a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as possible ( albeit with porn star proportions ) .	-2.7846
Their builders want them to feel human , to emulate the movement of a real body .	-12.4498
But , to the point when it comes to their ' personalities ' , the robots are not real women .	-3.8575
You cannot separate yourself from your companion or simply go away .	-9.5065
They have no conciliation or background history , nothing that suggests independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total submission .	-3.4584
In other words , they are pleasant slaves .	-1.6680
Or , to put it in the 2017 speech : Service girls	-3.8151
Trump ’ s Great Performance ?	-1.4282
He makes Mitt Romney the embodiment of common sense .	-2.2325
It has become a wisdom of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarized the US electorate have also split small families .	-3.7758
Around Christmas and Harvest Festival , there have been newspapers in the US with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump ’ s electing relatives .	-3.6871
We are all allegedly striving to let our filter bubbles burst .	-2.8452
Less noticed has Trump ’ s power to bring together families .	-2.4799
I mention this because my cousine , a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Republicans in our family , visited me this week in New York .	-3.1816
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .	-1.7365
With Trump in the White House , anyone she knows , including the Republican kinship she had fought with for decades for politics , is suddenly and very peculiar on the same side .	-3.8696
This is certainly a good thing around the dining table , but it strikes me in another context that this also entails considerable risks .	-4.1641
The left has been strengthened by Trump , but the distorting effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right .	-3.2006
When we talk about " normalization " and Trump , we refer to the cruel possibility that one day his mothers will no longer repudiate us .	-4.6150
But there is an even more appalling long-term scenario , in which Trump “ normalizes ” right-wing republicans , suddenly seemed to be an embodiment of sensibility compared to his standards .	-4.7247
Today , I find myself affected by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney ’ s original version of the crazy – the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax declaration looked ) – both of which , in fact , occur as a very mild crime compared to Trump .	-6.4816
When Trump goes , the Republican ’ s next candidate must be intellectually healthy only to qualify as an immense improvement .	-3.6922
When my cousine was in the city , we brought our children to Carussell in Central Park , the largest of the carousels in the New York Park Department , and the best three dollars to spend in the city if you don 't need a caffeine .	-4.8145
The horses are enormously large , the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are crunchy and the animals twist to watch their own shoulders with fear - extremely dark and the climbing music conveys this in a strange way .	-5.5540
So many clichés disappoint a city : the views of high buildings become old , the skylines become familiar to offer a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city does not live up to the dream .	-3.5885
Thirty-five years later , and I am still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a great roundabout in the north of London .	-4.0011
However , the Central Park carousel is still a strange magical experience , as there are two two-year-old , 11-year-old and two women in the 40s and all have a great time .	-5.5988
If I could have assessed the carousel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately nobody asked for it .	-3.2990
On the other hand , I was forced this week in a department store to evaluate my " experience " with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before going through my credit card .	-3.6439
In the coffee house on the corner of my street , it is the same , plus the option to synchronize the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something over the shop .	-4.3869
This not only slows down what should actually be a neutral exchange , but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no need is required .	-3.7847

Oscar Pistorius transferred chest pain from prison to hospital	-3.1448
Pistorius left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time .	-2.1997
Last year , he was brought to hospital for the treatment of cuts to his wrists , according to the prison authorities , after a case in his cell .	-4.2092
Pistorius was convicted of murders following an appeal by prosecutors against a first death sentence .	-4.5152
He killed Steenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine 's Day 2013 by launching her several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria .	-3.4721
Pistorius claimed that he considered his girlfriend to be a night invader hiding in the cabin .	-3.1855
Public prosecutors have announced their intention this time to appeal against Pistorius 's six-year prison sentence , which they say is too indulgent .	-4.1276
The National Criminal Prosecution Authority said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the objection could be heard this year .	-3.6620
Pistorius runs the risk of his punishment being increased to 15 years if prosecutors are successful .	-3.1481
There is no death penalty in South Africa .	-0.7769
As a farmer Arnold finds a strange egg .	-2.7402
Last of the Blumberg schools , the fourth graduates from feet and Eppenhofen were released into holidays and secondary schools .	-5.4598
Three of the redundancies will go to school in the future , four to the real school .	-5.0028
School Manager Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürgerhaus Biesental in Epfenhofen on Tuesday evening .	-3.1775
As a symbol of school redundancy , the 29 students of the four classes led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder chose a young eagle who grew up in the Hühnerhof but then is released into freedom .	-4.5385
In addition , the munterer Schar performed a musical entitled " Der Eagler im Hühnerhof " .	-5.5421
Farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and let it burst from his chickens .	-3.6930
Instead of a chicken a small eagle came out .	-2.1890
But the hope of making a chicken out of it disrupted , the eagle spread its wings and decided on a high mountain .	-5.4043
Then the classes showed three and four in the classes of Yvonne Frank a chicken dance .	-3.6753
The hens danced with the young gockels who carried cylinders to bet . . the . the , the . the , , , , ,	-9.0878
The eagle stands for integration , said school leader Angelika Sitte .	-2.2252
The young animal is different from the other young animals ( chicks ) , but they are part of it .	-10.1621
But he will never be like a chicken .	-1.5348
Its purpose is to be free .	-2.1729
She wanted every fourth classmate to feel accepted in his new school .	-4.4195
Thank you to the colleagues , the former head of school , Michael Müller , who repeatedly jumps in on teaching bottlenecks and parents .	-6.6299
The chicken season is now over , explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher .	-2.9852
She released her students after two years of teaching very reluctantly , because it was a really great time .	-4.6851
Finally , she could rely on the fourth classmates .	-4.9061
In conclusion , all students made a song of summer time and holiday .	-13.1889
There was a great deal of pleasure among children .	-10.3230
Eight first classmates are already registered for the new school year .	-2.7157

In the morning of 1 August , a group of illegally tending people was arrested in Sithonia , including the two Bulgarians .	-9.4521
On the same day they were released while an investigation is currently under way .	-3.2340
The Foreign Ministry reported bTV that the Bulgarians were released later .	-1.9045
The Greek authorities have exacerbated control of the free camp and impose substantial fines on anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose .	-3.9214
The controls are continued throughout the season .	-9.5671
The Ministry said that the Court can impose a fine .	-1.9503
Software Update for Diesel Vehicles : What those affected need to know now ?	-8.4539
How exactly does the software update take place ?	-1.7932
Do diesel drivers need to participate in the action ?	-2.4085
The most important questions and answers overview .	-8.7897
At the Diesel Summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars .	-2.7969
They are intended to improve the exhaust gas behaviour of cars in the emission classes Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 .	-3.7273
Euro 4 diesel or worse are excluded .	-1.8454
Anja Smetanin of ACE Auto Club Europa gives assessments :	-2.6831
Is the new action compulsory ?	-1.3120
No , the negotiated software updates are voluntary .	-1.4600
" The obligatory updates previously apply only to vehicles that have fuselage software , " says Anja Smetanin .	-3.6770
The Federal Authority for Car Transport ( KBA ) has ordered its retrofitting .	-4.4482
How and when will customers be informed about updates ?	-2.5351
Manufacturers have announced rapid implementation in the coming months , but have not yet given a precise date .	-3.9435
Daimler has announced that he will write to everyone concerned .	-4.0178
If an inspection is due in any case , it will be done within the scope of the in.	-4.0121
How long will the overall conversion take ?	-3.5672
" Hard to say " , says Smetanin .	-2.4945
This depends on manufacturers ' commitment and political pressure .	-3.0937
'Because we have seen that car manufacturers are not acting voluntarily on the subject of the environment ' .	-4.0669
How long should the update take ?	-1.5056
The conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .	-2.7801
It could be more time to get an appointment .	-3.4549
What do drivers who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group do ?	-2.3608
The ACE advises to wait .	-2.2559
Probably foreign manufacturers would follow , Smetanin said .	-3.6211
Is there a massive drop in the price of Euro 4 cars ?	-3.2410
The ACE fears this .	-1.5004
But it is precisely in the regions where driving bans are threatening .	-3.1044
There have been no loss of value for older diesel in rural areas .	-3.1744
The ACE advises to wait for a sale .	-2.4591
LL Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award	-1.3697
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington .	-1.4653
The first prize award under President Trump promises to become political .	-2.4435
One of the winners does not want to come - out of protest .	-2.5587
LL Cool J ( 49 ) is the first rapper to receive one of the prestigious Kennedy Center awards .	-2.8263
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday , this year also singer Gloria Estefan ( 59 ) , Lionel Richie ( 68 ) and choreographer Carmen de Lavallade ( 86 ) and TV producer Norman Lear ( 95 ) are among the honors .	-3.6416
The awards will be given at the beginning of December .	-2.3368
Traditionally , US President Donald Trump will host a reception and join his wife Melania in the award .	-3.2046
Therefore , Lear , the winner of the progressive TV series , announced that he would not participate in the gala .	-5.7991
He said to the ' New York Times ' : ' This presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even withdraw the funds - and that burdens me ' .	-5.3667
The 59-year-old Estefan stressed that she will use the conversation with Trump to make her view clear .	-3.4947
The Kennedy Centre , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital .	-2.3223
Prize winners include Meryl Streep , Aretha Franklin , Robert De Niro , George Lucas , Tom Hanks and Sting .	-2.1894
We make the city worth living .	-1.9529
Roland Wacker , Haslach ’ s city builder , will retire next year .	-3.2942
The job is already advertised , but suitable candidates are rare .	-3.9265
Wacker has been a city builder for 31 years .	-2.9689
And the work still makes him great fun , as he presents in the press conversation .	-9.5173
He reports of varied but also demanding tasks awaiting his successor .	-3.0468
At the same time , he wonders that no application has yet fulfilled the requirements profile .	-3.3922
The city is looking for an architect or construction engineer at the nearest possible time .	-3.8259
Thus , while respecting the regular termination periods , there is still enough time to get involved .	-5.4439
Because Haslach acts as a lower building law authority for the administrative community , the applicant must have appropriate qualifications .	-5.2098
Because this function definitely wants to keep the city .	-3.8403
If they were no longer able to complete them , citizens would have to go to Offenburg for consultation .	-14.1877
But closeness to citizens is important to the city and to it itself , says Wacker , who reports of a good working climate and good mood between authorities and citizens .	-4.9423
In more than 30 years in office , some significant projects have accumulated , which Wacker proudly looks back on .	-4.5209
" We make the city worth living " , he is safe about the Bauamt and its employees . .	-10.1883
But in the future there will be a variety of projects on the agenda : the redesign of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofen parking lot , for example , have begun .	-5.7733
The Kinzigbrücke between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed , and stadium renewal is still a topic .	-4.1051
The latter alone will bear some EUR 1.5 million , ' if we do it right ' , Wacker estimates .	-4.8901
" All in all , great tasks await my successor .	-1.6945
The work here is fun . '	-1.3638
It is designed for a city master to have great room for manoeuvre .	-5.9290
With Haslach ’ s own construction farm and gardening shop , much can be reacted quite flexibly .	-12.1403
" Much can be done " , Wacker said , and the design of green areas is often commended by citizens and visitors .	-4.5234
As the Old Town as an ensemble is protected by monuments , it is important to have an eye for what matches when new buildings are approved , the outgoing city builder stresses .	-5.9429
In any case , the city builder bears a high responsibility .	-4.9790
He is a builder , " in the end everything runs over my table " .	-3.9966
In the case of care and coordination , he can count on long-standing employees : Markus Neumaier ( Hochbau ) has been there for ten years , Manfred Schöner ( underground construction ) for 15 years .	-5.4505
Also , that his successor remains long , Wacker wants : " We are looking for someone who really identifies and wants to stay with the place " .	-4.8430
Continuity is important not only for a good working environment , but also for the further design of the city .	-4.0342
Anyone who wishes to inherit Roland Wacker should be able to present a degree in architecture as a diploma engineer or bachelor , according to the City of Haslach , and have good expertise in the fields of construction and construction law .	-7.9197
The City Building Office is subject to high and low construction , construction planning , basic acquisition , administration of urban properties , municipal farm with buildings and urban gardening as well as lower building rights authorities including monument protection .	-8.2734
Bicycle thrown on lines : South railway line closed	-3.6162
According to the police , the previously unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway track transfer in the area of Leobener Stra<unk>e ( B116 ) onto the cables .	-9.8211
They were so damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .	-2.8467
The investigators are based on two male perpetrators and have been looking for them since the night hours .	-3.5667
A pink scooter and a bicycle rider were observed by witnesses near the scooter .	-4.6550
" This goes far beyond a couple of letters , " said <unk>BB spokesman Christoph Posch to the APA .	-4.8619
The perpetrators , or the perpetrators , would have put themselves in great danger and would also have threatened rail transport .	-5.1497
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant , as well as the delay minutes and the costs for rail replacement traffic , railway customers could also pay for the perpetrators .	-12.1014
Overall , the spokesperson said a " substantial " sum .	-4.3543
The damage was repaired on Friday afternoon and rail traffic on the southern railway route could be carried out without obstacles .	-5.5792
Almost ten passenger trains had failed on Friday morning , two of which concerned long-distance traffic .	-10.6888
Freight trains did not fall , but they were delayed .	-3.5707
According to <unk>BB spokesman Christoph Posch , about 200 metres of upper lines had to be exchanged .	-4.3340
Insulators and masts have also been damaged .	-8.9997
Red meat , dairy products , and chocolate could help relieve IBD ( inflammatory disease )	-1.8850
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system .	-1.3994
But a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could relieve patients ’ symptoms of inflammatory diseases .	-10.0657
The incurable state of affairs in the US of around 1.3 million and 300,000 in the UK causes stomach cramps and bloats , recurring or bloody diarrhea , weight loss , and extreme fatigue .	-3.9468
While those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms , researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps develop immuncells that promote a tolerant intestine .	-3.6244
The senior researcher , Dr. Marco Colonna , explained that immuncells patrol in the intestine to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in food do not penetrate into the body .	-3.5015
Cells capable of causing inflammation are offset by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues .	-2.8287
If the balance tends too far towards inflammation , it can result in an inflammatory disease .	-3.1426
Experiments have found that a kind of tolerance-promoting immuncell occurs in mice that carries a certain bacterium in its infections .	-5.7732
And the bacterium needs Tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .	-2.6627
Professor Colonna said : " We have established a link between a type of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbiom , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .	-3.3938
The more tryptophan the mice had in their food , the more they had of these immune cells " .	-2.8275
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a more tolerant , less inflammatory intestinal milieu rich in Tryptophan promotes if the same system also affects humans .	-4.2208
Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan postdoctoral studied a kind of immuncell that promotes tolerance when she found that a group of study mouse had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which had been housed separately , did not have it .	-5.2156
She suspected that the difference had to do with the intestinal biomas of the mice - the community of bacteria , viruses and mushrooms that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract .	-3.3840
Darms of mice were DNA sequenced and six types of bacteria were found that were present in the mice with the immune cells , but without them lacking in the mice .	-5.1358
Mouse was raised in a sterile environment , so that they lacked an intestinal biomass and did not develop this type of immune cells , and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells .	-5.2025
To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system , researchers L. reuteri grew in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated by the mice .	-4.3529
Immuncells became tolerance-promoting cells .	-2.4761
When the active component was cleaned from the liquid , it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as Indol-3 lactic acid .	-2.9759
When researchers doubled the amount of Tryptophan in mice feed , the number of such cells increased by about 50 % , but when the tryptophan values were halved , the number of cells fell by half .	-3.3336
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice , and that most of us L. reuteri protect our gastrointestinal tracts .	-2.4900
It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes related to Tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory disease .	-3.3734
She said : ' The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote , because these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine .	-3.0421
High tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri can potentially lead to an expansion of this population . '	-3.4110
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has committed a " genius " with Nemanja Matic .	-8.3239
Manchester United signed a " genius " with Nemanja Matic , believes Jose Mourinho after the middle field player had his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening .	-3.7355
The 40 million pound signature of Chelsea began with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid begins on Tuesday , and impressed in the holder role , when people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marched to their liking .	-4.7154
However , Matic had been excluded from the preparatory Asia tour of the blues and created only 45 minutes , which Mourinho admitted he had to improve before the Premier League season began .	-4.4004
" He needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , " said Mourinho .	-2.0421
'We will help him to be ready sooner than later ' .	-2.3105
Besides Matic , Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started in the Aviva stadium , when Mourinho formed his start-XI for the beginning of the season .	-3.6361
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three more new commitments , but insisted that the club had already done a " fantastic job " to meet three of its four priority new commitments .	-4.1071
" Three out of four , for which I thank the club , " he added .	-3.0446
'I will be happier if they get four out of four for me , but they have made a lot of effort . '	-9.7965
Boeing " paints " Dreamliner in the sky	-1.9270
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner in the sky .	-2.1432
The pilots flew from Seattle in the US state of Washington , but the drawing began in Marquette in US state Michigan and moved in the form of a dreamliner over the USA , which is several thousand kilometres .	-4.4353

New low strike for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem with a problem .	-3.1870
As the wind turns , when Sigmar Gabriel was SPD leader , Socialist prime ministers always looked to Berlin with some concern before elections .	-4.2455
Should there be no bonfires from the party headquarters , no headwinds from the federal government - that was the main wish of the campaigners .	-7.4052
Since Martin Schulz led the party , this has changed fundamentally .	-2.9107
Since then , employees from the Willy Brandt House have been watching events in the SPD governed capitals with growing horror .	-11.9739
What Schulz got from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described with headwinds .	-3.4692
They were low strikes .	-2.6565

" This shows once again : Red-Green simply cannot govern reliably , " said CDU-Secretary-General Peter Tauber the editorial network Germany ( RND ) .	-3.9700
The surprising exit of a Green MEP has plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .	-3.3093
Five months before the country ’ s election , his red-green coalition lost its one-vote majority to the opposition from CDU and FDP .	-3.0067
The Green Federal Managing Director Michael Kellner has asked the dissenting Lower Saxon Green MEP Elke Twesten to return their mandate .	-4.5916
Transition to the CDU means a clear distortion of the will of voters .	-3.1567
Elke Twesten must immediately return her mandate , " said the Federal Manager and the Green campaign leader to the editorial network Germany ( RND ) .	-4.5390
" All this must not be true " , a SPD campaign sighs when the new hiob message reaches the party headquarters on Friday morning .	-5.0399
Stephan Weil , Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands for the CDU after the Green MEP Elke Twesten has transferred to the CDU without his own maj. the the the . the the . the the the .	-10.5560
It is the preliminary highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD national associations .	-3.0200
And no one knows what comes next .	-1.5665
The misery began with the unexpectedly significant defeat in the Saarland election in March .	-2.8580
A blue eye , no longer , the comrades calmed down at the time .	-3.5389
After the Landtag elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia , everything will be different . the the . the the the . the the the the the .	-9.0918
It then became - and everything became much worse .	-4.1602
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to the thumb , the Düsseldorf defeat smoothly reversed the party .	-4.8384
In the weeks afterwards , the cooperatives struggled again .	-6.0371
Then , when they had just created new courage , the G-20 summit in Hamburg came .	-2.7141
And with him came the next low strike .	-8.6182
Mayor Olaf Scholz , the last strong SPD leader , lost his nimbus that weekend because he was in the Elbphilharmony while his city burned .	-3.7057
And because , in crisis communication , he did so much wrong what can be done wrong .	-5.9836
Since then , Scholz has been fighting for his political survival .	-1.7639
So now Stephan Weil .	-1.8654
Due to the VW exhaust affair and its role on the Supervisory Board , the Dutch Prime Minister has been in criticism for a long time .	-3.5199
Miese poll values were added .	-2.0752
Nonetheless , or perhaps precisely for that reason , because in recent weeks , increasingly attempted to put emphasis on the federal government .	-6.1204
The effort of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin was not hidden either in the surroundings of Martin Schulz .	-4.6542
They granted him because they promised to stabilise the party .	-10.1526
Now the exact opposite could happen .	-2.4373
Because the party internal conflict between the Lower Saxon Greens is basically not to blame .	-4.2842
And Schulz certainly not .	-2.5760
For the time being , the cooperatives are therefore trying to keep their own ranks closed .	-4.5350
Their anger is directed at the Greens and , above all , at the dissenting parliamentarian Twesten .	-4.5686
" It is intolerable and democratically damaging how Mrs Twesten puts her own career interests above the interests of everyone else , " says Matthias Miersch , head of the party lenks in the SPD Bundestagsfaction , the editorial network Germany ( RND ) .	-4.4353
Mrs Twesten was elected to Parliament not because of her person as a direct candidate , but because of the Lower Saxon Green list , the Lower Saxon Member continued .	-13.3275
The logical consequence would be that it should return its mandate .	-2.5076
Thomas Oppermann , head of the SPD Bundestagsfaction , laments an " undemocratic manoeuvre " .	-3.7214
" The will to vote four years ago was clear : the people made Stephan Weil the prime minister , " says Oppermann , who leads the Lower Saxon SPD as a top candidate to the federal election , the RND .	-4.5777
" Now the personal career thinking of a future CDU MEP distorts the election result " , said Oppermann .	-9.7144
He called for the background to be clarified .	-2.5370
I want to know whether there has been more or there have been further commitments from the CDU Lower Saxony .	-3.6093
Funding for Local Core III	-3.5399
Anyone who wants to rehabilitate his house in the years can soon receive support from the country .	-4.5519
Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG urban development informed about this in Empingen on Wednesday .	-3.7702
At the beginning of the information event Schindler gave a review of what has happened so far .	-3.6424
Since 1991 there have been rehabilitation areas in Empingen .	-3.4861
At that time , in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the country of Baden-Württemberg took over two-thirds of the funding amount .	-3.9726
In the Recovery Area II from 2005 to 2016 , the grant was still 60 % .	-3.7853
For Schindler , the reconstructions to date are a " success project " - it is important to encourage internal development and not only to open up new construction areas .	-5.8929
On 4 April , the Governing Bureau of Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a rehabilitation area III .	-3.7095
The funding amounts to EUR 833 333 , of which EUR 500 000 would come from the country , the rest of the municipality of Empingen .	-4.0491
How does a rehabilitation area emerge ?	-3.1675
Schindler continued to investigate where the " truly old " houses are .	-3.8236
It also has a role to play , however , whether there is any interest in the planned area in rehabilitation .	-5.2875
If necessary , the territorial borders could also be postponed again .	-4.3069
The STEG represented Martin Keller , Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening .	-1.6984
Keller presented the contents of the Federal Country Programme " Social City " , in which the refurbishments would then be carried out .	-4.3165
At the heart of the programme are the revitalisation of inner cities , the improvement of residential and working conditions and the maintenance and expansion of infrastructure .	-4.5613
The measures would be carried out object-related , i.e. per plot of land .	-3.6138
The rehabilitation area would then finally be defined as a statute .	-3.7363
The granting period for subsidies has run since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026 .	-3.5141
By September this year , however , the inventory would first be carried out , in which those involved in the rehabilitation area would receive a questionnaire for completion .	-5.9036
In November or December , the Statute shall be adopted as far as possible , so that the restructuring can begin next year .	-5.4551
Pietzschmann then explained that each municipality must carry out the preliminary investigations .	-4.0115
It is a question of evaluating urban maladministration and deciding when and to what extent .	-4.2597
For the respective plot , a refurbishment notice will be entered in the land paper .	-6.8708
Pietzschmann himself will come back to reception and take a picture of the situation , she promised .	-4.0030
Gotzel stressed that a key success factor for the project is the participation of the parties involved .	-3.4754
Therefore , there will be questionnaires which will be sent postally to citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled in until the end of the summer holidays .	-4.1803
The yellow questionnaire is the " arch of buildings and land " , which deals , among other things , with the building condition and the purpose of rehabilitation .	-5.9248
In the grey questionnaire , the " Household and Household Area " , information on the size , distribution and residents of a residential area can be provided .	-4.6925
The blue " operating sheet " can only be filled in if business premises are operated in the building .	-4.7771
However , Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not simultaneously a request for funding .	-2.9165
Furthermore , new buildings are not eligible for . the . the . the . the , the the . the	-9.1181
Schindler also emphasized that the distribution of funds works according to the " greyhound principle " - who comes first , grinds first .	-4.9034
You cannot " reserve " funding for later .	-4.1195
Finally , photos of the project " Ortskern II " were shown to make the present a " tasty " rehabilitation .	-5.7122
British inventor sets himself a microchip to come with a hand movement in house and car .	-3.4028
A British inventor is the first in the country to be equipped with a microchip so that he can open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .	-8.7884
Steven Northam , 33 , had implanted the tiny chip between thumbs and fingers , and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company BioTeq .	-4.1162
He joined Dr. Geoff Watson , a consultant anaesthetist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester , Hants , to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards .	-3.6950
The technology resembles a cat and dog implanted microchip and lasts only 30 seconds .	-2.1987
The company of Mr. Northam also wants to change the castles of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for an extra charge of $ 300 per lock .	-4.2726
The married father of one has now installed both at home and at his BMW Z4 technology , which starts when his hand is at the control .	-3.9318
The White House ’ s advertising costs cost taxpayers thousands of euros	-2.6388
The White House ’ s decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month costs taxpayers up to $ 24,000 , according to the military ’ s details that were left to the TIME magazine .	-4.2660
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on 17 July in the White House with American construction programs .	-3.2945
President Donald Trump , Vice President Mike Pence , and senior White House officials took a tour of products from all 50 countries .	-2.4903
The helicopter manufactured in Connecticut was exhibited next to a yacht from Maine , a fire-fighter from Wisconsin and a forklift truck from Mississippi .	-3.5087
The White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn , following the records of the Navy Helicopter Squadron One ( HMX-1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .	-3.7474
" I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , " the commander of the HMX-1 wrote on the eve of the event his superior , the deputy naval commander for aviation .	-3.6061
The news showed that the helicopter arrived at the South Lawn on July 17 , at 7 a.m. for the event at 3 p.m. , and until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 this evening .	-4.4450
The note adds that if the flight from the White House was to be delayed , a second team would be required for the return flight due to the limitation of hours of service .	-11.9733
The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event , while the unit safety personnel remained on the ground during the time .	-4.6451
The records made available to the TIME did not make it clear whether a second crew was ultimately required .	-4.3151
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes .	-2.0916
Records indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could violate the provision .	-2.9192
" One question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case , " the commander wrote .	-2.9362
" Sounds as if you are closed , " the Deputy Commander replied .	-2.6748
The " Made in America " event was described by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act .	-2.7943
But official events also have political tones .	-2.3652
At the event , the President gave impetus to the reform of the health reform underway in the Senate , and he promoted efforts to contain government rules .	-5.0941
The use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon .	-2.5289
Presidents are obliged to use them for the journey .	-2.6078
But to request their use only for a photo OP is unusual .	-3.3558
Trump conducted an investigation in February , when the presidential aircraft carried out taxi services against the background of his first campaign rally in Melbourne , Florida , and his Twitter account is full of news complaining about his predecessor ’ s use of the presidential aircraft .	-3.7118
" The White House is enthusiastic about the show " Made In America " - showing products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials , " said the Deputy Secretary of the White House , Lindsay Walters .	-12.4212
HMX 1 crews often perform training flights in the area around Washington and the South Lawn to remove the US President in the White House with precise centimetres .	-11.5287
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July , HMX-1 performed 58 exercise landings in the White House .	-2.3940
The flight for the " Made in America " event counted in the training requirements of the flight crew for the month , said one official .	-3.3924
Helicopter units flew 11 hours on this day for " non-presidential support missions " .	-3.2396
The White House said that taxpayers did not take over the burden of any of the other requirements presented at the event .	-3.2980
A spokesman of Sikorsky said that the company had not been involved in issuing the helicopter on the South Lawn .	-10.3910
HMX-1 does not have budget records for presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact costs of the event .	-3.1678
According to hourly tariffs from the US Department of Defense for the financial year 2017 , however , the DoD refund rate for the VH-3D is $ 24,380 per flight hour .	-3.4634
The unit records the aircraft ’ s flight time as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia .	-3.7495
The White House argues that the actual costs of operating the helicopter are well below this rate .	-2.2942
" Defining the cost of taxpayers on the basis of estimates for the refund rates is highly misleading , " said Walters .	-4.1953
'These estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in annual funds ' .	-3.0783
According to a 2015 RAND study , the reimbursement rates for DoD do not include personnel costs , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance , and conclusion of contracts .	-3.8068
At that time , the former White House press spokesman , Sean Spicer , defended the helicopter for the event .	-3.2869
" The idea is to present things made in America this week , " said Spicer .	-2.2530
" And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not thousands , depend on it .	-3.0457
And I think , like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly .	-1.9906
It is , of course , appropriate to highlight this ' .	-2.5356
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event , but he was sitting in the driver ’ s seat of a fire-fighter car .	-3.5109
In the White House , Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and joked to the media about his own fleet of corporate products .	-2.8983
'I know Sikorsky very well ' , said the President , ' I have three of them ' .	-2.1855
TC BW Neuss in front of a tricky task	-3.6052
Top riders of the Second Tennis Bundesliga take part in the Table Third Search Village SV .	-4.3319
The TC Blau-Weiss Neuss will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m. in Kiel at the Table Third Search Village SV .	-4.5818
Despite five games , the leader of the Second Tennis Bundesliga has retained a sense of reality .	-4.8171
Team chief Marius Zay has respect for the opponent .	-3.3920
" This is a compact team that always plays in a very similar formation .	-2.7340
It is precisely on the back positions that I find the team very good . '	-3.6411
The imports from the High North mainly ensure class and stability at the Sechsdorfer SV .	-4.7454
" Their Danes and Finns can even point to bets in the Davis Cup .	-2.5119
And they are also strong in double , " says Zay with a view to Harri Heliovaara ( Finland ) , Andre Göransson ( Sweden ) , Sören and Esben Olesen , Martin Pedersen , and Andreas Bjerrehus ( all Denmark ) .	-2.9726
" As always , this will be difficult for us .	-2.0765
You also need good luck . '	-2.5493
The Neuss team for the trip to the High North is practical .	-3.1344
His debut for blue white could give Maxime Janvier .	-2.0648
If the current Challenger tournament in the Italian Biella does not win the Bundesliga match , the Czech player Zdenek Kolar ( Czech Republic ) will win his first bet this season .	-6.1306

After his two victories last Sunday against the Club an der Alster , Máté Valkusz could return to the team .	-3.7243
If it is not enough for the 18-year-old Hungarian , who in January 2016 was still the number one of the junior world rankings , someone from the trainer 's office around Marius Zay fills up the cader .	-5.8912
How America Can Damage OMV	-2.5960
Donald Trump was not really happy when he signed the law to tighten sanctions against Russia on Wednesday evening .	-3.9469
" In his haste of enacting the law , " the Congress packed in a few " unconstitutional rules " , he etched .	-5.0923
The response from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels foamed against the US push .	-3.8983
After all , the draft envisages punishing European companies that help Russians build gas pipelines into the EU .	-2.9797
Since then , correspondingly worried have been investors of the domestic OMV , who , together with other European companies , co-financed the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea management Nord Stream 2 .	-5.5209
The threat backdrop is enormous .	-2.4151
Nevertheless , it is too early for an assessment of the consequences , according to the Oil Group ’ s official statement .	-3.8220
Indeed , Donald Trump would have to bring the sanctions to life by means of an executive order .	-3.3336
Twelve weapons stand for him .	-2.7381
" The press " looked at which the Group could defend and which could really hurt it .	-3.6746
Narcos Season 3 Trailer : Without Pablo Escobar , the Cali Cartel will be placed in the hit series of Netflix .	-4.0729
Despite the second season of Narcos , which reveals Pablo Escobars Killer , the Netflix series is far from over .	-2.8839
The seasons three and four were already confirmed by the streaming service , the first received their first trailer and showed the latest evil weights of the show .	-3.6833
With the third season , the DEA has focused its attention on the richest organisation of drug trafficking in the world : the Cali cartel .	-9.1105
Led by four powerful sponsors , they operate " like a Fortune 500 company " only with more government bribes and violent actions .	-2.7765
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela ( Damian Alcazar ) is the leader of the cartel , Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , Pacho Herrera ( Alberto Ammann ) commands the Mexican connection , and Chepe Santacruz Londono ( Pepe Rapazote ) is located in New York .	-2.1544
In the newly released trailer , Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Pe<unk>a , the type that invites American and Colombian law enforcement agencies to support the war on drugs .	-2.9576
Other new actors are Matias Varela , Michael Stahl-David , Matt Whelan , Miguel Angel Silvestre , Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro .	-1.9182
The third season of Narcos will start on 1 September .	-6.9515
Roll backwards : The city provides 46 kitchen assistance . the . the . the the the . the the .	-8.5212
The town organizes the kita lunch table itself .	-3.2381
With fixed contacts for the children and an assignment to the team .	-3.2573
The clock is turned back in the city ’ s daily schools .	-4.3960
On September 1 , the city of Krefeld takes over the food supply in the urban children ’ s daily facilities ( kitas ) again in its own direction .	-5.7839
For Sonja Pommeranz , Deputy Head of Youth Assistance , this is good news : " We have all been very pleased " .	-4.3495
Cooking continues outside the house : A caterer takes over this task and delivers fresh cooked .	-5.1651
The city operates 46 daily schools in Krefeld , and in 44 children receive a warm meal at noon .	-5.2566
In the past kita year , 2800 children were sitting at the tables , and demand is growing steadily .	-5.1311
" Meanwhile , not only children who are served 45 hours a week in the kita for lunch " , explains Pommerance .	-4.6264
'The offer also applies to 35 hour care when children stay until 2 p.m. '	-3.8278
46 part-time workers will have a kitchen service from 1 September : they warm up the delivered meals , complement them with salad , raw food and fruit , portion the meal individually , dispense the meal , clean up , rinse and clean the kitchen .	-6.2076
" Employees are fixed to a kita , " says Pommeranz .	-3.6191
The size - there are two groups as well as seven groups - determines the size of the hour .	-4.3641
" The kitchen helpers are now firmly part of the Kita team , " says Pommeranz satisfied .	-3.1864
" They are much more involved and it is easier to implement educational concepts for the kital-management " .	-4.8036
It is also a question of healthy nutrition and cooking . . . . the . the , the . the . the ,	-10.9627
" The children should help prepare food " .	-2.5023
The direct connection of the kitchen power to the team makes sense .	-2.7065
Also for children .	-2.1974
" They have a well-known force in the kita , a person who is familiar to them , and not constantly changing people " .	-3.6894
This continuity is important for children .	-1.3678
The cleaning of the kita rooms - so far also the task of the kitchen staff - will be carried out by special cleaning personnel .	-5.1885
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - besides improving the quality of the kitchen performance also has the charm that it has proved to be the most economical comparison between self-governance and foreign award for the city , it is said from the press office .	-6.8483
And that , although 46 part-time forces are being recruited .	-3.3941
" But these hours are not so much weight for around 750 people in the education sector , " says Sonja Pommeranz .	-4.8842

Two young men aged 19 and 23 should have tried on Thursday to deprive a 13-year-old girl .	-2.8404
According to police information , the men addressed the 13-year-old , who stayed with friends on the Kolpingstra<unk>e , at 14.55 , because they wanted to telephone the girl 's mobile phone .	-5.7077
But the 13-year-old rejected the request and went on with her friends .	-3.4624
After that , one of the perpetrators tried to use the mobile phone and necklace of the girl , which was failing .	-4.9421
Without prey , the duo escaped .	-1.7327

GMB concern about investment in the McVitie factory in Glasgow	-2.0523
A trade union wants to assure McVitie ’ s managers of the biscuit manufacturer the long-term commitment to production at their plant in Glasgow .	-5.0821
GMB Scotland said that the company was silent about the future of investment at the Tollcross site .	-3.0609
More than 500 employees work in the plant , which produces besides other products Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits .	-3.5069
McVities owner Pladis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .	-2.5638
He added that employees and trade union representatives would " experience first " if their activities changed .	-2.8905
In a letter to the branch manager of the company , GMB Scotland McVitie 's called on " to express concerns that financing for the modernization of production lines will not be pushed forward " .	-11.6402
GMB senior organizer Drew Duffy , said : " The fact that we cannot gain clarity from the General Site Manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross deeply affects our members .	-3.8393
Generations of families have worked here and the workforce is focusing heavily on the local community and Glasgow , an important pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage .	-4.0266
Therefore , from the perspective of jobs , wages , and prosperity , and against the background of Brexit , rising living costs , and chronic production decline , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently requires a prosperous production presence at McVitie ' .	-4.1518
A spokesman of Pladis said : " Tollcross 's branch manager received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday , and the company will respond directly to this , as we appreciate the continuous commitment of employees and trade union representatives .	-4.9358
Two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross , where some issues were discussed openly .	-3.0846
We discussed with the employees that , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and insecure economic climate , we are constantly reviewing our business - and this applies to all our divisions and locations - in order to remain competitive .	-4.8617
She added : " In recent years , we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our Tollcross location , especially in production lines and operational improvements .	-10.8736
We fully recognise the legacy of Tollcross as a production facility and , if our operations change at the site , the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to know . '	-5.0202
Has the PSG Barcelona warned three years ago about Neymar ?	-1.5715

But was the football world warned three years ago by the PSG president about this prospect ?	-2.6006
When Manchester City announced interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014 , Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for any club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PSG .	-2.9161
" I 'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players , then we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact their players , " said Al-Khelaifi .	-2.8169

But if they try to sign one of our players , that will have consequences . '	-3.4480
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish club expressing interest in the PSG midfield player Marco Verratti earlier this summer .	-3.5496

Interview : ' Domspatzen report relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger '	-2.0844
The Regensburg Domspatzen report on abuses relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger .	-2.3643
This means author and historian Michael Hesemann .	-1.8753
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Cathedral Spatzen continues to provide discussion .	-3.7541
Christian Weisnder , spokesperson of the reform movement " We are Church " , declared after publication to the German Press Agency , he expects the former Regensburg bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller and the Cathedral Master Georg Ratzinger , the 93-year-old brother of the emerited Pope Benedict XVI .	-5.2975
It would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church greatly if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret at their own omissions or their then false assessment of what happened .	-4.4721
The Vatican newspaper " Osservatore Romano " , on the other hand , criticized the fact that the reporting on violence in the dome spatzes was " double standards " .	-5.6082
With regard to the attacks in Regensburg , no one doubts that these are ' shameful and shameful acts ' , which should be punished and prevented in the future ; but noticeable is the ' degree of media manipulation ' , according to the author Lucetta Scaraffia , historian and member of the Italian National Bioethics Committee .	-4.8099
" The habit of describing the Catholic Church as the source of all evils is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to consider it normal , " Scaraffia writes .	-4.3051
Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis also said in the interview with the Bavarian broadcasting : " You like to go to the church and that 's a food found " .	-5.4123
In addition , she pointed out that in her youth ' beats were a very normal educational means ' to cope with cheap children , as I was one ' .	-5.3116
They would find it unfair to apply today ’ s standards to previous decades , because the world has changed .	-2.9587
In connection with the reports on abuse cases , Pope brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared .	-3.8001
The author and historian Michael Hesemann , who , with Ratzinger , wrote the memory band " My brother of the Pope " ( translated into 12 languages ) , . the the .	-11.1138
" I have to protect Georg Ratzinger , " says Hesemann , " because all this had nothing to do with him , " he evaluates the final report .	-3.7526
What exactly is the 440-page report presented by Ulrich Weber , the lawyer appointed to the Enlightenment by Bistum Regensburg ?	-4.3620
A total of 547 Regensburg Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990 's " with high plausibility " victims of attacks , 67 domspatzen .	-10.5770
The final report refers to Georg Ratzinger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : " In summary , it can be said that , in many cases , forms of physical and psychological violence were used by Domkapellmeister R. . . the of the . the the the the the the . the the	-10.5185
Especially with high emotionality , punishment for pupils could also be more severe .	-4.6818
Nonetheless , unlike many other accused , many victims appreciate the general humanity of R. and therefore , in many cases , even combine positive memories with him despite violence " .	-5.2251
In the interview , Hesemann explains why he believes that the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Dompatzen Georg Ratzinger relieves .	-4.3104
Mr Hesemann , the 440-page report on the ' incidents of violence on protective orders at the Regensburg Domspatzen ' gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger .	-4.4362
On the one hand , many students highlight his " humanity " .	-2.6817
On the other hand , he also appears as a choleric and perfectionist who often became hand-picked when a domspatz musically did not produce top performance .	-5.6694
How do you regard this final report as his biograph ?	-2.6095
Michael Hesemann : If you take the trouble and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to wonder why the name Georg Ratzinger comes from it .	-5.3581
Just eight pages are dedicated to him and he is clearly uncovered by any suspicion of complicity or co-knowledge in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .	-5.2771
The excesses of violence at pre-school also occurred outside its sphere of effect .	-3.7771
It is possible to accuse him of learning too late or having not taken seriously enough initial suggestions .	-5.6848
The Domspatzengymnasium , on which he worked , was perceived by practically all respondents as - so literally - " Redemption " , " Heaven " and " Better World " .	-5.0566
Thus , the vast majority of his students , Georg Ratzinger , also exhibits an excellent testimony , describes him as " warm-hearted " , " popular " , " sincere " , " competent " and " understanding " , as an extremely good teacher who regularly supplied the guys with cakes , biscuits and bonbons and was " always surrounded by grapes of children " .	-6.2317
Only a minority complains about its perfectionism and its high emotionality , which has caused rage .	-10.6896
He has admitted , deeply regretted and apologized for the fact that he was not only cracking with chairs and throwing the keyboard on the ground , but also slaughtered ear slaughters and too cheerful guys on the hair or ears .	-8.3615
However , to save honour , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the period in question , the 1960s and 1970s , both among parents and teachers .	-4.8365
Do you know such breeding methods ?	-2.3623
Of course , I think each of us who was born before 1968 .	-8.0963
I , too , have experienced this in a secular school , a state gymnasium .	-3.6311
Compared to what this report is actually about , namely the appalling sexual abuse and the excesses of violence at pre-school , these are , of course , bagatelles .	-4.5936
One wonders if it is not more related to his fame and role as a brother of Benedict XVI that many media plunged into him .	-6.1793
The Bavarian Pope is still eager for many who have never understood him .	-4.3392
The truth , however , is that the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect . . the . the , the . the the , the the the	-9.5651
Much has been reported in the media in connection with the report on the issue of abuse at the Regensburg Domspatzen .	-4.7278
Will Georg Ratzinger also be burdened in the final report with any involvement or co-knowledge regarding sexual abuse ?	-4.7523
Michael Hesemann : Clearly no .	-1.9238
None of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claims to have entrusted themselves to the Domkapellmeister .	-9.7695
Not even the parents were inaugurated .	-1.3000
" I have never dared to talk to my father or mother about it , " said one affected person , " It was all very embarrassing to me " .	-5.3880
The real problem with sexual abuse education was and still is that most victims are silent from shame .	-4.2930
If they did not even entrust themselves to parents and siblings , they would certainly not have been a choir conductor , who would have been a professional colleague of the perpetrators .	-5.1050
How do the Dompatzen students assess the role of Ratzinger in the case of abuse ?	-4.2794
Michael Hesemann : A student interviewed it as follows : " Regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he ( Georg Ratzinger ) had timely insights and could have stopped the perpetrator .	-5.1095
I think it is also absurd to assume that he is calculated ... Bubs have opened more urgent or clearer or even more than to their parents , boarding managers , teachers of confidence , etc . .	-12.6483
That one talks to him about sex ... - unthinkable . '	-2.6430
The report thus reaches the very clear conclusion : ' The fact that pupils and / or their surroundings were entrusted with it in advance could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation ' .	-5.9400
As far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg Ratzinger must therefore be released from all co-knowledge .	-3.9748
It cannot be accused of not preventing or displaying it .	-4.0444
There is therefore no reason to link his good name to these repugnant crimes , as unfortunately happened in some cases .	-3.6173
In the media there was much to read about " excesses of violence " at the Regensburg Domspatzen .	-4.4257
The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused in the report " Wegschauen " .	-3.3649
Do he have to live with this accusation ?	-2.3609
Michael Hesemann : This is the big problem that everything has been mixed and mixed in the reporting into a huge melange of sexual abuse and excesses of violence and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg Ratzinger .	-4.6020
However , this is again an abuse of the report .	-3.4349
There is a clean separation between the pre-school and the school of the Dompatzen , between sexual abuse and excesses of violence and , let us say , other accusations .	-5.7566
Moreover , the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945 , including four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choir conductor of the Domspatzen .	-4.9666
All the terrible prayer education , the cases where boys have been harassed and painted by sadistic teachers and suffered appallingly , occurred at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen , where truly scandalous conditions have prevailed .	-6.4019
But with those , Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with , because he got the boys face only when they were already at the Dompatzengymnasium .	-5.0008
On that , as most witnesses stress , the theme of " pre-school " was taboo .	-3.5832
One was only happy to escape her and enjoyed so much better treatment and for many even " paradise " conditions .	-3.6710
What was different on the Dompatzengymnasium ?	-2.9120
Michael Hesemann : Although there was discipline , there was no sadistic violence .	-3.1864
This also applies to Georg Ratzinger , in which the report concludes that ' many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore , in many cases , even combine positive memories with him despite violence ' .	-4.5394
The maximum thus remains the accusation of looking away .	-4.6661
However , despite all the efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported about the conditions at pre-school .	-5.0023
The first time in 1970 / 71 , when he just began to establish himself and wanted to hear nothing from the events at a school where he was not acting and responsible ( according to the witness ) , and only then back in 1993 .	-6.1389
Does Georg Ratzinger consistently close his ears before the states ?	-3.0450
Michael Hesemann : No , because as early as 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the Dompatzengymnasium , which the report even reproduces .	-2.9271
In this he points out to him that ' the criminal penalty continues to be applied in pre-school ' .	-6.1891
In view of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent intervention . . . the . the . the the . the the the . the	-11.4040
This was , of course , at a time when there was legal clarity when caning sentences were prohibited in Bavaria for a long time .	-4.8167
Before that they occurred in a legal grey area , as everyone knows .	-3.4928
It was also difficult for him to estimate where those affected were perhaps exaggerated or dramatized and where the permissible limit was actually crossed .	-5.5432
Nor can we say that he always looked away .	-3.7173
That is simply not true .	-1.3610
It was only in 1980 that the caning sentence in schools was officially abolished in Bavaria .	-3.5817
Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today ’ s educational standards to the time .	-11.5255
How do you see this ?	-1.6903
Michael Hesemann : We historians are talking about the " fall knitting of anachronism " , i.e. the danger of evaluating the past according to today 's moral standards .	-4.0703
The Princess is right there .	-2.6777
Of course , this does not apply to sexual abuse , which was abhorrent at all times , nor to what was broken in the preschool of rebellion and violence in innocent children 's souls , that goes far beyond the usual then .	-7.1205
That is all very terrible and I am glad that it is finally being processed .	-3.5781
But at the same time I have to protect Georg Ratzinger , because all this has nothing to do with him .	-3.0348
His methods of disciplining and punishing , i.e. ear slaughters and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .	-4.3040
When physical punishment was prohibited , he kept to it strictly .	-4.1049
What image of his time in Regensburg did Georg Ratzinger reproduce in the talks with you for the book " My brother of the Pope " ?	-4.1963
Could the subject of caning also be raised ?	-4.5236
Michael Hesemann : Well , the book is about the life of his brother Joseph , Pope Benedict XVI , tells from his perspective , as the Domspatzen played only a side role .	-4.6087
Nevertheless , I do not at all conceal the fact that he led a strict regime there .	-4.5617
But that too must be said : without this perfectionism , without demanding absolute discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world-class world-famous Regensburg Domspatzen , true European cultural ambassadors and his musical tradition , twice in the US ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .	-6.8384
With biscuits and candy alone , you don ’ t make big singers and every success , regardless of the area , but always discipline , passion and self-overcoming .	-6.8831
As what kind of person did you experience Georg Ratzinger in the talks on her book ?	-4.0644
Michael Hesemann : Through the work on the book and beyond , I really met Georg Ratzinger very well and have experienced time and time again as a wonderful , humorous , fundamental , deeply believed and heartfelt people , from whom one cannot imagine that he could do anything to a fly .	-7.1713
I regularly get in contact with him , visit him , read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family , 23 years after his emergency .	-20.8205
Those who still do not forgive him that he once was strict with them are clearly in the minority .	-4.2887
Most of the Domspatzen are grateful to him today for enriching their lives and bringing them closer to the world of music . the , , , , or , , , , , or , , ,	-10.2331
And that he was always a good , fatheral teacher - a rigorous father , certainly that may be - but also a lovely respectful sperson , to whom they are still watching and worshipping today . . the , , and , .	-12.7278
And , once again , I would like to make it quite clear that everything he is accused of is educational methods that were then the order of the day .	-6.8707
We can be glad that we have long overcome this period .	-3.0890
But it is highly unfair to make a man just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to become a media scapegoat .	-3.0752
The evil intention behind it is all too obvious .	-2.5297
The report that has just been published relieves it .	-2.1847
Now decency would require that a 93-year-old man who has earned a great deal of merit and who , without anyone outside Bavaria and perhaps even Germany , would not know the Regensburg Domspatzen finally be left in peace .	-8.2432
