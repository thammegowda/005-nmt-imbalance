Even more security for pedestrians	-2.7436
The new B 33 pedestrian ramp was put into operation on Tuesday at the village car park - in sight of the older town hall ampels .	-5.8353
Two plants so close to each other : intent or thyroid string ?	-4.7093
This question was clearly answered by Mr Gutachs Mayor yesterday .	-13.2266
" The town hall ampel was installed at the time because it secures the school path , " explained Eckert yesterday .	-3.6700
The Kluser traffic lights safe both cyclists and bus passengers and the mountain inhabitants .	-3.3712
The facility , which was officially opened yesterday , is important for the Sulzbachweg / Kirchstra<unk>e crossroads .	-19.4762
We have the museum , two churches , spa park , the bus stop , a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area <unk> Grub <unk> .	-3.2078
" At the high volume of traffic and pedestrians , another traffic light had to be secured , " says Eckert .	-4.8890
This also confirms Peter Arnold of the Office of Landratsamt Offenburg .	-3.1370
" According to current measurements , approximately 12 000 vehicles pass through the community of Gutach on the B 33 every day , about ten percent of which are heavy goods traffic , " says Arnold .	-4.7387
Therefore , the construction of another traffic light is more than necessary : " Safety is simple here , " says Arnold .	-4.1776
A total of four traffic shows had been carried out , and a roundabout was also thought out , but because of the narrowness of the crossroads in the Sulzbachweg / Kirchstra<unk>e croagain to be .	-7.5922
According to Arnold , when the traffic lights were selected , everything was tested before : " By means of a transporter loaded with particularly long wooden tribes for us , we have tested whether these vehicles can leave the Sulzbachweg to the B 33 without knicking the traffic lights " .	-7.2596
The around EUR 15 000 traffic light system itself is the most modern one on the market , explained Arnold .	-4.2722
The plant is equipped with coloured LEDs that shine so strongly that the lights are well recognized by drivers , for example , even when the sun is deep .	-5.8680
And it is also economical : the older lighting systems consume about 100 watts , the new just eight watts .	-3.9509
There are three light systems per journey .	-2.5387
Arnold explained the technique of the new plant : it is equipped with two radar sensors .	-2.4097
If the pedestrian presses the traffic light button , the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation .	-13.3635
If the road is free , direct green for the pedestrian , if not , it takes about 15 seconds .	-3.8464
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase for the pedestrian can be finished .	-2.7730
" If a group or handicapped person goes over the road , the green phase will be extended , so everyone will come safely over the road , " explained Arnold .	-4.7313
Of course , the driver should take part in this as a partner and observe the road .	-4.6105
This was not the case yesterday : hardly the traffic light showed green for pedestrians , noised an upper class vehicle - at bright red .	-4.6561
Josef Winkler has written for more than 30 years the needs of his childhood and youth from the soul .	-3.2190
The Carinthian poet described the disasters of his Catholic childhood - the lack of language , the slope to raw violence and blunt sexuality , the narrowness and joylessness .	-4.5026
The Büchner Prize winner is known primarily as a prose author , theatre texts are rare in his work .	-4.3270
Collage from Prosatexten Gerhard Fresacher compiles a collage of prosatorial texts for his performance " Weather lights on the tongue peak " , which can now be seen in Garage X at Petersplatz .	-5.5392
The theatre maker combines elements from the autobiographically characterized novel " Der Leibeigegene " ( 1987 ) with prosaminiatures from " Leichnam , his family lauering " ( 2003 ) .	-4.2584
On the largely empty stage - important requisite : a crushed sofa on which indications are copulated and masturbated - the eight-headed ensemble is hanged through the text material .	-5.1688
Director Fresacher seems to have little confidence in the text .	-2.3995
The 70-minute performance transfers the template with a wealth of directing incidents , known from the repertoire of post-dramatic forms .	-3.7820
Actresses especially come to terms with the sometimes somewhat questionable scenic implementations .	-4.4394
They are touched hard , dipped with the head under water , tacked with their evening seals to the wall .	-4.2455
Forced into cellophane or forgery , they stake on dangerously high stickers through the staging , either monologize vocals or are completely silent on the stage floor .	-5.6808
However , the text hardly conveys itself in this hard way .	-3.6610
The best moments have the evening when sung - the bandwidth ranges from Deep Purple to popular songs .	-2.8659
Only towards the end will the overturned performance come to rest , and Winkler ’ s afterwards absurd humor flashes .	-15.6427
A Blackbox in the car ?	-11.2926
American road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the declining highway system , and believe they have found the solution in a small black box that can be found on the dashboard of each car .	-4.4368
The devices that record every kilometre driven and report the information to the authorities are at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and the state planning offices to revise the outdated system for financing US roads .	-4.2111
The normally rather boring area of road planning has suddenly created an intense debate with colourful alliances .	-3.5139
Libertarians have allied themselves with environmental groups , arguing that the government can use the small boxes to record the driven kilometres – and possibly where they were driven – and then use the information to calculate tax models .	-4.1850
The Tea Party is appalled .	-1.2257
The American Civil Rights Association ( ACLU ) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of data protection concerns .	-2.3111
But , while Congress cannot agree on action , several states are no longer waiting .	-2.9392
They are currently examining how they can change over the next ten years to a system where drivers pay per mile .	-3.2458
Thousands of drivers have already tested the tachographs , some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring .	-2.2888
That really is a must for our country .	-2.0514
“ It is nothing we may only use , ” said Hasan Ikhrata , Managing Director of the Southern California Assn of Governments , who plans to record the miles driven by all Californian drivers in the state from 2025 .	-4.0839
The way we pay these taxes will change .	-1.2986
The technology for this is there .	-2.0049
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund , financed from the taxes that US Americans pay at the column of tap , is bankrupt .	-5.2123
But America no longer tanks as much as it did before .	-3.6154
Cars consume less petrol .	-1.3947
Government oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon ( less than 4 euro cents per litre ) has not increased for 20 years .	-14.0363
At high prices , politicians do not dare to raise the tax by just one cent .	-3.7588
“ The gas tax is simply not sustainable , ” says Lee Munnich , an expert in transport legislation at the University of Minnesota .	-2.8362
His state recently equipped 500 cars with tachographs to test a mile-based payment system .	-2.1457
“ This is the most sensible alternative in the long term , ” he said .	-2.7205
Bureaucrats call it a mile-based user fee .	-2.1035
Not surprisingly , the idea is appealing to urban liberals , because , for example , the tax could be used to influence driving behaviour in such a way as to reduce congestion and climate-damaging emissions .	-4.2491
The Californian planners rely on the system to develop strategies aimed at achieving the federal state ’ s ambitious , legally enshrined goals on climate change .	-4.2320
But the Republican Bill Shuster from Pennsylvania , Chairman of the House Transportation Committee , has also declared that he sees it as the most viable long-term alternative .	-13.7016
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are also attacked by the idea of paying drivers after travelling .	-4.2328
“ This is not a tax that disappears in a black hole , ” says Adrian Moore , Vice-President of Reason ’ s Directives .	-2.9126
People pay directly for what they get .	-1.0070
The movement is also supported by two former American Transport Ministers who , in a 2011 report , called on Congress to move towards mile-basaccounting .	-3.6430
Last year , the US Senate approved a $ 90 million expensive pilot project , including 10,000 cars .	-2.8162
But the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the move , responding to the concerns of rural Members representing people who often have to travel to work or to the city in everyday life .	-5.1381
Nevertheless , several states and major cities are moving in this direction on their own .	-3.1719
The most committed is Oregon , which currently recruits 5,000 drivers for the country ’ s largest experiment .	-3.4516
These drivers will soon pay the mileage fees instead of the mineral oil tax to the state .	-3.3540
Nevada has already completed a pilot project .	-1.1240
New York City also considers such a thing .	-2.0736
Illinois tests it to a limited extent with trucks .	-2.7000
And the I-95 coalition , which includes the transport ministries of 17 states on the east coast ( including Maryland , Pennsylvania , Virginia , and Florida ) , is currently examining how to introduce the change .	-2.9236
The concept is not a universal hit .	-1.0845
In Nevada , where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with the equipment , drivers were skeptical about the idea that the government could pursue any of its movements .	-3.0649
“ Concerns about Big Brother and such things were a major problem , ” explains Alauddin Khan , Head of Strategy and Result Management at the Ministry of Transport of Nevada .	-3.1089
People did not want it .	-1.1234
When the test started , Nevada ’ s ACLU warned on its website : “ It would be relatively easy to turn tachographs into fully-fledged monitoring equipment . ”	-3.7379
There is no need to build a gigantic , bulky technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals .	-2.9941
Nevada belongs to a number of federal states that are now looking for affordable technology that enables the state to capture the driven kilometres , but not exactly when and where .	-4.2476
This , Khan said , would also make the public more reassured . to the .	-16.7261
Hunting for this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California .	-2.1235
The company originally did not start to help states tax drivers . to the of to the . to the of to the . to to the to to the . to	-16.1963
Rather , their aim was to foot in an emerging market for vehicle insurance , with drivers paying on the basis of the miles driven .	-5.3962
But the devices it tests are also interesting for street planners , because they do not work with GPS and provide only limited information that is uploaded regularly via modem .	-4.7293
“ People are more willing to participate if their speed and locations are not recorded , ” said Ryan Morrison , Managing Director of True Mileage .	-2.8397
Some of these public pilot programs have made major mistakes .	-2.6190
There are significantly cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement this .	-10.8655
In Oregon , planners experiment with giving drivers a range of choices .	-2.9771
You can choose a device with or without GPS .	-1.8566
Or they choose no equipment at all and instead pay a flat-rate fee based on the miles driven on average by all state residents .	-4.8122
Others hope to sell the concept of a suspicious public by equipping the devices with more functions than with less .	-3.1735
In New York City , traffic officials want to develop a taxation device to pay parking charges , pay insurance only for driven kilometres and collect speed data from other vehicles in real time , thanks to which drivers can avoid congestion .	-5.5337
“ Drivers would be motivated to participate by the added value of the benefits that the system offers , ” says the city ’ s planning document .	-4.1518
But some traffic planners wonder whether the whole talk about paying per mile is not just a huge diversion .	-3.4403
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the territory of San Francisco Bay , officials stated that Congress could solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund simply by raising fuel tax .	-16.2029
An additional one-off fee or an annual fee could be imposed on car drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that use little petrol , so that they pay a fair share too .	-4.7811
“ There is no reason for an operation if an aspirin is sufficient , ” explains Randy Rentschler , the head of Commission legislation and public affairs .	-3.2755
If we do that , hundreds of millions of drivers are worried about their privacy and many other things .	-2.8700
Royal Field : Small team Wacker	-3.2654
The voluntary fire brigade managed its autumn main test despite staff shortages .	-4.6767
Only eleven man participated in the exercise .	-10.8849
Department commander Hans Kammerer chose the Feder property in Burgberger Strasse in his training acceptance .	-4.9143
A short circuit should be created there when sawing .	-3.9818
Two people were injured due to the fire and smoke development , but one of them was able to send an emergency call .	-4.6646
After the first review of the situation by Hans Kammerer , two breathing protectors of the Wehr prepared to enter the building .	-4.8861
After a short period of time , the first person was able to find and lead to the outdoor .	-4.9584
The second person had to be worn .	-1.2743
This was not so easy as a narrow staircase was overcome .	-4.1173
The building , a workshop with integrated stabling for two horses , was not easy to secure .	-2.0852
It stored a lot of wood and straw bales in it .	-9.7820
There were also electrical machines for woodworking .	-2.9712
The first extinguishing attack was carried out via the tank in the vehicle .	-2.5260
A further line was carried out via a floor hydrant at about 100 meters distance .	-4.8143
Now three extinguishing attacks could be designed .	-2.7324
A hollow jet tube was also used in the building .	-3.7378
Hans Kammerer was also concerned with showing what to do with little staff at his dispos.	-5.0137
In case of seriousness , support is provided via the Königsfeld daily betting group .	-17.4051
The commander was satisfied with the exercise .	-2.3919
Networking of universities and companies Important	-2.1759
During his visit to the Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald district , President Guido Wolf was also informed in Titisee-Neustadt about where tomorrow 's workers come from .	-4.6264
At the Hochschwarzwald Förderzentrum , he dealt with this important issue , together with the Managing Directors of vocational schools and the District Gymnasium and the Chairman of the Parents Advisory Bo. . from to from from in from in from to . from	-11.9249
" Education is an important site factor " , emphasized Claudia Stehle , director of the Hans-Thoma School , who presented the networked school project Education Centre Hochschwarzwald .	-3.8399
Wolf was impressed by the model projects for training .	-2.9439
Since 2011 there has been successful cooperation between the Förderzentrum , District Gymnasium and Vocational School Centre in the forest town .	-3.7771
He also praised the family friendliness in the county .	-2.4100
" It is important not only to have a look at the family phase , but also due to demographic change the phase of caring for relatives , " explained Wolf .	-4.8208
He also said that more and more employees were concerned about the care and care of their families .	-3.9735
" Without the support of employers , the resulting burden on employees may lead to an end to the employment relationship , " said Wolf .	-3.3760
But nobody could afford to lose skilled workers , he continued to say . to sa . to to a . , , to to the , to the . , to the , the to	-19.8738
Another particularly important factor is the networking of universities and companies .	-2.4936
" Because whoever has already experienced the benefits of the region during his studies , his acquired knowledge and skills often preserve the regional economy , which contributes to strengthening the region , " the president of the country showed his conviction .	-5.8395
Only if sufficient training places were offered can the skilled workers be met .	-4.6306
In his opinion , the location advantage of the district is its favourable location in the southwest of Germany , close to France and Switzerland .	-3.4663
In addition , on his railway journey from Titisee-Neustadt to Fribourg , he experienced the efforts already made to develop public transport .	-4.1862
" Stay persistent and ensure that local public transport is better , " he explained to the address of local politicians present .	-4.2399
Experience an entertaining afternoon with music	-2.1706
For 15 years the Kaul family has invited the Dietinger seniors to coffee , cake and then to a vesper .	-3.7208
Previously , the elderly were housed in the restaurant .	-4.0681
Meanwhile , this afternoon takes place in the care home of St. Josef .	-3.8718
The inhabitants looked forward to the delicious cakes and cakes .	-2.8811
Later there was salad .	-2.5493
Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich entertained with common melodies .	-2.8389
The more than 100 years old natural stone wall as the front delimitation of the old school courtyard to the Kirchstra<unk>e is to be put once again on the recovery cost plan of the city of Bräunlingen .	-6.3600
In the days before the Kilbig , a small angle wall , stabilizing and static relief of the natural stone wall with balustrade was installed in the first works of refurbishment of the front school court .	-6.2052
The next step , according to Alexander Misok of the Bräunlinger Stadtbauamt , is to include the Landesmenkmalamt in the planning and to draw up a concept of rehabilitation for the old wall .	-6.2426
Then a cost calculation is to be carried out by professionals , which will then be put on the table to the municipal council to decide and determine how to proceed .	-5.8820
A decision on this will probably be taken next year . to to the .	-13.1708
Following the renovation , pavement and tree planting of the old school courtyard within the two side-wings of the school built in 1912 , the follow-up must be refurbished from scratch and placed on new substructure in the foreseeable future .	-15.7428
The historic , one hundred years old wall of the old school court to the Kirchstra<unk>e , is especially due to water and frost damage , since there is no drainage , needs renovation and has an arch inclination forward .	-6.6160
Deep cracks in individual stones testify to weather damage , but the wall is not currently at risk of collapse .	-3.3498
A stable wall is a prerequisite for a school courtyard used by students , which has been done through the current fortifications .	-4.6295
Originally , school renovation was planned even in 2008 / 2009 , but high unscheduled expenditure brought a shift . to the of to the of the . to to to the .	-18.8880
An important word in the historical school wall renovation , which has even been used for film shooting , will be addressed by the State Memorial Office .	-5.5051
Should guidelines come from this side , the city of Bräunlingen hopes for grants from the protectors of the monuments .	-21.7873
The pupils of the Bräunlinger Primary School , who are now taught again in a well-refurbished old school building with new Aula , can soon use the old school court .	-12.1161
<unk>zdemir wants jazz training in Stuttgart	-2.1835
Cem <unk>zdemir , Federal Chairman of the Greens , has now also engaged in the ongoing discussions on the future of the Music Universities in Baden-Württemberg .	-4.6376
" I think it is wrong to give up holistic training at the Stuttgart University of Music , " said <unk>zdemir the " Stuttgart News " .	-3.1801
Jazz and classics are members of the jazz site Stuttgart .	-4.1884
In this way , <unk>zdemir , who is considered to be a favorite for a direct mandate at the federal election on 22 September , is contrary to the Green Red Government .	-4.7226
On the basis of an expert study , it forces a reorganisation of the five music colleges in Baden-Württemberg .	-4.3663
After that , the course of study Jazz and Pop will be moved from the Stuttgart University of Music to the Mannheim University .	-4.7575
US border : " Super Tunnel " on drug smuggling	-3.1107
On the border between Mexico and the US , investigators have discovered and closed a " super tunnel " for drug smuggling .	-2.8352
As the US customs authorities said , the more than 500 metre long tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity , railway tracks , and ventilation facilities .	-3.5800
Three suspects were therefore arrested , eight tonnes of marijuana and almost 150 kilograms of cocaine seized .	-2.3182
The tunnel has not yet been used .	-2.4436
" These cartels are stupid when they think they could go through under the radar , " said the US District General Prosecutor Southern California , Laura Duffy , at a press conference in front of a warehouse in San Diego , where this had been discovered an end to the tunnel .	-4.5439
Duffy told the drug gangs : " If you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them , we are determined to make this a huge waste of your dirty money " .	-5.0150
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a permanent struggle against the drugs cartel.	-2.5935
Since 2006 , more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug crime .	-2.0272
Constructed by Experts	-1.2701
Because of the expensive equipment of the tunnel , the investigators assume that it was constructed by architects and engineers and that the construction took about a year .	-4.7026
The railway system was equipped so that electrically operated cars could be used there .	-3.9503
On the Mexican side , access is in a building 80 metres from the border .	-13.3328
According to the authorities , a head leads 20 meters into the depth to the actual tunnel entrance .	-3.2399
The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 meters height and 90 centimeters width .	-10.7036
It would also have been appropriate to promote illegal immigration towards the US .	-3.1740
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine fund .	-2.3168
The third , a Mexican , was taken because of the confiscated marijuana .	-2.7101
All three are threatened as a maximum penalty for lifelong freedom withdrawal , as officials said .	-4.0093
Eight such tunnels have been discovered since 2006 , and the press conference in San Diego continued .	-3.2702
However , it is the first time that cocaine has been found in such a tunnel construction .	-13.9192
Normally cocaine is smuggled in smaller quantities and not through tunnels .	-2.4447
This demonstrates the " despair " of drug gangs whose traditional routes have now been cut off , said Bill Sherman of the DEA drug trap in San Diego .	-4.2805
They would do everything possible to reach the US .	-1.9490
No details were announced on those arrested , at least one Mexican was said .	-3.8383
They must expect prison sentences up to ten years .	-2.8179
2014 Geisingen Festival	-2.1868
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250 .	-2.0311
Return of the first documentary mention is getting closer .	-3.4543
When the year ends in good eight weeks , the anniversary year is due .	-3.9415
Geisingen and Church Houses were first mentioned together in 794 .	-3.0151
A document was made in churches mentioning both places .	-3.3718
On 15 March there will be an official start to the anniversary year , and since Geisingen currently has no hall , this starting event takes place in the place where both were mentioned for the first time 1250 years ago , in church houses .	-5.3363
Several events are planned during the anniversary , both in Geisingen and in church houses .	-3.6744
Church houses will be the 1250 in July at a festive weekend from 18 to 20 July .	-3.5373
Repeat .	-2.0367
On Friday with a ceremony , on Saturday and Sunday with a festival around the Church Valley .	-3.2843
At this festival there is also the Church House Church Festival .	-4.3995
City Music Director Rudolf Barth wrote an order composition for the city on the occasion of the anniversary , which is performed on three dates .	-4.2666
On 21 June together with the Sonnwendfeier des Schwarzwaldvereins , on 12 July in the Arena with fireworks and on 13 December the first concert of city music in the new Festhalle .	-3.7028
This will be finished and inaugurated in the anniversary year , the official date will be on the last weekend of September , 27 and 28 September .	-4.3037
On the occasion of the Geisingen anniversary of the city , a new chronicle is also being released .	-4.3711
" It should be a chronicle not only of Geisingen himself , but a printed work on today 's Geising , which consists precisely of Geisingen , Church Houses , Leipferdingen , Aulfingen and Gutmadingen " , says Mayor Walter Hengstler .	-4.8396
And today ’ s Geising celebrates 2014 birthday , in 1974 today ’ s space with communities was carried out .	-4.6997
The new chronicle will be presented at the new Festhalle in Geisingen on 21 or 22 November .	-2.9945
But 2014 is another year with many anniversaries .	-2.7100
The Strohglonki fool starts on 8 February with a traditional evening on the occasion of its 60th anniversary , the harmony of Gutmadingen will be 90 years and has the festival banquet on 29 March and celebrates the District Music Festival from 1 to 4 May .	-5.5649
The Altenwerk Leipferdingen is 40 years old , the Geisinger School has been at the new site for 50 years and celebrates this on 10 May , the Musikverein Polyhymnia Leipferdingen becomes 150 years old and celebrates this at the Well Festival from 4 to 7 July .	-4.7552
The city of Geisingen was first mentioned in a donation document owned by the St. Gallen monastery in 764 .	-3.7164
The document was produced in churches ( houses ) , which was then court place .	-3.9309
Both communities are therefore mentioned in the same document .	-1.9477
Reason 2014 to celebrate this 1250-year-old , in addition , the municipal reform lags 40 years ago . to a in of to . to to to the to the .	-14.4770
The Council Targets Trail Installations	-15.8240
Should the railway transition " Am Hirschen " be converted to increase road safety ?	-4.2904
Yes , the municipal councils have decided .	-2.6060
Schiltach must take 220 000 euros in hand for this . .	-12.7189
Deutsche Bahn will improve the Kinzigtal railway track next year .	-2.7848
In particular , railway transport safety is to be increased - regularly there are collisions of trains with other vehicles across Germany .	-5.5042
If the municipalities agree to reconstruction measures , they must participate with a third in the costs , the rest share the railway and the federal government .	-5.7957
Schiltach 's town builder , Roland Grie<unk>haber , explained the special features of the railway crossing " Am Hirschen " .	-4.8099
The city is planning to build a booking in the amount of the tunnelmund there west of the railway track .	-5.9630
There , too , larger vehicles , such as those transporting long wood , could be counter-traffic without having to block the track .	-4.4130
Greekers therefore proposed to construct a necessary support wall in such a way that the city could widen the subsequent road in due course in order to ensure a smooth flow of traffic . to the of to to the of to to the . to to the to	-16.0236
This was discussed controversially in the municipal council , since some councils called into question the need for road proliferation : Thomas Kipp , in his statement , brought the mood of the critics to the point : ' Do we have to take so much money for so few vehicles ? '	-5.7957
Mayor Thomas Haas contradicted : the railway crossing " Hirschen " is used regularly for long wood transport .	-4.1454
Even wood from the " Kuhbach " area is partly transported over this route because the vehicles up to 20 metres long could not use the route at the Häberlesbrücke because they could not turn into the main road .	-5.9105
Moreover , the route served as a redirect for those vehicles that cannot use the tunnel when the main road is locked , Haas argued .	-3.8477
Since it is apparent that Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnels should be rebuilt and refurbished , as is the case at the moment in Wolfach , the railway crossing " Am Dirschen " could also have an important road significance for a longer period .	-6.8491
The councils agreed to have the cost of broadening the road .	-3.8214
Nevertheless , the majority voted in favour of the rebuilding of the railway transition with the provision that the necessary support wall is built in such a way that the city could expand the subsequent road towards " Bahnhofstra<unk>e " , if necessary for meeting traffic to around 5.5 meters .	-7.2972
The rebuilding of the railway transition at Gerberei Trautwein , on the other hand , could lead to a completely different problem concerning access to the sharply increasing " Geroltzhäuser Weg " .	-5.2951
The administration had investigated the reconstruction plans of the railway from the engineering office Breinlinger , since it had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhäuser Wegs would then be possible without further delay .	-5.5275
The investigation concluded that it was not possible to rule out that road slopes could lead to longer vehicles sitting .	-5.3992
Responsibility for this , in turn , lies with the city as a street construc.	-14.2972
The reconstruction can therefore result in liability disputes .	-4.0320
Since both the wooden flight and the turn worked in the current state of expansion , the railway transition should not be converted , Haas argued .	-6.2420
At this point , too , the risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle on the transition is much less than at the other railway crossings , since directly next to the center , to which there is a good visibility connection .	-6.9344
Even trains from the central station should be stopped at this point so far that no collision threatens .	-4.5980
The majority of these railway transitions were refused to agree , as the city of Schiltach would have to ' bathe out ' the problem with sitting vehicles , so the councils , because the railway could withdraw from responsibility after the construction work has been completed .	-7.3684
The body considers it unproblematic to be the conversions to the railway crossings " Before Heubach " and " Before Kuhbach " , for which crossing agreements have already been reached by rail .	-6.1558
Esa decides on large space missions : Missions for billions	-2.7823
Far planets , gravitational waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects that they want to start in the coming years .	-3.8922
30 proposals were available , five are still in the race .	-3.2759
Far worlds .	-1.2817
More than 1000 planets in other stars have already found astronomers .	-1.9960
No one knows whether there is at least life on some of them . to to . to to to . to to to to .	-10.9224
The choice is difficult : should you search for gravity waves ?	-4.0612
Or rather explore the origin of the cosmos ?	-1.9272
Or searching for similar planets and perhaps discovering alien life ?	-3.8572
These questions are being asked by the leaders of the European Space Agency , Esa .	-15.1067
For their programme " Cosmic Vision " they are looking for ideas for two major space projects , which are designed to promote research .	-4.6654
The budget for such " L missions " is approximately EUR 1 billion each . . to be . from to to the . of to the to . to to the to	-15.1428
The start is expected to be 2028 and 2034 .	-2.1174
At the beginning of September , the elite of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such mi.	-2.2468
30 ideas have been debated , five of which have now come to the closer choice .	-3.6988
Numerous bodies examined the proposals , check the researchers .	-4.5461
In the next few days a final decision will be taken by the Scientific Programme Committee .	-2.5587
A total of four major questions have been chosen by the Esa , to which the missions of the Cosmic Vision programme initiated in 2007 will find answers .	-4.1608
What are the conditions for the creation of planets and lives ?	-1.8363
The precise processes in the emergence of stars from large gas clouds - and thus also the emergence of planets that surround these stars - are still in the proverbial dark . of to the of to .	-16.9051
A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this dark .	-1.7931
And if a star has a planet , under what circumstances can life be created there ?	-2.9583
To address this issue , the space telescope " Cheops " will be launched in 2017 , with 500 already known planetary systems being examined more closely in our surroundings .	-5.2172
The possibilities are limited , however , and cheops are a small mission with a budget of EUR 150 million .	-16.6028
With larger instruments , astronomers could represent similar planets , and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres , seeking " biomarkers " : gases that are considered indicative of biological activity .	-4.0110
How does the solar system work ?	-0.9457
At the end of the day , this question , too , should give an insight into the conditions for the creation of life .	-5.8237
An important role is the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field as well as the particle radiation it produces with the planetary system .	-4.4340
In our solar system these processes can be examined exemplarily .	-3.5863
With the " Solar Orbiter " the Esa has already approved a mission of the M class ( there the budget is about half a billion euros ) for this issue .	-3.8217
The probe is scheduled to start in 2017 and monitor the surface and activity of the sun closely . to the . to the .	-20.1334
Jupiter and his moons are of great interest to the researchers .	-2.4647
They want to find out what role the giant planet played in developing the solar system .	-3.0630
For this purpose , the Esa provides for the first of the three L missions of the Cosmic Vision programme .	-13.1520
The probe " Juice " ( Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer ) is expected to start their journey in 2022 .	-2.2866
Eight years later , she reached Jupiter and was to investigate the atmosphere of the planet and the icy moons of Europe , Kallisto , and Ganymed .	-4.0673
What are the basic physical laws of the universe ?	-1.0419
The space offers many possibilities to study matter under extreme conditions and to investigate whether the natural laws we know are still valid there .	-3.9563
Perhaps there are also deviations that could show the physicists the way to a new theory , under which all known natural laws can be combined .	-5.1735
How did the universe emerge and what does it consist ? to the un. to to the .	-17.2284
13.7 billion years ago our cosmos came into being through the big bang .	-2.9282
In addition to the matter we are familiar with , which consists of stars , planets and living creatures like us , there is dark matter whose gravity holds galaxies and clusters of galaxies together , and dark energy , which accelerates the expansion of space .	-4.9510
So far , researchers do not know which physical laws were valid in the first second fractions of the big bang , nor do they consist of dark matter and dark energy .	-4.0001
With " Euclid " the Esa has already approved an M mission , which is scheduled for 2020 .	-4.2821
With a special telescope , the probe is intended to investigate the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time throughout the sky , thus enabling conclusions on the nature of dark matter and dark energy .	-4.5341
Who Could Race	-2.1455
Of the 30 proposals , only two will remain at the end of the selection procedure .	-2.1046
According to many experts , " E-Lisa " , the best opportunities for a L mission has a sophisticated concept to prove gravitational waves .	-5.5073
This includes physicists understanding changes in the structure of space time that Albert Einstein predicted nearly 100 years ago .	-3.5093
They have not yet been proven .	-2.6575
Elisa could do that , the scientists hope behind the project .	-2.5791
The mission provides a detector consisting of two or three probes , which is stationed in space .	-3.5477
In contrast to plants on Earth , it could also demonstrate waves of gravity that emerged from the big bang , thus providing new insights into the emergence of the cosmos . in of in of . to to to the of in to the . to to to the the to the	-20.6078
Four more suggestions compete for the second L mission : a large X-ray telescope called " Athena " , which is intended to explore black holes , " Icy Planets " , another mission to the outer planets of the solar system , " Prism " , a mission to measure cosmic background radiation , and the " Exoplanet Finder " , which is intended to detect and investigate similar planets .	-4.7930
Among other things , suggestions for sample return from Mars , research into the moon , Venus and asteroids , as well as solar physics have already been excluded .	-5.9600
Snowden is ready to “ cooperate ” with Germany on US surveillance	-2.2704
Edward Snowden , the whistleblower of the US intelligence service , has declared that he is willing to travel to Berlin and say before the German Bundestag if the American National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander do not provide answers to their activities .	-4.5186
German MEP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden in Russia on Thursday , where this asylum was given to discuss with him the statement in Germany .	-3.3963
In a letter from Snowden , presented to the media in Berlin on Friday by Ströbele , this letter writes : “ Although the result of my efforts was demonstrably positive , my government continues to treat a different opinion as a faithful break and seeks to criminalize political expression with a threat of penalty , in which no defence is possible . ”	-5.6826
To tell the truth is not a crime .	-1.7269
In the letter , Snowden writes that he is convinced that the support of the international community could persuade the American government to drop the charge against him .	-3.4509
The US Department of Justice ’ s charge includes espionage and theft of state property .	-2.5220
German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich said online to time : “ If Mr Snowden is prepared to speak to German representatives , then we will find ways to make that possible . ”	-4.1081
Relations between the US and Germany are burdened by claims that the NSA has heard the mobile phone from Chancellor Angela Merkel .	-3.1336
Thomas Oppermann , the member of the parliamentary committee responsible for the intelligence service , said that if possible , one should seize the opportunity to listen to Snowden as a witness , “ without jeopardising him and completely ruining relations with the US . ”	-4.8654
Ströbele , a member of the Greens , published a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed .	-14.0262
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia .	-1.4192
Ströbele explained that , according to the lawyer of the former NSA employee , Snowden cannot return to Russia if he leaves the country .	-3.5367
If Snowden says in Germany , he needs an assurance that he is ‘ safe ’ , the honourable Member says .	-3.7139
In his letter , Snowden explains that he faced a “ serious and ongoing ” persecution campaign that drove him out of his homeland .	-3.6706
But he is touched by the global response to “ my act of political expression . ”	-2.8081
Citizens around the world , as well as senior politicians – including in the United States – have described revelations of an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance as a merit of the general public .	-3.5516
In his letter , Snowden offers the German authorities an offer of cooperation “ when the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation have been resolved . ”	-3.3157
Frontier Airlines charges for hand baggage	-1.4642
Frontier Airlines is planning to demand up to $ 100 of passengers who wish to store hand baggage on their flights .	-14.2618
Frontier Airlines intends to calculate up to $ 100 for a piece of hand baggage and $ 2 for coffee or limonade , even if it was read in the announcement on Wednesday that passengers should keep the whole dose .	-4.0890
The new fee applies to hand baggage in the baggage compartment above the seat , small bags under the seat are still free of charge .	-3.5075
Frontier explained that if the fee is paid in advance , you will be charged $ 25 , and $ 100 for passengers paying only at the boarding pass .	-5.4674
Frontier spokesperson Kate O 'Malley said that the fee of $ 100 is aimed at moving travellers to take care of payment in advance .	-3.7727
“ We do not want to calculate this sum , ” she explained .	-2.4581
Airlines began to charge for the first and second checked baggage in 2008 .	-2.9001
Passengers who attempted to circumvent them have therefore piled into their hand baggage as much as possible , which means that the baggage fans are often overcrowded .	-5.4768
Fees are a way of encouraging passengers to take less on board .	-2.8122
O 'Malley said that the new fee is not really about earning money .	-1.8296
It is about the most faithful customers of Frontier , who would have clearly expressed that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find place in the subject above the seat .	-5.0190
Passengers who purchase their tickets on the airline 's website do not have to pay .	-2.6804
This means that a passenger may be allowed to carry a piece of baggage free of charge at the Frontier airport , but the next person will have to pay $ 100 for a similar piece of baggage .	-4.8162
O 'Malley declared that the Frontier website and the check-in procedures were changed so that passengers were informed of the fee before they came to the boarding pass .	-4.5425
The new hand baggage fee from Frontier will not come into force until summer , and there is no exact date yet .	-4.5842
Passengers often swamp over baggage supplements and other charges , but airlines are happy to resort to it . to a . to a to a . to a to a . to a to	-17.3677
They argue that the transport of baggage should cost money and passengers should pay this service if they wish .	-3.1147
Many on Wall Street regard the new baggage fees as a sign that the airlines are taking enough money to cover the costs of air travel after years of loss . to to the of from the to the . of to to the .	-22.4382
However , most so far have left the fingers of hand baggage charges .	-3.7586
Three years ago , Spirit Airlines Inc. demanded first hand baggage fees and later Allegiant Air , also a low-cost flyer .	-3.9890
The only other airline with such a charge is Hungarian Wizz Air , declared the airline consultant Jay Sorensen , who closely monitors the additional charges .	-3.8498
He estimated in a December 2011 report that the Spirit cabin baggage fee contributes $ 50 million annually .	-3.1225
Sorensen , who previously had a leadership position at Midwest Airlines , recently flew with Spirit and was curious what would expect him at the boarding path if passengers were to face the unusual hand baggage fee of the company .	-5.5834
“ The boarding process was one of the smooth ones I experienced in my career in aviation , ” he said . to a of the . of in of in to the . of of in . to the of to to the .	-15.0869
I expected to see teeth knirts and hands-on discussions at the pavement .	-4.2076
“ The aircraft was full , ” he explained , “ and the boarding ran as lubricated . ”	-2.7209
Frontier also follows Spirit in the 2 dollars required for coffee , tea , limonade or juice .	-3.5239
The company explained that passengers who bought limonade or juice are likely to keep the whole dose and coffee is filled free of charge .	-4.4828
Water is still free .	-1.5575
US Airways sought to demand money for refreshing drinks in 2008 , but reversed it seven months later after passengers complained and no other major company followed .	-4.9002
Frontiers ’ step to charge hand baggage fees if passengers do not buy directly from the airline is the latest initiative to direct customers to their own website .	-3.8408
Airlines pay online travel agencies such as Orbitz 10 to $ 25 per ticket sold .	-20.2067
This gives all companies an incentive to move passengers to buy directly from them rather than from an online travel agency .	-3.4469
But Frontier has gone the farthest in this area .	-3.2618
In September , the company began to award only half as many frequent flyer miles when booking through an online travel agency .	-3.3576
On Wednesday , miles were reduced to 25 % of the flight route .	-3.0488
A flight journey booked with a third-party supplier with a frontier of more than 1000 miles thus only contributes 250 miles to customers .	-5.8054
Passengers may also reserve direct purchases on the Frontier Places website .	-3.6680

Speeches from the Bible	-3.2218
About 40 women visited the last female breakfast this year in the evangelical parish of Bisingen .	-3.3913
The topic of the day in the municipal house were " proverbs from the Bible " and " speeches from the Middle Ages " .	-8.1223
Zita Köhler , the chairman of the Church Community Council , entered into the biblical proverbs after breakfast .	-3.8473
" Proverbial words contain life wisdom , regulations or warnings , " she explained .	-9.8616
She compared several proverbs with the corresponding Bibles and explained the meaning .	-3.6728
She called proverbs like : wooden eyes are vigilant , as scales fall from the eyes , throw an eye on someone who gives His the Lord in sleep , wash his hands in innocence .	-4.4079
Several times the speaker also advised her listeners what saying it was .	-3.5879
Christel Dehner adopted the phrase from the Middle Ages : all good things are three , make blue , something haunted .	-5.3576
She explained the importance and origin of the speeches she called ' bridges to the past ' .	-2.9757
Finally , a raffle was raffled .	-2.7363

Learning instead of unemployment : Pilot project for Unlearned in Tourism	-2.5465
A pilot project for the tourism industry is starting today on the Mecklenburg lakeside plate .	-3.8297
Under the leadership of the Federal Labour Agency , 49 women and men who are already working as unskilled in the industry are to be qualified to professionals for hotels and restaurants over three winters .	-4.1664
" New because the six-month courses end with qualifications , " said Carmen Wiechert of the agency Neubrandenburg .	-4.2703
The benefits are varied : it would not unemploy the participants , the companies would receive trained professionals who were increasingly lacking in hotels and restaurants , and the agency would not have to finance unemployment .	-5.0953
The project also includes the Chamber of Commerce in Neubrandenburg and the Deutsche Hotel- und Gaststättenverband ( Dehoga ) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern .	-2.6996
NSA declares that an “ internal error ” and not hackers are to blame for the crash of the site	-3.2373
The shadowy National Security Agency declared late Friday that a mistake had paralyzed its public website for a few hours , not hackers , as was claimed online .	-3.9768
“ NSA.gov was unavailable for a few hours this night because an internal error occurred during a planned update , ” explained the Spy Agency in a message sent by e-mail . “ NS“ “ NS” “ ” “ “ N” “ ” “ “ ” ” “ ” ” . “	-16.3037
The problem will be fixed this evening .	-1.9156
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed Denial of Service Attack ( DDoS ) is not true .	-2.4926
In the early hours of the evening , online server trackers noticed that the NSA website was not available for at least six hours , and this is still not for some users .	-4.6949
Previously , a NSA spokesman had declared to ABC News that the sensitive internal network of the authority was “ in no way ” compromised .	-3.0940
Secret information is not in danger , according to the speaker .	-2.3332
At least one group of hacktivists claimed to have paralysed the NSA website with a DDoS attack .	-2.6734
In such attacks , the target website is flooded with page calls until the servers are overloaded and the website collapses .	-2.9600
Cybertactics are relatively simple and attacks do not serve to enter the internal network of the target system .	-2.5638
The previously supersecret NSA , whose nickname once was No Such Agency ( no such authority ) , is now in the bright light of the public , and is exposed to sharp criticism after the revelations that have become known in recent months about its extensive domestic and foreign surveillance program – a result of the secret NSA data stolen and published by the disillusioned former NSA employee Edward Snowden .	-5.8804
The growing controversy over the intelligence service fueled initial speculation that the incident today is the result of a targeted cyperoperation .	-2.8459

Bombardier ’ s loss of profit following decline in numbers of deliveries and ordto . to the of in . to to the . to the from to	-15.5206
The Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15-percent decline in the net profit on Thursday after he had come under pressure from declining orders and deliveries to aircraft in the third quarter and contract problems in the railway sector .	-4.7444
Bombardier , headquartered in Montreal , did not publish any flight test data for his brand new CSeries aircraft and did not give any new information about whether the aircraft could go into commercial use in accordance with the ambitious timetable next September .	-5.2255
So far , only three more starts have followed the virgin flight of the test aircraft one and a half months ago , which makes it questionable whether the test phase is as planned .	-5.0673
The results remained behind the forecasts and caused a fall of more than eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange .	-3.9831
On Thursday , Cameron Doerksen , analyst at National Bank Financial , reduced its rating of “ outperform ” to “ sector perform ” in view of the fact that the share has limited price potential in the next one to two quarters .	-4.7793
“ Although weaker delivery numbers were largely expected for aircraft , we are clearly disappointed by margin development in the transport sector , ” said Doerksen in a customer letter .	-4.4413
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries if the test programme for the aircraft progresses .	-2.9670
However , if no new orders are announced in the coming months , we expect the market to become more sceptical of the program .	-3.4738
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft series can catapult the company into the lower market segment currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus .	-2.4346
The first test aircraft was presented to the public in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delays .	-2.2755
But , so far , binding orders for the CSeries with 177 are moderate , as potential buyers want to wait for the results of the aircraft tests and see whether the company ’ s claims about fuel efficiency and cost savings potential of the new jet aircraft are correct .	-5.3062
There are currently a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and compancompan.	-3.1542
CEO Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will achieve its goal of 300 binding orders at the beginning of commercial use of the jet .	-3.2028
On Thursday , the company management also assured analysts and media that the programme is on schedule .	-4.4501
“ The test aircraft no longer remained on the ground than expected , ” said Beaudoin at a telephone conference and added that during the aircraft ’ s lifetime , ground tests and software updates had been set .	-4.7333
Each manufacturer plans differently .	-1.4611
We have decided to take a first flight and then append a revision period , which we have done .	-3.3223
This is done throughout the flight programme .	-2.2429
The second of five test aircraft is expected to start in the next few weeks , the remaining shortly afterwards , it was said by the company .	-4.6737
Nevertheless , analysts remain skeptical whether the first customer can start a CSeries aircraft twelve months after the virgin flight .	-4.1847
Bombardier explained that it will check the planning for commissioning ( EIS ) and update it in the coming months .	-3.2859
“ The slow progress of the flight test – even if it appears to be equivalent to bombardiers ’ internal planning – reinforces our view that commissioning is shifting until the first quarter of 2015 , ” said Doerksen . to the of to the of from the of the to to to to to the . to	-12.3421
In the third quarter , at the end of September 30 , Bombardier ’ s net profit fell to $ 147 million , respectively 8 cents per share of $ 172 million , respectively 9 cents per share a year earlier .	-3.7886
The adjusted profit per share is unchanged 9 cents .	-2.6250
Sales declined slightly and declined from $ 4.2 billion to $ 4.1 billion .	-2.5362
Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and a turnover of $ 4.56 billion , according to Thomson Reuters I / B / E / S.	-2.6459

Bombardier , the world ’ s largest railway manufacturer , announced that sales in this sector increased by just under 11 % to $ 2.1 billion .	-15.3577
The order book in the transport sector was $ 32.6 billion on 30 September , slightly increasing compared to 31 December .	-3.2270
The profit margin in the field of transport has been affected by settlement problems with some major contracts .	-3.5608

A well-known criminal defender who warned a drug baron of a major police investigation because he was afraid that his secret drug addiction could be revealed was sentenced to three years in prison .	-3.5292
Basharat Ditta , 42 , supplied underworld size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about its drug trafficking activities after being compromised by his own cocaine addiction .	-3.6661
The Bash lawyer , prized by criminalists as “ first-class ” , was arrested in his house in 2011 after the police Scarborough , whom he had represented in an earlier drug procedure .	-5.4097
Officials watched how Scarborough ( 32 ) delivered three bags of cocaine at the house of the lawyer in Blackburn , Lancashire , while he was with colleagues at a meal of the Bar Chamber .	-3.7501

Today , Ditta , who works for Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn , was found guilty and condemned at the Liverpool Crown Court after a three-week trial in two charges for obstructing the judiciary .	-4.1796
He admitted cocaine ownership in an earlier survey .	-3.3619
The lawyer was transferred after the police discovered in their investigations against Scarborough that in February 2011 he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta .	-3.6102
Two investigators followed the suspect and saw how he went to Ditta ’ s house and put drugs under the lawyer ’ s waste tonne with a purity of 60 % in a black golf glove .	-4.1367
Shortly after delivering the drugs , Scarborough regularly called Ditta at dinner at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park .	-3.3471
The lawyer returned home , brought the drugs and then nine communications were exchanged between the two .	-3.1855
It became known in court that Ditta was a “ regular consumer ” of cocaine after testing class A drugs had been discovered in his hair , wallet , and credit cards .	-3.8517
Ditta was later arrested , but disputed , to take cocaine and said that he had spoken to the alleged dealer because he was his client , claiming that her discussion was subject to “ lawyer secrecy . ”	-4.9054
During his arrest , Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards , but they were guaranteed and he was taken from a hair sample .	-3.3627
He stated in the police interrogation that he was running an office and client at home for legal matters , both under his private address and at work .	-20.4568
It became known in court that he called on important actors in drug trafficking , some of which he had previously represented , for significant arrests and informed what the investigators knew about them .	-4.9889
Public Prosecutor Anne Whyte said , “ A criminal lawyer should know better than anyone else that the law is not breaking . ”	-2.8478
Ditta is charged with the abuse of his position as a criminal defender because he is too much involved with certain clients .	-4.0293
The relationship in question is not simply that of a drug trafficker , but a drug trafficker who supplies his lawyer with drugs .	-2.6783
Part of his communications was undoubtedly legitimate , because he was the lawyer of these people .	-3.0818
But that went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between lawyer and client .	-2.2614
He counteracted police investigations as far as possible , so that they could continue to investigate their criminal activities .	-3.5680
Mr Ditta discredited his profession .	-2.9492
He was too close to certain clients , especially Scarborough , and he allowed his independence to be compromised .	-1.8747
Ditta pointed out every mistake and claimed , “ If I were a corrupt lawyer , which I am not , and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough , I would not wait 15 hours , but do it immediately . ”	-4.8764
But , after the hearing , Superintendent Lee Halstead of the police in Lancashire said : “ Mr Ditta has taken the step from a criminal defender to a criminal at the moment he began to acquire drugs from organized criminals . ”	-3.4930
His cocaine dependence led to a hopeless compromise and made him susceptible to the motives of leading members of organised crime who commissioned him to obtain valuable information on police investigations .	-3.7982
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure public confidence and confidence .	-1.9246
Ditta has lagged behind this trust and attempted to hide behind the fa<unk>ade of his profession .	-3.6286
The Serious and Organised Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigations against Ditta , which also led to a conviction in three cases because of the possession of cocaine and judicial disability , which underlines our determination to bring criminals to justice .	-3.9017
This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that none can escape the arm of the law .	-2.9725
We will find you and bring you to court .	-2.2310
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after declaring himself guilty of the conspiracy of heroin , cocaine , and cannabis trade .	-2.7219
Thirty-five others involved in drug trafficking — persons were sentenced to 153 years for drug offences .	-4.6152
On his website , Ditta published an area of questions and answers about himself , in which he stated that his dream job was to represent clients in the death cell in America , his ultimate guest at dinner was Mohammed Ali and inequality of opportunity was the motivation for his work .	-20.1957
Revolutionary Church Music	-1.4169
To complete the celebrations of its 160th anniversary , the song range Dunningen will surround two worship services with the " Deutsche Messe " by Franz Schubert .	-4.6262
After the great success of the musical " Rock my Life " , which spectators enthusiastically inspired this spring , the song wrance will enrich two worship services with the performance of the German Fair of Franz Schubert at the end of the anniversary year .	-6.0044
On Saturday , October 26 , this extraordinary trade fair will be heard from 19 at the evening fair in the St. Martin Church of Dunningen and on Sunday , October 27 , from 10.15 a.m. at the service at the St. John 's Baptist Church in Lackendorf .	-5.7403
The so-called Deutsche Messe with the original title " Gesange zur Feier des holiges Victims der Messe " , D 872 , is a spiritual music work by the composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was considered almost revolutionary at the time of the origin .	-4.7988
The trade fair is listed within the framework of worship services , as the client Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind .	-4.2246
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider , the choir is accompanied by the brass group of the Musikverein Frohsinn Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi at the organ .	-3.0347
Haslach : Skepticism Gives Growing Confidence	-3.7132
The 2015 parish council elections will , for example , change fundamental changes in the Haslach ( SE ) Sea Organization .	-4.5192
There is only one common parish council for all six parishes .	-2.4728
At a joint meeting on Saturday , the Haslach , Hofstetten , Mühlenbach , Fischerbach , Steinach and Welschensteinach prepared for change .	-2.7107
There is nothing more to change the basic decisions of the diocese and it is up to the parish councils to implement them as satisfactorily as possible .	-4.2751
Over the course of the day , it became particularly clear : skepticism about the new is hesitant but increasingly confident .	-5.1140
From the ideas and expectations of the innovations in 2015 to concrete proposals on the future composition and the size of the parish council , the extremely constructive discussions of the six bodies with the main officials of the Seelsorgeteam ranged .	-4.7939
Regional Dean Georg Schmitt explained the newly drafted guidelines for sea organisations in the Archdiocese of Freiburg .	-4.1990
After that , SE Haslach , as a parish of churches , will form a public body that will enter into the rights and obligations of the six individual church communities . to date , the of the churof the of the of the of the of of the of the of of of the of the churof the chur.	-26.2674
There will only be a joint parish council and a board of foundations in which the priest is represented .	-3.6600
At least two elected members are to be represented from each parish , in which six parishes are formed locally known as municipal teams .	-4.5016
Their task will be to promote church life in the place in the future .	-3.0156
On the question of the finances of the individual parish , considerable discussion was then required .	-5.1808
The innovations stipulate that accumulated credits remain intended for purpose in the parishes .	-4.8465
By contrast , the liabilities pass to the general community .	-3.5676
There were great concerns , particularly with regard to the major planned investments , the commitment of which will then be made by all parishes .	-5.8112
" In the past , too , investment was only made in projects that could be managed by the individual parishes alone " , relativised Haslach 's parish chairman , Bruno Prinzbach .	-5.2658
Practical experience with a common body for five parishes described Barbar Knights , the chairman of the body in the Seelsorgeunit Schutterwald-Neuried .	-16.1050
They had made themselves the task of ' becoming one , remaining five ' in 2006 and found that this is not so easy .	-5.2013
The bodies of the Haslach Sea Care Unit then answered questions about the future composition and size of the joint parish council and the practical work of the municipal teams .	-4.5226
The preparations will be specified at further meetings and decided at another joint meeting of all six bodies next spring .	-4.4188
In the end , the parish council Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the sea care unit , which was approved by a clear majority .	-4.3166
In Pfullendorf , the electricity is expensive	-3.3705
The citizens of Pfullendorf must adapt to higher electricity costs .	-2.3712
As the CEO of the City Works , Jörg-Arne Bias , confirmed against the S<unk>DKURIER , a four-person Pfullendorfer family costs 70 to 90 euros per year .	-5.3943
The main reason for the upcoming price increase is the rise in the so-called EEC level from 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt hour .	-3.1731
This payment is redefined every year in October by the four operators of the large streets .	-4.4458
These quantify the additional costs they incur from the energy turnaround , which they can collect through a surcharge over the price of electricity .	-22.6502
The town works of Pfullendorf form the last link in this chain . to the from the to the .	-16.7495
The Supervisory Board of the Energy Company had even assumed a higher levy in its forecasts , as Jörg-Arne Bias reports .	-3.2580
Now the concrete payments would have to be calculated before next week city plants could inform their customers about the exact price increase .	-4.4123
" We start from an increase of 1 cent plus x , " said Bias , with the number more close to the 2 cents .	-4.0077
Permanent red traffic lights	-3.9514
Sometimes a traffic light simply will not be green .	-2.3884
The contact loop in the street does not react , or the light sign is broken .	-2.9638
What should be done - driving in red ?	-4.7630
If a person has been waiting long enough at a red traffic light and the intersection is free , he can continue , explains the Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine " Motorrad " .	-4.3534
However , waiting time must be ' appropriate ' , which can be interpreted differently from one case to another .	-4.3452
Becker advises you to stay at least five minutes before you can assume that the traffic light is disturbe. to to the . to to to to the . to to the .	-14.2274
However , if you continue the journey despite red light , you should be aware that it is fully responsible for an accident caused by it .	-5.7135
Anyone who tolerates less than five minutes may not wait long enough , warns Becker and refers to a decision by the Upper Land Court of Hamm .	-3.7759
In the negotiated case , a driver had ignored the traffic light after about three minutes and had to be responsible for a negligent breach of red light .	-4.1417
After all , the traffic light was not defective , but skipped little later on to green .	-4.9105
A driving ban was spared because of the special situation - but the fine was not .	-5.1843
Municipal Council is pleased with sound budget	-3.8902
Whenever the budget is at stake in municipal councils , Mayor Ralph Gerster has laughed well .	-3.4416
The municipal bag in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled , and the administration has not known since 2005 .	-3.4618
The 2012 financial year can also be booked in this sense as a full success .	-3.7078
This became clear in the presentation of the annual accounts for 2012 .	-3.1015
As Andrea Rothmund said , the administrative budget of around EUR 7.6 million was more than EUR 1 million planned .	-3.0120
The surplus of the administrative budget is also about EUR 1.8 million above the approach .	-3.1334
The surplus is mainly due to higher commercial tax revenues and the community 's share of income tax .	-3.9968
The asset budget was also well above the planned values .	-3.1274
Instead of the EUR 1.5 million earmarked last year , it was EUR 2.5 milli.	-2.3064
" This is essentially due to the higher administrative budget inflation , " says Rothmund .	-3.7378
With less investment than planned in the 2012 financial year , reserve incentives have also been higher .	-4.1368
In total , the overall reserve could be increased by around EUR 2.1 million to a total of EUR 4.9 million . from to . to the to the from to . to the to to the .	-15.1472
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for their good work .	-1.7387
" Such a work is not simply shaken out of the sleeve , " praised Gerster with a view to the annual accounts .	-4.4512
He and the local councils were clearly pleased with the good figures .	-3.2743
It may sound paradoxical , but it is precisely these good figures that citizens could soon be expensive .	-3.7037
Thanks to its financial position , the municipality has been able to abandon high levels of lifting in the past .	-5.4297
But , according to Gerster , this has often reduced the country ’ s grant .	-15.2121
There are prerequisites for these subsidies from various compensatory sticks .	-3.7663
Among other things , cities and communities that apply for grants must show certain levels of lifting .	-4.2754
" We need to look at the issue of lifting , because in the coming years investments are due , for which we would like subsidies , " Gerster announced in this context .	-5.4829
Nagold : Hugo Wermter for 60 years in Choir	-11.3091
With 60 years as a singer , Hubert Wermter ’ s history is almost twice as long as the autumn festival , during which he was solemnly honorhonored at at .	-15.4597
Hubert Wermter stood as usual in the colours of his men ’ s vocal association .	-3.7022
Even after 60 years , he still enjoys singing with the choir that has been won more than liked .	-6.3796
Wermter was also active in the association , including 28 years as a member of the committee .	-2.8856
He received several awards for his commitment and association : Jörg Kohr , pastoral speaker on behalf of the Cacilienverband Rottenburg-Stuttgart , handed him a document of the association and an honorary letter signed by Bishop Gebhard Prince .	-5.2659

The men 's vocal association Betra also sang classical choral songs like " Jägerwerben " by Julius Wengert , " Weit , far away " by Hubert Goisern and the folk song " When you go through the valley " .	-4.0225
With its mixed choir and women 's group - the " Impulschor " - the women 's quota of the festival , the Salzstetten song range ensured .	-6.1755
The mixed choir kidnapped with the Neapolitan people " Santa Lucia " and " Eviva Espana " by Antos Gus in foreign countries , while the " Impulschor " also resorted to foreign languages : " Liberatio " and " Hey Jude " belonged to their program .	-4.0998
The singer department of the Baising Sports Association came back to local films with " What is the Schwob ? " by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Pappert 's " Bierlied " , where the Vollmaringer Musikverein offered the crowning musical degree .	-5.3742
For the children there was a small by-programme - " Oma Hanne " alias Hannelore Stollsteimer performed a casperl theatre and read out a few stories that the children worked well for lunch .	-4.7964

Kenya ’ s Press Outrages of ConMMMin . from to . from to . from to . in in	-14.1869
‘ We are in a frightening situation and we must ask ourselves : what prevents Parliament from simply abolishing judicial independence tomorrow ? ’ was read in the newspaper that considers the draft law to be unconstitutional .	-14.4362
“ The law is draconian and very punishable , and we reject it , ” said Cyrus Kamau , Managing Director of the Capital Group , including CapitalFM , one of the most prestigious independent radio stations and news sites in Kenya .	-12.3937
He said that the new media centre “ will always be biased , because it is an extended arm of government , ” and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya ’ s position in the global economy .	-3.3780
“ I hope the President listens to us and we call on him to reject this draft law and return it to Parliament , ” he said .	-20.8566
According to the newspaper The Star , the government , through the new law , “ takes the media effectively into a stranglehold , ” whereas The Standard , Democracy , and Freedom of Speech in Kenya “ suffered a serious blow , ” calling the draft “ draconian . ”	-5.4257
The adoption of the law is part of a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security following the attacks by armed Islamists at the Westgate shopping centre in September .	-3.5477
The Kenyan media raised the authorities ’ anger because they published pictures of security cameras on which the units sent to the center supposedly robbed the luxurious shopping centre .	-5.2175
Police chief David Kimaiyo reacted to this by appointing two journalists and a leading media representative , even though the submission was withdrawn after a cry from the media .	-4.3271
According to the new law , media houses can be punished with a penalty of up to 20 million Kenyan schillings , and individual journalists with up to one million and the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation .	-4.3325
The tribunal also has the right to seize the possession of those affected if a penalty is not paid .	-2.9915
According to Daily Nation , “ a single punishment can push most radio stations into bankruptcy . ”	-2.4158
Moreover , the newspaper believes that these measures could have a devastating impact on the Kenyan “ lively blogosphere . ”	-3.5243
If they silence the media , politicians could do impunity whatever they want .	-2.2523
“ No one will ever know , ” wrote Mutuma Mathiu , a journalist with the nation , who calls the Kenyan media a crucial control factor in public life .	-3.8813
“ If politicians are left to themselves , they lead the country into bankruptcy and return to the time of hunters and collectors , ” he commented .	-3.7557
The Kenyan legislators have already raised public anger in the past .	-3.0255

Bad Dürrheim : A Dream Gets True for the FC	-2.4663
Despite the cold weather and rain , the official inauguration ceremony for the artificial grass sports square did not cost anything .	-6.5888

Both have been rejected .	-1.8220
Six years ago , ideas came up to create an artificial grass sports place , which was generally considered the ultimate solution .	-4.4193
Specific plans were included two years ago , when the FC took over the Schabelstube in Erbpacht , promised a cost share of EUR 100 000 for the construction of the place and approved funding of EUR 104 000 .	-4.5018

Creating a more relaxed atmosphere is the aim of this innovation .	-2.3631
As Airport spokesperson Peter Kleemann announced towards Radio Vienna , Vienna Airport is following an international trend with the recruitment of personal individuals .	-4.7370

By eliminating these allowances - on average , around 200 personal calls by the speakers on one day - it will be more calm in the future at the airport .	-6.6468

According to Lexicon , Déjà Vu is a psychological phenomenon that expresses itself in the feeling of having experienced or seen a new situation .	-3.8958
In the event of a visit to the café of the same name at the Opschlag in the district town of Kleve in sight of the Rhein-Waal University it does not have to stay with the pure Déjà Vu feeling .	-5.8954
After all , the café with its beautiful name is designed to make a real stay not only thoughtful , but always repeatable .	-6.8572
Because it is fun and simply beautiful .	-3.0078
A look at the inner life at Opschlag 8 gives the viewer a good feeling at once .	-3.5921
The state-of-the-art but not cool café ambience looks like a place to feel good .	-3.0667
The team spoils the guest with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the top with a variety of coffee or cocktail options .	-3.7663
There are delicious cakes or individually occupied fresh baguettes .	-3.8551
The owners , both 33 years old , already made a name before the opening of the decorative café at the Opschlag as a gastronomer : in Kranenburg they managed the " Art Lounge " .	-5.5425
From the move to Kleve to the Opschlag , the friendly café lovers hope for more audiences .	-4.2311
Last but not least , the university .	-3.4225

UN announces new targets in the fight against poverty	-2.8466
The United Nations is now beginning to draw up a series of new objectives to replace the Millennium Development Goals announced 12 years ago to combat poverty .	-3.7046
In the run-up to the UN Sustainable Development Summit , which began in the evening in Rio de Janeiro , Australian diplomats played a key role in advancing “ Sustainable Development Goals ” to replace the Millennium Goals expiring in 2015 .	-3.2504
They were included in the final draft document adopted by world leaders , including Mrs Gillard , at the summit .	-2.4834
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon declared at the summit in the evening that the time had come to “ think beyond national interests . ”	-2.8985
“ I am pleased that member states have agreed to start a process to agree on universal , sustainable development goals , ” he said .	-3.5191
“ These objectives will be based on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and will form an integral part of the post-2015 development framework .	-3.0259
I will spare no effort to implement this mandate given to me by the member states to achieve our vision of the sustainable development goals based on the success of the Millennium Goals . ”	-3.7341
Although the SG Achim / Baden has been without victory for four days , there is still a good mood among the handball top ligists .	-5.3172
Trainer Tomasz Malmon leaves no doubt about this at all .	-12.9847
All are still fully motivated in the case .	-3.3233
However , I hope that we will finally win again .	-2.4232
" Because I don 't know how a victory tastes , " Malmon expects a success experience from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II .	-3.8184
Although the third-league reserve from Fredenbeck has not yet ejected trees , Malmon warns the finger in advance .	-4.8486
Many players have trained in A-Youth myself .	-3.5234
Therefore , they will surely be particularly motivated against their ex-coach .	-13.3014
" In addition , we must wait to see whether there is still reinforcement from the first , " explains the SG-Coach .	-5.8834
To finally return to the track of success , the Malmon team certainly needs to increase compared to the previous appearances .	-15.8557
Above all , it happened massively in covering and switching .	-5.5882
Opportunities also definitely need to be improved .	-2.9437
Therefore , I hope that my players have finally got their heads free during the short break .	-11.8512
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing in the face of clashes between influential personalities	-2.3818
Thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo under the vigilant eyes of the statue of Samora Machel , the founder of the state and the first president of Mozambique to vote for peace calls in a rare public demonstration .	-4.1743
“ We want peace again , we want stability , ” said Vanessa de Sousa , Managing Director of an investment company .	-1.8604
For fear of the country ’ s future , she exchanged her business clothing for a t-shirt with the title “ We demand security ” in Portuguese and joined the capital ’ s independence square on Thursday .	-5.0820
For two weeks , there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and renamo , among the worst battles since the peace agreement over 20 years ago .	-3.6954
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement that was initially supported by the White Rhodesia and later by the apartheid government of South Africa in an effort to destabilize the country ’ s independent government .	-3.6724
After the 1992 peace treaty , it became an opposition party .	-2.1801
Analysts consider it unlikely that the country will fall back into a full-scale conflict , but recent events have worried foreign investors and locals . to the of to the .	-28.0763
There is a great deal at stake in the fast-growing economy , because discovering huge gas deposits off the coast and coal camps in the northwest could bring investment of more than $ 50 billion from companies such as Rio Tinto , Vale from Brazil , Eni from Italy , and Anadarko from the US over the next few years .	-5.2574
The ruling Frelimo Party , the dominant force since 1975 , and Renamo blame each other for tensions .	-2.4451
Renamo claims that the government has provoked recent clashes by attacking its members in the province of Sofala , a traditional Renamos Castle on October 17 .	-3.2183
The attacks on the former rebels escalated when government forces attacked Renamo bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama , the leader of the group , Renamo ’ s spokesman against the Financial Times .	-3.1947
The government blames Renamo for the clashes and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers .	-2.2402
President Armando Guebuza has tried to downplay concerns about instability .	-1.9618
To AFP , the French news agency , he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama regards himself as “ losers , ” who wants to use “ all his remaining forces to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government . ”	-4.0538
Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they want to avoid war .	-1.8460
But concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted in the words that Renamo abandoned the 1992 peace agreement .	-2.7286
He declared to the FT that he meant that Frelimo no longer respected the agreement .	-3.0433
“ Our vision is to resume negotiations seriously , ” said Mazanga .	-2.1050
Previous discussions between the parties have done little to resolve the tensions fueled by a number of clashes this year .	-3.1159
“ We have two adult men here ( Guebuza and Dhlakama ) who clash the heads , ” says Joseph Hanlon , lecturer at the Open University and Mozambique expert .	-3.4697
None of them is good in negotiations and none is prepared to make the necessary concessions .	-2.6768
Renamo , pushing for electoral reforms , has already said that she will boycott the local elections in November .	-2.9105
Presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for next year .	-1.9747
Some commentators have interpreted the use of force as an attempt by a poor movement to obtain concessions and financial benefits from the government .	-2.7602
Renamo ’ s electoral successes have shrinked since 1992 , while a newer party , founded by a former Renamo member , Movimento Democrático de Mo<unk>ambique ( MDM ) , is likely to improve in the elections . to the of to the of in in . to the in in	-9.7366
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – whose resignation is due when his second term ends next year – wants to destroy the country ’ s democracy .	-2.6585
“ He does not want multiparty democracy , he does not want transparent elections , he does not want peace because he does not want to give up the presidency , ” says Mazanga .	-2.7605
It is unclear what capacity Renamo has , but it has attacked unrest on police stations and vehicles on an important north-south link .	-4.2057
Most battles took place in the province of Sofala , which is located a few hundred kilometres north of Maputo , but in which Beira is located , the port , the mining companies like Rio Tinto and Vale to export coal .	-4.6717
In June , Rio interrupted the use of the railway for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the track .	-2.9927
Mazanga reserved for the question of whether Renamo would repeat this threat .	-3.2929
Renamo wanted to “ warn the international community that things are not good in Mozambique , ” said Mazanga .	-1.8878
Instability has increased frustration with the government , says Fernando Lima , head of Mediacoop , an independent media company , because many people have already worried about corruption , slow progress in development , and a recent wave of abduction .	-3.5888
“ People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country and should be the one who finds solutions to the problems , ” he explains .	-2.8426
Omar Sultane , a demonstrator , said that people simply wanted stability .	-1.5665
“ No one is interested in Renamo and Frelimo , they just want peace and usable roads , ” he explained .	-2.9246
Children should be taught myths and legends as “ models for life , ” an author says .	-3.0228
The stories of Thor showed that “ brutal force has no chance against clever tricks , ” and the Artus legend demonstrate how important it is to have a dream .	-2.6200
But many myths are “ far too wild , too offensive , and , in some cases , too dirty to be taught at schools , ” why Crossley-Holland advocated a “ careful selection ” of old works .	-3.6285
“ I find it wonderful that myths and folklore are already part of education in America , ” he said .	-2.2954
I have been proposing this as a plan for twenty years .	-2.4467
He added that in authors and teachers who are “ excessively didactic , ” children would “ completely switch off , ” because in entertaining stories , the messages would be “ sublime . ”	-4.6997
Crossley-Holland , who has translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon , and who is the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myth and the British Folk Tales , said : “ You can pursue certain intentions , but you should keep them in the background . ”	-3.7936
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author writing for adults , and an author writing for children is the need to give hope .	-15.9397
Not everything must be simplified or lead to the happy end , but there is an immanent sense of good and evil .	-2.2988
This must be presented underground , revealed by history and not explained .	-3.9941
This is the old story of showing rather than narrating .	-2.6251
Hansjakob moves again in Freihof	-3.0685
100 years ago , Heinrich Hansjakob moved to Haslach , and on Sunday his last years became alive in the " Freihof " .	-4.3950
The many spectators were enthusiastic about the very short scene game .	-3.1047
From the arrival to the award of honor citizenship to his death , screenwriter and Hansjakob actor Alois Kraftzcyk designed an entertaining piece of applause under the direction of Cornelia People .	-4.5314
Marcus Zagermann took the audience as spokesman through the ten different scenes , explained relationships and bridged time-jumps from youth to approaching retirement .	-3.6113
On October 22 , 1913 Hansjakob comes home in his children ’ s sky , in his free courtyard .	-3.9005
And then began the scene game in which Alois Krafczyk once again shined in his paraderrole as a great son of the city .	-3.2697
Stilecht drove with the two-spanner and " Black Forest " by Erich Becherer from Mühlenbach .	-4.3506
He was not only welcomed by the audience with a lot of applause , but also welcomed his sister Philippine .	-3.7515
Billy Sum-Hermann understood it incredibly well to take part in the role of the sister and lent her in mimics and gestures enormous life .	-15.0283
Between the individual game scenes , the Mühlenbach Farmer Chapel played selected pieces of music and completed the performance .	-4.7192
Haslach ’ s mayor , Heinz Winkler , gave himself the honor of honorary citizenship , who , in representation of the former owner , Hättich , together with a part of the city council , made his appearance .	-7.1297
Their expectation then made the three-queen singers who caused Hansjakob to declare : " Oh how beautiful , there are again youth memories of my own three-queen age " .	-5.9191
With their song " O Jesulein " they enjoyed the audience in the Freihof as well as the children of storks with their loud " Exit , Exit " .	-5.5589
His criticism of the Official Church expressed Hansjakob just as much as his concerns about the excesses in agriculture , the consequences of industrialization , or the effects of war .	-4.5782
In his homeland , behind his grave chapel on the fire near Hofstetten , he found his resting place .	-3.7698
" A troubled spirit had finally found its peace and had gone home for ever , " said it at the end of the scene game .	-3.9849
There was a lot of applause and many praising words from the audience for the performance .	-3.1092

Nevertheless , a first breathing was not heard from Ludwigsburg .	-3.0947

Unfortunately , in the case of unfavourable winds , this is widely heard - and there have already been some complaints from people from the city north .	-5.2005
He takes the complaints very seriously and has therefore contacted those affected , says the 40-year-old .	-3.4328
In close consultation with the authorities , we are now keeping the warning signals quieter with technical measures .	-3.1639
He will continue to rely on open dialogue with neighbours .	-3.2261
Because Matthias Schrell still has some things in front of the site .	-3.2082
With the expansion of the Lower Saxony Bridge , Rhenus Midgard continues to rely on coal imports for power plants and is one of the biggest in Europe in this secsector . to the of from to in from to in to . to to	-11.9459
Thanks to the sunbathing bath in front of the terminal , Capesize Bulkcarrier can be handled here for a long time .	-5.0100
" This year we want to crack the 3-million tonne brand in the envelope , " says Schrell .	-4.5081
In addition to the Eon power plant on the ground , import coal goes to power plants in the inland .	-4.0769
If the GDF Suez power station is still on the net , around 5 million tonnes of coal imports per year are realistic .	-4.2055
The three ship loaders on the bridge and the second band could create up to 10 million .	-2.8891
Bavaria ’ s Basketballer Optimistic Despite the First Defeat	-2.6970
Even the first defeat in the Euroleague could not diminish the huge optimism among the basketballers of the FC Bayern Munich .	-3.3383
" Nobody can forbid us to believe in winning against the best team in Europe over the past two years , " Bavarian coach Svetislav Pesic accounted for after the unfortunate 83 : 88 ( 39 : 47 ) on Thursday evening at title defender Olympiakos Piraeus .	-4.7059
We sent the message : Basketball also exists in Munich !	-11.3258
At its first third appearance in the European royal class , Munich sold itself very well for a long time , but were simply not clarified enough during the crucial phases .	-5.5598
The guests initially created the piece of art to convert a 15-point backlog 13 minutes before the end into a guided tour before Piraeus returned to the game .	-4.9871
" We have fought incredibly back against the two-time Euroleague champion , but then again made sensitive mistakes , " said Bavarian professional Yassin Idbihi .	-3.9802
We are proud of our performance , but we want to win every game .	-2.0062

Ben Greenman : Ten years of New York Comedy Festival : The New Yorker	-1.4504
One might say that New York City is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America : almost a hundred years ago , the varietal artist Frank Fay , who worked as conférencier in the Palace Theatre on Broadway , began to tell the crowd directly jokes in the form of a conversation .	-4.5002
Over the years , Fay ’ s innovation has been expanded , as last at the New York Comedy Festival .	-3.5132
Created and led by Caroline Hirsch , the founder of the stand-up institution Carolines , this year the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary with over sixty shows in small clubs and large theatres .	-3.8376
“ Most of these headliners began with Carolines and became more and more successful until they were known at some point to perform in a club , ” said Hirsch .	-4.1368
We have designed this festival so that we can continue to work with them .	-2.5971
This year ’ s event includes performances by Wanda Sykes , Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher , as well as by “ Stand Up for Heroes ” , an annual music and comedy benefit event for army veterans in the Madison Square Garden , which includes Bruce Springsteen , Jon Stewart , Roger Waters and Bill Cosby .	-4.2101
With the festival the world of comedy has grown .	-2.7080
A number of comedians participating in the festival have become known about more unconventional ways , such as broadcasts on smaller television channels such as Comedy Central , FX and Spike .	-3.9880
Nick Kroll became known on cable TV with a sitcom ( the ironic fantasy football series " The League " on FXX ) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central .	-3.5289
Jenny Slate was part of the occupation at “ Saturday Night Live ” and “ Parks and Recreation ” , although she is best known for her viral series “ Marcel the Shell with Shoes On ” .	-3.7946
Both Kroll and Slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices ( the surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik , the ironic W. Kaumau Bell , focused on racial issues ) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy .	-3.1958
One of the biggest visitor magnets of the festival is an interview : David Steinberg speaks to Larry David .	-3.0768
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian , but has become a prestigious television and film director and an unofficial comedy historian .	-2.9435
From 2005 to 2007 he moderated a television show entitled “ Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg ” at TV Land .	-2.6583
The meeting will take place at the Town Hall in the middle of Manhattan .	-2.4668
“ The city is definitely in the comedy-DNA of Larry ’ s entire work , ” said Steinberg .	-2.7026
He told me when he is here , then sometimes he goes through the street between two buildings and thinks : Hey , if I lose all my money , then perhaps I live here .	-3.3861

The body was found on the following night in the village of Cerro Pelado , 15 kilometres north of the exclusive beach resort Punta del Este .	-3.2635
As an alibi , a five-year-old half-sister of the young , who had taken them along , should say that she was sexually attacked by the boy .	-15.4698
But when the girl described the death before the police without mentioning an attack against them , the two boys admitted the deliberate killing of the 11-year-old .	-4.2400
Among other reasons , the elderly called a rivalry in football .	-3.3401
He was provisionally delivered to a psychiatric youth institution .	-3.6101
Pimps Must Prison	-2.8634
Due to exploitative trafficking in human beings , pimps , threats , insults and dangerous body injury , the Landgericht Konstanz sentenced a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen to three and a half years in prison .	-4.3398
The former Federal Armed Forces soldier , who worked as a doorstep after two operations in Afghanistan , confessed in a process agreement .	-4.3699
So in five cases he met women via Internet or telephone contacts , which he sent on the stroke after a few weeks against their will .	-4.6741
He resisted breaking violence and threats .	-2.2925

Together with a colleague who conveyed women , he brought them to various brothels in the southwest .	-3.6108
He partly monitored them there to control their revenue .	-4.4116
In court , the defendant first claimed that he was suffering from a serious trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan had died next to him in an explosion .	-18.3585
After a psychiatric expert suggested great doubt about the mental restriction and hence a limited guilt capacity , the 33-year-old made a comprehensive confession .	-5.5579
The court neither of the damaged women had to hear anymore . to the of to .	-15.7375
As a Kripo official reported , at least four other cases of exploitative trafficking in human beings could be identified after a first ad through telephone surveillance measures .	-4.5463

Oil prices continue to go to USD 96 per barrel	-3.5565
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday , after concerns about a high supply overshadowed a report that China ’ s energy-hungry manufacturing sector is growing .	-3.8002
The reference cavity for deliveries in December had fallen by 14 cents to USD 96.24 per barrel in Europe late morning in electronic commerce on the New York Mercantile Exchange .	-4.3639
The contract fell by 39 cents on Thursday , which meant a 5.8 % decline in October .	-2.7213
The large supply of crude oil has burdened prices in recent weeks .	-3.0561
The US Department of Energy declared on Wednesday that the US offer increased by 4.1 million barrels last week .	-2.2514
Over the course of five weeks , the supply had risen by 25 million barrels .	-2.9464
But on Friday there were references to stronger demand through two reports of an increase in activity in Chinese manufacturing .	-3.7027
This indicates a continued recovery of China ’ s economy , whose growth increased to 7.8 % in the third quarter , after reaching the lowest level in the previous quarter in two decades .	-4.0203
Crude oil from Brent , a reference value for international crude oil , also used by US refineries , fell at the ICE Exchange in London by 26 cents to USD 108.58 per barrel .	-3.1630
Court blocks the NYPD ’ s Stop and Frisk Directive	-2.4848
On Thursday , a federal appeal court in the US blocked the order of a judge who had called for changes to the Stop and Frisk Program ( “ Stop and Browse ” ) of the New York Police Department , and released the judge from the case .	-4.8180
The 2nd US Court of Appeal declared that the decisions of Judge Shira Scheindlin would be suspended until a decision was taken to appeal the city .	-4.4170
The judge had judged in August that the city violated the Constitution with the way in which the programme for stopping and consulting persons was implemented .	-4.2088
The city appealed against its assessment and the ordered remedies , including the decision to set up a monitoring body to help the police amend their directive and the relevant training programme .	-4.3403
On Tuesday , the Court of Appeals heard the arguments for suspension .	-3.2676
The appeal report declared that the judge should be released from the case because she infringed the Code of Conduct for US judges by determining that a judge should avoid the appearance of partiality ; this was partly justified by a series of media interviews and public statements in which she had reacted publicly to the criticism of the Court .	-5.9981
The judge had judged that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people because they target inappropriately black and Latin American men with the Stop and Frisk programme .	-3.5314
It appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of major changes , including reforms in directives , training and service supervision , and arranged a pilot program with cameras carried on the body in quarters where most controls were carried out .	-4.1895
In August , the city of New York agreed to stop the practice of storing names and addresses of people released after police control .	-3.4039
An oral negotiation on the appeal of the city is planned after March 14 , 2014 .	-2.8243
The stop-and-frisk tactics have been criticized by a number of civil rights proponents .	-13.6923
Such controls have been in various forms for decades , but the number of controls recorded increased during the term of the non-party mayor Michael Bloomberg to an all-time high of 684,330 in 2011 , most of them black and Latin American men .	-3.9289
In 2004 , four men belonging to all minorities filed a complaint that became a collective action .	-4.3130
Advocates of changes to the NYPD ’ s stop-and-frisk programme say that changes will end unfair practices and create a more trustworthy and effective police force , and influence the way other police presidents use the regulation .	-4.3718
Opponents believe that the changes would dampen the morality of the police , but not crime ; neither would money be wasted and the broader problem of a police force that is under pressure after thousands of jobs have been abolished over the last decade .	-5.2587
The judge pointed out that she did not end the stop-and-frisk practice , which is constitutional , but only reform the way the NYPD carries out the controls .	-15.8452

With this Bedouin wisdom , the first chairman Wolfgang Henne described the history and fascination of the association " Helping Hands " .	-2.4195
On Saturday afternoon the tenth birthday of the association , which can already have significant successes , was celebrated .	-3.8216
The first Chairman Henne reported in detail on the work of the association .	-2.7564
He himself was the first time in Mauritania in the Cheijk-Zajed hospital in Nouakchott in 2004 .	-2.4875
As a result , further cooperation developed , and the gynaecologist Henne performed numerous operations on site on several journeys .	-4.1344
During the speeches , pictures were shown on a large screen so that the guests of the anniversary event could see the actions mentioned .	-5.5022
The desert vehicle of the association was also shown .	-2.0973
It is a former border protection vehicle .	-2.3670
Rainer Prewo , the former OB of Nagold , had made the proposal to equip this vehicle with a photovoltaic plant and now , according to Henne , plans to work with the association in advisory function .	-4.4561
In 2008 , the Schleeh room from Baiersbronn created the Socogim Hospital in Socogim , a district on the outskirts of the capital - voluntary .	-6.0847
Henne also mentioned a new mother child hospital in Nouakchott	-1.7110
Especially interesting in times when the birth clinic is to be removed in Nagold .	-3.6317
One learns a lot in Africa as a medicine , Henne said , for example , de-acceleration against Burn-out .	-4.1871
Due to the political unrest in the country , it was not possible to travel as many as planned , but many medical professionals came to Germany to hospitate here in various areas .	-5.3805
In addition , containers are regularly sent to Africa with material , such as medical equipment , medicines , associated material , hospital beds and glasses in March this year .	-4.1960
Mitinitiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself supplied plenty of local colority by telling Mauritania about Mercedes vehicles converted to the mobile goat stable and describing the experiences of the Stammheim musicians who traditionally support the association during their trip to Mauritania .	-5.2107
As his personal reasons , he called his work in the field of auditing as a young Member .	-4.0594
When he realized how much money was lost , he decided to help Africans control a budget by the people .	-3.1865
Furthermore , foxes emphasized that global economies also demand global love for human beings .	-3.6798

Coulson used telephone hacking to check a tip	-2.1620
The former News of the Word editor Andy Coulson allegedly used “ telephone hacking , monitoring , and confrontation ” to attempt to confirm a wrong tip about an affair of the then Interior Minister , Charles Clarke .	-4.4697
Public Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC declared to the Court in Old Bailey that News of the World heard a mistaken rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with his “ attractive special adviser , ” Hannah Hanto CCCto the in . to the of in in in in . to in in in	-15.8836
The newspaper commissioned private detective Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlby ’ s voicemails , and persecuted them , but Coulson also called them and left news as the court experienced . a from to . to the of the , , to the .	-17.9456
" According to the Public Prosecutor , Coulson , who is now the editor of the NotW , is no one who is facing the apartment of people and hopes to catch them in fresh deed , but one who likes to confront people with a story to see their reaction , " explained Edis .	-5.8840
He said that NotW uses three procedures to investigate stories : telephone hacking , monitoring and confrontation .	-2.4284
The publisher is personally involved in the third method .	-1.4127
Obviously he knows of the second , of monitoring , otherwise it cannot be .	-3.5237
What about the first ?	-1.0119
Do he know about phone hacking ?	-2.1985
He disputes this , but we say , ‘ And whether he knew it ’ .	-11.8384
Rumours about an affair Clarkes were first taken up by the feature editorial of NotW , when a source that was sexually interested in Pawlby was said : “ Do not waste your time , it is associated with Charles . ”	-4.4325
A band with voicemails from their phone of at least three occasions was secured in August 2006 in Mulcaire 's apartment .	-2.9907
The investigators also found entries on the detective computer where Pawlby and her sister were stored as “ projects . ”	-3.1514
At the time of research , Pawlby 's grandparents received anonymous calls in which they were asked for information about them , Edis explained .	-3.9046
Meanwhile , former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup supervised monitoring of Pawlby ’ s movements .	-2.6933
On 18 June 2005 , Coulson left her a voicemail with the following content : “ I have a story that we want to release tomorrow , about which I would like to talk to Charles . ”	-17.0110
Edis said that Coulson ’ s activities in this story followed the same pattern as other important personalities , such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett .	-3.3135
The juries heard on Thursday that Coulson Blunkett faced a married woman because of an affair when he himself was lied with the co-accused Rebekah Brooks who had been married .	-3.7928
Coulson and Brooks dispute having conspired to hack phones between October 3 , 2000 and August 9 , 2006 .	-2.6408
Mulcaire , Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted the phone hacking .	-2.3163
In protest against the planned rich tax , French football will actually go through the first strike since 1972 .	-3.4484
A conciliation meeting will end without result .	-3.4073
In the conflict over the rich tax , the government and professional football in France maneuvered into a dead end after a failed conciliation meeting .	-3.6080
President Fran<unk>ois Hollande received and listened to their complaints at the Paris <unk>lysée Palace .	-3.5546
However , he refused to spare football from the planned 75 % tax on incomes of more than EUR 1 million per year , which all companies in the country will pay for two years from 2014 onwards .	-4.5178
The opposite side remained hard . to to . the to to . to to to . to to to to	-12.1143
The strike announced at the end of November is now going to go through , said the Chief Association of Professional Clubs ( UCPF ) , Jean-Pierre Louvel .	-4.7212

Gechingen : No absolute protection possible	-2.1191
" We want to involve the inhabitants in the planning at an early stage , " opened Mayor Jens Häu<unk>ler the citizen information event on the flood protection concept in Gechingen .	-13.8671
About 80 participants had come to the municipal hall to explain the planned measures , ask questions , express concerns and introduce ideas .	-4.0295
Häu<unk>ler made it clear : " The ultimate decisions are taken by the members of the municipal council " .	-4.2487
The flood that Gechingen met unprepared on 15 May 2009 was a major event that raised the question of protection for the future , says Häusler .	-4.1231
A river area examination was commissioned with neighbouring Aidlingen , which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen .	-3.4110
" The protection of as many built plots as possible is the goal , " says Häu<unk>ler .	-3.6224
The planning of the protection against a German weather service is based on statistical floods to be expected every 100 years .	-4.0214
Climate change is taken into account by a 15 % surcharge .	-2.0742
In specialist circles this is called " HQ 100aKlima " .	-2.6941
The water masses that caused considerable damage in Gechingen in 2009 corresponded to 1000 years of flooding .	-3.6732
" There is no absolute protection , but a relative improvement can be achieved , " says Häusler .	-2.7563
In order to achieve the protection of HQ 100aKlima , some EUR 4 million must be invested in Gechingen , with the municipality expecting some 70 percent national subsidies .	-4.8904
But householders pointed out that there would only be support if an overall concept was implemented .	-4.3599
The municipality needs the participation of its citizens .	-11.5383
An expensive planning and authorisation procedure must be completed .	-2.8232
In the best case , implementation can begin in 2016 .	-2.2419
Among other things , the protection concept , which was presented in the municipal council last week ( we reported ) provides for local measures in the influx of the river Irm from the Stammheim valley .	-4.2818
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept , the participants took the opportunity to introduce their concerns .	-3.2819
Among other things , it was questioned why no more dams and restraint pools were planned to protect the place .	-3.3618
Gregor Kühn , specialist planner of the commissioned engineering office Forest and Corbe from Hügelsheim , who presented the concept , emphasised that it needed the interplay of all the measures presented to achieve the desired goal in sum .	-5.1832
Moreover , the most economic solution is to be found , says Joachim Forest of Forest and Corbe .	-14.6337
There was displeasure among animals of the old town , who , even in normal thunderstorm rains , have suffered from overloading the channel network .	-8.5277
The problem is well known in the administration and first measures have already been taken .	-3.1859
However , householders pointed out that the directives on channel systems are different from those for flood protection and should not be mixed .	-4.5023
The municipality is obliged to interpret the channel network in such a way as to cope with two to three years of rainfall .	-4.5259
More dimensioning sewage channels would devour millions .	-3.5980
Serious injuries after clash	-3.0053
Early Friday afternoon two drivers were seriously injured on the national road 44 near Revensdorf in a frontal collision .	-4.3667
The police immediately completely blocked the road , but initially said little about the accident .	-3.9119
However , there are various testimonies that should be evaluated first .	-3.2777
It is clear that the 19-year-old manager of a VW Golf went towards Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf came to her with his hyundai . to the . the to the to .	-19.4296
Both vehicles collapsed , with the woman being so heavily trapped that the fire brigade needed less than half an hour to free them from the vehicle wreck .	-4.6831
The real cause of the accident was initially unresolved .	-3.2153
Both disasters came to nearby hospitals .	-2.5095
The route remained fully closed for about two hours .	-3.3520

Surprisingly the relationship in the outer : the stinging eyes , the beard , the high forehead .	-4.0446
And just as Fjodor M. Dostojewski and his massive oeuvre can be understood as the founder and apologist of the Russian soul , Philip K. Dick is read as American prophet , who is well known in his own country .	-5.2704
Some titles have been published in Heyne Verlag , the Haffmans cassette with the 118 narratives distributes two thousand.	-3.7849
Dick explains America - the empire of breathtaking technical progress , coupled with paranoia , security delusion , and belief to be chosen .	-3.3774
Dick had goddess experiences , his late books read like a mixture of the revelation of John and a computer manual .	-2.9050
Perhaps he was crazy , drugs had added to his brain .	-2.0500
He has captured early that the computers are divinities .	-3.2297
He wrote a theology of the computer and asked what distinguishes a man from a machine , the creator of his creator .	-3.1203

At the instruction of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection and Combating Terrorism ( BVT ) , the German Interior Intelligence Service , he should photograph the roof of the US outpost , which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank .	-4.2016
According to the German media , the BVT wanted to demonstrate the presence of surveillance antennas and the action led to a change of words between the US and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin .	-3.9788
James Clapper , US Director of National Intelligence , insisted again in September that the US did not use foreign espionage opportunities to “ steal the operating secrets of foreign companies on behalf of US firms , so that they could expand their international competitiveness or profit . ”	-4.3737
But since Edward Snowden , the former whistleblower employee , started publishing his fillhorn to US surveillance secrets , European governments and corporate leaders are no longer sure whether they can take the director at their word .	-4.4996
Reports that the American National Security Agency has spied the Brazilian oil company Petrobas and acquired data from American cloud providers , including Google and Yahoo , have brought the company paranoia to a new maximum because of government surveillance .	-4.3052

“ I believe that there is a sufficient basis for formal investigation , ” he said .	-2.4557
Moore explained to reporters that the initial autopsy suggests that Johnson has died from the consequences of “ position-related suffocation . ”	-3.6302

CDC Publish Allergy Guidelines for Schools	-1.6285
On Wednesday , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) published a series of guidelines for the handling of food allergies from children to schools .	-2.9917
These are the first such directives that the US Government has issued , as the number of children under school with food allergies increases .	-3.8014
One in 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy .	-1.9652
According to the CDC , the spread of food allergies among children increased by 18 % between 1997 and 2007 .	-2.7402
The guidelines contain information for schools to raise awareness of food allergies among teachers and employees and how to deal with children who show allergic reactions .	-4.0036
It is also recommended that schools have Epinephrin in stock – the car injection of the EpiPen brand is most commonly used – to deal with a potentially deadly oversensitivity reaction .	-3.8575

Germany is the first European nation to recognize a third sex for children born with unclear genitals .	-2.3751

According to the new law , parents no longer have to declare gender to such children , but can indicate “ indeterminate ” or “ not determined ” on the certificate of birth . to the of parparents in .	-20.1673
The aim of the law is to take pressure from parents so that they do not have to take hasty decisions concerning operations for gender assignment in newborns , and to combat discrimination against intersexual people .	-5.1829

Valais Simpson may have been intersexual .	-1.6086
The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed , but most experts in the US advise you to use the best available information on gender allocation if a provision is not possible and not to wait for the psychological and physical development of the child before deciding – if any – for an operation .	-5.3836
The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher , who specialized in the problem of gender identification , said that the new German law “ sounds like a good thing . ”	-3.1127
Intersexual children are an ethical dilemma .	-1.2776
“ Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgical intervention , but most children do not , ” he said .	-3.1462
You can assign sex without surgery and then wait for identity to develop .	-4.1516
The scientific data on how a child develops its gender identity is not very accurate .	-2.9323
Nobody knows why it is happening . from the to .	-4.6627
It is like the secret why people are homosexual .	-1.8773
A report to the European Commission in 2011 states that intersexual people should be distinguished from transsexual or transgender persons , because their status is not gender-based , but is due to their biological constitution , which is neither exclusively male nor female , but typically both at the same time or not clearly defined as one of . to the of and to to the to to the . to to the to to the to to to the . to to the	-17.7433
These characteristics were shown in sexual characteristics such as muscle mass , hair , breasts and stature , priority sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals , or in chromosomal structures and hormones .	-4.5693

In neighboring France , gender issues are still controversial , according to a news reporting on France 24 .	-3.3052
In 2011 , dozens of French members of the strictly Catholic country signed a petition that “ gender theory ” should be removed from school books .	-2.1614
The US website Catholic Online also opposed German law , on the grounds : “ If the world is broken into a new state , where gender is a decision , but not sexual activity , then we will distort two other pillars of civilization . ”	-4.9008
The mother of a newborn from Maryland declared to Baby Zone that it would be better if babies were assigned a sex at birth .	-3.6408
“ Parental life is stressful enough even without further restrictions , especially if you do not know the gender of your child , ” she said to the parent website .	-4.8443
Children need stability and security .	-1.0077
Historically , children born with both male and female sexes were called hermaphrodites , according to the attractive Greek God , who had both sexes .	-3.0692
Ten years ago , medicine regarded gender as something that can be erased and then rebuilt .	-3.5470
But the ethical foundations of an operation are now being doubted , after knowing how complex gender identity is , and that doctors can also be wrong because they do not know how the child feels when growing up with the gender allocated to them .	-5.2038
“ In the middle of the 20th century , one was called a psychiatric emergency , ” said Drescher .	-2.9721
When such a child was born , one called not the psychiatrist , but the surgeon .	-3.0798
The prevailing theory about the treatment of children with unclear genitals dates back to Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University , who said that gender was formable .	-4.0575
He characterized the concept of “ gender identity ” and argued that social and environmental impulses – like parents educate a child – interacted with a child ’ s genes and hormones , shaping whether a person views himself as male or female .	-4.7134
But , in a case known as “ John / Joan , ” from 1966 , his theories became controversial . to the of as of . to to the of to to the . to to	-14.9811
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been cut off with a bottled circumcision to castrate the child completely and also to remove his patterns and then raise it as a girl .	-6.0032
“ Money presented this case as a successful example of a conversion that he was not , ” says Drescher .	-3.0224
When the boy was about 15 , he moved back to male sex and married a woman .	-2.4187
At 38 , he committed suicide .	-2.7388
According to Drescher , there are still doctors who would practice this model .	-2.2383
But in the 1990 ’ s , with the introduction of the Internet , survivors of these sexual operations have come to the public , who are “ not happy with the result . ”	-3.9642
For example , with Jim Bruce , a 36-year-old author from Montana , born with XY-male chromosomes , but ambiguous genitals .	-3.0442
Doctors were not clear whether he had a big clitori or a small penis , and were convinced that he could never lead a “ satisfactory life ” as a man .	-3.7828
So his external organ and the farms were surgically removed shortly after birth in 1976 and he was generated as a girl .	-4.2211
At the age of 12 he received female hormones .	-1.6654
“ I knew I am not a girl , ” he explained to ABCNews.com	-1.9017
I was unhappy , but it was really difficult to ask questions .	-1.5750
At the age of 18 he should receive a vaginal plastic .	-2.2240
But , as he was depressive and knew that something was wrong , he demanded his medical act .	-3.3629
What he found out was shocking .	-0.9026
I was sterilized at my birth – and none ever told me .	-2.9957
Bruce was born with a DSD where his body could not produce enough testosteron to develop genitals .	-3.2310
After experiencing the truth , he returned to male identity , received Testosteron injections and let his breasts be removed .	-3.7508
The operation has made it infertile .	-2.5953
Today , he is fighting for others in an organization called Interface Project to ensure that intersexual people are perceived as normal .	-2.9876
But Anne Tamar-Mattis , Managing Director of Advocates for Informed Choice , based in California , worries that the German law could “ encourage stamping and stigmatizing . ”	-3.4492
“ Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make rapid decisions and to assign the child to the child , ” she explained .	-4.4642
We fear that this favours intervention .	-2.4733
We think it would be better to allocate male or female gender and then wait .	-2.5452
But we do not yet know how the law will affect , so we can only speculate .	-2.6422
Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports Australian law , because “ it allows adults to recognize as the third sex . ”	-3.1567
“ Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal sex , ” she explained .	-2.5996
The German law concerns the allocation of birth .	-3.4976
This is not a battle to force young children at this stage .	-3.1427
When they grow up , they can decide on their own body .	-12.1315
But Dr. Arlene Baratz , a breast radiologist from Pittsburg , who has a daughter with a sexual disorder and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group , says that the German law “ authorizes ” both parents and children .	-3.4331
Katie , the daughter of Baratz , was born with male chromosomes , but has a DSD called complete drug resistance .	-2.9645
Katie developed female characteristics due to the recipe effect of the Testosteron target cells .	-3.5637
It has a vagina , but no uterus and no ovaries .	-1.9749
Today , Katie is 29 and married ; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as an employee in child psychiatry .	-2.8932
While it is infertile , it hopes to get a child through adoption or a surrogate mother .	-3.4034
“ The law gives space to parents , so they do not have to make hasty decisions , ” said Baratz .	-4.5159
It gives them the time to make different tests and clarify things and gives them time before they write “ male ” or “ female ” .	-3.0700
In this way , everything is fine – you pull the child big and love it .	-4.5293
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy parental happiness .	-2.8628
And you don 't have to rush to undertake an operation that can no longer be undo .	-4.7976
“ That includes children in the decision and eliminates the fear that parents are driving around because they believe they would not do the right thing , ” she explained .	-4.6517
Ultimately , the child decides on the sex that fits better with him – and that is wonderful .	-13.3114
This will enable children to make the decision themselves .	-2.2434

Living with a Future Perspective	-2.0933
Actually Waltraud Ries lives fantastic .	-2.8921
Their house is situated in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with a lot of green , an old tree stock , nice neighbours and not too much traffic .	-12.8982
The city is only a few minutes away by public transport .	-3.0242
" Hopefully you are not afraid of spiders ? " asks Waltraud Ries and points to a fat spider at the door frame .	-3.4571
I have been looking for a new apartment for my husband and myself for some time .	-2.1923
But you know how difficult it is in Stuttgart .	-1.9113
The reason , however , is not spider phobia , but the concern not to be able to cope with the many staircases of the house and the apartment at age , she explains .	-5.5857
Moreover , since a meniscus operation , the Middle 50s has had to know what it means to move from floor to floor with handicap .	-5.1346
Recently , a book from her appeared on the subject of ' Happy living in old age - What form of residence is the best for me ? ' .	-4.9931
'Our apartment is the best example of what doesn 't go at all at the age ' , she starts to tell .	-12.8986
When she moved with her husband to the Maisonette apartment more than 20 years ago , it was simply a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green . of . to the aparof to the of the apar.	-17.2489
Today , with mid-fifty , Waltraud Ries thinks differently .	-2.7787
She also knows , however , that she is one of the few people who deal with the subject of ' housing at age ' .	-5.0589
Most are displacing it as long as it goes .	-14.4921
Old are always only the others ' , she says smiling .	-3.4114
Only when the pressure for suffering is really great can we think .	-4.3706
" Then it can be too late , " says Ries .	-3.3774
In her book , the interior architect presents 17 models of living for a self-determined age .	-4.0147
" What form of housing you choose is always an individual decision , " she explains .	-3.4668
D i e solution is not for age .	-2.3763
Even those who can afford to rest in Tuscany or Brittany should always consider becoming ill .	-3.5055
And : ' Without good knowledge of the language of the country , one can also join in the Dolce Vita , ' the author of the specialist books will consider settlement willingness .	-15.5599
Their models include classical care models , alternative living forms or the often quoted pensioner WG .	-4.3902
At Age , Everyone has their Ticks and Macks	-4.0767
" For me , however , such a community would be nothing , " she means with an eye winker .	-5.1740
Even not like a student WG with a shared bathroom and a kitchen .	-12.2537
'At age , you simply need your retreat rooms ' , says Ries .	-4.6748
Nevertheless , the author does not want to exclude the fact that a senior residential community can function .	-4.2294
But this must be different from the classical student WG .	-4.5294
And sometimes you just want your rest ' , she believes .	-3.5282
In this opinion , it is not alone in the capital .	-4.6356
'Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own apartment as long as they do , ' is also the experience of Theresa Rütten , the head of civil service life at the age of the state capital .	-4.2978
Your service advises people about becoming older .	-3.2997
That is why elderly people in particular would often accept inconveniences and restrictions only to remain in their usual environment , which is also the experience of the Warentest Foundation .	-5.1309
There are many possibilities today to make the house or the apartment accessible .	-16.7551
Ries recommends that everyone involved in the rebuilding of their home or apartment should first inform themselves thoroughly and not commission the best craftsmen .	-6.9125
Today there are also specialists for the refurbishment of age .	-4.6492
Even in the rental apartment , one or two can be realized , and if it is only the toilet seat increase , the interior architect will clarify .	-5.4176
But the existing apartment cannot always be redesigned according to age and thus accessible , even though it is still so beautiful .	-4.8241
This experience had to make Waltraud Ries .	-2.0441
Although the stairs could be installed inside the apartment , the stairs paved the way to the apartment door would be much bigger obstacle .	-6.1401
She will continue until she has found the ideal object for her and her husband .	-2.4264

US Wants to Prosecute Snowden	-2.8640
The US has not changed its attitude to former US intelligence officer Edward Snowden .	-13.7322
He will continue to be accused of having passed on unauthorised secret information .	-3.5432
He therefore had to face criminal proceedings in the United States , said the spokesman of the US State Department , Jennifer Psaki , in Washington .	-12.1077
Nor would Snowden ’ s recent statements change this .	-2.8569
Previously , after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow , German Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele appealed to the US not to continue threatening him with punishment .	-3.1739
Psaki emphasised that the statements made by a parliamentarian are not that of a German member of government .	-5.1446
Edward Snowden 's intelligence service cover is basically ready for a conversation with German authorities .	-4.6892
First of all , however , he wants to know his situation clearly .	-3.3940
The former NSA staff sought by the United States made this clear in an unaddressed letter published by the Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwarded to the Federal Government , Bundestag , and Federal Prosecutor .	-4.9732
The letter has the following text :	-2.5142

In the course of my work in these institutions , I witnessed systematic violations of my government , which led me to act morally .	-4.4565
As a result of the publication of these concerns , I saw myself exposed to a serious and persistent heading , which forced me to leave my family and my home .	-5.0537
I currently live in exile and enjoy temporary asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation under international law .	-2.5917
I am encouraged by the response to my political action , both in the USA and elsewhere .	-12.8270
Citizens around the world and also senior officials - including the United States - have judged the revelations of a system of all-embracing surveillance that is accountable to nobody as a service to the public .	-19.7865
These espionage revelations led to many proposals on new laws and directives aimed at the previously hidden abuse of public confidence .	-3.8335
The benefits to society from these findings are becoming increasingly clear , while at the same time the risks that have been purchased have been significantly reduced .	-4.5716
Although the outcome of my efforts was proven to be positive , my government continues to treat Dissen as a faithful break and seeks to criminalise and prosecute political expression .	-4.5169
Nevertheless , speaking the truth is not a cri.	-2.5709
I am confident that the United States Government , with the support of the international community , will take this harmful stance .	-3.1753
I hope that , if the difficulties in this humanitarian situation are resolved , I will be able to participate properly and legally in the responsible clarification of the facts concerning the media 's statements , particularly in terms of the truth and authenticity of the reports .	-5.3437
I look forward to talking to you in your country once the situation has been resolved and thank you for your efforts to respect international law that protects us all .	-3.4922

The budget was EUR 100 000 .	-2.2602
It is not yet clear how the new owner wants to use the former kindergarten .	-12.3065
The mayor is right that winterlingen handed over responsibility for the building before winter to someone else and therefore no longer have to pay for the entertainment of the house , such as heating , looking at the garden and clearing the path .	-4.9832

Report : Obama Campaign considered replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton	-1.8459
President Barack Obama ’ s closest advisers secretly considered replacing Vice-President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton in the 2012 election campaign , according to the New York Times .	-3.0516
The revelation is the most notable surprise of the long-awaited work of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann about the 2012 election campaign , “ Double Down : Game Change 2012 ” .	-2.7166
The Times is a copy of the next book , and she reported on Thursday evening that the president ’ s top advisers would have held “ large group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011 ” to find out whether Obama ’ s declining hope of re-election would be better if he dropped bids .	-5.6686
According to Jonathan Martin , the national correspondent of the Times , the book thoroughly reflects the history of the efforts of leading employees of the campaign and the White House , notably the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley , to measure the effect it has on the polls to exchange former Secretary of State Clinton for the Vice-President .	-4.8680
The potential change was a strictly guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office .	-2.3262
Only half a dozen of the president ’ s closest advisers – including Daley , Obama ’ s former campaign leader , Jim Messina , and the former White House leader , David Axelrod , and David Plouffe – knew about the intended change .	-3.7312
“ Double Down ” claims that Daley has been at the forefront of efforts to exchange Biden despite its “ narrow , personal relationship , ” before finally deciding against such a move , after the data showed that Clinton ’ s candidacy would “ not significantly improve Obama ’ s chances . ”	-14.7212
In an interview with Martin , Daley confirmed that the government had actually considered replacing Biden with Clinton .	-2.2849
“ I expressed a whole series of things that should be considered , and that was one of them , ” Daley explained to the magazine .	-3.2216
We must remember that the President had terrible poll ratings at the time , so we thought : “ For God ’ s will , what do we do ? ”	-3.9921
While Daley described the investigations as “ due diligence , ” Martin said to Anderson Cooper of CNN that during the campaign for re-election , considerable effort had been made to find out whether such a train pays off with regard to the ballot boxes .	-5.3013
“ In campaigns , not so much money is spent on surveys and focus groups if you don ’ t seriously think about something , ” Martin said on AC360 .	-3.8602
But it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team was thinking about exchanging .	-2.5153
Martin said to CNN that he asked Daley if his then boss had known about the potential change .	-13.5303
Although Daley declared that he did not believe that the president was “ aware ” of the possible change , the former chief of staff admitted that it was “ possible ” that Obama knew about it .	-3.6696
Martin added that “ double down ” does not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether Obama ’ s political explorations had reached his desk .	-3.6283
Cooper asked Martin whether he thinked seriously that Obama did not know anything about whether to drop biden in the elections .	-4.0734
Martin replied .	-2.0458
What happens on the way with my e-mail ?	-9.3564
E-mail actually means electronic letter .	-2.8572
Has the design of the Internet service been implemented in a technical way similar to the conventional mail ?	-4.9847
In the conception of early Internet services , the focus was on making communication possible .	-3.5403
Therefore , the basic technical protocols have not taken care to create a stable foundation for hearing safe letters .	-4.8300
Therefore , a conventional email is more like an open postcard than a sealed letter .	-3.1425
If user " Anna " sends a mail to " Benni " , are the computers of the two directly connected ?	-3.0398
The e-mail program or browser of Anna sends the mail to their service provider 's mail server in the first step .	-3.8190
For example , if it has a GMail account , Google would be .	-2.7975
This mail server sends the content to the provider that Benni uses .	-2.0659
On the route the mail can run via a number of other servers on the Internet .	-3.6746
Bennie can then call the content to his provider .	-2.4835
Will traditional emails be read on their way through the network ?	-3.0946
Most mails are read several times by software robots on the ro.	-2.6600
The sender 's provider usually checks whether the mail runs a malicious program as an attachment .	-4.0392
A virus check is also performed on the receiver systems .	-2.3243
Furthermore , the providers check whether this is an annoying and unwanted spam mail that is deleted immediately or at least sorted into a spam folder .	-4.5967
Do the robots have another task ?	-1.9344
For systems like GMail , the robot also determines the information Google needs to place context advertising .	-2.5897
If Anna and Benni communicate via GMail about their upcoming holiday trip , Google can show links to holiday offers .	-3.5906

In addition , there are possible illegal speech actions .	-3.9507
Is it possible to protect e-mails against reading ?	-11.4296
With an encryption according to the OpenPGP standard , an e-mail can be encrypted effectively against reading .	-3.3432
With high technical effort , it is also possible to conceal the metadata of e-mail communication , so that it is not even easy to recognize who has communicated with whom .	-4.7329

When his mother died , a man from Wolfsburg forged a plan .	-1.8006
He buried the dead in a forest - and continued to collect their pensions and care money .	-2.5821
In order to be able to collect pensions and care money , a 67-year-old Wolfsburg has buried his dead mother after investigating the police in the forest .	-3.9306
First he covered up the death of the 89 years , then he collected the money for more than a year and a half .	-3.8811
Now the 67-year-old must be responsible for fraud , as a spokesman said on Friday .	-2.7529
So the man hidden the woman in a forest near Helmstedt .	-2.6218
The man was suspected as early as May : at that time , it was noticed that drugs were no longer needed for the mother in need of care .	-4.8520
The pensioner told the investigators that his mother travelled to Spain .	-2.8889
Because the officials did so strangely , they continued to identify .	-4.1859
It emerged that the two had lived in a common apartment for more than 15 years and had last maintained it .	-4.7112
The 67-year-old eventually granted his mother 's death .	-12.6048
According to the police , an obduction did not indicate a capital crime .	-3.6223
Looking for ice cream that shines in the dark ?	-3.0092
A British entrepreneur has developed the first dark glowing ice – using qualls .	-4.0252
Charlie Francis exploited the fluorescent characteristics of sea animals and created a bright delicacy . to the of to the of to . to to to the to the to	-14.1516
The idea came to him after having read research about qualls and convinced Chinese scientists to produce the bright protein artificially .	-5.1226
The ice cream reacts with the tongue , increasing the pH value in protein and triggering the light .	-4.0258
Chris explains that the dining ice reacts to the warmth of the mouth , so the more you lick , the lighter it becomes .	-4.6387
Charlie , founder of the ice cream company Lick Me I 'm Delicious , says : “ The product is incredible , but still in a very early production phase , and so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds . ”	-3.9528
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH value .	-2.5817
When the mouth warms up the protein , the pH value and the ice shines .	-2.7424
We have tested it in recent months and it seemed ideal to bring it to the market in Halloween because it has this wonderful luminous effect .	-4.3087
It is probably the most expensive ice-cream I have ever produced , since the torch light is four times more expensive than gold .	-4.2625
Each ball costs me about 140 pounds .	-1.5262
But it tastes delicious .	-2.6802
Charlie 's experimental company , based in Bristol , is famous for its unusual flavours , including beer , cheese , beef and leaf gold .	-20.4695
But his latest creation is to become even more ambitious .	-2.4223
He says , “ I would like to develop an invisible ice cream . ”	-2.0413
This is , in itself , impossible due to the breakdown of light caused by the ice crystals that consist of ice cream , but I suspect we find a way to create it .	-4.9403
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a quall artificially produced by Chinese scientists	-2.8381
The TSV Morsum is still without any point in the Handball League after six days of play .	-14.6090
Exceptionally now , Ingo Ehlers ’ team is coming to the Derby against the TSV Daverden , who celebrated his first victory last weekend .	-4.5292
With this game the season starts again for us .	-2.4793
" I hope that we will finally have the head free , " Ehler 's behavior is optimistic .	-3.6934
He finally has his full cadre available , except for the permanent injured Hendrik Blohme .	-4.5693
Daverden , too , relies on tempo games . to the of . to the of the . to . to to the	-12.9879
We therefore need to keep our error rate low .	-3.0037
First and foremost , however , we need to increase coverage , which last left anything but a safe impression .	-4.8959
Daverdens Coach Thomas Panitz is much more relaxed after the first seasonal victory against Nordhorn .	-3.1921
The game was of course a house number .	-1.8678
But that is why we are far from the favorite , because everything can happen in Derby .	-4.3914
Nevertheless , Panitz now wants to follow up in Morsum to start a series .	-3.3092
Missing will be Jan-Malte Jodat .	-2.3494
For this purpose , the A-young Joost Windsü<unk> , who is active with double game rights at the A-Youth Federal Ligister HC Bremen , celebrates his seasonal debut .	-5.8485
Those who are not hot in such a game should stay at home .	-2.7223
Halloween 2013 : In Numbers	-1.3197
When I was small , Halloween had something magical .	-1.3914
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets , stay late and dress us for the neighbourhood .	-2.7576
Today I have become the Halloween muffle .	-2.7868
Over the last two years I have not declared myself prepared to distribute sweets from my apartment , and I do not think I will do so this year either .	-4.6173
But according to statistics , I am a black sheep about Halloween .	-2.1301
The majority of Americans – 158 million to be precise – are celebrating Halloween this year , spending a total of $ 6.9 billion on sweets , costumes , and decorations , according to the US Retailer Association ( NRF ) .	-3.0297
One thing I look forward to every Halloween is the trend values .	-3.4655
The costumes will account for about $ 1.2 billion of the $ 6.9 billion spent , according to the NRF .	-2.7620
This year , stimulating unbusy items are the last cry .	-4.5742
Women no longer have to cover themselves in sexy clothes , they can now embody seductive food such as pizza , hamburger or carrots .	-4.0545
As far as men are concerned , I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead , and I bet the Daft-Punk space men will make it into the instagram feeds this year .	-3.2598
According to Google , the most popular costumes are Zombies , Batman , Pirates and Witches .	-2.1766
I suspect it is nothing wrong with tradition .	-1.7508
We dressed our dogs last year and were not alone to my amazement .	-3.8571
Indeed , Americans spend $ 330 million this year on costumes of their pets , according to the NRF .	-2.0182
These are a lot of hot dogs .	-1.8645
As far as sweets are concerned , we are not shameful .	-3.6587
Americans will spend $ 1.9 billion this year , according to The Nielsen Company .	-1.9355
This is about 270 million kilograms of chocolate bars , lutschers , bonbons and rubber bearches .	-3.5680
So good news for the US Trade Department , according to the US Department of Trade , 41 million people dragging through the quarter by saying “ sweet or saure . ”	-5.6983
Indeed , we will buy more than 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and – let us not fool ourselves – eat .	-3.2907
The only thing we do not want to consume is the sugar-sweet Candy Corn , yet 15 million of them are sold around Halloween , the National Association of Confectionery Manufacturers .	-11.7562
These are about nine billion corn grains .	-1.8743
It is a mystery that I have not yet been able to resolve .	-2.4227
Nothing belongs more to Halloween than houses where it spokes .	-3.2294
They have great names such as “ Terror Behind the Walls ” ( which , by the way , is in a real prison ) , “ Howl-O-Scream ” and “ The House of Shock ” .	-3.4389
There are , in fact , 1,200 officially recognized spuke houses in the United States that redeem $ 500 million , according to America Haunts , and that includes the wonderful photos on which you are pinkering into the trousers and then putting the friends on Facebook , where they are not released again , and one of the type on which you stand leaves a comment like “ nice facial expression . ”	-7.8233
But let us finally come to the pumpkins .	-12.6062
Charlie Brown familiarised us with the Great Purbish when we were children , and carving a pumpkin latern is like decorating the Christmas tree – something we made from small to small .	-4.4647
Fortunately , the “ baby in the pumpkin ” trend began only last year thanks to Pinterest , so most of us grew up with cutting the pumpkin and not sitting in it .	-4.0553
This year , Americans will spend about $ 106 million on pumpkins , according to the US Census Bureau .	-2.1053
The pumpkin lateral , slowly rotting in the front garden , probably comes from Illinois , where 245 million kilograms of pumpkins were harvested this year .	-3.6859
If you want to score properly , call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa , California and cut something nice from their 921 kilo pumpkin .	-4.0525

At a fire in Helmbrechts , rescue forces have found a charged body in a three-family house .	-4.1539
Whether it is a resident is still unclear , as a police spokesman said in Bayreuth .	-3.0699
Late Thursday evening it had burned on the ground floor of the house .	-2.5786
When the fire brigade arrived , the flames already beat out of a window .	-2.3194
The staff went into the apartment and found the body in a room .	-3.1712
This and another room completely burned out .	-3.5089
The entire ground floor was damaged .	-1.6200
All other inhabitants were not at home during the fire , the police spokesman continued to explain .	-2.8361
The building is no longer inhabitable for the time .	-2.8947
The exact cause of fire was not clear at first .	-2.8041
Germany ’ s largest state church has launched an offensive to promote the profession of the pastor .	-3.4744
The background is a possible lack of parish : the Evangelic-Lutheran Church of Hannover expects the number of its currently around 1,800 pastors to be halved by 2030 .	-4.7820
For young people today , the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects for the future , said Pastor Mathis Burfien ( 43 ) in conversation with the Evangelical Press Service .	-3.2333
It is attractive to be able to determine the working and day-to-day process itself .	-3.6960
With Burfien , the Landeskirche has for the first time commissioned a pastor on a full place to inspire young people to study theology .	-4.7528
At present , fewer and fewer young people choose to study theology after graduation .	-3.1477
Burfia attributes this to the process of dechirical life : " God 's voice is quiet , the world is loud " .	-3.9323
The profession is characterised by great freedom and diversity .	-2.6042
I am Mr of my calendar of appointments and I can focus on where it is important to me .	-4.4521
Pastors may be close to people as sea care providers .	-3.9039
They earned as much as teachers and could live well on them .	-2.6589
To be sure , more is paid in the free economy , but for that , theologians would have a safe employer .	-3.6608
Today ’ s young people are not just about career , but about a meaningful job .	-5.1525
According to the State Church , which covers three quarters of Lower Saxony , around 60 pastors are currently retired every year .	-3.3899
At the same time , about 40 graduates from a theology study begin their Vikariat .	-3.2756
In sparsely populated peripheral areas such as resin , the Emsland or the Wendland , it will be difficult to occupy jobs in the future .	-3.5837
Burfien , among other things , wants to organize study days for young people and also invite celebrities who have studied theology .	-4.0934
Theology studies offer a broad education .	-2.7609
You can even become President of the Federal Republic .	-3.0471
Land Rover Rally Series Announced	-1.1176
In the interior there are racing seats and six-point belts as well as a hands-free system .	-3.9142
The options range from reinforced brakes , a service package with support from bowler works mechanics and logistical support to vehicle storage between events .	-3.7491
Drew Bowler , Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport , explains : “ The rally customers who come to Bowler have changed . ”	-2.5963
They are not all experienced racing drivers , but people who are looking for excitement and adventure as well as a reachable path to world-class events .	-12.6285
We are pleased to be able to open this path in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format opens up new possibilities for experiencing the various rally disciplines in Britain and abroad and preparing newcomers for the strapazes and reality of Rally Raid .	-4.9392

Fire brigade called for the salvation of a bitch fixed 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rock advance in a quarry	-4.6423
Cockerspaniel bitch Ruby went off after a smaller traffic accident	-14.6543
Three days later she was discovered by a walker in the quarry in her unfortunate position	-3.4861
Fire defenders rocked and saved the dog from safe death	-4.0130
The fire brigade succeeded in bringing a dog to safety , fixed on a 15 metre high lead in a rock wall .	-5.7458
The nine months old Cockerspaniel bitch Ruby went away after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before she was saved from a quarry on Wednesday .	-4.0728
Scott Alderson , 25 , and his girlfriend Becky Hall , 20 of whom the dog belongs , came to the quarry Flappit in Denholme , West Yorkshire to receive Ruby again and to thank the fire-fighters of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service .	-3.5429
They had desperately sought their missing bitch and published calls for assistance in social networks when she was in the quarry after the small traffic accident .	-5.3984
About 14 : 15 on Wednesday , a walker who run his dog saw the stranded Ruby on the 15 metre high sales in quarry .	-5.1529
The technical rescue team at Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to save Ruby , which was then transported up in a dog box .	-4.3654
Andy Clayton , a technical rescue team specialist , said : “ She was in a dangerous situation .	-2.4190
It was located in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and the ground .	-3.1730
She did not move a muscle during her rescue – she was like stiff frozen .	-3.3560
But now you are doing well .	-2.2531
She then eaten a few dog cakes .	-2.3654
This was a rather unusual effort .	-2.6673
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible .	-1.4333
Peter Lau , a technical rescue team specialist , said , “ Ruby had a huge luck . ”	-2.7255
It was possible that it was very seriously injured or worse .	-2.2980
Ruby was brought to the veterinary surgeon , but he found nothing except exhaustion and dehydration .	-4.4359
Becky Hall from Halifax , West Yorkshire , said , “ watching the salvation was frightening . ”	-2.6062
I could not believe that she was really up there .	-2.9825
It was wonderful to keep them in the poor again . .	-10.3128
The veterinarian explained that if exhaustion had become too big and had collapsed , she would probably have crashed .	-3.5538
The fire-fighters have done great things .	-2.7787
It was really courageous what they did .	-1.8361
We are simply so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible .	-2.5734

Mick Jagger explains that he never made Katy Perry when she was 18 .	-2.2683
During an interview with an Australian radio station this week , the pop star said she worked as a background singer to Jagger ’ s song “ Old Habits Die Hard ” from 2004 .	-3.4164
Perry explained that she did dinner with the dryer , and that “ he attacked me when I was 18 ” .	-4.9778
She added : “ This has been a long time ago and he was very nice to me . ”	-3.1250
In a statement , a representative Jaggers , 70 , said on Thursday that he “ categorically denied that he has ever made attempts to approach Katy Perry . ”	-4.0314
The representative added : “ Perhaps she confused him with someone else . ”	-2.7376

George Kerevan : European unbundling gives the Scots the Choice	-2.0035
A new day , a new horror story about independence .	-2.0843
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland is needed to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership .	-2.2832
This delivers the key word for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a barbed wire secured border along the Hadrian .	-25.3700
Indeed , the Strathclyde template referred to the possible economic benefits that would bring greater freedom of travel in the rest of Europe , but , as expected , this did not matter in the headlines .	-4.5846
Nor has anyone mentioned that EU member states frequently bend their strict rules if they are cheaper .	-4.1513
Since Scotland is not currently part of the Schengen area , the continued failure to take account of Brussels would only be a small concession in exchange for what we really want from the Scots .	-4.2732
So no story .	-2.2680
And one that has already come in such a way that it already resembles a fossil : for the first time I heard the “ independence means passport controls ” duck at least 40 years ago .	-4.4893
An interesting point is lost in the constant repetition of this ancient history .	-3.3923
Why should we expect an independent Scotland to dance after the European pipe ?	-2.3786
Why exchange the London yoke for Brussels , especially now ?	-2.5051
These are the real European news : the great post-war post-war plan for uniting Europe has stalled .	-3.2019
With the euro crisis , the European project has officially died .	-2.1137
Parties across the EU are gaining ground that are hostile to the EU or wish to throw the euro as a single currency . to the of the .	-21.9284
Even in Germany , the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany – only this year – was able to raise almost five million votes in the federal election in September , thereby effectively driving the Free Democrats ( the equivalent to the British Liberal Democrats ) out of the Bundestag .	-4.8691
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federalist Europe .	-1.9394
But the current economic crisis turns out to be a turning point .	-1.8961
Because of the strict austerity policy imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank in connection with the forced jacket in which the national economy is needed by adhering to the single currency , many people believe that the European project has gone too far .	-4.2789
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments causing excessive budget deficits – that was only the case in Greece .	-2.2397
Instead , the Eurosystem has nailed its members to exchange rates that are beneficial to German exporters – and German politicians like to leave that way .	-3.7945
Without the possibility of devaluing the local currency , southern Europe will find itself with a built-in productivity disadvantage compared to Germany .	-3.6297
The only way is to cut wages and public spending – spurred by Berlin .	-2.5255
A deeper European productivity problem lies behind the current budget and currency problems .	-2.4854
As a result of the “ green ” energy directives imposed by Brussels – a code for subsidising French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – European industry pays twice for electricity and four times for gas compared to the United States .	-3.2855
This is a crippling cost disadvantage , as we have already seen in Grangemouth .	-2.2318
All of the world ’ s wage fixes do not protect European petrochemical industry from being pushed into the corner by cheap American shale gas .	-19.1171
As a result , a revolt is raising , especially in France , the EU ’ s former cheerleader .	-2.9531
After the war , France ’ s political elite saw the EU as a vehicle that could keep Germany in check and raise Paris on an equal footing with Washington .	-3.5799
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy , and has pushed Europe forward its own economic policies , which is what the French economy is struggling to fi.	-5.3160
The result : Marine Le Pen ’ s right-wing , anti-EU National Front has just won a crucial re-election , thus referring the ruling Socialists to three .	-4.0077
The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 % of the votes – a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a division in the right spectrum would automatically benefit the left .	-3.7379
What does Le Pen do with its newly won popularity among the white French in the working class ?	-3.0590
It wants to use the EU elections next year to forge an anti-EU , anti-Community currency bloc in the European Parliament .	-2.6458
If the anti-EU parties perform well in these elections – and this is very well possible – then for the first time such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament .	-4.4469
This is the point I want to make : in the not too distant future , the growing resentment against the EU and the single currency will come together to abolish the euro .	-3.2426
The EU will not disappear , but it will become more like the “ Europe of ( sovereign ) nations , ” which General de Gaulle favored .	-2.9061
Germany and some of its satellite economies may stick to the euro , but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies .	-2.3565
I expect the United Kingdom to distance itself from this project in the hope of flattering itself in the United .	-3.8457
But Washington ’ s growing interest in the Pacific region suggests that Britain alone will be on Atlantic rain .	-2.6289
Where does Scotland stay with all this ?	-2.4398
We can decide to be a region of ( last but not least ) Small England .	-2.6296
Or we can defend our own economic interests – including telling Berlin and Brussels what they can stand where .	-2.8449
I suspect that Scotland could go well in a looser European network if we keep our own currency .	-3.6073
Cooperation with other similar countries is easier in an unfederated Europe of nations .	-1.8187

The SNP government in Scotland is – remarkably – the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe , and won a spectacular majority in 2011 because of the rejection of the proposed ( and made ) cuts that Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem Coalition had to account for .	-4.1605

Early puberty : Growing Fast	-2.4607
African-American and Hispanic girls tend to achieve puberty rather than their white ages , as studies show .	-2.9867
Physical changes do not immediately mean puberty	-2.3527
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible	-1.5820

Should a mother be concerned if her daughter grows breasts and shamhairs at the age of seven or eight ?	-3.0119
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics in Orlando , Florida this week , the paediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz declared that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and represented a new standard .	-3.5686
“ I spend a lot of time reassuring parents – usually this is not a sign that puberty is now quickly entering , ” explained Kaplowitz .	-4.6369
Obvious indications of development , such as growing breasts , sham and axle hair and body smell , are shown in girls earlier .	-4.5494
Nevertheless , there was only a slight shift in the age of the menarche ( appearance of the first control bleeding ) over the last 40 years .	-4.5872
In the United States , the average age is 12.5 years , slightly less than 12.75 in 1970 .	-1.9697
“ When the breasts ’ evolution begins , it takes at least two to three years to the menarche , ” said Kaplowitz , author of the book “ Early puberty in girls : The essential advisor to deal with this frequently occurring problem . ”	-5.3441
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty progresses .	-1.8771
It is controversial what actually represents the beginning of puberty , but it is important to “ early ” when the breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth boost of eight years ago .	-5.3852
In most cases , the process slows down or stagnates – something that a children ’ s physician can monitor closely . to the . to to the of . to to the . to to to the . to the	-16.9470
When progressing faster , tests may be displayed by an endicronologist to prevent serious problems such as tumours or cysts .	-4.4120
There are treatment methods for delaying an early menstruation and defending another consequence : premature aging of bones , which can ultimately lead to anti-growth and thus small adult body growth .	-4.5698
The recommendations for medical or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child , development speed , growth rate and emotional maturity .	-2.9777
Psychosocial aspects are also important .	-0.9105
Kaplowitz is reluctant in terms of medicines , but he acknowledges that “ oppressing puberty can alleviate behavioral problems and girls ’ feelings of being different from their female age . ”	-4.9391
The other major problem is understandable : parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have the period .	-1.8138
“ They worry about the risk of pregnancy or about how they handle the hygienic side , ” said Kaplowitz .	-3.1674
“ It was a shock , ” remembers a woman whose daughter received ten days .	-2.9912
Although there were first signs and we had talked about menstruation , it was not emotionally prepared .	-2.7192
She came home frightened and excited from school because she was the first in her circle of friends .	-2.8012
There are many comprehensively published theories about the causes of early puberty .	-1.8146
But there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other foodstuffs , chemicals in the environment , or sexual messages in the media are causing .	-3.2174
Boys come to puberty similar to girls earlier .	-3.1000
Kaplowitz believes that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of obesity .	-1.5720
He supported the conduct of a study in 2001 on girls aged six to nine , establishing a link between body fat and entry into puberty .	-3.6105
Other investigations support this conclusion , but there are many other factors that played a role .	-2.2328
In that country , African and Hispanic girls tend to achieve puberty rather than their white ages .	-2.8754
There are different explanations for this .	-1.9352
Globally , early puberty seems to be influenced by everything from economic conditions to climate to genes .	-3.0048
Another mystery : although boys are growing facial and shameful hair earlier , the trend towards a full previous puberty is not as pronounced as girls .	-4.8607
Other doctors at the AAP conference underlined the complexity of the issue .	-2.1352
The emergence of acne and shamhair is common even for babies and infants .	-15.8099
“ We must be careful about how we identify the true beginning of puberty , ” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman , a paediatric endocrinologist at the Goryeb Children 's Hospital in Morristown , New Jersey .	-14.5585
Parents should not hesitate to let their children advise themselves on how they should talk to their child .	-3.8171
“ That can mean that you have to have a conversation earlier than expected , ” said Kaplowitz .	-4.4308
If you stay calm , the child usually reacts well .	-2.8047
Girls who flourish early need the insurance that the process is a normal part of life , even if they occur earlier than thought .	-3.9428
Jumbo manufacturers argue about sitting width in the face of large orders .	-12.3106
Between leading aircraft manufacturers , there has been a discussion about the width of seats in the tourist class on long-haul flights , which indicates the tone for a bitter clash at the Dubai Airshow this month .	-4.8378
The dispute revolves around the width of seats offered to passengers on long flights in the tourist class – not always those who are most concerned about airlines , but this designated space is the key to the efficiency assertions of the latest aircraft by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co . . from to . from to , to , to to the of of , , the to to to to the to to to to to the to to to to the to to the . to to to to the	-25.7565
This week , Airbus called for an industry standard that requires a seat width of at least 46 cm ( 18 inches ) in the tourist class , but the US Archrival Boeing says that airlines should decide .	-4.4122
The debate comes at a time when the aircraft farmers are competing to sell even larger versions of their twin-engine long-haul flyers , and expect record orders at the event from 17 to 21 November .	-4.4553
How the rear part of the aircraft is designed – especially if there are nine or ten seats – is crucial for the indicated economic results that the new “ mini-jumbo ” design will deliver .	-4.9500
Boeing claims that its modernized “ 777X ” holds 406 people in tourist class seats that are over 17 inches wide and allow ten per row .	-4.6680
Airbus explains that the competing version of the A350 carries 350 people in 18 inches wide seats in the tourist class , with nine per row .	-3.4890
Aircraft giants often share love about technical details through advertising in the specialist press .	-3.9251
Now Airbus is appealing to the public before the Dubai Airshow , where the 777X is expected to place more than 100 orders .	-3.7029
Recently , the company presented an ad that could be the beginning of a new ad war and showed donors a picture in which three people are squeezed together in a restaurant , and the title : “ Would you accept that ? ”	-4.5537
“ Boeing proposes long-haul flights in seats narrower than regional turbo props , ” says Airbus Chief of Sales John Leahy .	-3.3563
Faced with changes in nutritional habits , people are becoming thicker , but aircraft seats have not changed radically .	-3.2974
Between the early 1970 ’ s , when the Boeing 747 defined the modern long-haul journey , and at the end of the century , the weight of the male average American between 40 and 49 years has increased by 10 % , according to the data of the US Department of Health .	-4.2032
The waist scope of the male average American in the 21st century is 100.8 cm , according to US health statistics .	-2.8063
Airbus says that its rival is sticking to a 1950 ’ s seat concept , when the average body scope of the freshly baptized “ Jet Set ” was narrower .	-16.9950
Airbus said that investigations were carried out that an additional tariff ( 2.54 cm ) per seat increased sleep quality by 53 percent . by in of in .	-16.7188
Boeing denies the numbers of Airbus on seats and says that it is not at the discretion of manufacturers to decide how airlines are to balance flight tariffs and facilities .	-20.5118
The company also explains that , according to research , the experience in the aircraft depends on more than the seat width .	-3.4329
“ It really amounts to giving airlines flexibility so that they can do what they think they need to be successful , ” explains Kent Craver von Boeing ’ s cabin expert .	-4.0192
They do not want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable .	-1.2276
They know their business better than anyone else .	-1.7303
Passengers are talking about more elbow freedom , but for manufacturers it is becoming increasingly an issue that can affect sales .	-3.8622
Behind the confrontation is a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least $ 700 billion after list prices in the coming decades , which could have a sustainable impact on the US or Europe ’ s export balance sheet .	-4.4085
As Reuters reported for the first time in July , the seat layout is the driving force behind the dispute over the new jets .	-2.8949
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 percent more efficiency per seat with their latest twin-engine long-haul designs than the market leader in this segment , the 365-seated Boeing 77-300ER .	-3.2775
Boeing 's statements on the results depend partly on the fact that the 777X is compared with its ten seats per row with the original design of nine seats in the 777 .	-3.4726
The increased costs per unit are still lower than for currently used machines with ten seats per line .	-3.3901
“ Boeing squeezes more seats into its aircraft to make it more competitive to our products , ” says Kevin Keniston , Head of Passenger Comfort at European Airbus .	-3.4176
On the other hand , analysts say that full cabins with ten seats per row at existing 777s suggested that many passengers chose the closer arrangement , which could be accompanied by cheaper flight tariffs .	-4.1926
“ Eighteen inches would be great for passengers , but the reality is : from an economic point of view , the Airbus offer is controlled by the 777 threat , ” says Mary Kirby , expert in cabin facilities , founder and editor of Runway Girl Network .	-3.9296
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats , but a catalogue of suppliers from which the airlines can select .	-2.6834
The world-travelling jet sellers even contribute to measuring the facility in competition .	-4.8365
Even if they price comfort , all manufacturers also offer jets with highly compressed design for low-cost airlines and regional flights .	-3.7823
Airbus has a ten-seat A350 , but has not yet sold anyone , according to its own statement .	-19.5062
Until recently , Airbus has emphasised the importance of increasing cabin adaptability and offering wide seats on the courses for some jets .	-4.0202
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets , experts say that the reputation for a new industry standard would probably be lost , but could distract from the wave of 777X sales .	-4.5691
New anti-nicotine vaccine could stop the pleasure of smoking	-3.7548
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could spoil smoking fun .	-2.0283
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for life .	-2.2328
Before human testing , more tests are needed , which may take some years to come , but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said that the first results were good .	-4.2476
“ We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can once help millions of smokers who have tried to stop and tried all the methods available on the market , but had to experience that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches , ” Cornell said .	-3.8855
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been changed to contain genetic information on the production of nicotine antibodies .	-2.7628
The virus selectively infects the liver cells , which then produce a constant current of antibodies .	-2.5640
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain , which means that a smoker does not experience a nicotine high .	-3.9750
In attempts , vaccinated mice administered to Nicotin maintained its normal level of activity .	-3.6273
By contrast , mice without vaccination would have taken a “ time out ” , researchers explained a sign that the nicotine had reached her brain .	-4.1528
The experiments are described in the Science Translational Medicine sheet .	-1.9195
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies .	-1.6415
Vaccinations had to be given so often to maintain the antibody level that they were expensive and impractical .	-2.8383
But the cost of the new vaccine is probably much lower , because it transforms liver cells into antibody factories .	-2.3568
As Professor Crystal said , a future vaccine could be administered to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette , thus preventing nicotine addiction .	-3.7146
More likely , smokers would use it to stop .	-1.8706
“ They then know that when they start smoking again , they no longer feel pleasant because of the nicotine vaccine , and that helps them to put the habit off , ” he explains .	-4.8107
British scientists said that the results were interesting , but at the same time warned that further research was needed .	-2.3155
Tripodi denied to have been influenced by Obeid	-2.8650
Former Laboratory Minister Joe Tripodi from New South Wales initiated an investigation by the state ’ s corruption supervision .	-15.8812
The former NSW minister denies having changed the rules on maritime leasing at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid , who had hidden participations in three plots in state-controlled land .	-4.5924
On Friday , the Independent Commission Again Corruption ( ICAC <unk> Independent Commission against Corruption ) extended its investigations into whether Obeid has influenced various State Ministers to extend lease contracts at the Circular Quay , where the Obeids operated two restaurants and a café without tendering after their expiry in August 2005 .	-5.4641
Now , because of the accusation that Tripodi knew Obeid ’ s hidden interest in the land , after Tripodi ’ s former Deputy Chief of Staff , Lynne Ashpole , said accordingly on Thursday .	-5.2304

Tripodi , who was a port minister from February 2006 to November 2009 , originally called for public tenders .	-3.0975
But he disputes having made the changes at Obeid ’ s request , which , as Tripodi confirmed , had urged the government ’ s leasing regulations to be reformed .	-5.4126
One of the ICAC ’ s telephone names showed talks from August and September 2007 between Obeid , Tripodi and Steve Dunn , a senior official who had changed to the Ministry of Port after working under Obeid in the Fisheries Authority .	-4.7713
“ Was the subject discussed in these telephone calls the preparation of commercial leasing rules ? ” , the deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi asked .	-4.2516

Foreign workers with 457 visas could be subjected to “ authenticity ” tests	-2.5881
The government is considering a “ authenticity test ” for foreign workers with 457 visas as part of extended measures .	-3.6774
If the test is introduced , it would be used via a criterion to prevent the 457 from being used to occupy unqualified jobs or as a back door to move family and friends to Australia .	-3.9497
Today , a government discussion proposal was published after the former Laboratory MEPs , Maxine McKew , had condemned the government 's comments on foreign workers because they could be seen as an insult by Australia 's neighbors .	-4.5932
“ Volume explanations such as foreigners are supposed to stand behind – and , Australians first hire – are a very unpleasant return in times when trade unions demanded a protected labor market , ” she said to the Australia India Institute today .	-6.2701
Historically , this meant that white workers should be protected – and if some in the region hear an echo of this historic artifact , I would not be surprised .	-3.5233

Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed railway link between London and the West Midlands .	-2.0086
After phase 2 , there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds .	-2.4437
In June , the government corrected the estimated cost of building the high-speed road between London and North England from GBP 32.7 billion to GBP 42.6 billion .	-2.5696
The British Government , which is in discussion with Transport Scotland , has asked HS2 Ltd to seek further route capacity and travel improvements for North England and Scotland .	-4.1546
This includes the possibility of travelling to London for three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh .	-3.0568
Baroness Kramer said , “ Our target for HS2 is a truly national network that brings Britain and its cities closer together . ”	-2.7647
We are moving forward with HS2 because it brings enormous benefits .	-2.7073

Regulations on electronic equipment in aircraft remain in force for the time being in Australia	-2.5390
Australian passengers must continue to switch off tablets and smartphones at startup and landing , despite efforts in the US to relax the rules on such devices .	-3.8701
The US Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) allows US airlines to change their requirements so that passengers can read , watch , or play videos on their equipment during critical flight phases if they are in “ air mode . ”	-4.2883
During most of the flight , passengers are already allowed to do so , but many people find it annoying that they cannot read their e-books when they start and land .	-4.2398
Australian companies are monitoring the decision to implement which US airlines have to do a huge amount of work , but are not following direct plans to change their rules .	-4.7443
The air traffic control authority CASA also declared that it would look at the announcement , but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic equipment remain in critical flight phases in Australia .	-4.4263
“ CASA currently has no specific regulations regarding the use of electronic devices in the aircraft , ” was announced .	-3.5516
The issue is subject to provisions that airlines must maintain safety at any time and passengers must follow the security instructions given by cabin staff .	-4.3247
Virgin has already had discussions with the CASA about the expansion of its Wi-Fi entertainment system on flights and said that it is open to change , but they should be initiated by the legislator .	-5.4442
“ We would like to see a review of the authorisation of electronic equipment by CASA , because we are convinced that this would improve customer experience after we now offer ( wireless entertainment ) during the flight , ” said a spokesman .	-4.3295
Qantas explained that , until further notice , the current rules would remain .	-4.6349
“ Our current guidelines provide that electronic equipment should not be used during startup and landing , and we currently have no plans to change that , ” explained the company .	-4.3510
The FAA rules apply to US airlines .	-1.5871
However , we are always interested in developments in regulations that passengers can benefit from , and will certainly look closely at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it .	-3.6716
The decision has different effects on US companies , depending on the age of the fleet .	-3.5386
They must prove that their aircraft can tolerate radio disturbances by mobile devices , and change manuals , training materials , hand baggage programs and customer instruction .	-3.6732
“ After an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet , it can allow passengers to use portable , lightweight electronic devices such as tablets , e-book readers , and smartphones at every level , ” the FAA announced .	-3.4927
In rare cases , the crew will instruct passengers to switch off the equipment during lanlanding . to the . to the of .	-14.6500

Borussia Dortmund then announced tough consequences .	-1.9253
Before the Friday game of the Bundesliga against VfB Stuttgart , the ultras reacted with a silence - first .	-4.0776
It was an unusual , almost spectacular acoustics that offered to the viewer until just before the start of the Bundesligaspiel between the German Vice Champion Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart in the Signal Iduna Park .	-4.5312
The guest fans were predominantly heard with their vocals .	-4.8592
The southern gallery , on the other hand , where the most faithful - and loudest - BVB fans stand , presented themselves extraordinarily quiet : no vocals , no battle calls .	-6.0345
The podium of the Capo , which otherwise coordinates the common guidance , remained unoccupied .	-4.0646
And at the front of the gallery blew a large flag with inscription " Stadium Ban " .	-5.1090
Only as a goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller as always the first BVB player entered the square , broke up short-term cheers .	-4.9208
When his team colleagues followed , there were loud vocals and flourishing shawls - but far from everywhere .	-4.0810
There was nothing in the central blocks 12 and 13 of the South Gallery .	-2.8028
Also that stadium spokesperson Norbert Dickel once again listed the positive experiences of the last few days - Derbyvictory , victory over Arsenal , extension of the contract of Trainer Jürgen Klopp - did not provide for celebration .	-5.0031
Only five minutes before the start , the Capo claimed his podium - and until then tangible tension escaped in a loud cry , as thickel as usual asked the mood on the ranks in the stadium .	-7.4135
Finally , as always , the South Gallery was in the turn - and finally here was again as usual the loudest place in the stadium .	-5.2138
And , at the latest , when the southern gallery started the loud call " Derbywinner stands up " , everything was as always .	-6.8510
The silence before was probably a response to what has happened in recent days .	-2.8060
Immediately before the Revierderby at the FC Schalke 04 , some of the BVB trailers had fired light tracks into the spectators ' ranks and on the square - and almost goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller hit .	-6.7962
The game was delayed because of the chaotic scenes .	-2.8666

" There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra movement , " the BVB boss announced on Thursday evening at a panel discussion in Frankfurt .	-2.8363
As an immediate measure , Watzke prohibited the ultras from choreographing for the home game against VfB Stuttgart .	-13.8368
" I have banned that , " he explained .	-2.5624
We cannot abandon zero tolerance policy on pyrotechnics .	-2.5356
Moreover , the ultras have been shown various possibilities of punishment - until Tuesday they now have time to choose one .	-4.3656
Otherwise , Watzke said , the BVB will set a sanction by the end of next week .	-2.4372
" That becomes dramatic " , insured watch .	-4.1762

“ My husband and I have just bought a house , there is all my money in it , ” says Amirthalinga .	-3.2968
Although she earns 3,000 Singapore dollars each month ( approximately 1,730 euros ) as administrator and her husband also works , monthly family income is not enough , she explains .	-4.5722
Indeed , demand in parts of South-East Asia – where household debt is increasing – is so great that ValueMax , where she has exchanged , became the third deposit house listed on the Singapore stock exchange this week .	-4.1131
Jewelry pledging is not only a quick way to get money – $ 1,300 in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also almost as favorable as an unsecured bank loan .	-3.3740
Typically , deposit houses in Singapore require an effective annual interest of 17 % , just above the 15.4 % required by the United Overseas Bank , a local lender with a branch in the same shopping centre .	-4.0105
However , depositary houses offer the advantage that there is no need for a review of creditworthiness or proof of income , which is why loans are faster than banks can be . to to to the . to to to the to to the .	-18.5988
For this reason , millions of people in the region are turning to depositary houses after families feel the pressure from rising costs of living and increasing budgetary and consumer debt .	-4.4025
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap credit , owing to loose fiscal policies in the developed economies , families with lower and middle-income are seeking deposit houses to compensate for the difference in the grim economy .	-4.8465
This week , the credit rating agency Standard & Poor 's growing fiscal debt , mainly through rising mortgages , called a risk factor for Asian banks ’ creditworthiness .	-3.7155
According to the Agency , Malaysia , Thailand , and Singapore have the highest household debt in Asia relative to GDP .	-2.7695
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80 % of GDP , a 60 % increase in 2008 .	-3.0068
Economists are also worried about the high consumer debt in Thailand , which has just emerged from a technical recession this week .	-3.3788
On Thursday , the data showed a continuing weakness in exports and a reduction in consumer demand .	-3.3649
“ In the end , given rising costs , people in the middle to lower segment ( the income scale ) will try to complement their income wherever possible , ” says Song Seng Wun , economist at CIMB , a Malaysian bank .	-3.4608
Historical highs in gold prices over the past two years have reinforced the trend towards pledging personal items , as people take the opportunity to turn the family ’ s jewelry into cash .	-4.3736
In Singapore , about 70 % of the pledged items are gold in the 200 depositary houses of the city state .	-3.6631
People say , “ The gold price looks good , let us pledge the gold chain and get back next month . ”	-3.0568
The largest Thai depositary operator , EasyMoney , has experienced a 20 % increase in customer growth in recent months .	-3.9954
The growth in the deposit business is so strong that ValueMax , operator of the Bendemeer branch and 15 others in Singapore , wants to expand not only to neighboring Malaysia – where the company operates four houses – but also outside Asia , according to Yeah Lee Ching , managing director of ValueMax .	-10.9300
The company finances this at 60 percent of the $ 66 million Singapore that it took this week with the Singapore stock exchange .	-4.4317
While some lenders have come to the crossfire because of high interest rates , Yeah explains that depositary houses are not only offering cheaper interest rates than other lenders , but also not directly increasing debt .	-5.8437
“ Customers lend items they already own , and the liquefied personal items of value do not increase household training , ” she explains .	-3.9552
The deposit borrowing business is increasingly socially accepted as short-term , secure financing .	-3.4392
Nor are all people who use deposit bonds in financial difficulties .	-13.2770
Rich people from Singapore also come to ValueMax branches to pledge gold bars and Rolex watches , for which they receive up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash .	-2.9430
Customers from every social class come to us .	-2.8040
“ These include wealthy people who borrow something for business or investment in the short term , or small businesses that have to bridge bottlenecks in cash flow , ” says Yeah .	-4.2394
Sometimes they just need money very quickly .	-1.8254
NSA sucks data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help	-2.0335
Edward Snowden , the intelligence uncoverer , has a principle of interest in helping Germany to educate the increasingly severe NSA spaffair .	-5.9093
According to the presentation of the Green Federal Deputy MEP Hans-Christian Ströbele , his surprising meeting with Snowden in Russia was about the conditions under which the ex-intelligence staff would tell a German prosecutor or a committee of inquiry .	-5.0090
Snowden referred to his complicated legal situation , said Ströbele to the ARD magazine " Panorama " .	-2.4080
Rescue Package over $ 325 million in Australia for Tasmanic Health	-3.2881
The Australian government insists on the tough conditions associated with the rescue package of more than $ 325 million for Tasmanian health care to ensure that the state ’ s government cannot waste the money .	-3.8551
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take “ immediate action ” to avert a crisis caused by an ageing population of the island state , a higher rate of chronic illnesses and system restrictions .	-3.6432
Financing for a period of four years was decided after government consultations with the independent Tasmanian MEP Andrew Wilkie .	-18.4350
“ The government has created an emergency rescue package that , in our view , addresses the unique challenges facing the state , ” said Plibersek today .	-3.3758
The $ 325 million package includes $ 31 million emergency aid for electoral benefits .	-2.5358
Another 2600 operations , including orthopedic interventions and treatments due to grey star , are intended to eliminate residues .	-4.0859
Moreover , there is money for day-to-day clinics in Hobart and Launceston , better aftercare for stationary stays , specialist training , mental health services and the introduction of a system for electronic recording of health data in local hospitals .	-4.2807
“ These investments correspond to the ideas that affected clinical staff have told me that they are the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system , ” said Tanya Plibersek .	-3.9083
The Minister insisted on a strict reporting and accountability of the Tasmanian Government .	-2.3682
The state must maintain the current level of funding to receive money from the Commonwealth and report monthly on where the additional money was spent .	-18.8440
A three-member Commission is set up to ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible .	-2.9598
As Wilkie explained today , the $ 325 million would benefit little if “ they were not accompanied by real reforms that put the Tasman public health system on a more sustainable course . ”	-3.3472
Nevertheless , he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent assistance that he first expressed to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May .	-3.2340
“ I am confident that federal aid will make a major contribution to removing the state ’ s public health system from the worrying list , ” said Wilkie .	-3.3473
According to the government of the state , these electoral benefits will largely compensate for the recent cuts .	-3.0579
But the health spokesman of the opposition at federal level , Peter Dutton , believes that today ’ s announcement is only a “ pavement solution . ”	-3.3923
“ We are in today ’ s situation because the laboratory government has withdrawn $ 430 million from the health system , ” he said to ABC TV .	-3.3840
It is unacceptable for a state government to pull almost half a billion dollars out of the system , and the Commonwealth puts in 300 million and then pretend to be good news .	-5.5887
Dutton called on Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the rescue package will be spent on additional bureaucracy .	-2.5215
Guillaume Nicloux ' adaptation of the novel of Denis Diderot convinces with extraordinary production facilities and contemporary details , however , is also more difficult than necessary .	-4.4006
The action played in France in the 1760s tells the graceful story of Suzanne , a young nobleman sent by her family to the monastery .	-3.7952
When she rebels , she faces the extreme cruelty of an extremely sadistic upper and becomes the object of erotic fascination of another .	-3.4093
The film never slides into delusion or sensational lust – and that is its problem .	-5.4492

Syria has destroyed its possibility of producing chemical weapons , according to a surveillance group	-2.9788
Syria has destroyed important facilities for the production of chemical weapons and toxic gas munitions , explained the global surveillance group on Thursday , while serious clashes have occurred in the north of the country near one of the sites where allegedly toxic substances are stored .	-5.4901
A Syrian group of activists also announced on Thursday that more than 120,000 people have been killed soon since the civil war began three years ago .	-3.3325
The announcement by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons ( OPCW ) came one day before the deadline .	-3.2710
1 November , which the Damascus organization based in The Hague had placed in order to destroy or “ inoperable ” all facilities for the production of chemical weapons , including all machines for mixing chemicals to poisonous gas and filling ammunition .	-18.8713
The conclusion of this process , which is basically the first stage of destruction , is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable aimed at destroying all Syrian chemical weapons by mid-2014 .	-3.2699
The destruction of institutions means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons .	-2.1301
But Damascus still needs to start destroying existing weapons and stocks .	-3.0506
According to assumptions , there are about 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons in the country , including mustard gas and nerve gas sarin .	-2.6350
The announcement came at a time when fighting took place on Thursday in the city of Safira , when experts say that there was a production facility for chemical weapons and storage sites , as the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights announced .	-4.4432
The group of activists who persecuted the number of deaths via a network of activists in Syria declared on Thursday that 120,296 people died .	-3.2279
There are 61,067 civilians , including 6,365 children .	-2.1746
On the government side , 29,954 of them belonged to the army of President Bashar Assad , 18,678 are government-friendly fighters , and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militias .	-14.0179
Also among the dead are 2,202 deserted army soldiers and 5,375 opposition fighters , many of them foreigners .	-2.4314
On 25 July , the UN estimated the number of deaths in this conflict since March 2011 at 100,000 .	-2.3749
This figure has not been updated so far .	-2.7094
The conflict has forced about two million people to flee the country .	-2.1998
Assad ’ s troops have been fighting the rebels in Safira for weeks , many of which have links to al-Qaeda groups .	-2.6927
The observatory said that there were losses on both sides on Thursday , but did not mention details .	-2.5536
The struggles underline the danger of chemical weapons inspectors , because their mission to liberate Syria from its toxic arsenal of weapons is a race against time in the midst of a raging civil war .	-3.8201
According to the OPCW , which works closely with the United Nations , the team is “ convinced that it has seen all the major production and mixing / filling facilities mentioned by Syria and experienced their destruction . ”	-4.0831
Therefore , “ no further inspection activities are currently planned . ”	-2.9834
At the beginning of the week , the inspectors declared that they had completed the first round of reviews and visited 21 out of 23 of the sites specified by Damascus .	-3.4232
Due to security concerns , the visit of two institutions was not possible , the inspectors said .	-3.3963
On Thursday , the OPWC declared that the two sites had been “ abandoned ” according to Syria ’ s statement , and the objects of the chemical weapons programme existing there had been moved to other mentioned facilities that were inspected . ”	-4.8758
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two facilities that the OPCW inspectors could not visit .	-2.5458
Syria has presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons , which must be approved next month by the OPWC executive committee .	-2.9277
“ I prefer the hat of the bravery and courage that you have shown in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever carried out by this organization , ” said Ahmed Uzumcu , the Director-General of the Monitoring Organization in a comment published by OPCW .	-4.7511
For three years now , the mainly Sunni Muslim rebels in this civil war have been fighting against Assad ’ s government and its security forces , which belong to many Alawite members , a secession of Shia ’ s Islam .	-15.2590
With regard to further developments , the head of the observation group , Rami Abdurrahman , said that there was a strong explosion in an air defence institution in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia on Wednesday .	-3.5547
The cause of the explosion is not known , he explained .	-2.0270
Anger at Bali ’ s Bomb Stackers	-11.8982
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who died in 2002 during the Bali bombing reacted annoyed by the judgment for the last of the incitement who was brought to justice , as Umar Patek , in her opinion , was to be shot down on the ground by the . of to the of to the . to the to the to	-13.8551
Patek , who was almost ten years in flight as one of South-East Asia ’ s most sought , was yesterday sentenced to a 20-year prison sentence for his role in building explosive bodies .	-5.1676
He could be made redundant after 15 years of punishment .	-12.0540
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder because of the attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta , where 202 people died , including 88 Australians , and many others were injured .	-3.1086
There was also a series of terrorist charges , including a wave of explosive attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000 .	-3.8175
The Public Prosecutor had called for a lifelong prison sentence , even though it could have applied for the man who , for his reputation as a masterful bomb farmer , was also called a “ demolition man . ”	-5.6409
The decision aroused painful memories at June Corteen , a mother from Perth who lost her 39 years old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the devastation caused by Patek and his co-conspirators nearly ten years ago .	-3.9275
Fighting with tears , she said that Patek should have been sentenced to death .	-13.3024
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys .	-1.8375
“ He should be faced with a shooting command , ” Corteen said to the AAP .	-12.9853
I have to live every day with the fact that I will not get another grandson and I will never see my daughters any more .	-4.0160
The Sari Club was equated to the ground when on 12 October 2002 a huge bomb exploded in a small load parked in front of the nightclub shortly after 23 : 00 .	-4.9571
Peter Hughes was in Paddy 's Bar , where only 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber exploded a backpack filled with explosives .	-3.0107
He fell into the coma for a month after the attack , and “ died ” three times , while standing on a life conservation system .	-4.5737
Hughes said that Patek deserved the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cell Jemaah Islamiah – Amrozi , Mukhlas , and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the bloodbath and executed four years ago .	-2.8271
Really , this type should be given the death penalty before everyone else .	-3.2288
Leaving him alive – no , there is no reason to leave him alive .	-2.4423
Getting 20 years after he killed 202 people and injured many hundreds is not much .	-2.3493
Patek is the last Bali bomber to be tried .	-2.4745
He escaped almost a decade of arrest , but was eventually taken up in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad , where US forces killed the former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden just under four months later .	-4.2793
During the negotiation , an FBI agent said that intelligence reports had suggested that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of rebuilding the link between South-East Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda .	-3.2609
“ He did not face up , ” said Corteen .	-11.7220
Until recently , he has shown no remorse for how much suffering he has inflicted on other people .	-3.1901
The judgment came before the tenth anniversary of the attack this year , commemorated with commemorative celebrations in Bali and Australia .	-3.6565
“ There will be many tears this year , ” said Corteen .	-1.6317
Patek may appeal against his judgment .	-2.3078
FAA : Passengers can now use electronic devices in aircraft ( but do not call mobile phones )	-2.5763
From departure to landing , passengers can now listen to their electronic devices for reading , working , gaming , music and using the reputation of movies , but not call them with mobile phones , so the new guidelines issued by the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) in the US on Thursday .	-5.6408
But passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately .	-1.3070
How quickly they would be implemented depends on the airline , FAA employees Michael Huerta declared at a press conference .	-2.9708
The airlines must demonstrate to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated the training manuals of the airline staff and the rules for storing the equipment in accordance with the new regulations .	-4.6672
The FAA has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic equipment in aircraft .	-3.3494
Delta and JetBlue were among these airlines .	-2.2575
“ Depending on the condition of the plan , we could approve the extended use of electronic devices very soon , ” the FAA announced in a statement .	-3.5908
Currently , passengers must disable smartphones , tablets and other equipment when the aircraft doors are closed .	-2.8582
They may only restart them once the aircraft has reached a height of three kilometres and the captain gives the green light . to the . to the of to the . to the to the .	-14.1022
When entering the landing flight , passengers must shut down and not restart them before the aircraft has landed .	-5.8193
According to the new guidelines , airlines whose aircraft are safeguarded against electronic disruptions could allow their passengers to use the equipment even on start , landing , and rolling fields , the FAA declared .	-4.9579
Most new aircraft and other aircraft that have been converted to higher altitudes for the use of Wi-Fi should meet the criteria .	-4.1842
Laura Glading , President of the professional association of professional flight companions , welcomed the changes . to the of in from to in the of the . from to . to the from to	-15.8412
“ If the new regulation is safely implemented – and we are working closely with the airline in this respect – both sides will benefit from it , ” commented Glading .	-3.4297
To be honest , we are sorry to have to feel careful on this issue .	-4.2026
Nevertheless , Internet connections for surfing , exchanging emails , text messages or downloading data under three kilometres remained prohibited , the authority explained .	-3.8258
Passengers are asked to move smartphones , tablets and other devices into flight mode .	-2.9270
So there is still no “ Words With Friends ” , the Scrabble-like online game that the actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 , when he had to leave a jet of American Airlines publicly because he refused to shut off the device while the plane was parked on the flight .	-5.2571
And heavier devices such as laptops must continue to be stored , as there is a risk of injury if they fly through the cabin .	-4.1159
Mobile calls during the flight remain prohibited .	-3.0059
The regulatory competence for telephone calls lies with the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) , not the FAA .	-2.3899
FAA may lift a ban on certain electronic equipment at startup and landing	-3.1289
Last month , Mark Rosenker said by the National Transportation Safety Board , safety expert on national transport issues on CBS News , mobile phones would still be regarded as a risk .	-3.6771
“ Mobile phones are really a problem , not only because they could potentially cause disruptions in navigation devices , but because we know from the FCC that air transmission can also disrupt transmission masts , ” says Rosenker .	-4.8163
An industry advisory committee set up by the FAA to investigate this issue recommended last month that the government allow a wider use of personal electronic equipment .	-3.9523
In recent years , pressure on the FAA has increased to relax restrictions on use .	-2.2521
Critics such as the democratic senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri believe that there are no valid security reasons for the ban .	-2.8167
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to impose because the use of the devices has become omnipresent .	-3.8284
Some studies mention that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore the switching off of the equipment .	-4.0693
In 1966 , the FAA began to restrict the use of electronic equipment by air travellers after reports of disruptions to navigation and communication equipment had become known by passenger-carried UCW radios , which at the time represented the latest technology trend .	-5.8178
New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft , but they are also designed and approved by the FAA that they do not represent electronic interferences .	-3.6843
Airlines have been providing passengers with Wi-Fi for several years when the air height is reached .	-4.6577
The flyers adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also more insensitive to interferences .	-2.7031
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for greater use of electronic equipment under the new directives , said Huerta .	-2.4709
Today ’ s electronic devices generally do much less radio than previous generations .	-3.5630
E-Readers , for example , give only minimal radiation when you scroll around .	-5.0158
But when downloading or sending data , the transmission values are stronger .	-2.6603
Amazon.com is one of the advocates of easing the restrictions on passenger use .	-3.3353
In 2011 , company employees invited a passenger aircraft full of Kindle E-Reader and made a test flight to identify problems , but could not detect .	-4.2326
Members of the FAA Consulting Committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using equipment .	-2.6029
Douglas Kidd of the Passenger Association National Association of Airline Passengers said he believed that the disruption of the equipment is real , even if the risk is minimal .	-4.1911
Other committee members said that there are only several reports of pilots speaking for the disruption of aircraft systems by devices , and most of them are very old .	-4.4344
However , the Committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to switch off the equipment by passengers in poor visibility when landing instruments .	-4.9437
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and described them as a reasonable adaptation for travellers who would now be fully equipped with technology .	-4.1401
“ We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not at odds with security , ” said Roger Dow , CEO of the U.S. Travel Association .	-2.6760
Saved birds by air rescue from North Sea Borinsel	-15.0042
A bird flown to the coast by air rescue service , exhausted on a North Sea drilling rig , was returned to nature .	-4.2821
The water rall was flown last month with a helicopter to Aberdeen , where it was packed up by the Scottish animal welfare organization SPCA in their rescue centre in Alloa .	-14.4192
Colin Seddon , Head of the Centre , said : “ This water rall was probably a winter bird from northern Europe stopped by the strong winds over the North Sea . ”	-4.1959
Apparently the exhausted bird sought refuge on the drilling island .	-3.3334
He added : “ He could no longer continue flying , so we were contacted with the request for help . ”	-3.3473
The water rall was fit and healthy again when it was released .	-3.4038
Is Europe ’ s elite ready to do business with Britain ?	-1.8843
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy together and defining what those who provide prosperity and work in Britain want to change our relations with the EU .	-3.4484
To this end , we have commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey among British economic leaders and asked them what they think about Britain , the economy and the EU .	-2.9085
YouGov surveyed more than 1,000 business leaders representing about British corporate sizes , sectors , and regions .	-4.2103
The results of the survey will surprise many .	-1.5922
We have found that the vast majority of companies now export outside Europe and focus on countries that are modernising and growing while the states are stagnating in the EU .	-3.6171
They want new trade links to countries like China , India , and Brazil to be favoured by government , rather than stopping with the long and strenuous process of reforming the obscure EU institutions .	-4.2460
In their opinion , on certain legally regulated issues – from antitrust to product legislation – the majority of economic leaders believe that control of these key competences should be brought back to Westminster .	-4.3257
There was general dissatisfaction with the internal market , because , according to companies , the costs of Brussels ’ rules would now outweigh the benefits of being part of Europe ’ s trade zone – even 40 % of large companies agreed to that , which is traditionally the most pro-European .	-5.2963
Finally , and this probably says the most , our survey of economic leaders showed that a clear majority of Britain wants a course towards changing the agreement , and a relationship with the EU based on trade , not politics .	-4.8316
This insight , found among companies of all sizes and leading corporations , shows that the economy is pushing for a “ meaningful change ” that returns the magazine of action to Britain .	-5.3214
Much is at stake – changing the agreement and better conditions for Britain would lead to a 16 % change of opinion in favour of remaining in the EU in a referendum .	-3.8913
The Prime Minister should have no doubt : this survey shows that the British economy is behind its plan for renegotiating British conditions for EU membership .	-2.8634
It also shows that companies expect a renegotiation of power back to Britain .	-3.3291
A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary , as the eurozone moves towards a closer economic and fiscal union .	-3.0581
The priority must be jobs and growth in the United Kingdom , as the result of our survey shows , which means increased emphasis on trade and fundamental change in the Brussels approach to rules .	-4.0146
Alexei Miller of Gazprom describes the beginning of a new gas era in Bulgaria	-2.6884
The start of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria is one of the largest European energy projects , explained by the Gazprom Board .	-3.0532
“ Today ’ s event is a milestone : building work on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline , the largest and most important project in Europe , has begun , ” said Gazprom ’ s Chairman of the Executive Board , Alexei Miller , in a statement on Thursday .	-3.5184
The project is a key element in the energy security of the entire European continent .	-1.9513
South Stream is intended to ensure greater diversity in Russia ’ s export routes across Europe .	-3.1897
A contractual dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine , where the majority of Russian gas is stored for Europe , will increase the risk of conventional routes , as is officially heard .	-3.8361
Miller said that the direct link to Bulgaria , a member of the European Union , means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are “ forever . ”	-2.4663
Bulgarian consumers receive gas from South Stream at reduced rates when the entire project starts operating in 2015 .	-3.2328
According to Gazprom , construction work in other subordinate countries will begin on the planned route at the end of the year .	-3.0460
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic metres of natural gas .	-2.2221

Two YMCA employees from New South Wales ( NSW ) have been accused of sexual crimes relating to children before 2011 accusations were made against the children 's carer Jonathan Lord from Caringbah , as the Royal Commission for sexual abuse of children experienced .	-4.9784
But , in the opening declaration before the Commission , the YMCA declared that “ there was never an incident of sexual abuse in the organization . ”	-4.8700
Managing Director Phillip Hare was consulted about a case in which a YMCA employee was accused of child pornography crimes and another in which a sports teacher of the YMCA Caringbah Hall had been convicted in 1991 for the abuse of children entrusted to him .	-13.6025
Hare said Gail Furness , a lawyer assisting the Commission , that he knew about the first case but did not know the second .	-3.0337
He acknowledged that the YMCA ’ s opening declaration to the Commission was also inaccurate in claiming that “ there were external reviews of the YMCA , where YMCA was recognised as the foremost child safety front . ”	-5.0758
Instead , evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA was informed that it received the second lowest assessment of four possible in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities ( Ministry of Education ) in August of the year .	-3.5726
Hare , who began with 21 at YMCA , acknowledged that the management failed “ from me downwards ” in the attitude of Lord , and did not ensure that employees were aware of their obligations to report violations of the child safety guidelines .	-5.7837
Lord was sentenced to 12 boys at the beginning of the year for sexual offences during his two-year work for the YMCA .	-15.2414
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison .	-1.3476
Hare , however , disputes that the YMCA would have a cultural problem preventing the employee from reporting Lord ’ s violations of child safety .	-25.0720
The staff said that they had observed infringements , including that Lord was alone with children , cared for them privately as babysitters , made them sit on his lap , said to him that he loved it , and let children play with his mobile phone .	-6.0053
Danielle Ockwell , whose superior was Lord , who had asked for training for child protection because she was concerned about his behavior , said that the child service provider Jacqui Barnat , who was the superior Lords in the YMCA Caringbah , was “ very intimidating and most of the time very inconceivable . ”	-5.3475
The Managing Director declared that he would not accept statements by employees that they would not have dared to report to their superior .	-4.4572
Instead , he said , their friendship with Lord has affected their judgment , which is why they would not have reported it .	-4.0034
Hare explained that he told the Executive Board of YMCA NSW that the lesson to be drawn from the “ Jonathan Lord Incident ” concerns “ not reporting ” by employees , and the Executive Board agreed to it .	-16.7214
Hare said that the decision to press employees to sign secrecy obligations shortly after accusations occur was taken by the managing director of the child services of YMCA , Liam Whitley .	-4.2607
He said that this should prevent contamination of evidence , but that was “ overzealous ” and poorly implemented .	-3.6491
The YMCA NSW was not a safe organization for children when Jonathan Lord was there between 2009 and 2011 , declared Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University , expert in sexual abuse , the Commission .	-3.7188
He explained that there have been “ serious problems ” in recruitment , verification , adaptation , training and supervision of employees .	-3.6211
The hearing was postponed until 20 December .	-0.9004
Tony Blair said that he would seize the opportunity to return as British Prime Minister – but admits that a comeback is unlikely .	-3.2741
In an interview this evening on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his leaving office , the 59-year-old announced his views on various domestic issues .	-3.4064
Since his resignation in June 2007 after a decade as Head of State , Blair has largely avoided commenting on British politics , and his comments mostly confined to foreign policy and its role as envoy of the Quartet of Peacemakers in the Middle East .	-3.9405
In response to the question of whether he would like to return to the Prime Minister ’ s office , Blair was quoted by the Evening Standard from London : “ Yes , sure , but it is unlikely that this will happen ... ”	-5.0719
When the horse show experts found themselves in Scharen in Cardiff to save the horse of the year , they realized that a hard competition was awaiting them .	-5.8925
But none was prepared for the three-year old Fenton Kirkland .	-2.3480
The Knirps , which is not even in the kindergarten , and only a few months ago made its first steps , and his Shetland-Pony Toffee travelled loosely through the three rounds and won the first prize – leaving 30 adult opponents behind .	-5.6963
The inseparable couple , both equally large , were praised for their appearance , behavior and style at the annual competition organized by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff .	-3.5370
During his performance in competition against men and women with elegant melons , he had put his leghold caps in a cheeky angle and led the two years old toffee through the ring .	-5.1081
Fenton was praised by the jury for his natural skills in dealing with the pony that was well above his age .	-4.0599
And Toffee received best notes for his appearance and personality .	-2.0186
Fenton had received Toffee as a gift for his third birthday last March and since then practised with the Shetland Pony every day .	-3.6775
His mother , Donna , 30 , said , “ Fenton and Toffee are a great span . ”	-1.8967
They had to compete against the entire field of participation and have gone off with gold pocket and roset. to the .	-15.5741
It was only the second time that he took part in a competition with Toffee , and we were all enthusiastic when he won .	-3.2728
Fully strangers in the arena thought it was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him .	-2.9787
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo , near Ebbw Vale , South Wales , follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howell , who has been showing horses for over ten years .	-11.1237
Howells said , “ The whole audience was like electric and everyone fired and clattered it . ”	-4.6628
He ran on sand the entire length of the arena and although he looked so tiny , he did fantastic work .	-3.6652
Fenton is crazy for animals – he loves horses , tractors and farms and has two chickens he takes care of .	-2.5728
As he has started , it will not take long for him to be on the “ Horse of the Year ” show – and I am sure he will do well .	-4.1356
One spokesman of the annual horse show said , “ Fenton is only three , but he knows how to deal with his pony . ”	-3.1003
Together they are a great team .	-1.3458
The jurors rated Fenton and Toffee on how well they had beaten and presented themselves in the demonstration ring .	-3.9122
They pay attention to good cooperation between pony and guide – and there were Fenton and Toffee the best in the ring .	-3.1181
I am sure that Fenton ’ s sweet clothes contributed their part to this , which really fits perfectly for the occasion .	-4.1622
China ’ s Newspaper is to be “ Reformed ” after call	-3.5190
A Chinese newspaper , which on the front page had called for the release of a reporter accused of defamation , should be reformed , explained a press regulat.	-3.6021
The New Express , based in Guangzhou , had printed a rare public appeal to release the journalist Chen Yongzhou .	-2.4608
But Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to falsify reports of a part-state company .	-3.7465
Now the New Express is subjected to “ comprehensive rectification , ” the regulatory authority declared .	-3.1826
The “ Rectification Order ” was issued by the Press and Publications Authority , Radio , Film and Television in Guangdong .	-3.0612
Preliminary investigations showed that the New Express , which belongs to the Yangcheng Evening News Group , had published several incorrect reports on the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013 .	-2.7282
“ The editorial management of the New Express was disorderly , ” the regulatory authority announced in a statement .	-2.9067
She said that she decided to “ impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou and withdraw his reporter license . ”	-3.3946
Moreover , “ the Yangcheng Evening News Group was instructed to complete rectification of the New Express and recommended that the relevant persons in charge of the New Express be identified and immediately reviewed the New Express leadership team . ”	-4.8353
Chen had written several articles for the New Express in which he reported about alleged financial irregularities with a manufacturer of construction machines called Zoomlion .	-3.2527
After being arrested , the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and stood behind his journalistic work .	-2.8104
But then Chen appeared on state television and admitted that he had published false reports for payment .	-3.6896
“ In this case , I damaged Zoomlion , as well as the entire news industry and its ability to gain public confidence , ” he explained to the state news broadcaster CCTV .	-3.7668
I did it primarily because I was on money and glory .	-2.5556
I realized that I was wrong .	-2.8713
Following Chen ’ s apology , the New Express published an apology on the front page and declared that it was failing to check the reports correctly .	-4.0010
Various well-known suspects have recently made confessions on television .	-2.2286
Experts say that confessions are still routinely enforced , despite a legislative change at the beginning of the year in which the authorities were forbidden to force someone to accuse themselves .	-3.3470
Discovered by the US-Mexico Drug Tunnel	-2.3979
One of the most sophisticated tunnels for drug smuggling between the US and Mexico , fully equipped with lighting , ventilation , and electrical railway operation , has now been discovered .	-3.3135
The US authorities described the 120 times 90 cm tunnel as one of the most sophisticated passages ever found .	-2.8484
The tunnel , which runs in the zigzack pattern over a length of almost six football fields , connects warehouses near Tijuana , Mexico , and San Diego , USA .	-3.7701
There are countless inconspicuous warehouses in the area , making it easier to hide trucks loaded with drugs .	-3.4568
The tunnel had been closed before drugs could be transported unrecognized , the authorities declared .	-2.8955
When the tunnel was discovered , eight and a half tonnes of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were ensured , the records of the court .	-14.9150
Three men who , according to the authorities , worked as drivers were accused of owning and selling marijuana and cocaine .	-3.1366
They are threatening prison sentences between ten years and lifelong when they are guilty .	-4.5662
In Nogales , Arizona , smugglers rely on an extensive underground network of drainage channels .	-1.9623
The tunnel is the eighth large passage that has been discovered in San Diego since 2006 . to the of the . to the of to to the . to to the	-11.9991
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after the marijuana harvest in Central Mexico in October , posing the challenge of bringing their product to consumers quickly .	-3.8535
In 2010 , authorities found a nearly 640 metre long passage with railways that ran from a kitchen in a residential house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego .	-3.9861
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr Still Love	-1.5566
Actors Orlando Bloom and Model Miranda Kerr want to go separate paths in the future .	-1.9753
In an interview , however , Bloom said that he and Kerr still love himself .	-2.0403
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents of the two-year Flynn .	-1.6110
Actor Orlando Bloom spoke about the separation of his wife , Topmodel Miranda Kerr .	-2.6048
In an interview with US journalist Katie Couric , who should be broadcasted on Friday ( local time ) , Bloom said , " life sometimes does not run exactly as we plan or hope " .	-3.4210
Kerr and himself still loved , emphasized the 36-year-old .	-2.6774
" We will support each other and love each other as parents of Flynn " .	-1.7242
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010 , and in 2011 their sons Flynn was born .	-2.2271
Veganism , according to Lexica , is subject to vegetarianism , but is quite different from that .	-4.5694
Because while vegetarians are allowed to eat cream cakes , ice cream or a powerful edamer , these cakes are not on a vegan 's menu .	-4.6495
Milk , cheese , egg , besides the abandonment of meat and fish , the vegan leaves off all the consumption of animal products - honey is also denied .	-4.5819
What remains is wonderful , but if you look closely , the vegan food world is characterized by considerable imagination .	-5.3503
" Brot spreads are very popular " , explains Ute Henkelmann , the owner of the local House of Reform , who provides a variety of special products for vegans .	-4.2630
Reuben Proctor is also happy to visit the shop in the Domgasse .	-2.6922
For 13 years , the native New Zealand has lived vegan , in Lampertheim he finds ( almost ) everything he needs for life . " In 1997 I implemented my nutrition and became vegetarian " .	-5.2764
At the turn of the century the next step was taken and I became Vegan .	-2.4171
" The conviction came not only because of nutrition , but because of the choice of shoes , " says Proctor , who prefers normal leather .	-3.9348
He recognized that there are other everyday concerns without animal products .	-3.4153
First of all , vegan is an ethics .	-11.8433
" I don 't want animals to die for me , " says Proctor the maxim of vegans extending to the whole consumer behaviour .	-4.2060
Instead of mourning burgers , stirries or rubber bears , the vegan quickly discovered new products that increased enthusiasm .	-3.5665
" It 's a double bonus , " says Proctor today , " actually vegan is not a waiver , not an askese , but an enrichment " , to assume to a reduction in in the choof ffood options , results from to the powe.	-26.3943
And that is precisely the conditioning that has left some so well intentioned attempts to fail .	-5.5263
" The addiction factor is a crucial factor that lets many quickly abandon , similar to smoking , " Proctor sets up a comparison .	-4.1515
And it says : " Certain tastes are not mounted on the animal " .	-5.1994
Often it is the spices or the type of preparation that make up the taste .	-2.9799
" You can also create the same effect in other ways , " explains the vegan .	-3.5741
Proctor , for example , brings aubergines , champignons and also some vegan sausages to a barbecue festival .	-3.8730
It pays attention to a balanced , varied diet , where it is also delicious .	-5.9337
Of course you want something between the teeth , that is legitimate .	-3.1141
" It should taste , but this is not just to reduce animal food , " says Proctor .	-2.8963
He did not suffer health damage to eating disorders , another widespread assumption .	-2.8351
For me the changeover had a positive aspect .	-2.8282
I do not take a foreign cholesterol and I have an increased vitamin proportion . to to .	-12.5170
There are high-performance athletes who feed exclusively vegan .	-2.6108
" My blood values are best , I often let myself check , " says Proctor .	-3.0772
In particular , many vegan critics warn against the lack of vitamin B12 .	-2.9102
" Because animals are fed with feedingstuffs instead of grazing on the pasture , it is questionable whether the vitamin B12 content is high in the meat that you purchase in the refrigerator , " Proctor finds .	-5.7439
For vegans there is also the possibility to take the coenzyme in the form of tablets .	-3.9472
" My B12 values are fine , " he explains .	-1.7236
Large routes do not need to be taken for food procurement .	-4.5684
Basic food is eventually available everywhere and every supermarket now has soya milk and other products .	-3.4983
I find everything I need on site .	-11.0503
Only sometimes I buy something special .	-2.1629
" Many people overlook the fact that only the finished products are expensive , but this is what we know about " ordinary " finished products .	-4.7287
In any case , the preparation of vegan dishes is far cheaper and less time consuming than usually assumed .	-3.1573
" There is a lot to discover in the house kitchen , with a few small knives you can achieve good , if not partially better results , " says Proctor .	-4.4853
Margarine instead of butter , a little bit more baking powder and carbon dioxide instead of egg , with its vegan cheese cake , Proctor could also amaze his parents .	-4.2752
Family celebrations give the vegan a new season .	-3.3041
This is dynamic when you cook together , and it has a new .	-5.1771
" The situations that may arise are as different as the people themselves , " says Proctor .	-2.6539
Of course , he has already been sceptical .	-3.3514
Do you not taste my food anymore ?	-2.3348
" Should I feel bad now because I drink milk ? " - on such issues , one should act as a vegan with a sense of finger .	-5.1158
" I don 't reject people , I 'm part of this society , " Proctor doesn 't want to be an enclave .	-4.2214
And more precisely , everyday life does not seem as vegan as suspected - and the vegan does not seem as limited in everyday life as usually assumed .	-5.2726
Fast food is also allowed .	-1.2680
Pommes are everywhere !	-2.2971
" Many döner shops offer Falafel , or a vegetarian yufka , " says Proctor .	-2.6664
In a pizzeria he evades pasta dishes , or orders a pizza without cheese , everything a question of habit .	-4.0028
The restaurants are slowly adjusting to it .	-4.3517
" When I started to feed myself vegan 13 years ago , everything was even more difficult , " the New Zealand can find a development : " You have to talk to the people , draw them to their attention " .	-4.5983
" When sufficient demands come , they may be inclined to complement the menu , " he hopes .	-3.2554
Vegan restaurants are developing , such as the Mannheim combust or the Bird-free café .	-4.5220
Proctor wishes that other restaurants have at least a vegan menu .	-3.3141
Basically , vegan dishes are available for all .	-2.5490
Everyone can eat them , so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive .	-2.2036
" Meat dishes , on the other hand , are exclusive , in the truest sense of the word , because they exclude others , " says Proctor .	-3.8305
" If you want to avoid food scandals , veganism is a safe way to make the most of the first part impossible , " says Proctor .	-3.2729
But purchasing vegan products could be a bit difficult at the beginning . to to to . to to the . to to to the to	-11.4498
Especially if one learns to understand that animal additives can also be included in peanuts as colourers , one seems to be quick to leave the courage with so many obstacles and traps .	-5.8130
Not only for this reason , Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen have written a book : " Veganissimo - Animal ingredients and their alternatives " explains the many ingredients that are added to food but also cleaning agents .	-3.6985
" Gradually you develop a scanner view and know what characters and logos you have to pay attention to " It is sometimes better to do small steps than stop or stumble " , Proctor knows .	-4.9464
Veganism , it is an important moral finger that beats on awareness .	-3.6888
Perhaps he does not entirely succeed in putting his habits off , but at least he can teach consumers to question his habits critically .	-4.7712

British Police Makes Assange an Extradition	-12.5169
Today , the British police handed an extradition certificate to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange , who sought refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and applied for asylum .	-4.0607
Scotland Yard declared that the 40-year-old Australian had been delivered a “ call for himself ” that called on him to appear in a police guard , and added that if he failed to do so , he was threatened with arrest .	-5.5505
Assange is threatened with extradition to Sweden because of the charge in a sex offence after its possibilities have been exhausted under British law , since the Supreme Court has rejected its objection to extradition at the beginning of the month .	-4.7022
Since he fears that Stockholm would extradite him to the US , he sought refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on 19 June and asked the South American country for political asylum .	-3.3136
Scotland Yard “ sent a 40-year-old man an invitation to take up a police guard at a time we chose , ” explained a spokesman .	-5.0034
He continues to violate the terms of his release on deposit .	-2.0034
The message did not comment on the delivery of the police invitation .	-2.4264
Assange fears that he was extradited from Sweden to the United States and accused of potential espionage accusations , having published more than 250,000 diplomatic news on the WikiLeaks revelation website .	-4.1708

Tax on foreign property owners against London ’ s Speculation Bubble	-2.2477
The Ministry of Finance has provisionally calculated the CGT measure , but is still waiting for the final decision by Chancellor George Osborne , who imposed a stamp tax of 7 % on homes in the 2012 budget , costing more than two million pounds and annual fees for buyers who hold homes as a company and not as individuals .	-5.1846
Already , revenues from the stamp tax on residential property in the Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea districts , which stood at <unk> 708 million in the 2012 / 13 tax year , collected revenues for Northern Ireland , Wales , Scotland , the North-East , Northwest , Yorkshire and the Humber region .	-4.8205
Cook said : “ After the raises in the stamp tax on high-price housing and the introduction of the related legislation against circumvention , it is difficult to say that high-quality properties are too low , regardless of the impact of the outdated community tax system . ”	-4.8817
“ But this step could make some foreign investors more restrained in buying properties in London , or discourage selling property , ” he added .	-4.1881
First-class properties – the top five to ten % of the housing market at price – in the wealthy southwest belt of London , extending from Fulham to Wimbledon , have increased by the record value of 11.8 % last year .	-4.4113
The prices in Central London showed an even-handed annual growth of 5.6 % , but were overshadowed by an emerging “ domestic market ” where the south-western part of the city , the north ( 7.4 % ) and the east ( 6.5 % ) experienced an upward trend , according to Savills investigation .	-4.8550
Scientists could throw more light on the context in which the tail wedding of a dog stands with its mood . to a of to the of . to to to to a .	-21.0355
Previous research showed that happy dogs with the tail went more to the right ( from the point of view of the dog ) , while in nervous dogs it was the left side .	-4.7193
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive and respond to these subtle differences .	-2.1579
Professor Georgio Vallortigara , a neuroscientist at the University of Trento , said : “ People know well that the left and right brain react differently to stimuli that cause positive or negative emotions . ”	-3.7060
Here we tried to look at this with other species .	-3.2188
He also noted that dogs , like humans , have the right half of the brain for the movement on the left and vice versa , and that the two hemispheres played different roles in feelings .	-4.9649
To learn more about how dogs respond to the lateral cock of their species , researchers watched the animals while watching the films of other dogs .	-5.6126
They measured the heart rate of the four-legged and analyzed the behavior .	-2.9494
Probably we will soon understand why the cock moves in one direction , sometimes in the other direction .	-3.5840
Professor Vallortigara said : “ We have shown dogs to dogs – either a natural version or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects , and we have managed the movement of the tail more to the left or right . ”	-4.6240
When the animals saw how an otherwise expressless dog moved the cock to the right ( from the perspective of the waving dog ) they remained completely relaxed .	-4.9120
But if the tail propensity was mainly left ( again from the perspective of the dog who wedels ) , their heart rate increased and they looked troubled .	-5.5838
According to Professor Vallortigara , the dogs do not communicate intentionally through these movements . by to the . of the , to the of to to the . to to the	-13.3143
Rather , he is convinced that dogs would have learned from experience , in which movements they should worry and when not .	-4.3584
He said , “ If you have different encounters with other dogs and the waving is linked to the tail in one direction rather with friendly behavior , and the right side produces a less friendly behavior , then you respond on the basis of these experiences . ”	-16.4740
Researchers say that the findings of dog owners , veterinarians and trainers could help to better understand their animal ’ s emotions . to the of animto the .	-15.4581
John Bradshaw , an expert in dog behavior and guest grant at the Faculty of Animal Healing at the University of Bristol , said that this was not the first study to examine whether left and right are important for dogs .	-4.8651
Last year , a team of the University of Lincoln found out that dogs turn their head to the left when they look at an aggressive dog , and right when it is a satisfied dog .	-3.6542
In another research at the University of Victoria in Canada , the following was : “ Dogs are more likely to go to a robot dog when they are , cock left and not right , instead of becoming troubled – exactly the other way round than in the Italian study . ”	-6.5206
According to his statement , the differences could therefore stir that the dogs in the various studies did not interpret the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs . .	-15.1950
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could help , he explained .	-2.4011
“ Although there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two brain halves are used for different purposes , many of the details still need to be determined – and dogs are no exception , ” says Bradshaw .	-3.7691
But since their behavior is easy to record , it will probably not take long before we understand why the cock sometimes moves in one direction , sometimes in the other direction .	-4.6955

Pope Francis Appoints First Cardinals in February	-2.2246
Pope Francis was first appointed on 22 February , as the Vatican announced on Thursday .	-3.2772
Cardinals are the most ranked clerics in the Catholic Church after the Pope , and they are also who elect a Pope , so that Francis will appoint the first group of men who will ultimately participate in the election of his successor .	-4.2188
There are currently 201 cardinals .	-1.2622
However , a cardinal aged 80 can no longer participate in the Pope ’ s election – a group of 120 “ eligible cardinals . ”	-3.7063
In a statement in which the news was announced , Father Federico Lombardi , a Vatican spokesman , said that a meeting of all cardinals would take place before the ceremony was held to appoint the new cardinals , also known as the consistency board .	-4.1899
“ Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision to convene the consistency in February in advance , so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from around the world can be planned , ” said Lombardi .	-16.8186
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of eligible cardinals will probably decline until February .	-3.1166
He declared that a Pope usually appoint as many cardinals as necessary so that the number of cardinals eligible for election is 120 again , and as many cardinals as he wants .	-5.0177
The consistency of next year is important because it was the first since the election of Francis in March of this year , says Valero .	-3.4582
There is currently a certain overhang on the part of Europe , and particularly Italy .	-2.7840
“ It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance , ” he said .	-2.1596
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America , but they have only a tiny number of cardinals .	-2.1618
The Cardinals will also be the first to be appointed since the Cardinals Council , founded by Francis , a group of eight cardinals from all over the world who have the task of finding ways to reform the Church .	-4.1362
In the past , the Pope decided everything alone .	-2.1702
“ Now Francis has selected these eight cardinals to help him , ” said Valero .	-2.4787
He explained that it was “ well possible ” for Francis to advise the cardinals .	-4.2355
So far , however , we have not been in this position – that is all new .	-4.4020
Valero said that bishops from large places would typically be called cardinals , but Francis is “ full of surprises – we do not know who he appoints . ”	-3.7478
GM Returns New Pickup Trucks in the US to Repair Seat Return	-12.0329
General Motors called back almost 19,000 of his brand new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra Pickup Trucks with construction year 2014 to resolve a problem with the manually adjustable seat rest , a communication from the US Regulatory Authority for Vehicle Safety on on Friday to the . to the of from to the in from to .	-17.7135
For some of the cars there may be a defect in the mechanism for returning the front seat bar .	-4.2134
For this reason , they do not comply with federal guidelines for vehicle safety in head restraints .	-3.5222
“ When moved from back to the vehicle , it is possible that the head restraint does not properly protect the passengers , so that there is an increased risk of injury , ” was read in the message on the website of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ( NHTSA ) .	-4.7999
The recalled models were produced between August 1 and September 10 .	-2.9731
Delivery of GM trucks began in June and represents the most important model start of the leading US car manufacturer since insolvency restructuring in 2009 .	-3.3942
GM informed the vehicle owners about the defect in the first half of October .	-2.1576
Due to the 16-day government shutdown , NHTSA could not check the letter of notification , which had a negative impact on car sales in October .	-3.9739
The sale of Silverado and Sierra trucks , which were newly developed for the model year 2014 , increased by 20 % in the first ten months of the year , explained GM on Friday .	-4.0703
In October GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra Pickup trucks .	-1.8780
GM shares rose by 1.4 percent on the New York stock exchange to $ 37.47 on Friday afternoon .	-2.5959
Obama ’ s Desperate Cry	-2.7477
I have elected President Obama twice in the hope that change is possible	-2.1735
He says that Obama has made laudable efforts that have been blocked by Republicans ’ blockade tactics	-3.2207
Obamacare ’ s blockade policy does not excuse Obamacare ’ s website problems , the drone attacks	-3.6631
Obama ’ s Memoirs about the 2008 election campaign are a sad memory of what might have been possible . to be from in to in .	-12.4647
Nathaniel P. Morris is a student at Harvard Medical School in the second year .	-2.0342
I am currently reading a terribly sad book .	-1.6828
It is a book that I thought it would breathe me up during the dismal second year of my medical studies and give me hope again .	-5.4872
It is called “ The Audacity to Win ” and describes Barack Obama ’ s memoirs for the 2008 presidential election .	-2.7891
When I am finished and go to bed in the evening with my patient writings , the book returns me to a time when politics inspired millions and breathed a speech .	-5.0013
The election became a landslide victory and news spokespersons held to highlight the historic importance of this hour .	-3.2459
My classmates wept for joy and my parents collected all the newspapers they could find .	-2.5847
A young team of visionaries was on the way to the White House and the nation was ready for change .	-2.0037
When Obama took office in 2008 , he had approval values of 82 % .	-2.8734
And then I close the book .	-1.2964
Switching back to the present is a bad awakening , as if one is torn out of a dream .	-3.4248
It is difficult to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague memory , a sad reminder of missed possibilities .	-2.3477
In the years since I first cast my vote , something has actually changed .	-2.8207
But it is simply nothing I could have imagined .	-2.0003
I recognise the great and versatile things Obama has achieved , from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for Health Insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq , the end of the forced concealment of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden .	-3.0405
I too believe that the party political blockade tactics have overturned too many efforts to bring our nation forward : immigration reform , a public option for health insurance and the closure of Guantanamo Bay , to name but a few .	-4.6129
But , having defended the Obama administration countless times to colleagues and acquaintances , I have finished with my attempts to explain .	-3.7363
I have reached a point of political despair .	-1.2668
Republican blockade policy cannot explain why foreign heads of state are allowed to intercept or the killing of innocent children by drones overseas .	-3.0621
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data on American privacy and why whistleblower is punished , disclosing state misconduct .	-3.2905
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki , an American citizen , was murdered without trial , nor why public financing and spending limits are being circumvented during the presidential elections .	-3.0321
It does not justify the results of a report stating that the White House ’ s efforts to calm the media are the “ most aggressive ... since the Nixon government . ”	-3.2745
And recently , it cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website in the more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act .	-2.9755
I do not know whether it is what I should have expected to do . to to to the . to to to .	-17.3040
Whether I should have understood with 18 that government work could contradict its previous political campaigns .	-3.6870
Obviously , the Members ' Office is not a predictable course , as an opposition party and random events such as the Newtown massacre shape public debate .	-3.6008
But if I look at the above examples , they seem largely elected by the government itself .	-2.6406
And that disturbs me most .	-2.2694
I elected Obama again in 2012 , not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy .	-2.0596
Mitt Romney was a confusing and unbalanced alternative ; he seemed unable to determine his direction and positions .	-3.3986
I had the impression that a second term of office for Obama , free of pressure from future elections , would fulfil the hope we have heard of for so long .	-3.3410
But , with Obama ’ s decline in approval to less than 45 % this week , the return to 2008 has become even harder .	-4.1912
It gives me the longing for the many promises that have dissolved in air .	-3.4488
This week I read a section in the book describing how Obama had to insert a serious loss against Clinton in the primary elections in Pennsylvania .	-3.4646
In a meeting with the electorate following the decision , he told his staff that they had to come back and follow the purpose of their cause .	-4.1683
“ I want us to find our spell again , ” he said .	-2.3904
We must remember who we are .	-1.0956
It is five years later , Mr President , and I could not agree more with you .	-2.6738

Clive Palmer claims that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has conflict of interest in parental leave	-1.9468
The billionaire and honourable Member , Clive Palmer , says that Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in a conflict of interest in his plans for parental leave , because his daughters are pregnant and could therefore benefit from this . to the of the . to the of to to the .	-16.3503
The mining magnate , which is in a judicial dispute over the payment of $ 6 million in CO2 tax , made the claim when he wanted to sweep questions from the table as to whether he was in a conflict .	-5.6462
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate , which are important for deciding whether to cut or reduce CO2 and mining taxes .	-3.0804
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and that Abbott ’ s daughters would personally benefit from the laws .	-2.3492
“ He is in a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave , because when one of his daughters becomes pregnant , he has a direct interest in whether or not to receive a holiday , ” said Palmer .	-3.9060
Two months after the election , the Palmer Electoral Commission officially declared the winner of the Fairfax Sunshine Coast seat with 53 votes after the recount .	-3.7983
Palmer called for a revision of the voting counting process to be carried out more quickly .	-3.2450
Tony Abbott 's daughters Frances and Bridget .	-1.4242
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of the vote ?	-1.6432
“ We need a better system , ” he said .	-0.9893
Why should we not have a system where you invade , enter data into a computer , immediately choose and then have the result at 6 : 30 in the evening ?	-4.4516
Palmer also criticized the use of pencils when marking the ballot paper .	-2.3365
Do you use it because you can wipe out the results if you don 't like it ?	-4.2895
Today , voting with pencils is incredible .	-2.5774
The Electoral Commission examined the options for an electronic election and recently published a joint legislative proposal with New Zealand .	-2.8807
Palmer , 59 , declared that his policies include an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he will take his new office “ very seriously . ”	-3.0634
A public office is about the public service .	-2.3506
“ We do not seek a reward other than that of history , namely that we can serve in a critical time of this community , ” he said .	-4.3060
RBS Suspends Two Forex Traders	-1.7436
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange department , so two people who are familiar with the situation ; this is another indication that the global authority investigation into alleged manipulations in the currency market is quickly taking off .	-5.3168
Some of the world ’ s largest banks , including UBS , Barclays , Deutsche Bank , and RBS , confirmed that they cooperate with the authorities in investigating the world ’ s largest financial market , where $ 5.3 billion change ownership every day .	-4.3279
The two traders would be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the expanding investigation that the scandal around the libor interbanking business entails .	-4.8261
The Bank , which did not comment on suspensions , confirmed this month that it received information requests from authorities .	-3.0012
“ Our investigations on this issue continue and we cooperate fully with the FCA and other regulators , ” said the Bank two weeks ago .	-2.8809
Last month , close to the situation , RBS indicated that the records of e-mails and instant messages sent by and to a former dealer were forwarded to the British supervisory authority , the Financial Conduct Authority .	-3.9632
This dealer , Richard Usher , had left the RBS in 2010 and is expected to have been vacated by his current position as European Head of Forex Spot Trade at JPMorgan .	-4.2861
Rohan Ramchandani , head of the European Spot Trading near Citi , was vacated this week and Matt Gardiner , former currency dealer at Barclays and UBS , was suspended this week at Standard Chartered .	-3.7753
None of these traders was accused of any misconduct .	-2.8512
The Usher Instant Message Group included bankers at Barclays and the Citigroup , said close to the situation .	-3.3008
UBS announced this week that it has taken steps against some of its employees after the Swiss regulatory authority Finma declared that it was investigating a suspected manipulation of the foreign exchange market in a number of Swiss banks .	-3.8329
At least six authorities worldwide – the European Commission , Finma , the Swiss competition authority Weko , the FCA , the US Department of Justice , and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently dealing with accusations that bankers should have agreed to transactions on the currency market .	-3.7825
HSBC , Citigroup , JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal investigations or received information requests from authorities , said familiar people with the situation .	-3.2170
Banks combat instant messages and emails from several years in search of cases of misconduct .	-3.1336
The news about these investigations has brought traders into turmoil in an area that has been one of the most profitable of investment bank trading units in recent years , but this year was under pressure because low volatility in currencies limits opportunities for speculators .	-5.0775
Some bankers have tried to downplay the affair , saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the extensive and highly liquid foreign exchange market , but leading traders believe that this is not necessarily true .	-3.5514
A leading trader noted that , despite the enormous daily volume of foreign-exchange trading , the fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use of own internal platforms by banks means that “ one can influence the market with very low ticket prices . ”	-4.7197
The news came out on the same day when Credit Suisse announced that she cancelled a London Exchange Traded Funds dealer this week after losing almost $ 6 million at the end of last year .	-4.0556
The Bank promptly informed the relevant authorities and cooperates with them .	-2.1918
“ We are sure that the trader has acted alone and that the matter is contained , ” explained Credit Suisse .	-3.5427
Painted the fence on the Bechtle Plot	-2.7777
A group of citizens ' initiative " Swiss meadow " has beautified the building fence on the Bechtle property on the spa promenade in Bad Herrenalb .	-9.6207
In addition , it cleaned and widened the footpath , it is said in a press release .	-3.9696
The planned covering of the disintegrating house in the rear part of the property was not allowed for security reasons , because the terrain threatens to slip down .	-4.6346
Alfred Abel , who is currently managing the property , had denied the improvement with his colleague Reinhard Domke from the BI .	-4.5935
Before the action of the BI , a transparent message " We were in favour of this " was appro.	-6.2865
However , this did little to disrupt the approximately 20 members of the citizens ' initiative in their actions .	-4.0218
Her motto on the big poster was called " We are against building ruins " .	-2.5756
She wanted to draw attention to the danger of even larger ruins on the Swiss meadow - one day the huge project should fail .	-13.2691
In conversation with many passers-by in front of the " construction site " it became clear that some citizens believe that the implementation of the city 's project will improve many , although not few have the same questions to the dimension of the project presented as the BI .	-5.8180
But they start to resign because the city continues to delay these answers , it is said by the BI .	-3.2506
As we have heard , the public statements of the mayor have an impact .	-4.2310
At the municipal council meeting in May , he said that he feared the exit for the thermal bath if the population voted against the plans for a bathing and wellness complex on the Swiss meadow .	-5.1475
Some therefore appear to be almost frightened , others feel that they are a " blunt attempt to blackmail " to the population , as the BI press release says .	-6.9966
The BI thanked the donors for the color and all the helpers .	-2.5461
Rangnick Schiris : No Swalking King	-3.1392
As satisfied as Ralf Rangnick with the current high form of Bundesliga table leader Red Bull Salzburg is , the sports director of the " bulls " was disappointed by the referees .	-4.3920
" There is currently a dangerous tendency that Mane and Alan will be pushed into the category of Swalking Kings , " he protected the two offensive wirblers at a press conference in Salzburg on Thursday .	-3.8009
Recent reason for Rangnick ’ s criticism was yellow for man at the 3 : 0 against Gardena last Sunday , when the Senegalese became a supposed acting show – which was not , however , as the TV images showed .	-6.3360
" A gross misdecision , " said Rangnick , the referee Harkam called " completely overstretched " .	-4.7062
Harkam would also have contributed to the escalation between Salzburg-Coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig-Trainer Adi Hütter after the game .	-2.4933
He decided to defend his German countryman : " I would have behaved like Roger Schmidt in every single situation " .	-3.4921
Schmidt himself does not wish to have any contact with his colleague after the skirmish .	-5.0343
I do not know why .	-1.7228
" For I am the one who was insulted , " emphasized the 46-year-old .	-3.7094
However , in view of the success race , Rangnick adopted a praise anthem .	-4.8822
" There are only two words : right well , " he stated .	-3.3859
There is not much to suspend .	-1.4522
Especially the way the team plays is impressive .	-2.1344
This is to continue quietly .	-15.4005
There will be little changes in winter transfer time .	-2.9990
There are no great reasons to change something .	-2.0928
" Except for a player comes with the desire to leave the club , " Rangnick made clear .	-4.3992
Supreme Court confirms Obama ’ s Health Act	-1.7314
It is a great victory for the Obama administration : the US Supreme Court today decided that the health law closely linked to Barack Obama is constitutional .	-2.8488
With five to four votes , the judges judged that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ’ s individual mandate – forcing US citizens to complete health insurance or pay a punishment by 2014 – is constitutional within the context of the state ’ s tax authority .	-4.0219
The chief judge John Roberts beat the side of the four more liberal members of the Chamber , while the judges Scalia , Thomas , Alito and Kennedy opposed it .	-3.5852
The Court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 2700 pages law and also believed that the provision of the Health Act , according to which states would either have to extend the conditions of access to Medicaid or would otherwise delete all state Medicaid funding , would not be unconstitutional .	-6.5084
The action against the law was exercised by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business .	-3.0239
The law was firmly rejected by all the leading Republican presidential candidates , including the ultimate challenger Mitt Romney , in the 2012 primary campaign .	-2.8123

With three gigantic reflectors at 45 metres altitude , a century dream became true on Wednesday .	-3.0941
" Finally ! " , Mayor Steinar Bergsland swarmed at the start ceremony in the TV2 station .	-3.4557
Some of the valley ’ s inhabitants came up with sun chairs , others safely set up sunglasses .	-6.5112
So far , sun-hungry people have had to go to a nearby summit in winter with a cable car . to the . to the of .	-15.3414
Ten years ago , local artist Martin Andersen presented the proposal to direct the rays with mirrors into the valley .	-3.2846
However , this basic idea has been in place since 1913 .	-3.2689
After several years of debate , the city council finally adopted the 5 million kronen ( approximately 615 000 euros ) costly project .	-4.5286
A similar construction has provided winter sunshine to the Italian Alpine town of Viganella for several years .	-3.4931
Post Hardly Empty Sunday	-2.2042
" Many citizens will not have noticed that the red points for Sunday emptying are still on various mailboxes of the core city and the districts , but you read the small print on the yellow containers of Post AG , you quickly find out that the emptyness is no longer taking place on Sundays and holidays , " says the FDP .	-6.4541
A request from the FDP confirmed this .	-1.8196
On Sundays and holidays only before the post office building in Ernst-Ludwig-Stra<unk>e 36 and at Jakob-Müller-Stra<unk>e 1 in Hüttenfeld .	-3.6755
Whether empty in Hofheim and Rosengarten is still on Sunday will not be answered in the answer to the FDP request .	-3.9924
The social and youth spokesperson of the FDP , Fritz Röhrenbeck , wants to retreat here .	-3.4667
Sunday emptying is an important postal service at appointment .	-3.5207
" Despite the price increase for letters on January 2013 , this undertaking is radical and unreasonable " .	-3.7692
Thomas Bittner , Liberal Group Chairman and City Association , supports his group colleagues : ' What annoys me is the fact that , in this case , empty times are changed or deleted ' .	-5.6015
The post office is miles away from the citizens .	-4.1350
" At least the mailboxes in the Neuschlo<unk> and Rosengarten districts must be emptied again on Sundays , " says Bittner and Röhrenbeck unisono .	-3.6470
The core city is also valid , especially non-mobile citizens should be able to reach a mailbox with Sunday emptying on foot .	-5.5382
In the city parliament , Röhrenbeck asked whether the city administration is planning to talk to the post on this matter .	-4.7540
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the post did not communicate with Lampertheim .	-1.6004
However , his knowledge also includes a Sunday empty in Hofheim .	-4.0269
Your party has spoken out in favour of privatisation .	-2.8145
" Then decisions are taken elsewhere , " said Maier .	-1.8806
Frankfurt ’ s Parking Fees are to rise strongly	-3.3414
Parking in Frankfurt could soon become more sensitive .	-2.7629
This morning , the magistrate of the city advises on a submission of transport district Stefan Majer ( Green ) .	-4.9332
Accordingly , parking charges are to be increased by 50 perpercent . from from to . from from parparparto particpar. participarticipartic	-15.4556
For this purpose , however , the prices should not be increased , but the time interval of parking clocks and parking ticket machines should be reduced from 30 to 20 minutes .	-5.2850
The Municipal Assembly will then have to decide in December .	-3.3067
The retail committee of the IHK Frankfurt considers this ' not a good idea ' .	-2.8366
The parking facilities in front of the shop are " an ununderestimable advantage for smaller dealers " .	-14.6161
The German Transport Club believes that an increase after two decades is " quite appropriate and actually long overdue " .	-3.2874
Public transport also becomes more expensive .	-1.9111
Freudenstadt : Rapid actions Surmble Host	-5.2665
With a narrow cadre the men I of the TSV Freudenstadt had to take part in the Schiller-Schulturnhalle in Reutlingen against the TG Gönningen from the Swabian Alb .	-4.0588
The Elbler stood with an experienced team on the other side of the net .	-3.1923
Soon , however , it became apparent that they could not completely compete with the rapid actions of the cities of joy .	-5.4420
The Gönningers were extremely difficult with the hard and placed surcharges .	-4.6231
They repeatedly missed the passports and attacks played by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz clearly via the network center and were not in place in the block defense .	-5.0643
Two high prize profits clearly expressed the superiority of the cities of joy in all matters .	-4.6147
Given this crushing and gambling performance , the third sentence was won somewhat lax and funny at the 3 : 0 end ( 25 : 13 , 25 : 14 , 25 : 22 ) .	-4.8220
On November 2 , the Baiersbronn TV , which was able to prevail clearly in Nagold , will be a much more powerful opponent in the field .	-4.7671
TSV Freudenstadt I : Dominik Bäuerle , Yannik Büchle , Sebastian Dölker , Felix Palchen , Stefan Räller , Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz .	-1.8270
The second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt were faced in the Murgtal Hall in Baiersbronn .	-3.8857
They delivered a hardly competitive two-hour match .	-2.6121
Nervosity on both sides caused errors and points , especially when ball-taking ; even in passports , the precision was sometimes deficient goods , and in some critical game scenes , the overhaul prevented the glance for potential points gains .	-7.6918
However , during this highly balanced meeting , the TSV team of Marcus Blasutto consistently voted for the great physical commitment and a pleasant commitment of both teams .	-5.3811
Maintenance Day at the Small English Hut	-3.3474
For the fifth day of care in the succession of the Natura 2000 project upper Hotzenwald , a group of dedicated participants met at the small English hut in Ibach .	-4.0546
Due to suggestions from the population , this day in the area of the hut the view into the valley should be freed , said Mayor Helmut Kaiser .	-5.0002
Many hikers , according to Emperor , called this area the splendid piece of the gorge climb , on which the landscape offers the ideal setting for splendid views .	-5.3337
He thanked the present for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the day of care is an appropriate instrument for strengthening the link between man and nature .	-4.2240
It gives every citizen the opportunity to focus on nature itself .	-3.5229
At the same time , with the tourist aspect , environmental consideration can also be . to to the tour.	-19.1668
This ecological aspect was explained by Friederike Tribukait of the Nature Protection Department of the Freiburg Government Bureau following the welcome by Landrat Tilman Bollacher , who had taken over the auspices and wished the action a good success .	-4.6676
According to Tribukait , the tourist objective of the vision is to preserve the old Allmendweidfeld , which has grown strongly , with its specific protected habitat types , by opening and connecting to the still existing pastures .	-6.8006
Certain species , such as rare butterflies and grasshoppers , cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest areas .	-2.7205
You need these free connections to maintenance .	-2.0569
Tribukait said that she did not want to miss to break a lance for the planned biosphere area .	-3.6633
The current measure is not only seamless in this planning .	-3.4110
A biosphere area also provides an opportunity for sustainable economic and environmental development based on the internationally recognised UNESCO status and thus a continuous complement to the achievements with the Life Project and the previous care days for the future .	-5.3949
According to these various designs , Christoph Wehle and Life Project Manager Cornelia Bischoff divided the helpers into groups . from to , to the of . to the of the of in .	-13.2627
The bigger trees had already been beaten in advance , the forest tractor may be ready to call .	-4.7573
A group of helpers should take care of the exemption of junior bushes and the maintenance of a dry brick .	-4.1626
The objective was the free view at the viewpoint .	-3.5933

Egypt ’ s First Freelected President	-2.2359
Mohammed Morsi takes office , but his day of triumph should not mean the end of Egypt ’ s political disputes .	-3.4309
Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised a “ new Egypt , ” when he was the first freely elected president of the country to succeed Husni Mubarak , who had been driven out of office 16 months earlier .	-3.5128
With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court , Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and Egypt ’ s fifth head of state since the fall of the monarchy about 60 years ago .	-2.9578
He placed the oath in front of the 18 judges of the court dressed in black robes , who have their seat on the Nile and felt an ancient Egyptian temple .	-4.9309
“ We strive for a better future , a new Egypt and a second republic , ” said Morsi at the solemn ceremony that was broadcast live on state television .	-3.5327
“ Today , the Egyptian people have laid the foundations for a new life – absolute freedom , genuine democracy and stability , ” said the 60-year-old Morsi , an engineer trained in the US , and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood , a fundamentalist group that , since its foundation , had been sharply targeted by the government as a banned organization 84 years ago .	-4.4516
Hundreds of soldiers and police guard the building when Morsi arrived in a small car convoy shortly after eleven o 'clock .	-3.6117
Only a few hundred followers had gathered before the court to cheer the new president , and , unlike the presidential prunk from the Mubarak era , traffic was only stopped shortly so that the autoconvoy could cross the usually lively road that connects the city centre to the southern suburbs .	-5.9432
As an uncharismatic “ replacement wheel ” of the Brotherhood , his personal prestige has increased since his victory and a Friday speech , in which he presented himself not only as a candidate for Islamists , but all of those who wanted to target the 2011 insurgency ’ s aspirations against authoritarian Mubarak .	-4.8649

But with the removal of the official oath to the court and not as usual before Parliament , he bows to the will of the military , pointing out that the power struggle will continue .	-5.3785

Jamef Bwell was injured in 1981 in a car accident near Yaoundé , the capital city of Cameroon .	-2.6167
First he had only a broken arm , but then an inflammation was formed that spread to his brain and caused a hematom that would affect him for the rest of his life .	-4.5868
“ There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon , ” says Georges Bwell .	-2.3775
We would have released it from Cameroon if we had the money .	-1.8761
Instead , Bwelle spent years accompanying his father in overcrowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer .	-2.9952
“ It ’ s not easy , ” comments Bwell .	-2.0795
You can leave the house at 5 o 'clock in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first , and is not the first .	-3.4102
There are many patients .	-1.4852
Some people even die because they have to wait .	-2.1071
The situation has hardly changed since Bwelle ’ s father died in 2002 .	-1.8107
In Cameroon , there is only one doctor for 5,000 people , according to the World Health Organization .	-2.6136
On the other hand , the ratio in the United States lies with a doctor for 413 people .	-3.4246
But even if there was a doctor for her , most Cameroons could not afford to visit .	-3.5739
Two out of five people live below the poverty line and nearly three-quarters of health spending in the country are private .	-2.4236
“ The only problem they have is poverty , ” says Bwell .	-1.7351
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life .	-0.9664
His father and so many of his fellow countrymen suffered the decision to do something about it in Bwell .	-3.7445
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteam carried out 700 free operations last year .	-2.4694
He became a doctor himself and works as a vascular surgeon in the Central Hospital in Yaoundé .	-19.7011
He also established a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME , which travels to rural areas at weekends and offers free medical care .	-3.4996
Since 2008 , he and his volunteer group have helped almost 32,000 people .	-2.2574
Almost every Friday he and up to 30 people force themselves into small buses and drive with the snowed medical equipment on the roof over unforgettable terrain into the villages that need help .	-5.2177
Not always everything goes smoothly .	-9.9771
More than once they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud .	-2.6241
But when they arrive they will receive as heroes : a festival , singing and dance and the best accommodation that the place has to offer .	-3.9154
In these villages , free medical care is really a reason to celebrate and wave – with its broad smile and its borderless energy – at the happy celebration .	-5.1813
The next morning the team will start investigating hundreds of patients .	-2.4447
“ We treat 500 people per trip ” , says Bwelle .	-19.4597
They come from a radius of 60 kilometres around the village – and on foot .	-3.3608
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas .	-2.1734
Many people are treated for malaria , tuberculosis , malnutrition , diabetes , parasites and sexually transmitted diseases .	-1.5589
Others receive crutches , donated glasses , or free birth certificates – a document that is needed for school , but many poor families simply cannot afford to . to to to to the . to to the to to to the .	-11.4085
In the evening , the team performs simple operations with local anaesthesia .	-2.3745
The operations usually take place in a school , town hall or apartment ; after the intervention the patients stand up and go to the recreation area to make room for the next .	-4.7768
The lighting for the OP and the disinfection equipment is fed by the generator of the group , so Bwell and his volunteers work until the early morning on Sunday .	-3.8008
It is an exhausting pensum , but village musicians usually help keep the team motivated .	-2.7413
“ They drum all night so that we can stay aware and continue our work , ” says Bwell .	-3.4643
On Sunday the team will return to the city , tired but proud of the work done .	-3.4682
The group – a mixture of Cameroon doctors and foreign medical students – carried out 700 free operations last year , and knows that its work makes a huge difference for the people to whom it helps .	-4.3253
A man explained that the free operation of a break in service he received now enables him to work again .	-4.2821
“ That changes the future of my family , ” said the man .	-2.6521
Besides the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital , Bwelle also works in private clinics in Yaoundé at night .	-3.3057
With this second job he finances 60 % of his non-profit activity , says Bwell ; the rest come from private donations .	-3.5413
“ I really do not know when he sleeps , ” says Katie O 'Malley , who studied at Drexel University in Philadelphia Medicine in the second year and volunteers in Bwelles Group .	-3.5296
He is always in hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so that he can go on these campaigns .	-4.1415
For medical and nursing students such as O 'Malley , who come from the US and Europe and support Bavaria , this is an opportunity to gain practical experience that they would never get at home . from to in .	-5.8266
" We can be in operations where we help to dismantle blood or keep the instruments for Dr. Bwell , " explains O 'Malley .	-4.6854
This would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year .	-11.1243
Students usually pay for their journey to Cameroon and bring frequently donated sanitation material .	-3.1055
But once they are in Yaoundé , Bwell takes over the accommodation , transport and manual .	-4.0411
" He is undoubtedly a hero , " says O 'Malley .	-2.3720
He dedicates his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroon people know no borders .	-2.5774
For Bwell , almost permanent work is not a burden .	-3.2177
Helping others to live a happier life and thus fulfilling a promise that he gave to his father gives him great joy .	-24.7760
“ I am so happy when I do this work , ” says Bwell .	-2.8136
And I think of my father .	-1.1222

In the course of the performance he puts the active scene in light : the hut of Santiago , the bar of the singer Marie-Luise Gunst , who sings with her songs and her wonderful voice the feeling of life of Cuba .	-5.0704
The four musicians play Cuba 's rhythm and are also guests of the bar .	-2.3967
Tourism : Descent to the Romans	-1.7843
About 120 metres in length , a wastewater channel from the Roman period is preserved below Cologne .	-4.5952
If you visit Cologne , you will not miss the Duomo .	-4.3048
About 157 meters the two towers stand in the sky and make it the second highest church building in Europe .	-3.7710
But few visitors who are amazed by the two filigree church towers suggest that there is a lot to discover under the Duomo .	-4.7915
Rainer Schulze is an expert in Cologne 's underworld .	-1.9316
Meeting point for its guided tours is the Service Centre of Cologne-Tourism directly at the Duomo .	-3.2122
The tour starts quite unspectacularly : " We start in the underground garage " , says Schulze .	-13.1021
In the 1970s , the city fathers wanted a city that was auto-accessible , and that is why the remains of the old city wall remained only what was not too big .	-6.2737
For this reason , most users of the car park are rushing to the Roman remains and only parking their car .	-6.1301
But if you look closer , the Parkdeck D2 discovers an archaeological site separated by metal grid bars .	-4.2725
There are about five metres high ruins made of handheld stones .	-3.6769
" They are remains of the Roman city wall built in the second half of the first century after Christ , " says Schulze .	-9.9439
Before returning to the daylight , Schulze lets participants take a look at a dark , 15 metre deep shaft at the upper park level .	-5.5259
This is the fountain of the old cathedral , which is unfortunately hardly perceived .	-2.9844
The next station of the tour is the pretorium , and here the participants will return to the depth .	-4.6943
We see here the headquarters of the once most powerful man north of the Alps , the Praetor of the CCAA .	-3.9064
A visitor wants to know what CCAA means .	-2.1130
" The abbreviation stands for " Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium " , which means in good German as " City of Roman Law and City of Agrippines , founded under Emperor Claudius at the place of the Altar for the Empire " .	-4.2772
And the Pretorium is the former Statthalter Palace , the centre of power of the Roman Empire on the Rhine .	-3.1858
From the premises of the exhibition , tunnel access to the Roman sewage channel , which is preserved here at about 120 metres long .	-4.8179
" You can go quietly along the so-called Cloaca Maxima if you want , " says Schulze .	-3.8772
Schulze still has a surprise .	-2.1436
After bringing the key at the cash office , he leads the group to a 16 metre deep , walkable shaft .	-14.0278
" We are now in the Mikwe , a ritual Jewish bath , " he explains .	-1.8775
The Jewish community built its bath deep into the ground to come to the groundwater that was essential for ritual washing .	-3.4970
To date , in the lower end of the Mikwe , whose origins date back to the eighth century , different water levels can be read by changing levels of the Rhine .	-4.2347
The Mikwe becomes part of an archaeological zone on the town hall square , for which the construction work will begin shortly .	-16.4811
But a few years will pass until completion .	-3.9200
Almost hacked : Reedition of Rocker	-4.9093
A bloody attack in the rockermilieu is re-rolled after more than four years .	-12.3338
A trial for attempted death , dangerous body injury and property damage against two 30 years has begun before the Frankfurt district court ( Oder ) .	-4.9176
It is accompanied by strict security measures .	-1.8356
The defendants silenced for the start .	-3.0886
They should have been active in the rocker scene and at that time they were among the bandidos .	-4.0614
The Public Prosecutor accuses them of collapsing and embarking on three men in a car in June 2009 with unknown accomplices in Finowfurt .	-4.0709
All victims were seriously injured , a man would have lost his leg .	-12.8410
The victims should have heard the competing group of Hells Angels .	-2.9730
One should have been a high-level member from Berlin .	-2.5719
Apparently , the precedent was a persecution hunt with several cars .	-4.0517
According to indictment , it was about fighting and demonstrating power .	-4.1790
The two defendants had been freed in a first trial at the beginning of 2012 .	-2.9775
A court spokesman said that it was not possible to prove that the men were actually involved in the bloody feud .	-3.6213
The perpetrators had worn masks and had not been recognized .	-1.9091
The Federal Court lifted the judgment after the revision of the Public Prosecutor 's Office and referred it back to the district court for renegotiation .	-5.1665
One of the defendants is currently in open enforcement for another offence .	-2.5582
The main concern was the reconstruction of the processes at Tatnight .	-4.3007
As a witness , the Commissioner who was investigating at the time was invited .	-3.8406
The focus was on mobile phone talks between the defendants and other people who had heard the police off .	-16.0374
It is difficult that rockers in court almost always comply with a law for them rather than say .	-5.5472
This also applies to the victims .	-1.5107
In the first process , only one of the victims had unpacked .	-2.6794
Public Prosecutor Stefan Golfier of the Frankfurt Public Prosecutor ( Or ) said on demand that new traces have emerged since the last trial .	-4.1856
Eleven more days are scheduled for the process .	-2.9006
The Discard Society Does Not Think	-2.8857
The night was long , the music loud and the mood good , but at some point it goes home .	-2.3019
Hunger is noticeable in the bells of the people on the front-passenger and back seat .	-14.4156
Clearly , one or other cocktail or champagne may be responsible for this !	-3.7869
What is closer than driving chilled to the next drive-in to treat yourself a little ?	-5.1340
I admit that I am happy to join us when we go to the fast food hole late night or early morning .	-20.3884
A few Pommes , a Cola , a Burger - and then nix as from home and in bed !	-3.1325
But on the home path the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco goers become apparent .	-4.6775
After all , what is missing is that you constantly throw your fast food bags out of the car window ? !	-14.8755
Above all during the weekends there are discarded paper bags on the street edges and in parking .	-13.1069
" Why ? " , I wonder .	-1.3720
Are people too dof to take the bags home respectively to the next garbage bin ?	-3.8904
It is not only the case that the paper product distorts the landscape .	-2.9144
Bags have already hidden traffic facilities such as guidelines , causing accidents .	-4.3685
But this is not what said ' discard society ' thinks , probably it does not even know what this word actually means .	-5.5575
If you are travelling more often in the evening , especially with several people in the car , you know what a back bench can look like after celebrated nights : clothes , bottles and other garbage are towering .	-5.4859
There would be a few bags more or less nix - unlike the street where nobody wants to trample the food remains of others .	-6.4323
I already see the day when cities and communities are too bleak - and the fast food chains for their bags have to demand deposit .	-6.1388
Obama ’ s Return to Health Policy	-2.1720
Following heavy criticism yesterday , President Obama withdrew from his often repeated , clear promise : “ If you like your health insurance , you can keep it . ”	-4.1347
After hundreds of thousands of their insurers received a letter of termination , Republicans have accused the president in recent days of deceiving the American public .	-3.7590
Yesterday , Obama relativized his original promise .	-12.3341
“ The vast majority of citizens who have functioning health insurance can keep them , ” he said at a speech in Boston .	-3.1392
In response to the numerous media reports on terminations , Obama called on those Americans who received such communications to look around the free market for new insurance .	-4.0167
Most citizens could thus receive better , more comprehensive health insurance at the same price or cheaper than predicted .	-3.1041
“ They come a better offer , ” he said .	-2.3984
The government described it as unsurprising that the five percent of the population who have concluded an insurance would have to look for another tariff , because their contract does not meet the new standards under the Affordable Care Act .	-5.6835
“ I would like to say to these Americans very directly : they deserve better , ” Sebelius said at a hearing before the House of Representatives ’ Committee on Energy and Trade in Washington .	-3.7981
Sebelius , responsible for implementing the Affordable Care Act , declared that the launch of the online platform has been “ miserable ” since October .	-2.8608
“ I am as frustrated and angry as everyone else , ” she said .	-2.1896
I am determined to regain your trust .	-1.4647
This speech by a raised Sebelius to a consultant behind her sitting at yesterday 's House hearing was started from Missouri after a dispute with Republican MEP Billy Long , whether she should be obliged to take part in Obamacare .	-6.4168
After more than three hours of hearing , Long Sebelius repeatedly afflicted the question why the “ architect ” of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily abandon state-sponsored insurance to complete a rate at HealthCare.gov , which she now wants to sell millions of Americans .	-4.8595
Government in Jerusalem does not confirm attack on Syria ’ s Air Force Ban	-14.0155
On Thursday , an American government official who wanted to remain anonymous claimed that Israeli combat aircraft had attacked an air base in Syria ’ s Latakia one day earlier .	-3.7473
The aim was ' missiles and equipment ' , which the Israeli Government feared was intended for Lebanese Hezbollah , according to CNN .	-3.6646
Syrian and Lebanese media , as well as the Arab channel Al-Arabiya , had previously reported that the base in the port city of Latakia was shot on Thursday night from Wednesday to Thursday , and the Israelis blamed it .	-4.5987
The Israeli TV channel Channel 2 showed satellite images of the base in Latakia , where Russian defense missiles of type S-125 Newa and a battery of SA-3 missiles , according to Channel 2 , have a range of 35 kilometres and can transport explosive heads up to 70 kilograms .	-4.4971
Uncertain The government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack .	-2.6290
But Reuters ’ news agency quotes an also anonymous Israeli government official in saying that he believes that Israel has carried out the attack , but is not certain .	-3.9382
One spokesman from the Israeli Ministry of Defence said : ' We do not comment on these reports ' .	-3.1306
The journalist Ron Ben-Yishai emphasized in Yedioth Ahronoth ’ s daily newspaper that the Syrian regime was already , partly successful , trying to supply ground-air missiles to Hezbollah .	-11.9062
The Israeli Government had repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to provide Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons means exceeding a ' red line ' that would follow a military response .	-12.8739
John Kerry declares in an unprecedented admission that US espionage has “ gone inappropriately too far . ”	-2.7638
John Kerry , with an unexpected admission , indicated a weakening of the US ’ s defensive attitude toward its surveillance programs by saying that espionage has “ gone inappropriately too far in certain cases . ”	-4.5660
The Foreign Minister also acknowledged that he , together with Barack Obama , was responsible for switching to “ autopilot ” when the explosive revelations of the Whistleblower Edward Snowden about the NSA ’ s spy activities became public .	-4.7520
By leaking information , the US government has fallen into a diplomatic storm of indignation from its allies .	-2.9366
In a video communication speech at the Open Government Conference in London , Kerry said : “ Without a doubt , the President and I , as well as others in the government , have learnt of a few things that have almost expired by car , simply because the capacity existed to do what still happened to the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War and , of course , 11 September . ”	-7.0570
He then admitted that US espionage had crossed a border , but also stressed that no rights had been abused .	-3.6569
He said , “ In some cases , this has gone inappropriately too far . ”	-2.5145
The President is determined to create clarity and therefore carry out a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel that abuse is taking place .	-4.3388
I assure you that the rights of innocent people will not be affected in this process .	-2.2049
Kerry insisted , however , that the NSA was a force of good and that its surveillance saved many lives .	-3.3640
He added : “ We are dealing with a new world in which people are prepared to blow themselves into the air . ”	-2.7053
There is a radical extremism in the world that is obsessed with killing people , blowing into the air and attacking governments .	-3.6215
So what if we were able to intercept and stop it before it happens ?	-2.6825
We have actually prevented aircraft crashes , attacks on buildings and the murder of people , because we have learnt about such plans in advance .	-4.3196
Meanwhile , US legislators will travel to Europe to dispel concerns about alleged American espionage and convince Europeans of the need to continue to work with the US in anti-terrorist efforts , as the Chairman of the Senatsunter Committee on European Affairs stated on Thursday .	-4.2336
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said that he spoke to representatives of the European Parliament and other people this week and was concerned about their threats to stop taking part in anti-terrorist organisations because of the frustration of the National Security Agency 's monitoring .	-4.2449
“ It is very important for US national security interests that Europeans remain on board with regard to our joint efforts to combat terrorism , ” said Murphy , who sits as a democrat for the first time in the Senate and is chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Relations and European Affairs , in an interview in Washington .	-4.7120
I also go to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism , regardless of its anger over the NSA programmes .	-3.4515
Media reports , according to which the NSA has collected millions of telephone data in Europe , have strained relations with some US allies , although this week the head of the intelligence service declared that the reports were incorrect and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and exchanged with the United States .	-4.4443
Other revelations quoted from documents passed on by Snowden , according to which the NSA supervised the mobile phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other leaders worldwide .	-14.5819
The head of national intelligence services , James Clapper , defended spying among allies as necessary and declared that this is common on on both sides .	-3.5911
In all the tumult , Murphy , his authority prepared the journey of the Congress to take place this year , and hoped that the delegation would include members from both parties and chambers .	-3.2532
The names of the other participating Members will be published in the coming days .	-2.3059
He said that the exact route is still being developed .	-2.7698
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the journey was to improve relations , he also said that there would be some “ serious words . ”	-3.0920
He said that European governments should be honest with their people about the kind of espionage programmes they have been using for years .	-3.3261
“ While we can change our surveillance programs and thus better protect the rights of Europeans , they must also accept the fact that we are not the only ones who spy , ” Murphy said .	-4.2217
Meanwhile , John Kerry is on a weekend trip to the Middle East and Poland to deal with the resentment of the US strategy in Syria , Egypt , and Iran , as well as US surveillance activities .	-4.0373
A stubborn injury to the jump joint threatens to prevent the use of Nicolai Müller in the Bundesliga Foreign Play of the FSV Mainz 05 at the FC Augsbur.	-4.3526
Mainz bands about a deployment of Nicolai Müller .	-3.5041
Tomorrow he will try to train with the team .	-1.3693
So far he has only been able to do so individually .	-3.2810
" We will decide on his commitment in the short term , " said Trainer Thomas Tuchel . . to a in .	-15.6900
The 40-year-old hopes to have his best goalkeeper with six hits .	-3.5527

Australian Calls against Prison in Thailand	-2.8065
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney , who was sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for mistakenly claiming to have been raped by a taxi driver , appealed to the ruling and was released on deposi.	-13.8060
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty by a provincial court in Phuket on 15 June to have made a false statement after having indicated to the Thai police that a local taxi driver raped them in the morning on Sunday , 10 June , while two other men held them .	-4.5423
Later , however , the recordings of a video camera showed that she had reached her hotel safely after being separated from her Australian friend .	-3.4488
The police in Phuket interrogated Bamford for two days until she confessed to thought out history .	-3.1929
Until the court negotiations , it was in police custody on the grou.	-4.0982
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a low-security institution on the periphery of Phuket , rather than in a prison for adult women .	-3.4123
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks , a former player of the Australian Rubgy League who addressed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra with a request for help for his daughter .	-13.3384
Tunks explained to the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family is “ extremely concerned ” about the well-being of his daughter and wanted to have them back in Australia .	-3.1656
“ We are of course worried , but we hope that she will be back home as soon as possible , ” said Tunks .	-3.4495
Bamford has appealed against the judgment and is open to a deposit of 50,000 Baht .	-3.0918
In Australian reports she read that she is making holidays in the holiday resort of Krabi in South Thailand .	-4.7705
It was heard from the court that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and was warned that the appeal could also lead to a higher penalty of up to two years in a prison for adults .	-3.8803
However , after the recent assassination of Michelle Smith in Phuket , Thailand may also try to improve its fatal tourist image , and there is therefore a free speech .	-6.3837
