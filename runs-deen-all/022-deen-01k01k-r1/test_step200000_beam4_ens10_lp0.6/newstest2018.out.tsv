Munich 1856 : Four maps that change your view of the city	-2.3740
A mistaken institution where young people are to meet today .	-4.2307
A tomb chapel where the S-Bahn tunnel is now digged .	-3.5446
Small gardeners manage the former cause of farmers .	-2.9970
The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories .	-2.3116
It annoys if maps are not up to date .	-2.6296
Everyone who has had to excite himself because the car navigation instead of a bypass showed a green meadow .	-5.4075
The historical maps of the digital Bavarian atlas , an offer of the Geoportal of Bavaria of the State Government , are far from current - but this is precisely why they are very instructive .	-5.4415
Especially when compared to current online cards .	-2.6693
Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed since the 19th century in the distribution area of Munich Merkur .	-3.5049
The digital Bavarian atlas is a patchwork that is not recognized as such .	-3.3250
The large overview map included more detailed maps for cities and communities , so-called urposition sheets .	-4.4917
These originated according to the Bavarian survey administration between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria .	-5.3648
Your client : Napoleon .	-1.0613
The French army leader occupied Bavaria since spring 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .	-2.1573
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic reception of Bavaria for military purposes , of course .	-2.8072
Although the French troops finally withdrew from the peace of Lunéville on 9 February 1801 , they were today ’ s neighbors who created the idea of a wide-ranging Bavarian map .	-4.5062
Kurfürst Max IV Joseph pushed the project forward , founded the " Topographic Bureau " - and thus the Bavarian survey management .	-4.0984
The Urpositionsblatt für München dates back to 1856 and can be found on the website of the Bavarian State Library .	-4.2935
The comparison between earlier and today is most impressive in the example of the state capital .	-4.1842
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown toto .	-13.3592
An example of this is Undersendling , which is still relatively isolated in the map of 1856 .	-3.2780
Sendling was communicated 21 years after the map was created , i.e. in 1877 , as a Munich district .	-4.0560
Today , Untersendling is located in the heart of the city .	-12.0222
The houses Untersendlings concentrate around 1856 along the present Plinganserstra<unk>e , which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878 , a leader of the uprising of Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705 .	-3.9280
Where the West Park is today , you can see nothing but fields - at first glance : when zooming in , a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears : handwritten numbered corridors from the so-called " take-up " from which the property tax was derived .	-6.2625
Small parcels are no longer occupied by farmers , but small gardeners of the " Land in Sun " plant .	-5.5389
A large green area is north of Untersendling .	-2.6441
The Theresienwiese , since 1810 the scene of the Oktoberfest , was indeed a meadow in the 19th century - not a concrete desert .	-3.7075
On the other hand , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine .	-2.1874
In the Urpositionsblatt you read not only the street name " am Gasteig " in the region of today 's district of Au-Haidhausen , or the hill " Auf der Lüften " - but also in large letters " Irren Anstalt " .	-5.4340
Yes , here on the Auerfeldstra<unk>e you once closed people with delusions .	-3.8971
In 1858 / 59 the Munich District Irrenanstalt " On the Auer Lüften " was founded .	-4.8078
From 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the establishment - the psychiatrist who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .	-3.7329
" He was progressive for his time and ended , for example , the chains of the so-called mistakes .	-3.0528
He also prohibited the staff from using violence against the passengers , " says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Haidhausen Museum , who worked for an exhibition on the institution .	-4.6237
There was room for 280 patients first , then 500 seats were extended .	-5.3525
At some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the circular institution in Haar 1905 .	-14.7463
Since 2006 , the Isar-Amper-Klinikum München-Ost , one of Germany ’ s largest psychiatrics , has been located there .	-4.1834
Young people meet in the Munich Salesianum in the area of the former Auer Anstalt .	-3.9838
The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth home with training companies .	-3.1553
West is the football pitch of the TSV Munich East , east of the 1980s .	-3.5628
In 2015 , the children 's house " Casa Don Bosco " was built , in architectural terms , on the origin of the Irrenan Institute , which had been destroyed in bombing during World War II .	-5.4779
The Marienplatz square was registered around 1856 as " Haupt Square " , the Kaufingerstra<unk>e was called " Kaufinger Gasse " .	-4.2031
The Second World War brought a significant change in the heart of Munich .	-2.7859
In December 1944 , the Allied bombs took many holes into the city centre .	-4.1190
A big thing remained to this day - at the Marienhof .	-3.4695
The English Institute , small business houses and a cave chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof , where these days the preparatory work and the second S-Bahn Railway Route on 5 April 2017 will take place .	-6.3916
With the slider , the old Munich card can be compared to the aerial photo of today - and the hole at the Marienhof can be filled .	-16.4412
Civil rights Group Published Travel Warning for Missouri	-2.0663
The National Association for the Promotion of Colors has issued a warning for coloured people travelling to Missouri due to discriminatory policies and the state ’ s racist attacks .	-3.8979
" The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri , which is due to enter into force until 28 August 2017 , calls on African travellers , visitors and Missourians to pay special attention when travelling through the state and to exercise extreme caution , as a series of questionable racing incidents have recently occurred throughout the state and are noted here , " says the Group 's opinion .	-5.7901
A recently adopted law by Missouri , which makes it harder for people to win discrimination actions , as well as the law enforcement authorities of the state , which are disproportionately aimed at minorities , led the group to issue the travel warning , said NAACP .	-4.8198
" They have violations of the civil rights that people happen .	-2.7774
They are stopped because of their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , " said the President of Missouri NAACP , Rod Chapel , the Kansas City Star .	-3.2680
'We hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not heard yet . '	-2.5063
It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States .	-2.5521
The group quoted incidents such as racist offences against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .	-2.2589
Sanders died in questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no petrol while travelling through the state and was detained by the police of Missouri without being accused of a crime .	-4.2921
The Council also draws attention to a recent report by the Missouri Public Prosecutor Office , which shows that black drivers in the state are stopped 75 % more frequently by whites .	-18.4261
" The recommendation is that people are aware of what might happen in Missouri , " said Chapel .	-2.1603
" People must be prepared to bring bail money or let the relatives know that they travel through the state . "	-4.4209
In 2015 , Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes , according to the latest figures from the FBI ’ s hate crime reporting program , which classified the state as regards the number of such injuries to the country ’ s 16th rank .	-4.2841
The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law , which would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination .	-20.6221
Previously , the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the States had adopted immigration laws , obliged local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for infringements of immigration , which , according to the ACLU , will contribute to further racial profiling .	-3.9678
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but stakeholders have recently used the measure to respond to certain laws and trends within the US .	-3.5405
Weidefence Project is Elemental	-3.4580
The Fischerbach Weidezaun project is a success project and will continue next year .	-1.7832
The CDU MEPs Peter Wei<unk> and Kordula Kovac gave a picture on the ground .	-3.5785
At the Rechtgrabenhof of the Schwendemann family , representatives of the Fischerbach CDU local association met together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two Members .	-3.5477
Markus Schwendemann first gave insights into his company , where he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , supplies 40 milk cows and equally many young animals and houses holiday guests in five apartments .	-4.0907
The " Black Forest Milk " is for him the alternative marketing path for the milk of his cows , says Schwendemann .	-10.5655
The table of holiday guests comes exclusively regional .	-4.7536
Since he is also BLHV chairman of Fischerbach , he called the Weidezaun project " fundamentally important " .	-3.9100
I cannot profit on such steep areas .	-3.0556
The green land surface provides a lot of work , much needs to be processed with the motor sense .	-4.5173
" We have here to fight with the conditions and with topography , " said Schwendemann .	-3.0695
In 2003 , he took over the parental company and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if he does not run a bio-operation .	-5.1269
For Mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : " The municipality has recognized the importance of the pasture fence project and is glad about leader promotion " .	-4.3610
At the cost of EUR 3000 to EUR 4000 per hectare , farmers should be supported .	-2.9327
One hopes that this could lead to the reforestation of land for a while .	-5.1778
" The greatest treasure we have are the people who work in agriculture and think about how to continue their business , " said the mayor .	-4.6796
Farmers are often in criticism of promotion	-3.4826
In 2013 , a total of 25 parcels were fenced by eleven participants .	-2.9087
The open-air space is therefore 40 hectares , which cannot be reforested by at least 2023 .	-4.3191
Half of the total cost of EUR 71 500 was sponsored by leaders , a quarter was borne by the municipality of Fischerbach .	-3.9805
Thus , farmers remained EUR 12 610 , which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of pasture fence .	-3.2739
" The great advantage is the longevity of fences , " explained Schwendemann .	-2.2762
Kordula Kovac emphasized : ' You are doing a really good job , without farmers and women there is no way ' .	-4.4049
Even Peter Wei<unk> stated : " Best food is produced here " .	-4.9004
The Landscape Maintenance Directive ( LPR ) Baden-Württemberg enables the state to promote pasture fencfefe. to to the of to the . to the to the of .	-15.9783
The aim is to keep the Black Forest open .	-1.7759
The existence of a funding scene described by the LPR is a prerequisite .	-4.0308
Moreover , the surface to be fenced must not be manageable ( slope above 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by reforest. to to the of to the of .	-14.6448
For the 2018 Fischerbach Weidezaun project , the application by eight participants is currently under way with 24 parcels that want to build just under 16 kilometres of fence .	-5.1034
The open-air area is 35 hectares and the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros .	-4.0599
Is nothing more sacred ?	-1.4869
Now , the White House of Trump ’ s Statue of Liberty	-3.3500
The safest sign of regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .	-2.3228
The Americans appreciate this as much as any other - hence the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein at Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003 .	-3.9742
Stephen Miller , one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with CNN ’ s Jim Acosta about the president ’ s proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration with the statue of freedom .	-13.0944
To stay fair , Miller did not attack the statue itself .	-1.7514
A horde of boat owners and liberty imitators would have lynched him if he had done so .	-2.4047
But he attacked their importance , and in particular the importance attached to it when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus was added to his base in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument .	-3.8919
When Miller Acosta abused : " I do not want to go into a complete thing about history , but the statue of freedom is ... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world .	-3.6088
The poem to which you refer , which was added later and is not part of the original statue of freedom . '	-3.1957
Miller is factually right , but as he said himself , it is not really about history .	-3.8984
It is about contemporary resonance to the upsetting words of Lazarus , the only one in which a state invites not only any old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : ' Your tiredness , your poor , / Your afflicted masses who long to breathe freely , / the miserable waste of your rich coasts ' .	-6.3909
There was never a time when the " miserable waste " was better to see on our screens .	-2.9983
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump ’ s US .	-2.7304
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural conflict : it is indeed a conflict about America ’ s importance .	-3.1839
Lazarus - and their friends who campaigned to place their words at the base after their death - knew very well that they took a highly political action .	-4.5709
The sculpture should show the links between French and American Republicanism by representing the female embodiment of freedom in a wasted classical picture .	-4.1874
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem , the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .	-2.8947
And she gives herself a very different name : the mother of the exiles .	-2.6330
The combination of poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism .	-2.1079
And , just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , people from the right wing wanted to switch this back for a long time .	-3.7022
The great scribe Rush Limbaugh , a kind of John of the Baptist for the coming of Trump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was not inviting anyone , but rather an early neo-conservative that brings the American flame to the surrounding world : " Lady Liberty is moving forward .	-4.3233
It is intended to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .	-2.3219
The torch should not illuminate the path to the United States ' .	-2.7041
Rather unusual , Limbaugh has come a little . from to .	-6.1831
The importance of the statue is absolutely a question of the position of percep.	-3.0107
The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted , miserable but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships .	-3.2305
It is truly about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and an opportunity to improve their lives .	-3.0823
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they must hear .	-2.1669
And that , of course , is not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever like to recognise .	-2.9550
Their torch should not illuminate the path , but inflame the hatred that is their only source of power .	-3.6182
World Championship 2017 : Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK ’ teto the from to . in to to the from to	-10.2111
Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when only two Scots belonged to the United Kingdom ’ to the UK’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ to ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’	-12.4952
The Director of the United Kingdom 's Trade Athletics , Neil Black , says that the 16-member Scottish contingent will make a massive contribution to the team in the World Cup cadre " " . to the of to in the from to in the .	-13.6743
A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which starts on Friday .	-2.0957
Black believes that " something special develops in Scotland " and the United Kingdom 's athletics must learn something from it .	-3.4202
" We welcome it and we try to understand it , and we will continue until we find it out , " said Black .	-2.8887
" I speak to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think that there is something to do with what they have done .	-2.4876
The Scottish athletes think that there is something to do with what they have done .	-2.1018
British athletics : It has something to do with what they have done .	-2.0230
And also with the type on the street corner .	-2.4954
Whatever the combination of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . '	-1.4629
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal candidates , including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will be against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m distance , while Eilidh Doyle was elected by the team as a team captain .	-13.2559
" Eilidh is quite modest .	-1.2730
Her captain speech was incredible , " says Black .	-2.1879
" A number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and very motivated .	-2.5171
The passion and real feeling that Eilidh naturally brought in were great . '	-3.2508
The Commonwealth silver medal winner , who will take part in the 400m hurdles during her fifth World Championship , says that it is incredible that 16 Scots are in the British team .	-4.4474
Scotland ’ s best total of athletes at the World Cup has been seven , reached in 1983 and 2015 .	-2.7906
The medium-range runner Muir is leading along this path and last year set five British and two European records .	-4.4175
It will participate in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m running .	-11.9893
Chris O 'Hare , who runs 1,500 metres , is another Scot that should be watched after a great season that included the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games .	-4.3627
Doyle remembers her first World Championships when the only other Scot in the team was Lee McConnell .	-3.5182
The team captain says that she is " enormously proud " of the fact that many of her compatriots will not only belong to the team , but in some cases will also join the medals and finals .	-4.5529
" The special thing about being a team captain is that she was elected by the other members of the team , so it was a great honour anyway , but knowing that my team colleagues voted for me and voted for me makes it something very special for me , " she added .	-4.4088
" Obviously I am very proud of all the Scots belonging to the team .	-2.0389
It only shows how far we have come .	-1.7493
And they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to rise on podiums .	-2.4815
What about my speech as a captain ?	-2.4906
Yes , I think it went well .	-1.4113
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation because we have a home world championship .	-2.6275
So it is really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from being back in the Olympic Stadium .	-3.8593
I get a second chance to go out and compete there and it will simply be such a great atmosphere outside . '	-3.9650
Blocking critics about Facebook : Don 't apply for a public office if you cannot treat voter heating	-18.0619
The father of our country knew something of bad press .	-1.6672
The Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long before the newspapers beat him for everything , from domestic politics to his political principles .	-2.9145
He swamped in criticism , safely .	-3.1349
But he did not silence his critics .	-1.3162
Because in 1783 , Washington said : ' Freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and silent , we are led to slaughter like sheep . '	-18.0217
This brings me to Maryland , Governor Larry Hogan , who must work to be more like Washington .	-2.1176
Hogan 's employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .	-13.8579
That is why the American Civil Liberties Union sued him earlier this week .	-2.9986
The staff of the governor released the complaint as frivol , and the online comment was full of a backlash with " Na , and ? " .	-3.0770
" It is only Facebook , " said many people .	-1.6078
But it is important .	-0.8651
And it is especially important when it is a type like Hogan .	-2.5969
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state that is astonishingly popular .	-1.7748
He has the second highest consent of the 50 governors of the nation .	-2.4803
Hogan is not a reactionary heat head .	-1.1844
He has shown a firm hand in leading his state and strict compliance with the principles .	-3.1048
He was also very skilled in using Facebook as a primary means of combining with his voters and playing his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side .	-3.7530
Therefore , blocking people who come to the side of the governor - who is a public forum officially described as being unnecessary and ultimately dangerous by employees paid by public tax dollars .	-22.9727
In an interview with The Washington Post , Hogan ’ s spokesman Amelia Chasse defended the governor ’ s actions , arguing that blocking comments is nothing more than a moderation .	-2.5125
But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hatefully filled people who swing the whip ononto .	-3.8139
The post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan .	-1.9088
And these are only real people who speak to their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur and a pastor , no trolls .	-2.9292
They all said that their comments were respectful , thoughtful , and not profane .	-12.2529
The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan 's Catholic faith .	-2.0826
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie , Md . , was not hate filled , but she asked for hate crimes .	-2.0281
" I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news , " she wrote in the comment area of the news broadcast " The Post " .	-3.2875
" Nor do I appreciate this idea if a number of people take a position on the same subject , then some people disregard them rather than a so-called collective deployment and do not recognise them as a large group of citizens affected " .	-5.8993
What governor staff called " concentrated spam attack " would probably call others " advocacy " .	-3.6750
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment .	-1.9330
It is much cleaner than in previous times if we had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical leading articles or arrest demonstrators and silence .	-4.5742
But that is what is happening digitally .	-1.9834
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for insulting Facebook and other social media .	-15.3106
President Trump is sued by Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed .	-1.7809
One of the first milestones on this issue fell in Virginia last week .	-1.7278
The chairman of the Loudoun County ’ s Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment , according to US judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria , when she banished a voter from her Facebook site .	-3.5464
And in Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin ( R ) also received a visit from the ACLU due to its use of Facebook and Twitter .	-18.2080
This should not be so difficult .	-1.8493
At the moment , Washington has had a similar effect to the Internet .	-2.8944
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800 , and anonymous letters introduced his leadership .	-3.6130
And even then , Washington had anonymous trolls .	-1.3948
The people who used pseudonyms like " Juricola " , " Valerius " , " Belisarius " and " Portius " wrote all letters to newspapers that reflected Washington 's decisions .	-3.1058
Petitions that criticized his position on the Treaty of Amity , Trade and Shipping with Britain overwhelmed his office , according to the historic documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project .	-3.6942
But he did not silence them .	-1.5153
Freedom of speech , differences of opinion and discourses are the basis of our nation .	-11.1755
And true leadership means accepting that .	-1.8108
Ronan Rafferty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club	-1.7805

Less passive smoking lung cancer	-2.2112
In the last two decades , fewer and fewer people have died of lung cancer because of passive smoking .	-2.0588
Scientists from the University Hospital of Hamburg-Eppendorf ( UKE ) come to this conclusion in a study . from in from to the . from of to . from to . to from to . to	-14.1230
" According to our estimates , 167 lung cancer deaths are attributable to passive smoking every year , " said Heiko Becher .	-3.2220
In comparison , he drew up his own study on the subject of 1994 .	-3.6248
At that time there were 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking every year in Germany .	-2.7301
The new investigation is published in the International Journal of Public Health .	-1.8158
House connections prove to be very complex	-2.5905
The construction works in Villinger Stra<unk>e are in full swing and " lie reasonably in time " , says the head of the building house Fred Heinze .	-4.9554
In the area of house connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected , since there is a lot hidden in the underground , which is not noted in the plans .	-5.6932

It is a rare insight into daily life in the highlands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was inaugurated in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,026 elders should vote through a public hike before the occupying forces .	-4.3508
An existing movement that stirred up for independence against Dutch rule quickly turned against the government of Jakarta , which maintains control of the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers .	-3.8961

Papua is Indonesia ’ s poorest province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst child mortality and literacy rates in Asia .	-2.1447
But it is also Indonesia ’ s gold land .	-2.0036
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Grasberg , owned by the Freeport McMoran from Phoenix , is only 60 miles from Paniai , a highland province in the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants .	-3.2497
In 2015 alone , Freeport reduced gold and copper worth $ 3.1 billion .	-2.1857

Indonesian President Joko Widodo , known as Jokowi in the popular mouth , promised to address inequalities and violations in Papua during his 2014 election campaign .	-3.3971
The former Zimmermann secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua - including Paniai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jakarta .	-3.0686

" Our hearts have broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014 , with the expectation that he will fulfil our hopes that justice will be restored , " says you .	-3.1188

The soldiers who had drinked hunted and beat the group with their gun pistons , said victims and witnesses .	-3.0662
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .	-1.9270
A child , the 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo , was beaten so hard that he fell into the coma .	-2.8465
A few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was fired and things escalated the next day .	-2.9664
About 1,000 young Papua men , women and children gathered in a football pitch in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice .	-2.8305
They carried ceremonial hunting arches and performed the Waita dance - constantly in the circle and imitating a bird song - by Papuas Mee Pago tribe .	-4.5091
Some demonstrators began to throw stones on police and military posts .	-2.5861
When the mood was heated , a command was sent to the soldier via internal radio : " If the masses do more than three times resistance , they shoot them dead , " it is said in an official document by TIME that was not released to the local media .	-4.8311
Yeremias Kayame , 56 , the head of the Kego Koto district of Enarotali , saw the threat and called for rest and called on the crowd to return home .	-3.4511
Nobody was listening in the mood .	-1.8276
" When I turned around , I was suddenly shot in my left wrist , " he said TIME on the veranda of his colourful wooden house .	-2.8475
Kayame still does not know who fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here .	-3.0460
" It was overcrowded , many shots were fired , " he adds .	-1.6197
The local man Alfius Youw was met three times , so his cousin , witnessing the shootings .	-3.2128

According to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstrators were killed and many others injured .	-1.7833
The news about the killings came only on the following day ' filtered ' to Jakarta .	-2.6134
Three weeks , Jokowi made a passionate speech in Jayapura in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and vowed to address the historical abuses in Papua .	-3.6870
" I want this case to be resolved immediately , so that it will no longer happen in the future , " he said .	-2.6159
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he established an extrajudicial mechanism for resolving historic human rights violations .	-2.6646
But the excuses began almost immediately .	-1.5905
" Most injuries occurred long ago .	-1.4377
Some were in the 90s and early 2000s .	-1.9387
The point is that we have committed ourselves to addressing these infringements , but there are processes that need to go through , " he said .	-3.0142
Then Wiranto withdrew when he spoke to TIME on 5 June in Jakarta and said that he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua .	-3.3102
Instead , " everything is regulated by law , " he said .	-2.1294
Wiranto , who charged the UN for ' crimes against humanity ' , which called for more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor 's bloody independence vote in 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had already been resolved , including the Paniai incident .	-3.6448
Families of the Paniai victims accepted such claims with grim inbelief .	-2.7929
" I have been interviewed four times over the past three years , but there has been no progress at all , " says Yohanes .	-2.4168

" I am afraid , " he says .	-1.2565
" I am afraid to be arrested by the military , I am afraid to be shot . "	-2.8849
His brother Yacobus repeated the view that the people of Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident .	-2.4951
He says that he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four of the victims .	-2.1500

The shootings have not stopped .	-2.3862
On Tuesday the Indonesian police shot on villagers in Paniai 's neighborhood Deiyai .	-12.6594
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company that refused to bring an unconscious man to hospital , one person died and 17 others were injured , including children .	-3.1751
The man , the 24-year-old Ravianus Douw , who was drowned when he fished in a nearby river , died on his way to the hospital .	-2.8619
Excellent villagers protested in front of the company ’ s location office .	-3.5318
The police said that the villagers threw stones to officers who responded by firing warnings .	-2.9531
But locals say that the mobile brigade ( Indonesian paramilitary police ) began to shoot the crowd and kill one .	-2.6493
" We were so panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , " says the 29-year-old Dominggu Badii , who lived near the hospital and witnessed how the injured here were quickly received , according to the TIME .	-3.9799
" I hid myself two days in my house . "	-2.5375
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the participating officers to be held accountable and to withdraw the mobile police brigade from the territory .	-3.4812
Paniai has always been a source of unrest for the Indonesian government .	-2.8341
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the dissatisfaction of the tribal Mee , Moni , Dani and Damal who live in the green highlands of Papua .	-16.5201
Many joined the Free Papua Movement ( OPM ) , the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of Papua by encouraging sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers .	-3.1294
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai , including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya .	-1.7492
In response , thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and arbitrarily detained in recent years , on the pretext of ' securing national sovereignty ' .	-2.9807
Some never appear again .	-2.1628
Among the people of Papua , Paniai is known as " a tragic , forgotten place " .	-2.3458
Poverty reinforces discontent .	-10.5758
The bit of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals .	-2.1741
Bread is just as beyond reach .	-3.3681
People here grow everything they eat : especially nota and fruit and leaf vegetables .	-2.6000
Agriculture is the task of women , who can work on four or five fields of sweetener potatoes each . to the of . to the of to the in the .	-16.8382
They retain most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .	-12.1659
Ten pieces of nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees ( 75 cents ) .	-2.0009
Over time , economic inequalities have grown between the local Papua and the new migrants who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to Nabire Airport .	-4.2140
The few jobs that exist in the region usually go to better educated and wealthier migrants .	-2.9501
Papua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to run their own companies competitive .	-3.2810
" Young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money here , " says John Gobai , Chairman of the Paniai tribal council .	-2.9009
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua .	-1.4981
Furthermore , restrictions on reporting remain tense for international media .	-2.6939
At the beginning of the year , French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua because of a lack of coordination with related institutions , even though they were given the rare permission to film .	-3.2721
According to Phelim Kine , Deputy Asian Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jokowi ’ s campaign to lift the reporting restrictions in order to promote transparency and development were not realized .	-3.6119
" There are new threats to foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia 's most troubled eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua : visa refusal and a black list , " he said in a statement .	-3.2366
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian Government remains largely limited to Papua ’ s immediate neighbors .	-2.6736
In March , six Pacific states - Tonga , Nauru , Palau , Tuvalu , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the ' various and widespread violations ' in Papua , including the Paniai shooting .	-2.9933
The same countries have historically supported OPM .	-1.8276
The spokesperson of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Arrmanatha Nasir , rejected the group 's accusations and said journalists in Jakarta : ' In Indonesia there is still a democratic system and there are free media , so it is difficult to cover up evidence of human rights cases ' .	-4.1829
The local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .	-12.9008
When an official delegation from the Netherlands , led by the Human Rights Ambassador Kees Van Baar , visited Jayapura on 4 May , locals broke their silence and afflicted him " We want freedom " , according to a source that also attended the meeting but wants to remain anonymous .	-3.9538
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua say that they will probably not vote for Jokowi again .	-2.2326
" Jokowi is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai shots , " says Gobai , Chairman of the Tribal Council .	-3.0085
He wants Jokowi to know that , apart from living under the constant threat of a predatory military , the Paniai people are in poor education and health services .	-2.7231
Gobai says that the Paniai people , like other Papua , regard their voice for Jokowi as a " guilt " he must repay .	-3.3302
" They do not need money , they just want justice , " he says .	-1.9872
Despite the threats and intimidation , the Paniai shot victims ’ families carried out one last symbolic act of defiance : the body of a victim was buried on a terrain precisely against the police and the military station .	-12.1351
They know that they may never be justified , but at least they do not forget their crimes .	-3.2864

It is the second fire that sweeps through the high house in just two years , which is accidentally called the Torch Tower .	-4.4365
The building was evacuated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .	-2.1137
" We slept and we stood up at the fire alarm and at the shouting of the people .	-13.4716
We ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50th floor , " a resident who told his name as George , Reuters .	-3.5624
Dubai ’ s civil protection authorities said that fire fighting units deleted the fire at 4.00 am local time ( 00.00 GMT ) and cooled the building .	-3.7775
The government said that it is working to provide accommodation for those affected .	-2.5218
The incident can revive issues relating to the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high houses around the world .	-3.5088
An investigation by the management of the Torch building following its fire in 2015 showed that the majority of the damage came from the facing , external lining to decoration or isolation .	-4.7187
In the United Kingdom , the police said that they believe that the system of plates for isolation and covering at the London Grenfell tower in June could contribute to the rapid spread of a fire where some 80 people died .	-4.8272

The President of the International Tennis Federation ( ITF ) has fallen through with his large Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly .	-3.1810
At the meeting in Ho-Chi-Minh City , the revolutionary proposal for this sport to play Davis Cup individuals only on two winnings was not supported by the required two-thirds majority .	-4.9541
The five-set classics , which are often very long but also very appreciated for this reason , remain the traditional competition .	-5.5220
63.54 % of member countries voted in favour of the reform , so the ITF President David Haggerty ’ s goal was scarcely missed .	-3.6401
" We respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members have not adopted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup .	-2.6813
We need a change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historical competitions , " said Haggerty .	-2.2065
We will continue to work to improve competitions .	-2.2037

More than 1 out of 5 US travellers bring forbidden items into the aircraft , finding a survey	-3.5535
A survey among air passengers showed that more than 20 percent deliberately or unconsciously banned items smuggled past the US Transportation Security Administration ’ s control points , including at least 6 percent that entered the aircraft while carrying accidentally banned knives or other items with blades .	-5.1047
Less than 1 % claimed that they had discovered late that they had travelled mistakenly with firearms , ammunitions , or explosives .	-3.4606
The survey of more than 1,000 people - carried out by a jet charter service , Stratos Jet Charters Inc . - also found that younger travellers rather disregard the rules .	-4.0218
Of those respondents who admitted that they knowingly tried to fly with something banned by the TSA , 19.7 % were millennials , compared to less than 15 % that were members of Generation X.	-3.5958
The most common items deliberately passed by TSA agents were food and liquids .	-3.0385
More than 3 % admitted that they had knowingly carried objects with blades through security control , while 2.2 % of female respondents and 3.7 % of male respondents also confirmed that they had deliberately brought forbidden drugs into the aircraft .	-4.3970
The company said that it asked travellers throughout the country to find out how many inadvertently smuggling goods would have been brought through airport security and how many would have done it intentionally .	-5.3184
It is no surprise that the people who bear the most smuggling goods - knowingly or unknowingly - through safety were those who fly most frequently .	-4.0412
The company , however , points out that the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing .	-12.6702
People are often uncertain what liquids they are allowed to take with them or how much of them .	-3.3517
So it is no surprise that the greatest amount of liquids prohibited by the TSA are .	-3.8394
For a time , people thought that TSA could view books as smuggling goods .	-3.1876

Elon Musk does not care : Tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel Order	-2.3502
Elektro-Thousandsassa Elon Musk likes to indicate with the huge number of preorders for his new Tesla " Model 3 " .	-3.6911
He has hitherto failed that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation .	-3.7969
In addition to the always triumphant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tesla chief Elon Musk has for the first time betrayed another less glossy figure in announcing the recent quarterly balance sheet : cancellations in the new mass market model 3 .	-5.7780
Musk has often advertised over the past few months with more than 500,000 preorders for the new car whose delivery starts .	-4.0145
Now Musk admits : 63,000 of the total 518,000 preorders have been withdrawn .	-3.5345
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations .	-3.0067
In case of cancellation , Tesla will fully refund the $ 1000 ( $ 1000 in the US and $ 1000 in the UK ) " Reservation Deposit " .	-4.8096
Currently there are 455,000 such non-binding reservations , Musk granted in a telephone conference with analysts .	-3.6813
However , the Tesla Chief does not believe that the cancellation of around 12 % of all orders could become a problem .	-4.0740
His argument is that the challenge of ambitious growth targets lies not in demand , but on the production side .	-3.2201
Last year , Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles .	-1.4559
In 2018 - all models together - it will be 500,000 , one million in 2020 .	-3.4404
The demand for this is obviously there .	-2.1020
According to Musk , 1800 reservations are added per day .	-2.7202
If you order a " Model 3 " today , you may expect to deliver at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive its brand new production roads , which have never been tested in practice , without maximum load interruptions .	-14.7164
Many experts doubt that this is possible .	-1.2952
However , if there is more delay , the non-binding reservation could become a problem for Tesla .	-3.9560
After all , the company cannot prevent dissatisfied customers from running away .	-4.1698
EPA Chief Pruitt withdraws from Obama Era ’ s Rules of Reducing Emissions	-3.7902
One day after he was sued by 15 states , Scott Pruitt , the head of the environmental protection authority , withdrew his previous decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules to reduce emissions of smog-caused air pollutants .	-4.1485
Pruitt presented the change when his agency proved more responsive to the needs of the state environmental authorities than previous administrations .	-3.4845
He did not mention the complaint that had been brought against his previous post in a federal appeal court .	-3.3289
It is a deadline for states on 1 October to comply with 2015 standards on ground-close ozone .	-3.8507
In June , Pruitt announced that he would delay compliance by one year to give his authority more time , study the plan and avoid " interfering in local decisions or impeding economic growth . "	-17.2390
Pruitt , who was President Donald Trump ’ s prosecutor of Oklahoma before his appointment , has long been a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations .	-3.4863
Since his arrival in Washington , Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations that oppose the chemical industry and the fossil fuel industry .	-2.9078
The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the recent legal setback for the Pruitts regulatory rollback agenda .	-1.9007
Last month , a federal appeal court in Washington decided that the EPA administrator exceeded its authority when trying to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration that committed oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks .	-3.2731
In an opinion published on Wednesday evening , Pruitt suggested that his turn on ozone standards would simply strengthen the EPO ’ s willingness to cooperate with the states through the complex process of meeting the new standards in good time .	-4.5525
" Under previous administrations , the EPO has often failed to meet the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be accused of activist groups and others , and in an agreement to set the deadline for implementation , " said Pruitt , who sued the EPO more than a dozen times in his previous job .	-4.5310
" We do not believe in regulation by court proceedings , and we take deadlines seriously .	-2.3328
We also take the law and the authority that exists to us seriously . '	-2.7024
Nevertheless , the opinion of the EPO said that Pruitt will eventually use his ' power to late and all other legal powers ' to ensure that the rules ' are based on sound policy and the best available information ' .	-5.3039
Congressional Republicans are pressing for a broader recast of ozone rules .	-2.4237
A bill approved last month is intended to delay implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .	-19.2291
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate .	-1.3854
The New York Prosecutor General Eric Schneiderman , who led the coalition of the states that sued the EPO this week , said that the group intends to maintain legal pressure .	-3.3721
" The reversal of the EPO - following our complaints - is an important gain for health and safety from these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog flowing into their communities , " said Schneiderman .	-4.1274
In this case , New York joined California , Connecticut , Delaware , Illinois , Iowa , Maine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Pennsylvania , Rhode Island , Vermont , and Washington , and the District of Columbia .	-2.1135
Soil ozone is created when pollutants from cars , power stations , oil refineries , chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere respond to sunlight .	-3.2696
The emerging smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people and contribute to thousands of premature deaths every year .	-2.8409
Representatives of public health care and environmentalists rejoiced at Pruitt ’ s surprising change of course .	-3.5758
" It is worrying how much pressure it takes to take this reasonable step from the person responsible for the protection of the air we breathe , " said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity .	-3.5413
" We must continue to fight the Trump administration 's ideological crusade to offer ourselves to polluters and their special interests . "	-3.5385

In 1267 , the St. Hilarius Chapel was first mentioned in the Württembergische Urkundenbuch : Count Hermann von Sulz sold " the mountain with the parish church of Tumlingen and the Vogtei " to Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver .	-8.7195
According to the text of the document , the Tumlinger Mountain , apart from the former parish church , was also a magnificent courtyard , including the church or the patron law and not the other way around .	-6.9122
So people lived there .	-2.7620
As shown in the description of the Oberamt Freudenstadt in 1858 , next to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf , which are still visible today in the village screen of Tumlingen , the " mountain " was the third , the magnificent settlement centre of the village .	-5.8298
Old cards dating back to 1600 underpin these historical conditions .	-3.3121
Patronate law was established from the early medieval Eigenkirchen law .	-13.9352
A Lord who built a church , equipped and occupied with a priest , remained the owner of this church and could inherit this church .	-4.4025
It was associated with the right to set up a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop .	-4.3600
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower .	-2.1275
The size of the two most breakable at Christmas in 1673 .	-4.1829
The newly purchased bell sounded for the first time in 1692 , but had to be delivered later during World War II in 1942 .	-13.2544
In the 30-year war ( 1616 to 1648 ) the windows were beaten and the bell ropes were stolen .	-4.0606
The roof was leaky .	-3.0782
In 1796 , French troops camped near the church .	-2.2737
They broke out the chancels and church chairs and used them as firewood .	-3.4144
The remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809 .	-1.8836
Until 1869 , the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery was also the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler .	-3.1881
In 1823 the cemetery was expanded and the Hilarius Church aborted .	-2.8189
Only the church tower was standing .	-3.2682
During New Year 's Night in 1834 , a storm divided the church tower and half collapsed .	-3.0301
To prevent accidents , the tower was aborted .	-3.3558
Only today ’ s tower dwarf remained a witness to the 750 years old church history .	-11.9745
Today , Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem from the " Schaffigen Pensioners " as a successor to Dieter Dockhorn maintain the Hilarius facility .	-4.0410
As an organizer , the friends and promoters invite tumlingens on Sunday 16 July to the sixth serenade in the old cemetery to the St. Hilarius Chapel .	-4.8233
This is designed by the combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with words by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis .	-3.1925
Place chairman Hartmut Romann speaks the ke. to the of the .	-16.2528
The program starts at 4.30 p.m.	-2.2063
Admission is from 5.30 p.m.	-2.9158
A drink in front of the graveyard takes place to close the Serenade .	-4.2774
" Enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest " , the organisers display the fantastic views .	-4.3308
The serenade takes place only in dry weather .	-1.9492
The organizers hope for many supporters to preserve the historic St. Hilarius plant , which is important for tumling and hearing swimmers .	-20.1100
Friends and promoters of tumling feel particularly committed to home care , as Serenade organizer Walter Martini confirms .	-3.9826
Association wants to check authorisation of wind wheels	-3.5871
" Boisheim defends itself " does not see a legal precondition for the construction and has therefore turned to the council .	-4.7623
The association " Boisheim defends itself " has asked Landrat Andreas Coenen ( CDU ) to withdraw its permission for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheim Nette .	-4.3033
It was illegal .	-1.9877
The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 , wind turbines could not have been authorized at the Boisheimer Nette , since at the time in Viersen there was only a wind concentration zone on the city border with Schwalmtal .	-5.4037
Within this concentration zone construction and operation of wind power plants are possible , while the concentration zone also excludes wind energy for the rest of the city .	-4.8476
Such zones are intended to prevent the landscape from being " saved " .	-3.7182
Although the city of Viersen had decided a second wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette a few days earlier by amending the land use plan , which had not been approved by the district government of Düsseldorf because of a form error .	-5.5033
" Because of the lack of planning legislation , the authorisation notice issued remains unlawful and therefore also to withdraw , " said Christoph Erkens , Chairman of " Boisheim defends itself " .	-5.5683
Current state of play : Before the summer break , the city council resolved the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette ; the district government is still outstanding .	-5.9439
Erkens : " This excludes the granting of an authorisation for the construction of wind energy plants " .	-4.5342
The circle confirms the receipt of the invitation .	-1.7794
" The corresponding letters have been received at the Viersen district since last week , " explained a speaker .	-3.4487
The circle takes it as an opportunity to re-examine the matter .	-2.8975
However , they probably do not cause the procedure to be stopped .	-2.9998
With a view to ongoing proceedings at the administrative court , the circle on Thursday did not wish to express its opinion on the content of the association " Boisheim defends itself " .	-5.5115
NEW Re , a subsidiary of NEW , plans to build four 200 metres high wind wheels on an area at the Boisheimer Nette .	-4.0463
As early as last year , the company in which the city of Viersen is directly involved had concluded leasing contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of terrain .	-4.8269
With the construction of the four wind turbines , the electricity needs of around 11 400 households can be met - that is about one-fifth of the electricity needs of all fourses .	-5.3252
NEW Re wants to invest around EUR 20 million .	-1.7579
Last summer , Viersen ’ s city council gave the green light for the purchase of three wind power plants in the wind park Linnich near Aachen as well as a participation in a wind power plant in <unk>bach-Palenberg in the district of Heinsberg .	-4.2600
Car and tractor collapse : Mrs dies in terrible accident	-3.6808

City and traders are planning ' home shopping ' weekend	-3.5504
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region are to rediscover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September .	-12.5350
The industrial association and the city administration want to take advantage of the weekend on 8 and 9 September to attract the inhabitants to the shopping centre .	-5.0785
As the Chairman of the Industrial Association , Christian König , announced , the " home shopping " weekend is intended to raise awareness among the customers of the offers offered by their own city beyond the usual supermarket goods .	-5.9273
So a market with regional suppliers is planned , similar to the weekly market .	-3.1165
Moreover , domestic companies are to present themselves with their training places .	-3.4687
In addition , the shops of the city centre are invited to " midnight shopping " .	-4.9850
The action is not only aimed at the inhabitants of the city and the nearer region .	-12.3550
In preparation are advertising spots on the radio , an Internet video and printed bags , which point to the weekend of action , Christian König said .	-4.6754
City administration and commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce .	-3.0012
Thus the industrial association and the city go into another stage of the project " Attractive City " .	-4.8085
These include new offers such as the first " Active Day " to the Well Festival , including Sunday sales , discussions with all traders and hosts to encourage them to participate actively .	-6.2756
Also attractive offers on Saturday and the renunciation of parking charges this day are part of the concept .	-3.3830
In addition , customer potential should be re-opened or re-opened .	-3.3680
These include spa guests and tourists .	-2.2443
But many locals would also have lost sight of the city when shopping .	-4.0538
In the end , everyone would have to help to revive the city centre - to landlords , the businesses of the whole city and clubs .	-13.0295
With a network , it was necessary to overcome the lethargy that had partly broadened , King said in spring .	-16.7463
Birgit Streich , Head of the IHK Center in Mühlhausen , announced that the third " home shopping day " across Germany , will be involved for the first time in five Thuringian cities .	-5.0600
Besides Bad Langensalza , these are Weimar , Sömmerda , Holy City and Bleicherode .	-2.7354
The day should ' promote the appreciation of local trade and stress its importance for the common good of our cities ' , says Stream .	-4.1912
The action led by the IHK and with many partners also makes it clear that each citizen can influence its own direct environment with its purchasing behaviour .	-4.8272

Trump put pressure on Mexico after leaked transcripts of telephone calls for paying the border wall	-3.3250
Transcripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .	-1.7993
On January 27 , Trump called in a telephone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall .	-2.8926
The US President insulted him because he had publicly denounced the wall , according to reports he said to him : ' You cannot say that to the press ' .	-4.7330
Trump launched his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the US , and swore to make Mexico pay for the project .	-2.8357
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and revealed a tense exchange .	-2.5059
Mr. Trump said to Mr. Turnbull that trade for the US would be " ridiculous " , " mies " and " stupid " to take over refugees emigrated to Australia , and that the trade conveyed by the Obama administration would make him look like a " dep " after proposing a ban on resettling refugees to the US .	-5.2123
Mr. Trump finished the call after saying to Mr Turnbull , ' that is the most unpleasant call for the whole day . '	-3.4944
Moore ’ s Ford Massacre : Activists return to racist lynchact as a call for justice	-3.0344
A 1948 Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in rural Monroe , Georgia , and rumped on the Ford bridge of Moore .	-3.5202
Before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men emerged with guns to block its way .	-2.9177
The leader of the mob - a middle age man in a needle strip suit - took a long train on his cigar and looked tested through the windshield .	-4.5265
Inside the passengers floated in fear .	-2.8163
" We want this n ---- r Roger ! " roarthe man .	-3.4777
" Get it out of the car ! "	-10.7089
Screams torn the silence when a young black man was dismantled from the front-passenger seat .	-11.7061
Fortunately , this terrible scene , which was played on 22 July , is only one replacement .	-2.9999
But when a snake is thrown around the neck of " Roger " , almost everyone in the audience emerged very real sight .	-13.3595
Since 2005 , civil rights activists have returned to the Moore 's Ford Bridge to emulate the night when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom , as well as George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946 .	-3.5675
Nobody has ever been accused of the murders .	-12.2923
" It is really inconceivable that not a single person has been arrested in all these years - although we see them in our communities , although we know who they are , " said Tyrone Brooks , who helps organize the reproduction .	-4.8505
" It is a spot of dirt on a story , but it is a burden on our souls . "	-2.7678
Brooks is a 71-year-old former member of the Georgian State of Congress and a civil rights activist .	-13.5649
For him , it serves as a dramatic call for action and is an annual memory of the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected .	-3.6270
" We want law enforcement , we want the end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we need justice , " he said .	-3.5132
'We cannot get healing and reconciliation until we get justice . '	-2.6185
A court medical professional puts a bedcloth on the corpse of one of the victims of the Moore-Ford lynchen on July 27 , 1946 .	-4.7157
According to FBI files received by the NBC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the lynch process .	-2.8514
But none has ever been charged .	-2.6013
Although the suspects have remained free for decades , civil rights activists say that the double motivation for lynch actions has always been known throughout the city : politics and sex .	-3.5306
In April 1946 , a Supreme Court ruling enabled the black citizens of Georgia to vote for the first time in the summer election campaign .	-3.4826
About the same time as the election , according to the FBI , the black farmer Roger Malcom laid down a white landowner , Barnett Hester , during a fight - supposedly because of a woman .	-4.2668
Brooks said that the rumor in the city was that Hester slept with Malcom ’ s wife Dorothy , and that the baby she wore did not come from her husband .	-3.3034
On July 25 , 1946 , Loy Harrison , a prominent white landowner , paid $ 600 to exempt Malcom from prison , according to the FBI .	-2.6978
He was accompanied by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey to prison .	-1.8439
But when they then distanced themselves from the prison and approached the Moore 's Ford Bridge , a lynchmob surrounded the car .	-2.9665
" As it turns out , it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murders , " concludes an FBI report .	-2.4795
" It is also obvious that there was a plot between state and local prosecution , which was not only involved in the murders , eliminated evidence and covered up the identity of witnesses . "	-4.2403
Brooks formulate it even more concisely .	-2.1823
" It was an electoral massacre , " he said .	-1.7013
" They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : " If you have registered and if you vote , that will happen to you . "	-4.0264
For almost a decade , Cassandra Greene has led the annual replacement of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch killings .	-2.7283
Their presentation is illustrative , gratifying and is based on a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe that it no longer exists in America .	-4.7558
It is difficult to watch and look away even more difficult , but Greene said that this is the point .	-22.9197
" We do not want to talk about lynching , because we are then faced with its ugligence in all of us , " she said .	-3.9338
" But I cannot build a relationship with you if you do not want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have done " .	-3.6722
The samples for this year 's production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen whites and the rest of black - pushed into a room and listened when Greene started a well-played overview of the piece .	-4.2486
Wade Marbaugh is here Greenes Co director .	-1.9920
He has played the role of the chief clan member for years , but he said that the role will never be easier .	-2.9098
" I feel dirty because I am not so , " said Marbaugh .	-1.8116
" But I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return at these times . "	-3.2040
On the other side of the room , the actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona , who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester , tried their lines .	-2.5372
The piece begins with Malcom , who shouts and afflicts Hester , angry that he slept with his wife Dorothy .	-4.0990
" I said n --- he disappeared from my property ! "	-2.1863
Rascona replies the fire .	-1.2131
There is a break .	-1.0468
And then everyone ( at least all black actors ) erupts into laughter .	-2.0725
Greene laughs the loudest .	-1.2854
" What ? ! " , Rascona asked .	-1.8451
It is alarmed and confused .	-0.9497
Was I too hard ?	-1.0204
" No " , said Greene , still kicking .	-2.8941
" I simply do not think white people said ' n -- he ' .	-2.8900
" But " , one of the other black actors scored .	-3.4887
" You only have to meet the hard ' R. ' .	-2.7099
And that is exactly where the energy shifts in space , a feeling of comradeship replaces the unease .	-4.0642
Everyone is busy getting this right , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four people killed .	-3.2737
The scene begins again .	-1.3891
This time , when Rascona says the N word , he says it sharply and forcefully .	-2.5884
Absolutely nobody laughs . . to . to to . to to . to to to .	-10.5761
This repetition ends violently and quickly .	-1.8257
There are cries , shots and then silence .	-2.5033
A woman , dressed with a mourning dress , stands above the bodies of the actors and performs Billie Holiday 's gripping praise " Strange Fruit " .	-3.5458
Your vote breaks with every second word .	-2.3322
About a hundred metres behind it , a group of about four dozen spectators sweat and tears from the eyes .	-4.0175
The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white .	-1.7979
A couple arrived from Ithaca , New York , to see the performance , many just come down the road .	-3.0029
They have experienced moisture every eight hours of Georgia when Brooks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tombs of the Malcoms and Dorseys .	-4.2320
Until that point , the murders have remained an anecdote , but now , when you stand in the same country where the Lynch murders took place , the air feels spec. to to the . to to the to . to to the to to the to the	-14.2916
When the last notes of the song end , Greene invites you to come closer and inspect the body name .	-3.2254
Children put on their heads , register the fake blood and the quiet body and whisper each other .	-4.0573
" They are not really dead , " a little boy murmurs as if he wants to remember .	-3.3154
After a few minutes Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it is over .	-2.3190
Actors throw away the lynch rope and wipe their tears .	-2.5199
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh , the man in the suit who played the clan member .	-2.4028
Nick Rascona embraces two of his players and then breaks crystally into their arms , the emotional burden of the performance eventually breaks down with hi. to the .	-21.7903
" It 's okay " , whispers one of the women .	-1.9365
" We know that this is not in your heart .	-1.6172
You did so for one reason . '	-2.0614
Later , the audience meets the actors for dinner .	-2.6166
At a table , a white couple from Atlanta suggests the adjustment with a black pair that they have just met .	-20.5508
Denise Duplinski fought to find words that left the performance .	-2.8268
" It is difficult to hear these terrible words and deeds ... come from people who look like you and do that because they look like you , " she said .	-3.4948
" What this really does with me makes me believe that the lynches are still going on , " she added , " today this is only called police shooting . "	-5.3444
In the same room , Tyrone Brooks holds his table , he eats and reminds of civil rights .	-3.4647
He said he started planning the performance next year .	-2.2055
" The replacement is inspiring in some ways , because it describes the horror of what we have endured , but it is also a moment of learning , " he said .	-10.5675
" It 's like learning nothing from it , then it can happen again .	-3.4479

Stormish are celebrated Foster , Milling , Vinke and Conductor Janowski , who modest and shapes his hands to the Merkel Raute .	-4.8314
There is great applause for the festival orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time - given the large heat again in casual leisure clothing .	-5.2347
The performance of Frank Castorf and his directing team was awaited with excitement .	-3.7829
In 2013 , if he had got a successful pipe concert over himself , there were great cheers five years later , in which the individual " buh " calls went under .	-16.5573
Festival Chief Katharina Wagner is probably looking forward to this . ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-12.3069
" One realizes that the audience has grown together with the " ring " in a way , " she had said just before the performance of the dpa .	-4.7517

EPO Returns Decision to Delay the Smog rule after complaints	-3.7619
The US Environmental Protection Authority has lifted a decision to delay regulation of the Obama administration , according to which states are obliged to contain emissions causing smog , a day after 15 states sued the agency for the move .	-5.1903
The EPO late announced on Wednesday the decision to promote the so-called ' ozone provisions in 2015 ' and said that it showed the Agency 's commitment to cooperate with states .	-14.3123
" We believe in dialogue with and in responding to our state partners , " said EPA Chief Scott Pruitt in a statement .	-2.9719
In June , Pruitt announced the EPO 's intention to delay ozone regulations - in which part of the country should measure pollutant emissions to determine where cuts need to be made to meet stricter air quality standards - by one year until October 2018 .	-4.5790
A group of 15 largely democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , complained on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .	-2.6438
President Donald Trump ’ s administration has tried to reduce a wide range of environmental requirements imposed by former President Barack Obama , as part of a broader agenda that Trump is seeking to boost economic growth .	-3.6613
However , efforts have triggered the setback of democrats and nature protection groups , which are worried about the effects of greater emissions on public health .	-3.7087
The EPO website says that inhaling air containing ozone " can reduce lung function and increase breathing symptoms " such as asthma .	-3.3609
Local Council Wants Community Area	-4.2842
In the end , the decision was clear : in the event of two opposing votes , the council of Fluorn-Winzeln decides to establish a Community area in the future senior residential complex .	-5.0455
Before the discussion there is an important information : the purchase contract for the lack of property is signed , Mayor Bernhard Tjaden reports .	-3.8402
Although it will take time for the area belonging to the church community to date to become a municipality , there is no longer any planning obstacle to the project to be stemmed by a private investor .	-6.2183
There is a discussion on a Community area for this .	-2.7841
One of the two investors still in the boat has offered to meet the community .	-3.0514
On the ground floor , it would provide a living area - approximately 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a surface area of 70 square meters for a special price .	-3.7988
The administration and majority of the municipal council suggests that such a Community area should not be seen as a meeting point for the inhabitants of senior residences , but openly inside the municipality .	-6.4473
As an example , the word " knitting café " made the round .	-3.2564
The decision pre-decided by the allocation of resources to the current budget last autumn is sweetened by funding opportunities .	-5.1679
The construction is in the restoration area .	-3.1344
The establishment of a Community area , Tjaden reports , would be eligible for funding at 60 % of the to. from the to the . to the to . to the to the . to	-15.9542
The proposal for a decision , in order to signal to the investor that it does not want to be thrown down in this respect , provides for the establishment that both saddle - which is based on environmental construction - and pult roof - which reduces the grape height and makes the construction more economical .	-7.9432
Needless to say , Wilfried Sohmer does not mean this addition .	-3.1190
If it is helpful , unanimously it happens the body .	-4.3659
It is not as easy as the Community area .	-3.0750
Daniela Ruf refers to the many buildings with which you are not making quite progress , for which you are now leaning in the Community area from the window , she says : ' I am hard to do so ' .	-8.1418
Yvonne Staiger is absolutely in favour of the Community area , but absolutely against local participation .	-3.4379
It sees a hidden subsidy to already wealthy or even foreign investors .	-3.2105
That is not the case , because the acquisition of the area does not give a grant , but rather gets a genuine , marketable equivalent , in case of doubt , is the counterspeech .	-7.2828
Staiger ’ s request to split up the proposal for a resolution accordingly finds three support.	-4.3140
Thus , with two votes against the original programme , which summarises Stefan Haller : ' If we take the decision in this way , we will take a giant step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure ' .	-5.3215

" We know that we are not in the best physical constitution , " said Ancelotti and added : " The most important point is the balance in the team .	-2.4695
That was not good last . '	-2.9199
The 58-year-old , however , believes in an increase in performance in the first official obligation of the season .	-3.6693
" Football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation .	-1.4259
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .	-1.6411

In resin the first " star path " is to be created nationwide .	-4.0339
The association plans to do this by Sternwarte Sankt Andreasberg .	-3.3196
There is a planetary trail in Göttingen - since 2003 .	-2.4993
A " star path " meets the information needs of many resin visitors , it was said .	-4.0761
It combines nature , science , movement and sports performance .	-1.9711
The members want to put up panels along the planned route and inform them about stars and constellations .	-4.5134
In a first phase until 2018 , the association plans to " easily accessible installations in five to six places " in the upper resin .	-4.6265
St. Andreasberg , Braunlage , Hohegeiss and Sieber would be in question .	-4.0678
The information on the boards should be supplemented via the Internet .	-2.8419
For this reason , good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of locations .	-4.2077
Accessibility is also a criterion .	-1.3026
Later , the star trail will be extended by train .	-4.2336
" On the star path , the viewers learn a lot about the physics of each star , " said the club .	-4.5434
They also learned why stars had different colors , or why a star shines more than another , even though it is far further away .	-4.3122
It also conveys the constellation of a selected star and when it is best to see .	-4.5881
The association has been operating the highest star waiting in Northern Germany since 2014 in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg .	-3.8603
The location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany , according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation .	-3.7325
Often the Milky Way and even the Andromeda galaxy can be seen with a mere eye .	-3.9514
In the uni-city there has been something similar to the planetary path in the United States since 2003 at the initiative of the Förderverein Planetarium Göttingen .	-4.8268
Starting in front of Gebhards Hotel in the Goetheallee , which forms the interior of our solar system , the Planetenweg leads with its steles up to the Hainberg and Sternwarte - as well as an " alien " location in Diemarden ( municipality of the same ) with the planet Sedna .	-4.6724
The steles with the individual planets - including the pluto degraded to the dwarf planet at the end point - are exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .	-4.4384
The earth thus shrinks to a ball of 6.5 millimeters in diameter , while the exactly 75 metres away sun measures 70 centimetr. to the of .	-14.5639
The whole distance of the planetary trail is about four kilometres .	-12.8155
While the light from sun to pluto takes about eight hours , pedestrians need a good hour to stele with pluto .	-3.2364
Pedestrians are therefore faster than light in space .	-2.1754
But the march to the next fixed star would take half a year .	-3.4479
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time , discuss a possible showdown	-1.6649
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia , who should be on a collision course to stage the most exciting box fight below 147 pounds in the near future , met for the first time on Thursday .	-3.1805

Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday evening at 7 pm on ESPN .	-2.2206
When the pair positioned for photos , Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas noticed that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the " perfect order of scale " .	-13.9469
" I am a former spring weight " , Garcia reminded .	-2.5072
" I have risen for Broner [ to 140 pounds ] , but I am not so big .	-3.0979
I am small for 140 .	-0.9694
I would like to go down on lightweight .	-3.1843
And he must move to lightweight [ 135 pounds ] and then we fight .	-2.5626
That is what the fans demand .	-2.2288
Let us give them that . '	-1.3162
Lomachenko agreed .	-0.6498
" Boxing needs this fight . "	-2.0655
Climate asked whether it should be on pay-per-view , part of a strategy that Lomachenko must fight with a 135-pound debut this year to agree a date with Garcia next summer ( 37-0 , 30 knockouts ) , which also has an interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight title in the forum on 23 September .	-4.3606
" This battle could take place in pay-per-view mode because all fans asked for him , " said Garcia and later openly expressed themselves fighting the network that offers the best financial package .	-3.9532
We are the best .	-0.6338
No other name can cause this kind of attention .	-2.7167
Whenever they are ready ... '	-1.0668
Garcia said he appreciated Lomachenko as " an enormous fighter " , and he might participate in his Saturday struggle .	-3.3155
But Lomachenko stayed with the generous praise for Garcia and said that he thinked the triangle champion from Riverside look " very slow , sorry Mikey ... you wanted the co-out " .	-4.4571
Garcia said that the focus is to show strength , then boxes .	-2.2723
Both said they could feel the momentum that built up for their own struggle .	-2.7533
" This is the struggle that must be carried out .	-2.5831
No other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm . to . to the . , to to the . to to the . , to the of to the .	-15.9397
I am more than happy to work on it , " said Garcia .	-1.7581
Lomachenko said : " I waited for the top fighters , and that is Mikey .	-2.2415

Fortuna ’ s Hoffmann : ' Tripartite works better '	-10.9753
After 2 : 2 , Andre Hoffmann hopes to start the season against Braunschweig that the optimization of the defense formation will bring points to Aue .	-4.8992
Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the first season game , with the result also , if the two countergates had not been against Braunschweig at 2 : 2 .	-5.4392
" These were two countergates too much , and we need to be even better careful in Aue , " says Fortuna Düsseldorf 's defensive player .	-4.4831
In the Ore Mountains the triangle should be further optimized .	-3.5876
And the fortunes no longer want to catch a gate after a free trip .	-5.0107
" For the future , it will be the case that nobody is putting on line next to Michael ( Rensing ) . "	-5.4266
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better able to cope with the triangle even after the experience in preparation than with the four-chain .	-4.6061
" I do not yet know how we will act in Aue , " says his coach Friedhelm Funkel , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , " because we have players in the triangle on the half positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gie<unk>elmann , " said Hoffmann .	-5.2018
" The prerequisite is that we harmonise even better and that we do not afford so many playback errors in building up . "	-5.7359
Of course , Hoffmann also drives to each other to win the game .	-12.8518
" But whether you can speak of a failed start after a draw does not know . a . a . to to the . to to the . to to	-13.7426
The performance could well be okay , " said Hoffmann .	-2.6393
" But if we can score four points on Sunday and focus on the trophy , we will certainly be able to talk about a proper seasonal start . "	-5.0149
His coach didn 't want to know anything about . to . to a . to to the . to to the	-11.5371
" I judge the start of the season only after six to eight game days , " said Friedhelm Funkel , who does not want to speak of an advantage over eye , just because the game of the Saxons in Heidenheim had to be broken off prematurely because of a storm .	-5.3499
" Now they can start the season almost with a home game , " said Funkel and Hoffmann believed that the players from Aue might even be a little fresher , because they would not have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against an ascent favorite in the bones .	-5.6058
" But they don 't know 100 % where they are currently , " says Fortuna 's domestic defender .	-3.7316
Although guests from the Rhineland go to the meeting on Sunday in the final ( almost ) finished stadium of Aue .	-4.6464
" That we sweep them away simply because we are entitled to come under the first six is bloodshed , " says Funkel , whose balance sheet is quite positive in the event of a defeat against Aue from nine games .	-5.7099
" There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga that you have to beat from the outset , " explains Fortunas Chefcoach .	-4.2157
" To make such a statement would be arrogant and superior " .	-3.3401
And so Funkel doesn 't want to experience his players on Sunday .	-3.1924
New results of the Swedish Asylum Assessment Test	-2.7247
The recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , which have been subjected to a new method of medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 % of people tested are older than 18 years , but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results . to the of from to the .	-18.9192
The Swedish Forensic Medicine Authority ( Rättsmedicinalverket ) has begun carrying out the tests last year .	-3.0155
They are supposed to make the assessment of age more precise during the asylum procedure , after the Swedish migration authority ( migration network ) has been criticised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were under age .	-25.2264
To date , migration sales sent 6,880 cases to test and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31 July 2017 .	-3.9588
Eighty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the person was " possibly 18 years or older " .	-3.0260
In 432 cases , the conclusion was that the person " may be under 18 years old " .	-2.5798
The tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is called into question .	-13.7656
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency , the results have been consistent in recent months .	-2.6487
" We see no great difference in the statistics of recent months , the figures are quite constant , " he said the magazine The Local .	-2.8529
The high proportion of cases in which the person was judged over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has lied over his age .	-3.2297
In May , the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases that " suggest that the person investigated was 18 years or older " .	-3.6105
When the Svenska Dagbladet newspaper examined the 581 results published , she found that in 243 of these cases , the person had frankly said that she would be 18 years old this year .	-24.2648
The method of medical age assessment , in which X-ray recordings of wisdom teeth and MRT recordings of knee joints are made , then analysed by dentists and radiologists , has also been criticised in some areas .	-20.4195
One skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute , whose work involves assessing the biological maturity of people to see whether they went sooner or later than usually through puberty .	-3.8738
" I had reason to think about it , and I do not believe that the type of measurement should be used .	-2.6654
Judging biological age in this way is very uncertain .	-2.2145
If we cannot say it safely , we should not pretend that we could , " he said the newspaper Metro .	-3.3821
However , Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests : " In general , you can say that the risk of assessing a child as an adult is low .	-3.2086
The biggest risk is if the person is less than 18 , in this case this is about 10 % . '	-4.3917

The work on the three bridges of Landstra<unk>e 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well .	-2.6292
On Wednesday a seven tonnes of heavy concrete part was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach .	-2.8478
" We are very good at the time , it is running super , " says Reinhold Leicht , construction manager at the Road and Transport department at the Freiburg Government Bureau .	-5.1244
In April the works began at the same time on all three bridges in need of renovation between Schramberg and Lauterbach .	-3.3013
The construction is scheduled for October and easy to keep to the timetable .	-3.5695
The first bridge , coming from Schramberg , leads through the Trombach .	-9.5225
It is a vaulted arch bridge made of concrete , covered with red sandstone and has a total length of 4.80 meters .	-3.9678
It was built in 1900 .	-1.3195
Like the other two bridges , it has now entered the years .	-17.3509
In order to ensure stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly refurbished .	-3.7123
The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach .	-2.3206
They are made of red stone .	-2.6938
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve , or 10.60 meters long .	-2.7426
The bridge at the entrance to the village of Lauterbach has now received a 1.30 metre wide and seven tonnes of heavy bridge cap on Wednesday morning .	-4.3559
This is a border attachment which is also used as a business route .	-13.3640
On the southern part of the bridge a 2.20 metre bridge cap is to be used on Friday .	-3.4606
That is what the pedestrian trail is about .	-3.7618
The particular thing is that these are finished parts , a patent of the Schramberg company Dizwo .	-3.6141
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps .	-2.1686
Particular sense of finger has required the laying of lines by the construction in Lauterbach .	-4.3395
There is also a glass fibre cable that many companies are connected to .	-3.9376
The residents were informed about the project in the run-up to the work .	-3.8222
In addition , fish and crabs had to be fished .	-3.2150
For the bridges between the building house and the collection wine towards Schramberg , traffic is regulated by a traffic light .	-4.6638
For construction work at the bridge at the entrance to Lauterbach , the street is fully locked in the area of the bridge at the altitude of hotels " Tannenhof " and " Seven Linden " .	-4.6796
The cost of the three bridge renovations is EUR 700 000 together .	-2.5243
The country finances the whole thing .	-11.9055
AfD in Gerolstein : Colombian protest at German potato salad	-3.5254
It does not happen so often that parties pull together , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( AfD ) , it is hard to reconcile otherwise .	-4.3185
The parties represented in the Kreistag Volkaneifel ( CDU , SPD , Green , FDP , FWG , Left ) belong to a broad alliance that this day shows peaceful flag , because the AfD invites the poster " Great Campaign Stop " in the Gerolstein Stadthalle Rondell .	-5.4726
And known names bring to the start - like Alice Weidel , who together with Alexander Gauland is the top duo for the federal election on September 24 , and the deputy chairman Beatrix von Storch .	-4.6279
But those who are already on site hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the AfD-learners , but to demonstrate .	-4.0681
The motto " The Eifel remains colourful " .	-1.8744
Originally , the city picnic was planned under the motto " All at a table " on the Wellness Square , but now takes place in the parking lot below the Rondell - directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the city hall .	-5.7692
A colourful picture that can be seen here .	-3.4032
And what Christa Karoli , Chairman of the Forums A World and one of the leading organizers , really is delighted : " Good how many people have met here " .	-4.9403
There are music and lots of food , including a " German potato salad , which the AfD could eat easily " , says the woman who brought him with him .	-4.2121
The police have ordered many officials to Gerolstein , showing presence in particular at the railway station , which is only a few metres away from the venues .	-5.1446
How did the AfD actually come to Gerolstein ?	-2.0295
Mario Hompes reported about the AfD volcanic eifel that he tried to make such an event and received the supplement .	-5.0507
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf initially asked in Daun , but received a cancellation because there were not enough parking spaces due to the already built Laurentiuskirmes .	-6.0959
Now the Rondell , Hompes is pleased that " we can have such a nice event here " .	-3.8622
With a view to the event on the Rondellvorplatz , he says : ' That is the good right of people , the main thing , it remains peaceful ' .	-4.5607
This is also true : at around 8 p.m. on the Rondellvorplatz a band provides entertainment , in the Stadthalle various speakers , including the Rhineland-Pfälzische AfD chairman Uwe Junge .	-5.6444
In the Chamber there are about 200 listeners waiting for the top candidate for the federal election , Alice Weidel , and the deputy chairman Beatrix von Storch to speak .	-4.7128
The police presence is unchanged , but so far the officials had a quiet evening .	-2.6580
The AfD event takes a little more than an hour , the guests on the front pitch have a longer breath , but also there is something to clean up shortly after 21 a.m.	-6.5050
The police can bridge - no special events .	-2.6020
The Trumpet Meets	-10.6353

So Johann Sebastian Bach combines with Bulgarian folklore and the piece " Exchange Suite " of the jazz winner Nils Wogram , classic , jazz and free games into a fascinating piece of art .	-6.2735
This core of the programme was only performed this spring with enormous success in Fribourg .	-3.8348

Prime Minister Weil Wants Rapid New Election	-2.4737
CDU and FDP Before possible majority in Lower Sax	-2.3334
Lower Saxony ’ s Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) is in favour of a rapid re-election of the country ’ s day after the loss of the red-green majority , but he does not want to resign .	-3.6185
Because on Friday , Parliament was in favour of dissolving .	-3.3652
Previously , the surprising withdrawal of a Green MEP from their Lower Saxony group plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .	-4.0460
Five months before the official election date , the red-green coalition in Hanover lost its scarce one-vote majority in Parliament to the opposition from CDU and FDP .	-3.3889
Previous Green MEP Elke Twesten justified her step by non-nominating the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg ( Wümme ) .	-14.5775
" I see my political future in the CDU " , she explained on Friday in Hannover .	-12.5020
CDU leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend that his group accept them .	-3.1032
Thus , CDU and FDP together would have 69 seats in Lower Saxony , SPD and Green 68 seats .	-3.9036
So far , the relationship has been reversed .	-2.8579
The new country day will be elected regularly on 14 January next year .	-2.4580
Thümler said that the red-green government must now decide whether it can continue to govern without a majority in this situation .	-3.6784
However , Stephan Weil considers it essential that land day decides on its self-resolution as quickly as possible .	-4.1885
The CDU Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .	-2.6980
The country ’ s constitution also provides for the possibility that the country ’ s day will withdraw the Prime Minister ’ s confidence and elect a successor .	-4.6868
" Our Constitution offers several options .	-1.3747
Thümler said that these possibilities must be clearly examined in legal terms .	-4.8550
'You will discuss all questions in peace if they are legally reasonable ' .	-5.2487
Thümler called Twesten 's step " but somewhat curious " .	-2.8645
The politician herself stressed : " I am not a traitor .	-2.3738
I feel very good " .	-1.3910
She called herself a supporter of black green .	-2.4384
The Greens called on the breakaway Members to return their country 's mandate .	-2.8101
" We assume , of course , that she will return her country 's mandate , which she has received via the green country list , with immediate effect , " said Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner .	-4.9728
The Green Chairman Anja Piel said : ' We regret the decision of Elke Twesten extremely ' .	-3.5669
She has deliberately chosen not to have a debate in the group .	-2.7548
" Even in the light of the fact that there were no differences in content , we cannot understand this step . "	-3.9320
SPD candidate for Chancellor Martin Schulz condemns the transfer of Lower Saxon Green MEPs Elke Twesten to the CDU as a betrayal .	-2.9889
" The behaviour of the former Green MEPs in Lower Saxony is not only betrayal of the electorate , but also betrayal of red green , " wrote Federal Head of Social Democrats on Friday on Facebook .	-3.7743
He supports Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) ’ s decision to re-elect the country ’ s day quickly .	-13.1994
The Twestens exit costs the majority in Lower Saxony .	-3.2799
The politician place " in her injured vanity and in her frustration her personal interests before the well-being of the country " , SPD Secretary-General Hubertus Heil criticized .	-4.1119
" It is a scandal that the CDU is participating in this dirty intrigue game in Lower Saxony and is trying to make political capital from it " .	-12.5172
Lower Saxony ’ s CDU leader , Björn Thümler , wants to recommend to his Members to include Elke Twesten in the CDU .	-3.4476
The leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Oppermann , accused Twesten of distorting the outcome of the 2013 election with personal career thinking .	-3.6866
The CDU was then the strongest force before the SPD , but the SPD and the Green had a very thin majority of one voice in the country 's day .	-5.1118
Agriculture Minister in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from toxic iron , Mr Schmidt ?	-2.7157
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs .	-1.2964
How could the scandal happen ?	-1.0833
How can consumers protect themselves .	-1.0246
Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt ( CSU ) is in the interview with the editorial network Germany ( RND ) .	-3.0969
Mr Schmidt , how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs ?	-1.7650
I can only encourage all consumers to look closely at the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp pressure .	-3.0097
On the consumer protection portal www.Lebensmittelwarnung.de , the Federal Republic of Germany will update the latest information on the egg charges concerned .	-5.6080
Eggs affected should be destroyed or returned .	-1.9276
Even if , after all that we know at the moment , a health risk is virtually excluded .	-4.0886
Does Aldi now take the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of offer - because the central role of the enlightenment is not really perceived by the Federal Agriculture Minister ?	-4.5865
Food surveillance is the task of the federal states .	-2.4993
Nevertheless , my House has acted immediately and has been in close exchange with the authorities of the countries since it became known that Germany is affected .	-5.3857
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers .	-2.0216
Trade , like manufacturers , must ensure that the products sold are transportable and safe for health .	-3.6492
If the maximum residue level for eggs exceeds 0.005mg / kg , these are not traffic .	-4.0238
However , uncharged eggs can be sold and consumed .	-13.1989
This time , businesses are not to blame .	-2.3033
Are production companies and consumers sitting on the same boat ?	-2.8777
According to the current state of knowledge , production companies are not directly to blame .	-3.6422
Instead , they have to expect economic damage because of alleged illegal practices by service companies .	-3.7229
As always , there are too few controllers in seriousness .	-2.7869
Does it only lack staff or coherent competence ?	-3.3768
It was precisely the official controls that revealed the process .	-2.8967
However , the truth is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded 100 % .	-2.4960
It is precisely for this reason that consistent clarification of such events and handing over to public prosecutors in cases where crimes may occur are crucial .	-5.1861
I have already made it clear on several occasions that I expect the responsible authorities to be fully informed .	-3.2218
Is the regular alarmism of food scandals really necessary ?	-2.3798
Consumers have the right to obtain exclusively safe and transport f.	-14.8494
If unauthorised insecticide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly outraged .	-2.7231
Thanks to the adjusted means , manufacturers , traders and consumers have entered a situation that is absolutely unnecessary .	-5.1064
In principle , it must be clear that the illegal use of insecticide Fipronil in the attitude of food supplying animals is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately .	-4.0538
This must be done consistently and with high pressure at all levels .	-3.1482
I expect all the competent authorities to be informed quickly and completely .	-3.5682
How the Financial Rules of Football affect Neymar ’ s Move to Paris	-2.6101
The rules aimed at preventing unhindered European football clubs ’ expenditure will not disturb Neymar ’ s world record transfer from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain .	-3.2160
Any consequences will come from UEFA for Paris Saint-Germain , because the leading organization that monitors the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .	-3.5443
Financial fair play rules launched by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG must eventually demonstrate that the transfer of Neymar was funded without major losses .	-3.6821
Barcelona has paid EUR 222 million ( $ 262 million ) to purchase the Brazilian out of its contract , and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several $ 10 million perperper . from the to the of in .	-11.5317
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar ’ s move to France .	-1.6866
PSG can certainly relax the money so that Neymar signs and puts it into a galaxy of other stars , given the financing of the team through the energy-rich family of rulers of Qatar .	-4.0440
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on acquiring players , but must control them with legitimate sources of revenue that allow them the Break-Even point in their football business .	-5.3562
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA president in 2007 .	-1.6509
Former French player believed that clubs that had taken huge debt to success effectively cheated and risked ruining when banks or owners withdrew their support .	-3.7741
In 2011 , FFP shifted from focusing on club debt to monitoring its losses .	-1.8573
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested strongly to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a tougher matter .	-3.4038
During the current three-year FFP disposition period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million .	-3.3281
And , while Platini has fallen into disgrace from the presidency in 2015 , his UEFA successor , Aleksander Ceferin , continues to deter excessive spending .	-3.8027
" Certainly FFP is not dead and we will certainly strengthen the rules for the future , " said Andrea Traverso , who is responsible for FFP at UEFA , to The Associated Press last week .	-3.1358
Although the PSG has paid the Neymar buy-out clause in a flat rate , it can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of its contract .	-3.4334
Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the replacement amount for the next five years can be expelled of EUR 44.4 million in the annual accounts .	-4.3228
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has hit the PSG together with Abu Dhabi , owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions .	-2.7518
The PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million ( then $ 82 million ) , which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and it was ordered that the team members for the 2014 / 15 Champions League will remain limited to 21 players instead of the other normal 25 players .	-4.6558
UEFA is searching for clubs that might try to overwhelm their financial supervision by blowing their revenues through companies associated with club owners .	-5.0007
While a Catarian company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsoring were to exceed the standard market rates , UEFA would not be considered a legitimate income .	-3.7334
This happened in 2014 , when UEFA decided that the value of PSA sponsorship was bloated by Qatar Tourism Authority .	-2.7535
It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come to Qatar on payments by the World Cup 2022 organizing committee .	-3.5512
But PSG and Qatar 2022 disputed that Neymar will become a World Cup ambassador and that such a manoeuvre could be easily identified for UEFA regulators .	-3.4913
Previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules .	-2.8727
UEFA had no preparatory discussions with PSG on Neymar 's transfer , said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .	-2.9979
They spoke with The Associated Press under the condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation .	-15.1980
The latest reports show that PSG has earned more than EUR 10 million in 2015 / 16 with sales of EUR 542.4 million .	-3.5205
The accounts for the last financial year still need to be published .	-2.3507
PSG expects Neymar ’ s arrival to be a blessing for sponsoring deals , merchandising , and jersey sales .	-2.4213
The association expects sales to increase by at least 30 percent after signing .	-3.0320
The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players go , and she tried to prevent Neymar ’ s move by claiming that PSG would infringe the FFP .	-12.2373
" It is a clear case of " financial doping " with the club and the state , " said the President of the La Liga , Javier Tebas , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar 's ultimate ownership of PSG .	-2.7423
Arsenal Manager Arsene Wenger , whose association is owned by an American sports tycoon , shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that finances an association .	-3.0702
" It is the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football over the last 15 years , " said Wenger on Thursday .	-2.8434
" Once a country has a club , everything is possible .	-2.2200
It will be very difficult to respect the financial fair play because you can go different ways or have different interests if a country has such a big player to represent a country . '	-3.7528
Swiss Looks for a New Schogging Supplier	-2.5909
In recent years , Chocolat Frey has produced chocolate for the Swiss .	-2.9641
Now the sweet cooperation is coming to an end : the airline rewrites the order .	-3.8503
Swiss spokesman Meike Fuhlrott confirmed on request of the news agency sda a corresponding report of the newspaper " Northwest Switzerland " on Friday .	-10.5428
According to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .	-2.2958
The products would be checked every two to three years and subject to quality control .	-2.5652
" We are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolat Frey , " said the speaker .	-2.1219
About 17 million small red white packed choggitables distribute 14 grams per year to passengers before landing .	-4.6455
The Swiss did not want to provide information about the costs .	-3.2514
Industry insiders estimate the order volume according to " Northwest Switzerland " at 1.5 to 2 million francs - the Migros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around one billion francs .	-4.1018
But more important is the advertising effect : it is a prestigious job for a choggia manufacturer .	-3.7557
Swiss does not want to betray how many applicants there are in the new tender .	-4.2557
But only Swiss manufacturers are in question .	-2.6138
According to the newspaper report , Chocolat Frey will seek to renew the Treaty beyond spring 2018 .	-2.8922
For the sda , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion .	-2.6262
Swiss has been distributing chocolate panels on board their flights since 2006 .	-2.6880

Nostalgia goes into the niche " Wet Hot American Summer " and " Comrade Detective "	-2.8864
This repetition of history is nostalgic simultaneously because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80s , for the 90-year Grunge-era ( when the foremost thinkers David Wain and Michael Showalter rotated the Sketch comedy " The State " for MTV ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , such as Elizabeth Banks , Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd , went to greater things .	-4.8759
As a cultural artifact , it is equally a parody and an embodiment of our facebook-capable era of permanent memories .	-2.4026
But as a franchise it feels like time is running out .	-2.8635
" First Day of Camp " worked surprisingly well , not only because of its absurd humor ( it contained an original story for a speaking dose of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .	-3.0337
By sticking to the core of the gag - middle-age actors play horny children who will grow up - they nevertheless created the impossibility of winning the last part of the joke back .	-4.5219
" Ten Years Later " , with his adults now playing adults , is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more according to the casting principle , including a reference to the stalker films of the 90s such as " The Hand That Rocks the Cradle " ( " The Hand that swings the cradle " ) .	-5.1231
At one point , a character browses through an Apple powerbook , some inline skates and " a number of other things from 1991 " .	-3.1169
Many of the central stories are the same .	-1.0514
The lovely coop ( Mr. Showalter ) , now novelist , has still not forgotten Katie ( Marguerite Moreau ) .	-3.3302
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost his virginity .	-1.5250
And there is another crazy malicious plot involved in Ronald Reagan ( also Mr. Showalter ) , now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good impression of Michael Ian Black ) .	-3.8311
As always , excursions are the best part of the franchise .	-1.4836
It is especially fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd , who shows Matt Dillon 's lower lip beard of " Singles " , whose former Big Man-on camp Andy now feels like an old cracker .	-9.8357
It is the moments of random madness that could fuel this franchise like a kind of repeating " Seven Up ! " series until he achieves what I accept as his logical conclusion : " Wet Hot American Summer : Twenty Years Later " , whose last scene will show the gang how she will visit the film premiere of " Wet Hot American Summer " .	-4.3295
" Comrade Detective " on Amazon is now reminiscent of another kind of nostalgia : the revival of the Cold War of " The Americans " , the film " Atomic Blonde " and even " GLOW " with its east-to-west ring-combat iconography .	-7.4036
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as director indicates to be a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two policemen as friends , two officers from Bucharest who are fighting for truth , atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism .	-3.8956
The main roles - a hard-sotted gregor and an idealistic iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici , whose dialogues are synchronized by Channing Tatum ( also an executive producer ) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English .	-3.1407
It is a brilliant idea .	-1.3555
But it is not much more than an idea .	-1.1530
There are some beautiful gags to stand ( the police spend time watching chess on television , as Americans might do with football ) .	-3.7111
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate , Nick Offerman , Mahershala Ali and Chlo<unk> Sevigny - ensures a decent game ' Find the Voice ' .	-2.9841
But " Comrade Detective " is so committed to the truth of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask - that it often plays like a single one .	-2.9182

Beating Drug Mafia in the Land	-2.2473
The police succeeded in blocking the Italian Mafia in Baden-Württemberg .	-2.4834
On Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest Baar Circle , in Rottweil , Konstanz , Esslingen and Stuttgart , as the Public Prosecutor Konstanz announced on Friday .	-3.8689
15 suspects aged between 25 and 77 were arrested and already issued arrest warrants against them .	-4.4366
Furthermore , officials secured larger quantities of marijuana and cocaine , firearms and several hundred thousand euros .	-2.6905
Two people were arrested at simultaneous races in Italy .	-2.4234
There were German arrest warrants against the two suspects of Italy .	-1.8180
The two are probably delivered to Germany .	-2.5352
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action .	-2.1793
In total , more than 300 police officers were in use .	-3.1111
Mafia members are accused of organised drug crime , serious violence , attempted murder , robbery and blackmail .	-2.9261
Since summer 2016 , the Public Prosecutor has been investigating Konstanz against organized drug trafficking in southern Germany .	-3.9183
Between the prosecutors in Konstanz and Palermo there was a great exchange and the investigators of the Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .	-3.7974

Big Gaps in the Foreign Register	-3.0805
" Data from citizens who should not appear there " : according to a report , the Foreign Register in Germany has significant shortcomings .	-4.2847
This leads to some serious mistakes in asylum procedures .	-3.1194
According to a media report , the Federal Government ’ s Refugee Management Officer , Frank-Jürgen , has drawn attention to large gaps in the foreign central register .	-3.8562
Defects in the data registered there may lead to " partially serious mistakes " in asylum procedures and deportations , warned in an analysis presented by the " Süddeutsche Zeitung " .	-5.1751
According to the register , ten million people with foreign nationality are covered , including around 5.7 million from non-EU countries in countries from to . to to the to the to their . to the to the	-16.2406
The data is therefore managed by about 600 foreign authorities in Germany .	-3.1661
Because the data had not been sufficiently maintained , the data quality has not been good in parts so far .	-4.3344
In individual cases , data had been found in 1921 , " of people who have long since stopped living , or of citizens who have become German citizens and should not actually appear in the register " .	-4.8268
" Faulty data input can significantly slow down return processes , " says the report .	-3.4335
Moreover , statistics on people who are subject to travel include EU citizens who would not have to leave .	-4.7794
Such incorrect allocations , however , led to a distorted debate on the handling of persons required to leave , " says the analysis .	-6.2204
Meanwhile , the Federal Government appears to have started sending refugee families back to Italy with children under the age of 16 when they arrived .	-4.1744
This emerges from an internal paper by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees ( BAMF ) , reports the " New Osnabrücker Newspaper " .	-3.3819
The paper says , therefore , that the BAMF has been carrying out such procedures ' with regard to families with children - with the exception of infants and microchildren - to Italy since 1 June 2017 ' .	-4.6260

" It is brilliant how our body is designed for this and we pay tribute to the donors who make their blood available to foreigners , even disinterested , " said Mayor Karlheinz Kistner .	-5.7433
" A single blood donation helps several people " , explained the DRK Director of the German Red Cross , Holger Maisenbacher , because the canned are dismantled into their components .	-5.2593
So three people could benefit from a donation of blood .	-12.8937
At the same time , Maisenbacher reported on the actions that will take place in Oberreichenbach in spring .	-3.2953

The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25 %	-1.3096
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and inflation slowdown speculation about rising .	-3.6398
The Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain " sad " when it maintained interest rates on family incomes in the midst of increasing pressure .	-3.1124
The Bank ’ s Monetary Committee ( MPC ) policymakers voted 6-2 to keep interest rates to 0.25 % , with fewer members seeking an increase this month , as weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase .	-3.9929
In its quarterly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts to 1.7 % in 2017 , and to 1.6 % in 2018 , warning that pressure on household incomes would continue , with inflation likely to rise to almost 3 % in the autumn .	-13.8592
But it signaled that interest rate hikes would be needed in the coming years to rein in Brexit fueled inflation , and it said that borrowing costs might have to rise more than expected in financial markets .	-4.2227
Members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth stimulus package issued a year after Brexit .	-2.3184
It will call for time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funding for banks from next February , although it has been said that it is now expected to provide GBP 15 billion more under this system - with GBP 115 billion .	-4.4530
Minutes after the decision on interest rates , the Bank said : ' In the MPC ’ s central forecast , gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak in the short term , as pressure on household real incomes continues to burden consumption . '	-3.5696
On interest rates , it repeated that ' a certain tightening of monetary policy ' would be needed to cool down inflation and a ' slightly bigger ' scale than markets expect .	-3.9019
Markets are currently predicting the first rise in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .	-2.1511
However , the Bank stressed that increases would be " gradually " and " limited " .	-2.8422
The Bank ’ s downward growth forecasts for this year and next year are compared to the 1.9 % and 1.7 % forecast in May .	-2.9310
It maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .	-1.9076
According to these news , the pound fell against the dollar and the euro .	-2.3481
The pound fell by 0.5 % to $ 1.31 and fell by 0.4 % to € 1.11 .	-1.8629
The decision will not be changed after the recent disappointing growth rates have reduced rising expectations for an increase in interest rates , and GDP has risen from 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % in the second quarter .	-4.9784
Growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , even though it will easily recover after the Bank by the end of the year .	-3.1152
The latest inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and slight wage increases , as the tightening becomes even worse before it will improve .	-4.7484
She added that monetary policy cannot ' prevent ' the decline in income in the next few years , but added that wages will ' clearly ' recover at the end of their three-year forecast .	-4.3499
The economy is also strengthened by rising demand for British goods , owing to the weak pound , which will compensate for some of the lower consumption spending .	-21.4695
The decision comes one year after the reduction of interest rates to 0.25 % last August following the shocking EU vote causing the pound to fall .	-3.0287
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years to fully achieve prices and the economy .	-2.3375
Before the Bank ’ s last judgment on interest rates , the call for an increase in interest rates had increased , as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households , with three policymakers demanding an increase to 0.5 % in July .	-3.8181
Inflation fell from 2.9 % last month in June to 2.6 % , despite the Bank saying that it was expected and will attract it again in the coming months .	-3.8554
The Bank said that the exceeding ratio to its 2 % target is ' entirely ' attributable to the weak pound .	-20.2080
Andrew Montlake , Director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers , said : " Given the recent decline in swap rates , the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again , as creditors are looking for shops vocally and want to end the year in a positive way .	-4.4673
The market looks particularly good for those who expire the existing deals and complete the new mortgages , and many with toll-free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . '	-3.7295
NHS ( The National Health Service ) is to prescribe controversial HIV drugs to 10,000 people	-2.2831
From September onwards , patients will be given access to " transformative " HIV prevention treatment following a struggle before the High Court against NHS funding .	-4.8796
NHS England announced that a pre-exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) taken prior to sexual intercourse , which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 % , is now supplied by the health service through a first three-year study for an estimated 10,000 people .	-4.5528
He agreed to finance the process after the Court of Appeals confirmed last year a Supreme Court ruling that the NHS had the power to pay for the PREP despite claiming that the local authorities should finance it .	-4.2035
The move announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England chief Simon Stevens as " important new intervention " , while the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) called this a " crucial moment " .	-3.7942
Sexual health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool , and Sheffield will be among the first to enable people to register , and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 .	-3.2660
Pre-exposure prophylaxis ( PREP ) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .	-15.2702
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in the event of infectious pers.	-14.1210
Taking PrEP before sexual intercourse means that there are just enough medicines in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .	-3.6706
Such medicines can be taken every day or two hours before sexual intercourse .	-2.6745
Those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men , transsexuals and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated .	-3.4804
In clinics , suitable participants are identified who agree to the study , including men , women , transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment .	-3.2871

The program will sign $ 10 million and NHS England a contract to deliver medicines this week after an international competitive procurement .	-3.1396
The study is intended to assess the entire potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence as targeted , recorded and implemented on a large scale .	-4.2641
Stevens said : " This great new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .	-2.3921
It is another milestone in the continued progress that has been made over three decades in tackling one of the greatest health challenges facing humanity . to the '	-20.8677
Deborah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National Aids Trust ) , said : " This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .	-2.0337
PrEP , if targeted at needy and vulnerable people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic .	-3.2606
From September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS financed attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and is not subject to negotiations with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives .	-11.1002
We warmly welcome this announcement . '	-1.5994
Ian Green , Chairman of the Executive Board of Terrence Higgins Trust , said : " The priority must now be to ensure that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk to HIV is left behind .	-3.7045
Now that PrEP test medicine has been procured , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people . '	-3.2301
Sharon Hodgson , Shadow Minister for Health , said : " The beginning of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and hesitant implementation by the government .	-15.6250
The evidence shows how transformatively this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection .	-3.0201
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP .	-2.0771
Now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country in order to protect people who are HIV infected , and that it will help us bring about a step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society ' .	-4.6206
Living Great Life : Intermediate floor and clever designer tricks have transformed this little Earl ’ s Court apartment into a generous home	-5.4587
Joanne Leigh , a former banker with a passion for real estate , reduced in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment .	-2.4554
It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags .	-3.0350
" Before that I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room , " says Joanne .	-2.3239
" I was looking for something comparable to my price .	-2.1066
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and she had the same high ceilings .	-2.2232
I fallen in love with her and made an offer on that day ' .	-2.9541
Since the first visit , the 1,000 square feet apartment has been completely overtaken .	-3.4240
Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to reach the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne storage space and an intermediate floor to make the best use of the spacious ceiling height .	-12.6847
" I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .	-1.6612
That was my requirement , " she says .	-2.1464
To this end , she commissioned the Duck & Shed architectural and design studio of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 foot high ceilings and to create a home that was not only a development but also a place for life for Joanne .	-4.0470
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms over each other , so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor in which one could stand .	-3.5391
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the target .	-2.3005
" The steel plant is quite complicated , " he explains .	-2.0539
" We had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked above each other without having to piece ourselves .	-4.7126
Not only was it about building a simple platform , but also creating the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function at the top or bottom . "	-4.7493
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms at full altitude - with much additional drama .	-3.7016
A classic copper light window from Retrouvius down the glamorous living area for the middle floor .	-3.8146
Mirrored gold furniture , silver accents and Vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program .	-2.3431
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .	-2.2934
At both ends a short corridor is mirrored to let him work longer .	-3.5138
In the kitchen the mirror feels like a window in to an.	-10.6644
At the entrance , mirrored units offer space for all cutlery and glasses of Joanne .	-3.0673
By perceiving a more glamorous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .	-3.0332
Foldable kitchens are nothing new .	-2.8629
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door .	-2.6646
" A bit of engineering went into it , " explains Erfan of the steel reinforced , veneered MDF door .	-3.3357
" It is counterweight , so when you push the door it slides very easily . "	-3.6672
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Joanne was able to win an additional 16 m <unk> , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .	-3.4344
" At the end of the day you will sell the base area - or how your property is valued , " says Erfan .	-2.7302
" In a rudimentary form , a real estate agent will occur and carry out a calculation based on the size of the ground . "	-17.7849
Here they managed to enlarge the floor surface while using high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage .	-4.3078
" The materials are the things you touch and which therefore help create an emotional binding in a home , " says Erfan .	-3.3521
" You don 't fall in love with the electric outlets in the walls .	-2.5975
These are important , but they do not play with your heart . '	-2.0529
It shows that an apartment can turn into something quite amazing by design and increased square meters of something standard .	-4.2894
Indeed , like Joanne , you could decide not to leave them .	-2.2369
Brothers Fight for a US $ 500 million Real Empire	-2.4251
Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty , worth more than $ 500 million in confrontation with one of Victoria ’ s largest real estate empires .	-4.0509
The former director of the ' Carlton Football Club ' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak , just three doors away from his younger brother Paul , who has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets are to be divided .	-4.0880
Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp debate on separation is taking place in the Supreme Court .	-3.5937
Together with her mother Anna , the brothers have 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , since the family bought a business at Smith Street , Collingwood in 1973 .	-12.5295
The Westco Jeans family founded there and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores .	-3.1480
It was sold in 1999 for $ 85 million .	-1.4088
This money has been invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the city center , the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centres in the suburb .	-3.8127
After an agreement with her deceased father , Colin - described by Paul as " the main operator and the dominant personality " in the De Lutis family - possesses about two-thirds of the assets and Paul about a third of the asset . of the of in of and in in the of of .	-17.0570
A legal act says that this means that Colin owns $ 316 million and Paul worth $ 176 million .	-3.2085
The distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .	-15.8996
" The divisions proposed by Colin left him with what I thought was the best objects , " he wrote in a first affidavit in 2015 .	-3.2922
Last Friday , after several failed conciliations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place .	-2.3979
The brothers are now fighting for control over the existing business , which Colin , as Paul claims , has excluded .	-3.7571
Colin argues that this is not true , but accuses Paul of incompetent management of some possessions .	-2.4378
In an early affidavit submitted by Colin , he says he hopes to resolve the dispute .	-2.6335
" My Italian heritage stipulates that the family is the most important priority , " he wrote .	-2.2858
The costs increase in the case , with hundreds of pages with affidavits , emails and reports of companies , including Deloitte , Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan Myers , QC , and law firms held by both sides .	-3.9380
Mrs De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicacies from the late 1950s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early 1970s .	-2.9904
They used the security to buy the Collingwood property in which Colin opened the first jeans shop of the family .	-3.2458
Colin says that he began Westco there when he " was the high school in my last years , when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . "	-11.2939
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass their property on to her sons in a fr. to the .	-13.4400
" Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to come to court , " she wrote .	-2.4675
Two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lutis Group , claiming that Mark was paid $ 10 million and Luke $ 26 million when he left the company .	-3.4546
Both Lukas and Mark were , Paul says , " the conditions of their financial separation have become bitter " .	-3.7170
Colin was very restrained , although he was a former member of the AFL Executive Board and , after a 2015 biography by Eddie McGuire , he was the best friend of the television star .	-11.5662
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers .	-1.5631
Only Colin replied by SMS to say " I really can not say much " because the case was in courts .	-3.7324
" It is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and draw our family name through the courts , " he wrote .	-2.4964
In mid-2016 , Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to meet his brother ’ s demands .	-2.9425
" Our father did not want Paul and I to end in our current dispute , " he said and added that he " still hoped for a solution " .	-2.9027
This hope seemed to have passed on Friday .	-2.4890
" Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future , " Colin wrote .	-2.2564
Trump ’ s new chief of staff plans to restrict the president ’ s media abstinence .	-2.3093
Others have tried and failed .	-1.3435
Perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it .	-2.5686
If so , it will be the first .	-1.2892
Politico reports that the new White House Chief of Staff is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Trump , including news media reports , in the hope of keeping the chief on a more even-handed course .	-3.6655
Here is a piece of Reporter Josh Dawsey :	-1.6692
" When John F. Kelly , the new White House Chief of Staff , met with senior employees on his first working day , he presented a major problem in President Donald Trump ’ s White House that he wanted to repair : bad information that falls into the president ’ s hands .	-4.3659
Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he were given good information . '	-3.9919
Kelly ’ s diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring its media diet .	-1.7767
President Trump ’ s relationship with television goes back decades – and now that he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong .	-2.5366
" If candidate Trump was annoyed by unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received a fair coverage of posts to be convinced , " said former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg to Politico in February .	-3.6986
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that ' the key to keeping Trump ’ s Twitter habit under control is , according to six former campaign officials , to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady price of praise . . ' to the of to the , to the of to the . to the to to the	-12.7524
Okay .	-0.4152
But the idea that Trump ’ s Twitter habit has ever been “ under control ” is ridiculous .	-1.7555
Perhaps these campaign officials know something we do not know others - that Trump ’ s tweets would have contained even more ignition without their interventions .	-3.0430
We will probably never know about the tweets that Trump did not send .	-2.5413
If his staff managed to keep trouble away from him several times , their efforts were worthwhile .	-4.1500
But no one has consistently prevented Trump from creating controversy .	-2.0224
Part of the problem is that people in a White House composed of competing parties are constantly trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views from the world .	-3.4695
Politico reported in May on the preference of advisers to provide dubious information to the President for strategic reasons .	-3.8737
This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher :	-1.4611
" Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can respond like a volcano to negative press cuts , especially those with damaging leaks , and that he is stiffening to find out where they come from .	-4.1151
That was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone maliciously accused the President of a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com , the website of the Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh of being " the source behind a cluster of leaks " in the White House . " " I to to " " " to " " " to " to to to " .	-12.6170
Although Johnson was permanently banished from Twitter because of harassment , or that he did not offer concrete evidence , or that in the past he made false accusations and revoked them .	-4.5598
Trump read the article and began to consult Walsh staff . "	-2.6317
Goldmaker added that then-chief of staff Reince Priebus and the White House Secretary-General , Rob Porter , have " tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper tram that Trump receives . "	-4.1809
How did this work ?	-1.6141
Kelly tried to do the same three months later .	-1.8473
Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective manager than a priebus , but Trump is still his impulsive self , and his advisers are still seeking influence .	-2.9752
These unchanging factors make Kelly ’ s mission very difficult .	-2.0775

They have brought horses , babies and an army of transporters after they were thrown out in May , but without having been deterred by a divide buried by the Council in order to prevent their incidents .	-5.5346
The tactful group found a gap in defense facilities and pressed their vehicles through a section that remained unhindered to find a way .	-4.0372
Angry inhabitants have afflicted the Solihull Council , who said that it is ' useless to deal with the problem ' .	-3.7534
An anonymous inhabitant said : " They moved there on Monday evening after they were sent by Bentley Heath , where they thrown stones on the passers-by .	-11.7984
The Council must be forced into action by shame to implement it , because it was useless when dealing with the problem .	-12.1101
The travellers were there in May , moved on and are now back again .	-3.1465
More arrived yesterday evening , probably today more . '	-2.1371
She added : " The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with this by keeping long instructions to protect its parks .	-3.1047
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I am not happy to continue to pay my municipal tax if the Council cannot even stop it . '	-15.5146
A resident who did not want to be named said : " It is ridiculous , we have just seen the last round of these travellers just to be plundered by another round .	-3.9833
The numbers have increased this time and even a horse has been seen in the parking area . "	-3.4798
One spokesperson from the Solihull Council said : " We are aware of an unauthorised camp in the country beyond the Streetsbrook Road and are working together with the police at Solihull , and we are taking the necessary legal steps to ensure that they continue as quickly as possible .	-5.1005
To support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible report anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101 .	-2.9507
This helps to create a picture of the situation in which the Court must examine when we present our case . '	-3.4180
From Birkenhof Waldhotel Luise	-1.3189
From the former Hotel Birkenhof becomes the Waldhotel Luise .	-12.9325
The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and will be reopened on 1 March next year .	-3.8459
That is good news for the city .	-1.6089
Because , with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014 , approximately 30 000 nights per year were lost and also revenue by the tourist tax .	-4.8403
In autumn 2014 , given the dramatically increasing numbers of refugees who came to the county , the hotel building was offered to the Landratsamt as a collection accommodation , which created controversial discudisdiscussion .	-16.0488
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by drawing up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .	-3.5365
The decision was not undisputed at that time in the municipal council .	-3.3352
But the mayor Julian Osswald , in particular , defended the hotel location and spoke of serious interested parties at the time .	-20.7853
He should be right .	-1.0999
The Group of Luisenhotels with Managing Director Birgit Scherer , based in Bad Bergzabern , has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to turn it into a house of the three-star plus category under the name of Waldhotel LuWW Waldagain to be in in . the in the of in in in of the from the of from the in the	-14.7394

You are called Hotel Luise , Luisenpark , Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise .	-1.9318
The former Hotel Birkenhof has been in front of the entrance for a long time , and when you enter the house , it is clear what extensive renovation work is being done .	-5.4073
The floors were removed , partly dismantled ceilings , old bathtubs removed from the rooms .	-3.7974
The entire hotel is a single construction site .	-10.4461
There is still much to be done by March .	-1.7431
" It 's actually a nice hotel , " says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper .	-2.5704
Everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style .	-2.6718
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers , the entrance area is redesigned , new windows are installed .	-16.9358
Everything should become " beautiful " later , as Thomas Scherer expresses .	-3.5680
" We want to make a piece of jewelry out of . "	-3.2453
Swimming pool , wellness area and meeting room are all equipped .	-3.3609
You don 't want to position yourself at the high level of hotels in Lauterbad , but already at a high level , Scherer emphasises .	-4.6471
The Waldhotel Luise , with its approximately 60 rooms , wants to spread out , explains Scherer .	-4.0768
Both individual holidaymakers , groups or businessmen should feel comfortable at home at the hotel .	-4.8411
He had talks with OB Julian Osswald and Tourism Director Michael Krause , according to Scherer .	-3.4550

When asked about the level of investment , Thomas Scherer does not want to determine exactly .	-4.2619
Nearly less than a million euros , he expects .	-3.5892
The exterior facilities are also brought to front , which is already clearly visible .	-4.3686
In an inner courtyard there is a large terrace that will be accessible from the restaurant , which is open to the public .	-3.7817
Thomas Scherer is optimistic : " Freudenstadt is a good market " .	-1.7360
Russia ’ s Special Investigators Grand Jury	-2.2915
In the Russian affair for US President Donald Trump , special investigator Robert Mueller is said to have set up a so-called Grand Jury after a report .	-3.4286
The body has started work in recent weeks , wrote the " Wall Street Journal " appealing to familiar people .	-4.8147
The newspaper valued the step as a sign that Mueller expanded and intensified his investigations .	-2.9267
The broadcaster CNN reported that there are already initial invitations from the body to a meeting between Trump ’ s oldest son and a Russian lawyer .	-3.6103
US intelligence services have long accused the Kremlin of interfering specifically in the 2016 presidential election campaign .	-2.7050
Mueller investigates whether there were agreements between Trump ’ s campaign team and Moscow .	-2.0853
The investigation focuses on several men who acted as Republican advisers in the election campaign .	-3.7522
According to reports , Mueller also looked at more and more Trump ’ s private and business environment .	-2.6360
A few weeks ago , the Washington Post wrote that the special investigator Trump personally put Trump at the centre and investigate the accusation of whether the president may have hindered the judiciary in the course of the affair .	-12.3119
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine the evidence available in potential crime cases and to decide whether to charge them to the .	-6.1875
Grand Jurys are therefore also called charges .	-3.0473
They are usually turned on when they are larger and controversial cases .	-3.4906
The procedure always takes place behind closed doors .	-2.1555
The body can also be activated by the Public Prosecutor 's Office to invite people to interrogate under oath .	-4.4871
According to the CNN broadcaster , charges have already been issued that revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer .	-4.2485
People involved in the meeting had been asked to make a statement , the report said .	-3.8375
They should also provide documents .	-1.2725
In addition to Trump Jr. , Trump ’ s consultant and son of silence , Jared Kushner , and his then campaign chief , Paul Manafort , were also involved in the talk . as in from to .	-15.2905
Legal experts said on US television on Thursday evening that the appointment shows that Mueller would not be intimidated in his work , and that he wants to act quickly if necessary .	-4.7347
However , it should not necessarily be said that the Grand Jury will be activated at the end to decide on charging .	-4.4990
Nevertheless , the establishment of the body of the beginning of a new phase in the investigations , and a new cause for concern for President Trump .	-23.7622
In the midst of the new revelations , the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to present the Russian affair as a campaign of his political opponents .	-2.7519
" Russia 's history is a total invention , " said Trump .	-1.7369
The issue gives the Democrats an opportunity to ' feel good because they have nothing else to talk about ' .	-3.1081
His special adviser , Ty Cobb , explained in a statement that he knows nothing about setting up a Grand Jury .	-3.5939
But this also usually works in secret , he emphasized .	-3.9514
The White House advocates any measures that accelerated the work of the special investigator in a ' fair ' way .	-3.0413
Former FBI chief James Comey said three times that he was not investigated against the president .	-3.1410
There is no reason to assume that something has changed , as the statement said .	-4.5336
But Mueller was only used after Trump fired Comey .	-2.5120
Because of this draft , accusations against Trump have become loud that he wanted to hinder justice .	-4.5943
Comey said before a Senate Committee in June that Trump asked him to stop investigating the then national security adviser , Michael Flynn .	-2.8886
The President is under great pressure because of the investigation .	-2.2724
According to the presentation of US media , the White House collected material against the special investigator and his staff .	-11.7214
The speculation triggered whether Trump wanted to dismiss Mueller .	-2.5900
Unlike an independent Congressional special investigator , such as the Watergate affair around the later resigned President Richard Nixon , Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired by the Ministry of Justice at the presidency ’ s pressure .	-16.0818
Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a move .	-2.8726
Two groups of Republican and Democratic senators presented draft legislation on Thursday , according to which the special investigator could no longer be released so easily .	-3.5822
Antarctica ’ s Giant Ice Mountains in Antarctica	-3.1732
In West Antarctica , a gigantic iceberg of Berlin ’ s almost seven times larger size has dissolved from the Schelfeis .	-5.4085
This was announced by the Bremerhaven Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Sea Research on Wednesday .	-2.6734
More than a trillion tonnes of heavy and 5800 square kilometres of coloss are now driving north and will probably take two or three years to melt .	-4.9353
With 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered over the past three decades .	-3.3812
He does not assume a risk to people .	-11.8437
The extent to which climate change has played a role in cutting the iceberg is unclear , according to researchers ' indications .	-3.7486
Overall , however , there has been a series of unusual collapses of ice shelves in the region for about 30 years , writing the US Research Centre for Snow and Ice ( NSIDC ) in a fact background .	-4.0090
Many researchers believe that this could be linked to global warming .	-2.4681
The coloss that has now broken off has been part of the Larsen C shelf ceremony to date the of . to the of to the . the to to	-14.7698
Schelfeis swims on the sea and is fed by large glaciers .	-2.2905
It thus continues to grow into the sea and regularly breaks down .	-4.1393
The Larsen C Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula .	-3.2619
North of this celebration , the balance of growth and cancellation was disrupted a few years ago .	-3.9353
A complete shelf ice was disintegrated there , writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen .	-3.7743
There is a lot to say that Larsen C shelf ice is also in danger , because the front edge has never withdrawn as far as it is today .	-5.4705
Moreover , the ice plate is under tension and can disintegrate if a piece is broken off at a key point . to to the . to to to the to . to to to the to	-15.4042
The melting of shelf ice and iceberg does not increase sea level because it swimming on the water and displacing ice as much water as it does after melting itself .	-5.2897
However , the loss of the shelf ice causes the glaciers to flow directly into the sea and to flow much faster than before .	-4.9532
This might increase the sea level , but only to a small extent , writes the British research project to monitor the Antarctic ( Midas ) .	-4.3812
The Larsen C Schelfeis is the fourth largest shelf ice in Antarctica , according to AWI data with almost 50 000 square kilometres .	-4.7221
At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , on the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters .	-3.6752
It is breaking off regularly there .	-4.5216
" Although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change , the ice shield is now in a more vulnerable position , " said Martin O 'Leary of the British Swansea University .	-4.0949
" This is the widest withdrawal since the records began , " he also confirmed .	-3.2516
Among scientists , there is controversy as to whether the Larsen C shelf ice will grow again or decline in the long term and possibly collapse , his colleague Adrian Luckman said , and added : ' Our models say that it will be less stable ' .	-5.5833
But this will take decades .	-10.5807
Although these researchers did not attribute the breakdown of this giant iceberg to climate change , in recent decades there have been a great deal of ice shelves in the Antarctic Peninsula .	-6.0022
This long tip of Antarctica stretches towards South America .	-2.7080
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey research programme , the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950 ’ s .	-14.2470
The temperature rise has contributed to the decline .	-2.3689
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed around three degrees over the past 50 years , making it one of the areas where temperature rises fastest .	-3.5252
CDU wants home rates for staff	-3.8573
Because it is becoming increasingly difficult to occupy vacancies , the CDU calls for the employers ' association to leave in order to become more attractive .	-4.2877
Only shortly before the summer break , the circle won 41 new posts in the administration .	-4.6727
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann .	-2.5395
Now , 17 apprentices again have their first working day behind themselves .	-4.2418
The courses at the circle are obviously very sought-after .	-3.9429
Around 620 applications were recorded for the places to be awarded this year .	-3.4316
Nevertheless , the circle still lacks staff to meet the increased requirements and tasks .	-14.0353
Currently there are still 50 unoccupied jobs in the Mettmann district .	-16.6749
Among other things , doctors and engineers are being sought as well as powers of general administration .	-4.5333
The CDU , together with the FDP and the UWG , now wants to take the initiative and counter the shortage of skilled workers in the administration . to the of in in of . to to the in to the .	-18.1730
The administration shall develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development according to the wishes of the parties .	-4.7375
The aim is not only to meet short-term requirements for skilled workers , but to counteract the shortage of applicants in the future .	-4.9557
The overall concept should be internally and externally oriented , identify concrete measures for beginners and include a training offensive , demand CDU , FDP and UWG .	-4.3642
This sounds like a good approach .	-1.8099
Because the circle deals with personnel problems that were not known in the past .	-4.4300
Other cities promote good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .	-2.1555
There is talk of a real ' competition of public employers ' .	-3.1456
In addition , a large number of employees who leave the service due to illness or age .	-4.3580
So it is high time to act so that more jobs are not left unfilled .	-4.7434
But Klaus-Dieter Völker , CDU leader , goes beyond the joint request with his party .	-3.0377
He recently caused a fist-thick surprise in the circle when he publicly questioned the cover of personnel and stunned the rest of the parties .	-5.5369
People want to see every opportunity to leave the municipal employers ' association .	-3.8088
" If we do not reach a satisfactory solution in the short term , the circle administration with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with circle cities - should seek a home tariff , " says peoples .	-5.5224
In doing so , the CDU is trying to pay the employees and officials better than it actually provides for the public service tariff forum .	-4.7688
The salaries are currently exactly required , increases or more money are only available if you change to a higher level , which is oriented towards professional years .	-5.7093
But the tasks of the circle have increased in recent years .	-2.6459
Just a few weeks ago , new spaces had to be set up in which employees look after the provisions of the new prostitute law .	-4.5954
Not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers , Landrat Thomas Hendele and Director Martin Richter have a problem : they have too few staff .	-3.6513
Italy ’ s Migrant Rescue Boats	-3.2963
Italy has warned NGOs who use rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they cannot continue this unless they comply with new rules for their operations .	-3.5323
" If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue to work , " said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa .	-3.1129
Minniti ’ s warning came a day after the Italian authorities seized a boat from the German aid organisation ' Youth Rescue ' because their team had effectively cooperated with human traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration .	-4.0836
The aid organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to comment on detailed accusations by the Italian Public Prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio .	-3.9917
" For us , saving human life remains our top priority , so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , " said the organization in a statement on the social media .	-4.0992
'We can judge all the accusations currently being made only after we have collected all the information and can assess the situation . '	-4.2979
The Italian authorities had monitored the boat of ' Youth Rescue ' , the Iuventa , since October .	-2.5690
It is suspected that his crew is taking hose boat migrants on board who are delivered directly to them by human traffickers , and that smugglers can leave to allow ships to be used again .	-5.8959
At least such a meeting was supposed to take place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the Act of the Public Prosecutor , whose content was published by the Italian media . to the of from the of from to .	-15.4301
The occupation is suspected of overlooking the authority of the Italian coastguard , the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other motives .	-3.0744
Under the Code of Conduct , boats such as Iuventa must , above all , have an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities .	-3.1999
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to adhere to the code : Save the Children , MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain .	-2.8377
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable , because they would not bring about any ' major changes or disabilities ' of their rescue operations .	-3.9980
Among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel laureate organization is doctors without borders ( MSF ) .	-2.6127
Minniti has meanwhile said that the number of migrants arriving after the rescue measures in Italy has fallen sharply in recent weeks , suggesting that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and cooperation with the local mayors have beared fruit .	-4.2780
" In recent days we have started to see light at the end of the tunnel , " said the minister .	-2.4115
He announced plans for further discussions with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants that these countries leave in the hope of reaching Europe .	-3.4733
Growth and Trials	-1.4531
Nine Weilermer Bikers , the " Berlin Outdoor Posts " and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the North Palace to enjoy trials and sights for four days .	-4.1551
Three friendly guides were available for this pur.	-2.5658
The accommodation in the Wachenheimer Valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .	-2.9770
The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra .	-1.9004
The first tour led to the Michael Chapel above Deidesheim at hot summer temperatures .	-2.3241
It was followed by viewpoints , partly on towers from which one could look far above the Palatinate Forest and the upper plains .	-12.3252
In between , there have been longer and longer increases , for which long trials rewarded .	-4.3019
The second day went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and the Volksfest Wurstmarkt .	-2.9035
Once again , the viewpoint was linked with " flowing " trials and moderate rises .	-5.0597
On the last two days , many metres of altitude were required again .	-12.5211
Caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and refuges brought welcome breaks .	-2.0542

The fact is that e-sport has long become a serious industry , a lucrative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gags included .	-3.6711
This is also recognized by the first federal league associations that are increasingly engaged in this area .	-4.3918

What exactly is this about ?	-1.9441
In e-sport , computer games such as " League Of Legends " , " Dota 2 " , " Counterstrike " or the FIFA football simulation are fought at competitive level .	-4.2963
Leagues have long established themselves , as in normal sport , where professionals compete against each other .	-4.0529
And in the 2022 Asian Games , e-sport is already part of the official program .	-2.8577
But is it a real sport ?	-2.6060
For many , the idea certainly needs to be accustome.	-3.3392
Ingo Froböse , too , has long discussed the issue .	-18.4392
For the professor at the German Sports College in Cologne , e-sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in classical sports - for example , increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormonal changes .	-4.2232
It also needs cognitive skills , a technical and tactical understanding and a rapid response capability .	-3.3740
Professional gamers should train not only on the console , but also their bodies and pay attention to diet .	-3.3983
" The fit player is a good player . "	-1.6014
However , it also sees problems : " Doping is becoming more and more a topic " .	-4.7964

Michelle Carter condemns Conrad Roy for suicide	-1.9272
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her friend through texts and calls to suicide .	-2.6497
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her condemnation behind bars and five years have been subjected to pro.	-3.0048
Carter was sentenced in June for negligent killing of Conrad Roy , who took his life on 13 July 2014 .	-2.7655
The father of Roy said at the hearing on Thursday : " My family is uncomfortable .	-2.5408
My son was my best friend . '	-0.9778
Carter was allowed to remain free until the appeal .	-2.5156
She had been faced with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from mental illness .	-3.7909
Dressed in red trousers and a cream coloured blouse , Carter stood in the eyes with tears , with folded hands and downward eyes when condemned .	-4.3546
" Your actions have killed Conrad Roy , " said the prosecutor to the court .	-2.4970
" She ended his life to make her own better .	-2.0346

" She has shown no repentance " .	-2.8115

" No longer have this only person with whom I have been together every day since my birth is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , " she said .	-3.7500
The case seems to set a legal precedent because there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to call on another to commit suicide .	-2.8123
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in 2014 by carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle .	-2.4167
The case attracted national attention after Carter ’ s text revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life .	-2.9809
" Hung up , jumping from a building , fire yourself , I do not know there are many ways , " she said in several news she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on holiday with his family .	-4.4656
In the moments before his suicide she wrote : " You must do it , Conrad " and " All you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy . "	-3.6081
Judge Moniz said that Carter was looking for attention by the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from the case by any press .	-3.7291

Joshua Kimmich : Learning from the New Mini-Lahm of the FC Bavaria	-2.5084
It is no coincidence that Joshua Kimmich was allowed to run the Audi Cup as captain .	-3.1990
The FC Bayern trusts the Confed Cup winner a big season - extra motivation is not harmful .	-4.0717
Something was different in his place in the cabin , which Joshua Kimmich saw immediately , even though the additional clothing was very , very small .	-3.9759
But since the second day of the Audi Cup was of course not a Philipp Lahm or a Manuel Neuer to see , he stopped the binding allocated to him .	-6.1933
" The trainer did not announce it , " said the Confed Cup winner after his first bet as Bavarian captain .	-3.6125
Well , the stand could have run better than the 0 : 2 against the SSC Naples .	-3.5167
But the sign of the coach could also interpret Kimmich .	-3.2084
Not the eight years older Arturo Vidal was chosen as a leader in the C-Elf , which was made up of youth players , debutants and professionals just coming from holiday , but rather he .	-6.0486
Sugar is most likely to be distributed to those who want to keep mood .	-4.8138
So anyone who has been chosen to enter the legacy of Lahm can only use a small extra motivation well .	-4.3710
Kimmich confirmed : " This is what you want as a player : take responsibility " .	-2.9451
On Wednesday , the 22-year-old flew over the field as a mini-lahm .	-3.2042
Right back , that is now his position , the white bond on the arm did their rest .	-4.0685
And at all Kimmich worked in this starting formation like the one who can best take the row into his hand .	-6.3976
He gave instructions to attempt to steer the unplayed force .	-2.7159
He had a look for the whole , while many others were busy with himself .	-3.3518
Vidal with overplaying his missing fitness ( hardly folded ) ; Renato Sanches thus coming out of the devil to follow the achievements of the Asian journey ( even conditionally ) ; and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle by not noticing negatively in their first appearance in the Bavarian jersey .	-6.9555
After all , that worked very well .	-3.1346
Sule ran beside Kimmich , Rudy before the defense , both acted sovereignly .	-3.2595
The well-known Napoli storm was often difficult , and the silk also tried to play a few times successfully in the game .	-7.2834
His colleague , Mr Rudy , admittedly admitted that the result was ' not as we hoped ' .	-3.4705
But he also showed proper performance during the debut .	-3.0796
Play relocation , tempo change : " For this style I was also fetched " .	-4.7113
How unusual this Bavarian world is still for new accessibility was followed by the game .	-5.2865
Rudy , for example , did not give one or two in the catacombs , but determined six or seven interviews .	-13.3004
Kimmich passed away after a few cracky statements in the back of his new players .	-4.0725
There he heard an interesting sentence from Süle : " What goes off here , I have already noticed .	-4.5741
At Bavaria you just have to win every game " .	-10.2949
After all , he no longer needs to teach the new . to the . to to the . to to the . to to	-10.9403

The Bavarian Legionaire is almost a club colleague of <unk>FB-Captain Schnaderbeck and fevers with our ladys .	-3.8230
The Austrian footballer ’ s tweet of the year and Champions League winner should be a special motivation injection .	-3.0043

Companies satisfied with Rhineland-Palatinate Minister : Economics praises Wissing ’ s Tempo	-3.4882
It was often inconciliatory , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when Eveline Lemke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economy of Rheinland-Palatinate .	-12.9776
This is evident after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economic Affairs , Volker Wissing ( FDP ) , is in office .	-3.2446
Chambers and companies from the region speak on TV request of a change in economic policy - and at the same time the old minister .	-4.8122
Frank Natus , Chairman of the Association of Trier Companies ( VTU ) , says : " Wissing takes up the wishes of the economy that Lemke has all blocked " .	-3.5625
The biggest reversal is Natus 's infrastructure policy : the gap in motorway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now high on the country 's list of priorities .	-16.0871
This year , the Ministry hopes for a planning procedure to be established by 2021 .	-5.4351
A role in the country ’ s plans is also played by the Western Bypass of Trier , which is in the urgent need of the Federal Transport Plan .	-5.2713
The aim is to start the route in December 2020 , says Ministry Speaker Cornelia Holtmann .	-3.1104
Natus sees it as a sign to support regional but internationally competing companies .	-3.4193
The Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( IHK ) Trier , as suggested by Wissing , seeks a Rhineland Palatinate label for wine to increase sales in supermarkets and stop the trend of German wine exports that have been sacking for ten years .	-14.2701
In addition , Wissing has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company , praises the IHK .	-3.6419
The Trier Chamber of Commerce sees in the new master bonus an additional incentive for young apprentices , says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach .	-3.5307
A premium of EUR 1000 for the existing master exam and EUR 2500 for graduates to become self-employed within ten years of master training .	-4.8036
But the country ’ s homework list remains long .	-2.6243
The planned road construction rapidly creates facts , while the country lacks the necessary staff , says Jan Glockauer , IHK Trier ’ s head officer .	-5.2215
Of 56 new engineers who wish to hire mobility at the national company , only 29 jobs have been occupied .	-4.6515
The IHK calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices .	-2.3088
CDU Group Vice Christian Baldauf refers to calculations by the Court of Auditors , which in 2017 and 2018 invest more than EUR 20 million less in preserving national roads than proposed .	-3.7114
Frank Natus also expects a concept of the country as it wants to fix the shortage of skilled workers in the region .	-4.1072
The extension of broadband to date in the country is also sobering .	-3.8739
In 2016 , regional companies had rated the network supply in an IHK survey only with the note 3.4 .	-2.8711
They complained about stalling internet connections and cancellations .	-13.0378
Ex-Minister of Economic Affairs Eveline Lemke , on the other hand , is currently out of politics and is still sitting on the Supervisory Board of the wind company Pro Wind .	-4.1670
The Green Group left Lemke until April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe , where she had already cleared the field after four months of disagreement .	-13.9058
Audi is supposed to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers are facing a backlash .	-3.3472
One day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles .	-2.3971
The BMW Chairman said that the company believes that ' there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions ' , referring to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles .	-4.0696
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .	-2.0179
None of the companies described the companies as recalls .	-3.0490
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions rules .	-2.5975
But nitrogen oxides emitting diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma .	-2.1417
The cost of automotive manufacturers to install plants to neutralize diesel vehicle emissions is also increasing , making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .	-4.1405
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also charged with cogging the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem .	-3.3802
Companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen , which has been able to use so-called shutdown equipment that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the rules when a car has been tested but reduced in normal driving conditions .	-5.0422
In the United States , several Volkswagen employees have been accused of being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic .	-3.2011
Last month , the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .	-2.4810
The former manager , Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be brought to justice in the United States .	-2.3299
Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen earlier this year , after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to bypass emission rules in Europe , and a question focused on the United States has been extended .	-4.1521
The involvement of Audi in the investigation could heavily impact Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to the profit of Volkswagen .	-3.3663
This message was held on Saturday on the Isar	-15.1840
The city wants to protect the Isar .	-1.4679
To ensure that the Isar visitors join , a raft goes through Munich tomorrow , which has a special message .	-5.4332
Those who draw it to the Isar on Saturday will see a big raft between Flaucher and Reichenbachbrücke .	-4.5857
And this is not a common raft , with Isar tourists .	-2.9144
The building department wants to explain .	-16.8733
On the raft you see a great information transparency .	-4.8926
It shows a Müllberg .	-2.3131
The start of a public relations campaign to appeal to the Isar visitors .	-2.7391
The motto " True Love is ... " is intended to sharpen the understanding of the Isar as a protective wild river .	-4.4153
Last summer the raft took place on the Isar and this year , too , there are other actions and measures to achieve considerable and environmentally conscious behaviour .	-5.6208
Mordillos of noses and laughing against suffering	-3.5791
Mordillo was at times one of the most published cartoon drawings , the noses of his figures are his trademark .	-4.0085
At 85 , the Argentinean is still working on a film .	-4.2277
His message : laugh , " because there is too much suffering in the world " .	-2.2228
Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .	-2.2976
In the first years as an artist , he found himself , among other things , as a draftsman of congratulations - which frustrated him .	-5.0253
" The happiest day in my professional life was the day when my job lost , " he once said .	-2.1304
After stations in Lima , New York and Paris , he succeeded in breaking through in the late 1960s : with the release of his cartoons in " Paris Match " and then in the " Star " and other leading magazines around the world .	-4.3052
Even in China , Mordillo found many fans .	-1.7402
The artist has always been inspired by cities .	-2.8600
Large , round mordillo figures stumble in drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .	-4.1762
In the early morning he sits on the table today , working almost ten hours a day .	-5.4407
Through calendars , puzzles , books for young and old , t-shirts , plush animals and watches , his drolling figures continue to spread much worldwide .	-4.5743
For six years he has also been working on a cartoon film and a TV series with his figures .	-3.2814
The main person in the film " Crazy Island " is a giraffe - mordillo 's most popular animal in his drawings - which has a thousand-feet as an opponent .	-3.4086
For the first time , his figures speak in the 3D movie , which will be released on the cinema screen in 2019 .	-3.8683
" I do not know exactly what they will say it is strange for me , " says Mordillo .	-2.3822
The script is not written by him .	-1.6005
That 's why he bets on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced without words .	-4.3506
Provence ’ s Climate Change Lavender	-2.2730
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France , but there is a warning that it is threatened with climate change .	-2.0648
The lavender is declining because of the drought conditions and insects transmitted to the disease , which causes great headaches for scientists and farmers trying to find solutions .	-4.5988
Eric Chaisse , expert of the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence , said : " The lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because in recent years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change , which brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn .	-4.3278
This has an impact on the life of Lavendel . to to to the . to to the . to to to to to	-12.3382
There is also a small cicade , a microbacterium that transmits dwarf cicades , and in very dry weather there are many of them . '	-3.5285
Much is at stake .	-1.9188
Lavender oil attracts not only holidaymakers , but also perfumes and cosmetics .	-3.0473
Eric Chaisse said : " Instead of having very long plant tubes with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , underdeveloped and either missing or weakened .	-2.7780
So we have fewer parts of essential oil . '	-2.0224
One of the solutions to be considered is better water distribution and the slowdown of evaporation from the soil , but also the spraying of plants with a protective mix of sound and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drought .	-4.7903
The town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhön celebrates its 1200th anniversary this year .	-3.1744
The highlight is this Saturday and Sunday with a Middle Ages festival .	-3.2066
On these days we will be able to experience churches , guilds , traders , vagants or a countryside camp in the city centre .	-7.1916
The murder of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico	-1.5935
The Riodoce weekly newspaper staff usually meet on Wednesday to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the State of Sinaloa through organised crime , corrupt officials and constant drug wars .	-4.7985
But on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they met to talk about security .	-2.4224
They have been told that it is important to change their routines .	-12.0366
Two high-level journalists are discussing what feels safer : they should take their children into the office , who were the goal of an attack with grenades in 2009 or leave them at home .	-4.7831
Security experts have written three words on a board at the front of the room : opponents , neutral , allies .	-2.5659
You ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary , perceptions and abdominal feelings are enough .	-3.1349
There are drug smugglers , politicians , businessmen , journalists suspected of being on the government ’ s salary list or cartels , a catalogue of criminals who dangerously damage Mexico ’ s chaos .	-3.9645
There is no rest break from violence , and while the bodies are increasing throughout the country , there are more and more journalists : at least 25 , since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012 , 589 after attacks and threats under federal protection , and until now there were at least seven deaths in seven states .	-5.4717
Among the latter is her editor and inspirer of Riodoce , co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas .	-2.8796
" The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , " wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . to " " . " to " " " " " " " " " " " "	-11.5007
His absence is deeply perceived , although his presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Valdez , showing his middle finger with the word " Justice " , depends on the facade of the Riodoce building .	-4.8849
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the reporters discuss their divided topics , the trauma , their nightmares , sleeplessness , paranoia .	-2.8148
Although a special prosecutor was set up in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists , according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists , it initiated only two criminal proceedings .	-3.6085
As with the majority of thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organised crime every year , journalists ’ murderers are rarely tried .	-17.1779
At Riodoce , they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa , although they are insoluble and although the terrain is now even more treacherous .	-4.1655
Without information about the murderers , without justice , the meeting to discuss security has little benefit , says Ibarra .	-2.5393
" It is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , " he says .	-1.7394
" Until we know why , we all distrust . "	-2.6433
On the morning of May 15 , Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in Culiacan 's capital .	-12.3996
He only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men .	-3.3964
The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .	-2.1413
Valdez was 50 years old .	-0.7710
He left a woman and two adult children .	-1.1831
Rumors tend to fly around Culiacan freely .	-2.4113
But there is virtually nothing but silence about Valdez .	-2.8803
Since Guzman ’ s arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January , Sinaloa has become one of the country ’ s bloodiest battlefields , as rival groups are fighting here to fill the vacuum .	-3.0656
There is nothing to make in Sinaloa that someone or several people are shot on the streets every day , or that the graveyard is full of decorated , two-storey mausoleums for drug kings who are larger than many houses for the living .	-13.1677
For one minute , forget that there is a state of calm when only one cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States .	-3.8208
Nevertheless , and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work , Ismail Bojorquez ( 60 ) , a co-founder and director of Riodoce , is guilty of not being able to protect his friend .	-3.0664
He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder .	-1.4170
First , in February there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez , a leader of one of the rival antitrust factions in the war with Guzman ’ s sons .	-3.2015
This publication may have annoyed the sons , suspected gang members bought each copy of the issue once it was delivered to newspaper kiosks .	-3.6131
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country to his own security after the confiscation of another newspaper that had published the same story . to the of to the of . to the of in to in . to the to	-15.9671
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .	-2.0113
He had survived for so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there .	-2.5419
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 , joining five colleagues to establish Riodoce and selling $ 50 shares .	-3.7123
In Sinaloa , " it was impossible to practise journalism without encountering the drugs problem , " said Bojorquez .	-2.6765
Over time , the newspaper deserved a reputation for courageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .	-2.8733
Reporters loved to be able to publish hard-hitting studies without fear of censorship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to treat .	-3.5654
Eight years after the foundation of Riodoce , she received the prestigious " Maria-Moors-Cabot Prize " for her coverage in Latin America . to her as a in in from the of in from to in the . to the of from	-14.3679
In the same year , Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in pursuing Mexican drug history wherever she led .	-3.1113
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid .	-1.3074
" I want to live on , " he said at the time of the CPJ award .	-1.9484
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa " is a way of life , " he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV .	-2.0987
" You must take on the task that you as a journalist accept - either that or you play the stupid . . to to the of . to to to the . to to to	-14.3648
I would not like to be asked : ' What did you do with so many dead ... why did you not say what was going on ? '	-3.5036
The Riodoce team misses Valdez , the fun bird that could curse like a port worker , the friend who was generous with hugs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .	-3.4047
They trusted on his routine .	-1.8892
He would always wear his hat .	-1.6799
He would always go to El Guayabo , the bar opposite the office , and always sit there at the same table .	-2.8819
Now they ask : Was his love of routine his corruption ?	-2.8489
His death has also forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their work and stay alive .	-3.5780
" They don 't like it if you look at their women , their children , their clean shops , their secret runways to move drugs .	-4.1370
" These things were not allowed , " said Bojorquez .	-1.4263
The result , even in the best times , is a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation .	-2.5325
Trust his own instincts .	-1.1170
If it smells wrongly , it will remain away .	-10.6959
The trouble is , said the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal , that " smell a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing happened with Javier . "	-3.2140
The old rules , as he and others say , no longer apply in Sinaloa , just as in Tamaulipas , Veracruz , Guerrero and other states where a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is home .	-3.2973
The landscape is constantly changing .	-1.5637
Suddenly , no mobile phones were allowed in the room where Riodoce employees met for security training , and previously it became known that spyware sold exclusively to governments was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico . from in of of of to the of the . to to to to to to the the of the . to to the	-14.2602
Outside , two policemen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 <unk> C ) in the shade of a tree .	-11.8399
They were instructed by the national government to protect Riodoce offices in a four-storey building in a middle class district of Culiacan .	-3.6639
Half in joke , some of the reporters wondered whether these officers belong to the 50 % of the police that the governor himself described as untrustworthy .	-3.1887
It is months since the reporters went into the mountain landscape , where drug gangs are de facto under control .	-3.5351
For this week 's edition , Riodoce has looked at three main stories .	-2.4412
There was the murder of the brother of the former famous boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa .	-2.2709
They also had an exposé on government spending that focused on the governor ’ s home city .	-3.1679
And there was a group that performed a kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan , a block away from the office of the prosecutor .	-17.8585
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened , so caution was needed when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favourite local of drug traffickers and authorities .	-3.5612
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party ( PRI ) , which dominated almost all political levels throughout the century .	-3.4907
Several PRI governors have recently been accused of corruption due to high cases .	-3.5983
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant , including one in which a son of " El Chapo " Guzman escaped a military attack .	-3.3288
Just a few months earlier , readers would have regarded the column of Valdez as the best informed source of abduction .	-3.0594
" In the past , we already knew what happened , " said Villarreal , 46 , with the nickname " El Flaco " because of its slim body stature .	-3.8147
" Now , all channels of communication with our sources have broken down . " to " .	-12.3534
The Valdez office has been turned into a storage room for signs and stickers protesting against the murders of journalists , because employees have become something they would never have expected : activists in the name of the press .	-4.1975
Reporter Miriam Ramirez gathered a few signs and went to a demonstration next morning for another journalist to the office of the prosecutor .	-4.1287
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed , in the western state of Michoacan .	-12.9745
A burnt body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests that it is his .	-2.2810
Journalists throughout the country have become more vocal by writing on pavements and buildings in organized protests " SOS Press " .	-3.4766
On that day , the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the Valdez case .	-3.6133
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez , Ramirez accused the authorities of spying out journalists and killing them because they said the truth .	-3.0187
She has since asked for it to be divided again by the government because it is concerned that its anger has violated its objectivity .	-4.1916
Valdez repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were " surrounded " by organised crime , government officials involved and an indifferent society .	-2.4821
In his latest book " Narco-Journalism " he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who were under one ceiling with organized crime .	-4.5311
Last year , the Articulo 19 Media Guardian Group assigned more than half of the attacks on police and official journalists .	-3.5932
" In Mexico you died because they want you to keep the mouth , " said Ramirez .	-2.5697
Obviously , the murders have a deterrent effect .	-2.0162
No one forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago .	-1.8699
Their body was found together with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel : ' I am here for my reports ' .	-24.9240
A computer keyboard and headphones were next to their separate head .	-2.0298
Some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua following the murder of the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March .	-2.3207
Others continue , as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the murder of her director in 2004 .	-2.6443
In 2010 , the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drugs cartels with a leading article on the front page entitled " What do you want from us ? "	-4.0420
Some journalists have fled their home states or even from the country .	-2.4742
It is a painful decision .	-0.7506
It is difficult to find work in exile , and they still observe the streets and seek dangers .	-10.7998
And sometimes they are driven , as apparently the photographer Ruben Espinosa , who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the flight from Veracruz . in of the of of the of of of in the of the of .	-13.6215
For those who are left behind and continue to work , it is a daily dance with risky decisions .	-3.0402
Ibarra , who once wanted to be a poet , admits that drug trafficking is frightening him .	-2.4339

Now researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible Nashorn of a Canadian miner were so well preserved that experts described it as " Mona Lisa of Dinosaurs " .	-4.4374
It was so good that they even found that his scaly skin was of reddish brown - and they said that she had something of a " troubled past " .	-4.2561
The report in the magazine " Current Biology " called it " the best-preserved armoured dinosaur ever found , and one of the best dinosaur copies in the world " . to " " " " the " dino" " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " to	-16.9743
The fossil is a newly discovered kind of nodosaur living in the middle of the cycle time between 110 million and 112 million years ago .	-3.1258
Its incredibly well preserved state has astonished researchers who describe it as " truly remarkable " .	-3.3932
According to reports in National Geographic , the armored plant eater is the best preserved fossil of its kind .	-2.6873
It was found by Shawn Funk when he grub on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta , Canada .	-2.7929
He met something that seemed missing from the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely .	-3.7237
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology .	-1.8312
They spent the next six years revealing the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,100 kg ) heavy earth clumps .	-3.0927
After all this hard work , the final result is now ready to be revealed .	-2.5402
" If you blink a little with your eyes , you might almost believe that it has slept , " said the main author Caleb Brown , scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum , where the creature is visible .	-3.8352
" It will go into science history as one of the most beautiful and most preserved dinosaur copies - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs . "	-3.2663
Researchers have found that this plant eater , although covered with armor and resembling a changing tank , was probably threatened by meat eating dinosaurs .	-3.8623
The heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators , and used a shielding technique known as countershadow , which is also used by many modern animals .	-3.9596
This would have allowed itself to be better mixed into its surroundings and evaded its enemies , say experts , suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs .	-4.5070
The 110 million years old creature from the Nodosaur family made headlines for the first time in May and is now visible in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology .	-3.4041
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell , one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours discovering it carefully .	-3.5146
The amazing preservation of the copy allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and armor over his body .	-3.3045
They discovered countershadow , a common defense method in animal kingdom , meaning that the top of the creature was darker than its bottom .	-3.2249
Although the counter-shadow is usual , the results are surprising , as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds those of today ’ s animals .	-18.6123
It suggests that the dinosaur was driven by sufficient pressure from meat eating dinosaurs that evolution favored concealment as a means of survival .	-3.1540
But most contemporary animals that use the countershading - think of roe , zebras or belts - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey , signaling that this nodosaur was subject to a real struggle for survival .	-13.9711
" Strong predator behavior on a massive , heavily armoured dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the chalk time must have been , " said Brown .	-4.7328
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was red-brown .	-2.1342
Scientists continue to investigate the animal for references to his life , including his preserved intestinal content , to find out what it eaten as his last meal .	-4.1620
They believe that the dinosaur , when he died , was pushed into a river and driven to the sea , where he fell on the back to the sea bottom .	-4.7857
At that time , Alberta was as warm as South Florida today , and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland than they are today .	-2.6945
" This nodosaur is truly remarkable because it is fully covered with preserved scaly skin , but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal , " said Brown .	-4.0307
" The result is that today the animal looks almost as much as it was in early Cretan times .	-4.7605
You don 't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it ; if you just shoot a little with your eyes , you might almost believe that it is at sleep . '	-4.8120
Credit time was a time when huge theropods , meat-eating dinosaurs , who were on two legs , passed through the earth .	-5.1332
Although the king of them , who lived Tyrannosaurus Rex , millions of years after Borealopelta , the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors .	-3.1061
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus , a 38 feet ( 11.5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monster .	-2.4250
The scientists , whose latest findings appear in the trade journal Current Biology , believe that Borealopelta was sank in the sea after death and mummified in the mud .	-4.1318
The creature was found by Shawn Funk , when he died on March 21 , 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta , Canada .	-3.1264
According to the museum , it is the best-preserved armored dinosaur in the world , including skin and armor , and is completely from the snout to the hip .	-3.6000
The creatures averaged about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,300 kg ) .	-2.8112
It contained two 20 inches long leads , which were shouldered by his shoulders .	-13.3462
Researchers believe that the armored plant eater was flooded by Western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea .	-3.1290
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur preserved its armor in exquisite detail .	-2.6393
The pebbled remains of this special copy are so well preserved that the skin remains still cover holy tank plates along the dinosaur	-13.5345
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic , such a level of conservation is as rare as a profit in the lotto .	-2.3864
The more I look at it , the more confusing it will be .	-1.6198
Scaled remains of the skin still cover the skin ’ s armoured plates that carry the skull of the animal .	-6.1565

On the motorway Stuttgart-Munich ( A8 ) , about 20 people were injured at a mass carambolage on Thursday afternoon .	-3.2287
According to the police , nearly 30 vehicles were brought together between the connection points of Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen ( district of Aichach-Friedberg ) during a thunderstorm , including probably trucks .	-4.9376
At first there was no information about the exact number of injured .	-3.9950
These are slight to medium-sized injuries , said a police spokesman .	-11.1338
A large supply of rescue vehicles was at the place of accident .	-3.6732
The A8 was completely blocked in the direction of Munich .	-2.2765
In the direction of Munich a backdrop of about ten kilometres was formed .	-4.7944
As an AZ reporter reports , there were also massive disabilities on the counter-drive - by numerous gaffers .	-6.4971

Deutsche Bahn : Group tests ' Comfort Check-in '	-1.9838
It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced before : nothing suspicious is sitting in the train and sleeping .	-4.4381
Or you 're deepened in your work and just have a brilliant thought .	-4.3975
And then : bufff .	-1.3306
Comes the creator and awakens a gentle or tears the passenger in the middle of the workflow .	-5.2738
Ticket control .	-1.3427
But the days of interruptions are soon over .	-2.6511
The Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the uncredited ticket control .	-3.4903
Simply confirm by mobile phone that you take your seat and devalue the ticket .	-14.3225
Currently , a test operation runs on two routes .	-2.7631
" If the offer goes on , we extend it .	-3.5709
It will probably be available at the beginning of next year on many other long-distance routes in Germany , " said a railway spokesmspeaker .	-3.9654
" Comfort Check-in " is the railway called the ticket devaluation without the creator .	-4.5182
In order to be able to use them , however , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or a tablet .	-4.4289
And you have to book an online ticket - which most passengers already do .	-3.5228
It also has to be bought through the app of the train , the DB Navigator , which is the most convenient way of booking tickets anyway .	-4.6023
Finally , a seat reservation is required .	-2.8896
Because the " Comfort Check-in " works like this : you rise to the train , call your ticket under " My Tickets " .	-4.8183
A button for electronic devaluation will appear with the test customers .	-3.0510
The train companions receive a notification on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and has taken the seat Y .	-4.5878
If the train companion comes to place Y , he knows that there is a passenger with already devalued online ticket .	-5.0777
So you can continue to sleep , continue working , remain silent .	-4.0574
The " check-in " has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the railway - which in turn should benefit the passengers .	-3.8725
" If you want to travel by our train accompanying staff without any ticket control , check in at DB Navigator yourself .	-4.8939
This allows passengers to make their travel time more personal in the train , " says Michael Peterson , Marketing Board of DB Remote Transport .	-3.2075
Second plus : " And our employees have more time than they do today to meet individual customer needs " .	-3.6646
Those who often travel by train know that , besides delays and missed trains , ticket controls are among the greatest annoyances .	-4.2516
Because often you don 't have all the documents you need to devalue online tickets , one pass. to your .	-19.0301
Either the credit card or identity card is missing or a document that you have to show .	-4.4165
The result is endless discussions between train accompaniment and passenger , leading to bad mood in the department or in the large area and delays in controlling your own ticket and ultimately taking the time to deal with other concerns .	-6.3818
Only a small number of test customers can use the new service .	-2.0203
And this also only applies to the ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen connections .	-13.5253
More train numbers on the same route are not yet activated .	-2.6880
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question : " Whose Streets ? " " " " " " to the " " " " . " Whose to " " " " " "	-11.0327
On 9 August 2014 , Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core .	-2.2782
Just a day after she arrived in New York City , the born in St. Louis sat on the bed of an Airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone .	-3.0654
She stumbled over a post from someone from the High School .	-2.5910
" The police have just killed a 18-year-old child , and it is still on the street , " it said there .	-3.3765
Confused because nobody else had posted the information on their feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .	-2.5752
A user with the handle <unk> TheeePharoah has been constantly retweeted on their timeline .	-3.1063
The rapper from the area of St. Louis was killing live the death of Michael Brown , an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson , Mon .	-14.1922
He posted a picture of Brown ’ s lifeless body that was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours .	-3.7598
" That is wild " , Ferrell thought about himself .	-2.7707
But death was nothing new for them and their community .	-1.9015
She placed her mobile phone to return to tweets later on the Canfield-Drive .	-3.7592
There were photos of the police band and people who shouted , and of a man who claimed to be Brown 's father , who was a sign with the inscription : ' Ferguson 's police have just killed my unarmed son ! '	-4.3174
She observed a live feed where a policeman stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a belling dog .	-3.1697
In another video , she said , another policeman disguised his rifle and shouted : " I will kill you ... animals all . "	-3.8884
" This is not usual , " Ferrell remembered her statement .	-2.7184
'This is not the kind of murder we have used to and we can call it typical ' .	-3.7930
At this moment I felt frost of shake .	-2.6698
I was angry and crying . '	-1.8428
She booked a return flight and went home the next day .	-1.7919
After landing at 11 p.m. , she picked up her six-year-old daughter from her father 's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning .	-3.7150
What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the theme of a new documentary , " Whose Streets ? " , in cinemas from the 11th century .	-3.0431
It is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resilience consisting of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers .	-3.6286
When Ferrell and her daughter , who weared a flower dress and a suitable crown , drove to Ferguson , the two discussed a conversation that they had countless times before this morning » about the black experience and the black condition <unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk> .	-6.5809
" You remember how I taught you when black people must fight for what they believe ? " she remembered what she said .	-2.6709
" We now go to Ferguson because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and that was not true .	-3.2364
I could not take them with me , " said Ferrell later .	-2.4662
" What happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .	-1.9843
It must know and see it and be raised in it .	-3.0473
It must be well developed , not only activism and organisation , but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution , and what we must do to become free to free ourselves .	-3.2419
Although I am lucky to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience any blatant racism , she is no different from the next black women ’ s child .	-3.9036
I have the feeling that I would do her a bad service to keep her away from it . '	-3.0566
The first station , when they arrived in Ferguson , was at the South Florissant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which became a camp area when the activists waited for the possible non-charge of Officer Darren Wilson .	-4.6710
There Ferrell and her daughter linked to a local business owner who had lunch .	-3.7969
They prepared pockets and helped pass them on to demonstrators .	-2.1270
Slowly began to take shape a new kind of activism for Ferrell .	-1.7676
" My activism changed totally after 9 August , " she said and noted that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St . Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities .	-3.6162
" I had no experience in organizing .	-1.3755
Everything has happened . to . to . to to . to to the . to to	-10.3289
Weeks later Ferrell met during an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan , one of the co-directors of the film .	-2.4502
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to " document " what happened .	-1.9579
One question was asked by Ferrell : ' Do you want to document or try to find a story you can exploit ? '	-3.9639
This skepticism was fed by countless cases of people , often white - in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience .	-3.3382
As Folayan recently said in an interview : ' We heard that people born and grown up in Ferguson did not centre their voices and we wanted to do it differently ' . to to the of to the . to the of . to to the from to . to	-17.7523
Folayan had already worked with the then co-director Damon Davis , an artist from the field known for his activism in the field of death stract inmates .	-4.6285
His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project , together with six other locals , followed the team of " Whose Streets ? " in the years after Brown 's shooting .	-10.8815
" This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks to us .	-9.9638
" That was the main thing for me , as these people are described , because that is how I will be presented . "	-4.6143
The aim was not to focus on Ferrell 's experience - to show that the movement " is not a Messiah leader , but a community that comes together " , said Folayan - she proved to be the most open participant of the film .	-3.7895
As a result , documents from " Whose Streets ? " show surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell 's life as she falls in love and marries her wife . to . to to the . to to the of . to to the . to	-14.1713
" I felt like naked , " Ferrell said and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time .	-2.1863
" But I understood that there needs to be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanitarianism of black people . "	-11.6364
In addition , Ferrell ’ s history repeats the role of black gay women in the broader black-live matter movement .	-2.8714
Two of the three founders of the movement who , after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 , marked the film " BlacklivesMatter " in social media , identify themselves as gay .	-2.9571
" Black , gay women in leadership positions have borne the movement as a whole , " said Ferrell , " and therefore we are constantly fighting on various fronts .	-10.5976
Black , gay women must bear the main burden of everything . '	-2.2693
Folayan agreed to note that " the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women " .	-2.4521
However , she insists that " this is not an affirmative type of action " , where Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity .	-3.7561
" She was the person who shook up this energy , " she said .	-2.8414
" It is no coincidence , although she was at the forefront , because in a life at these crossings as a black , gay woman is at stake .	-4.3876
You can feel your energy through the screen . "	-2.0701
The news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared , but the racial links between the community and the police continue .	-3.5164
Ferrell is suitable for 2 <unk> years due to the blocking of a motorway at a demonstration .	-3.5357
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : " A chaos " .	-2.9078
Nevertheless , she clings to a singing and she feels committed to this memory since she went to the streets in Ferguson three years ago .	-3.9074
" It is our duty to fight for our freedom .	-0.9781
It is our duty to win .	-1.0667
We must love and support each other .	-1.6290

From " dream " to " madness " : TV readers discuss bit gallery	-2.3582
The bit gallery moves people although it is far from being built .	-3.2516
But the idea of a shopping centre at the southern end of the pedestrian zone has divided the population into advocates and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .	-3.5556
Cold hardly leaves the subject one .	-4.1852
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page " People 's Friend Bitburg " .	-3.1096
While some say to the bit gallery : " That would be a dream " ( Anja Becker ) or " That would be real class " ( Nicole Schausten ) , comes from the other side : " No man " ( Siggi Betzen ) or quite simply : " Great Man ! " ( Lars Scholz ) .	-4.9227
While proponents rely on a gallery to move more customers to the city , which also benefits the rest of the shops , opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will bleed .	-5.7161
In addition , the gallery is planned on the property where the farm market hall stands , where 13 direct marketers offer their products .	-4.3123
This will stop at the beginning of the construction work .	-3.4668
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new construction - to Beda-Square with possibility to sit outside .	-4.3283
Simone Rooms : " We have been buying in the farm market hall for many years almost weekly .	-3.3024
Mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the women of the countryside are always very happy .	-5.2238
We have also discovered the butchery for ourselves .	-2.4440
We would like this offer to be maintained during and above all after the construction of the gallery .	-3.5250
There are also other cities .	-3.4497
The small market hall in Frankfurt is particularly interesting . '	-2.5821
Gerd Densing : " Whether direct marketers are located in a market hall in the gallery , the amount of the rent depends on the amount .	-4.3950
However , this should not be exactly low in the new project . '	-4.2937
Eva Kilic : " Why shopping palaces in Bitburg ?	-1.4671
Whether clothing , shoes , drugs or supermarkets , I find that superfluous .	-2.7129
There is enough of that in our city .	-2.7452
One can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .	-3.7371
However , since there is not even a proper weekly market here , it is all the more important that we at least have the market hall .	-4.3010
After all , the goods offered there are fresh , largely offered directly by the producer and is cheap .	-4.8779
As you can see , shopping in a shopping centre is only rented by larger companies , because the rents there are often unsustainable for a retailer .	-4.8722
It is a pity that special businesses almost no longer exist , and what remains will probably disappear . '	-4.7050
Wolf Fandel : " A shopping centre with a market hall does not fit me together .	-2.3191
And the gallery does not fit into Bitburg .	-1.7733
Above all , where should the farmer market hall go during the construction period ?	-4.0024
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run if the bit gallery actually comes at some point .	-3.7359
Or can the specter bit gallery already manage to distribute all shops from Bitburg ? '	-4.1234
George Marquet : " That simply won 't work . to to the . to the . to to the . to to to the .	-13.4406
And no one needs a shopping centre that is empty .	-3.2178
I think it would have been better to promote a proper farmer market rather than this gallery .	-3.3590
But there is no place for a farmer market hall thanks to the madness of many - I think - senseless construction projects in Bitburg .	-4.2727
If the farmers ' market hall is broken down , a piece of culture will disappear again . ' '	-12.9095
A suitable similarity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA	-2.1353
In the middle of the Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces - white , black and brown that are almost imperceptible - that hang on cables from the ceiling .	-3.8052
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen Tupper and Haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning .	-3.4392
Manning sent the sections of the Fort Leavenworth prison , where the former intelligence analyst served a 35-year-old prison sentence after she published diplomatic messages classified as secret on the WikiLeaks website .	-4.7132
The new exhibition opened on August 2 is called A Becoming Resemblance ( A suitable similarity ) .	-2.6371
She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg , whose discipline united her expertise in technology , computer sciences and art , and manning , a transwoman and pioneering dissident whose conviction of Barack Obama was converted when he had only three days in office .	-3.9236
Dewey-Hagborg , through the algorithmic analysis of the DNA extracted by Manning , which created 30 portraits of how someone could look with these genomic data , has created a sharp , albeit somewhat intellectual , commentary not only on the formability of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also on identity .	-5.1011
Manning , born as Bradley Edward , but has spoken openly about identification as a woman since her puberty , was sentenced in 2013 for 20 charges , including six violations of the Spyware Act , computer fraud , and theft .	-4.1559
Through the prison , her image was suppressed , so much so that there was only one photo - a grain , black and white selfish in which manning was visibly sitting on a driver 's seat and wearing a platinum wig - with which she was associated .	-5.4536
In 2015 , Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of its 2012 project ' Stranger Visions ' .	-2.5499
In it , the artist produced portraits of forensic artifacts such as cigarette silence and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to produce an image of what these people could look like .	-4.0085
This was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine .	-2.2607
" They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning , while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , " explained Dewey-Hagborg in a press preview of the new exhibition .	-3.1917
And she could not visit at that time and she could not be photographed , so you contact Chelsea and asked them if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .	-3.6766
The artist and her imprisoned muse became unequal letter friends , who exchanged several letters over the course of two years . to the of . to to the of to . the to to the to the	-13.4244
They even created a comic " Suppressed Images " illustrated by Shoili Kanungo , which foresaw a future in which President Chelsea 's judgment would be transformed and capable of seeing the exhibition personally .	-4.1539
Indeed , Obama would demand Manning ’ s release in a military prison in Kansas just a few days after the book was published , a welcome kind of happy meeting .	-3.9887
There is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Trump is waging a war against informers from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new , tweetable ways to escape the rigid divisions he should actually fix .	-4.7418
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said that " things happen for a certain reason " .	-2.4339
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Manning demanded an end to " automatic fragmentation , whose basis was gender , race , sexuality and culture . "	-3.7745
On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand feet of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .	-2.8862
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by including the 200 letters ( or nucleotides according to the sophisticated scientific lexicon of the artist ) how amazingly similar , at least in biological terms , we are all .	-3.2731
" Hopefully , what people will take with them is that our genome does not care about who we are and how open genetic data are for interpretation and how subjective they are , " said Dewey-Hagborg , whose video work of 2007 , Spurious Memories , is also to be seen .	-3.8919
" DNA data can tell so many different stories , so 30 of these stories are . "	-2.3336

" I still get goose skin when I talk about it . "	-3.1701
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition personally - as anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do it , she will be welcomed in the middle of the space by the masks , by her own genomic simulacres , which collapse like hordes of protesters .	-16.5327

Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of the University of Oxford sought for killing	-2.6011
A nationwide human hunt is under way for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of the University of Oxford who are sought as suspects after a man had been stoked in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries .	-4.3971
On Monday , Wyndham Lathem ( 42 ) and Andrew Warren ( 56 ) arrest warrants were issued for murder because of their alleged participation in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau , as shown by the acts of the Cook County court .	-3.4665
The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau , 26 , died after several stitches .	-1.5071
A Community warning system published by the Chicago police authority says that the body was discovered on 27 July .	-2.6178
Officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza apartments and found the victim with several injuries on his body .	-2.4420
Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead in the place of events , and detectives investigate the stitches as murder , while the police actively seeks the two suspects , said officials .	-4.0456
Lathem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007 .	-2.0372
Alan K. Cubbage , the Vice-President of University Relations , said in an email statement that Lathem was now in vacation and was excluded from entering the Northwestern University campus .	-3.5552
" This is now a criminal matter investigated by the competent authorities , and Northwestern University cooperates with this investigation , " said Cubbage .	-2.6114
Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford .	-1.2325
A university spokesman and Somerville College said in an email statement that ' we are in contact with the police in Britain and are prepared to help the US investigation authorities in every possible way ' .	-3.8506
The statement added that Warren ’ s colleagues were shocked and want him to stand .	-13.6290
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Authority , Anthony Guglielmi , said he urged the suspects to face up to the authorities .	-2.4696
" The police have an idea of their place of residence , and our efforts to localize them are stepping up , " said Guglielmi .	-3.0458
Guglielmi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the suspects .	-1.6373
Guglielmi said that the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received a mysterious tip saying that something happened in apartment 1008 .	-3.2148
The police described the scene as very cruel .	-1.1347
Guglielmi said that it was unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July .	-2.1079
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building .	-1.9689
" We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship , " said Guglielmi .	-1.5724
The management team of Grand Plaza published a statement to the inhabitants : " The police are currently working on the timeline and the background of the victim and exploring a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . "	-3.8431
'We shall complete the WADA road map in the near future ' - Russian Vice-Prime Minister Mutko	-2.9702
Russian Vice-Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that it will not take long for the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) to be implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency ( RUSADA ) .	-3.2751
" At a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap , RUSADA has received the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD ( UK Anti-Doping ) .	-3.3997
The WADA timetable has been updated in this respect , " explained Mutko on Thursday .	-2.2814
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA roadmap on compliance with the code , which describes the criteria for the reinstatement of RUSADA and was recently published on the website of the organization .	-3.9563
According to Mutko , it contains nothing that could cause concern for Russia .	-2.5889
" Everything was announced , everything is implemented .	-1.9043
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and WADA in the near future , " he added .	-1.9917
However , one of the criteria mentioned in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by the WADA by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport .	-3.5688
As far as the matter is concerned , Mutko said : " We are carrying out the investigation because our anti-doping system has admitted a mistake .	-3.7350
All measures have been implemented .	-1.2245
But there were no government programmes and we will not admit something that does not exist . '	-2.8906
Mutko ’ s words agreed with those of Vitaly Smirnov , the head of the independent Russian anti-doping commission .	-2.6216
In conversation with the Russian sales office RSport at the beginning of the day , Smirnov added problems of the past to Russian anti-doping organisations , but then added : ' We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .	-3.9293
Nobody intends to accept this report unconditionally , " added Smirnov .	-2.1974
RUSADA was excluded from doping controls in Russia in November 2015 as a result of the doping scandal .	-2.9645
However , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping ( UKAD ) .	-2.2743
After a visit to the headquarters of the organization in Moscow in July , WADA Director-General Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA is moving in the right direction to be reinstated .	-3.6419
Aldi Sells No Egs	-10.2681
That was communicated by the company groups .	-3.4264
It was a mere precautionary measure that no health impairment could be assumed , as stated in the communication .	-5.4547
From now on , only eggs are likely to be delivered to Aldi , which have proven to have been negatively tested on fipronil-containing anti-lice ag.	-5.2884
Aldi wants to create clarity and transparency with its customers .	-3.3854
The start-ups that will help your company not to become the next Uber	-2.4855
Amy Errett wanted to measure the luck with your e-commerce start-up , but surveys did not work .	-3.2821
Answers were often vague , little helpful or , worse , fraudulent .	-2.7598
And even if you promised anonymity , some workers did not trust the process .	-1.9121
" There was simply no consistency and objectivity , " said Errett , who operates the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Company Madison Reed .	-2.6208
She has called for help from outside .	-2.3068
A new breed of Human Resources start-ups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel .	-2.6743
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it enables companies to carry out surveys , address special groups and demographic groups , provide employees with anonymity and complaint hotlines , and , in some cases , whistleblowern allow C-Suite executives to circumvent and directly address the Board of D.	-4.8441
" You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit to pursue their health , but where is the fitbit for your company ? " said Jim Barnett , co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employees engagement .	-3.4528
Saved said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint .	-2.5883
In addition to the snap surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units most have complaints and which executives have low approval results - so you can drill why .	-4.8252
Companies come to realize that they must remain at the top of the workplace culture so that they do not become the next subject involved in scandals since a former employee has published a blog post describing an environment of harassment in which those who have spoken have been punished .	-4.8643
For start-ups like Glint , this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity .	-2.1976
Global governance , regulation , and compliance could have more than $ 118.7 billion in 2020 , according to the financial technology website Let 's Talk Payments .	-2.6343
Denver , Colorado , Start-up Convercent , which helps companies to prevent and recognize bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity in the middle of the Uber case in discredit earlier this year .	-3.6529
Convercent has almost 600 clients , including Airbnb , Microsoft and Tesla .	-1.5249
Uber has recently registered as a client .	-1.9878
As Glint , Convercent lets companies send tailor-made " pulse " surveys , collect confidential answers in real time , and view the heat cards of your problem areas .	-4.2159
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior .	-3.2467
And if the CEO is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .	-2.8038
" The Court of Public Opinion has captured the regulators , " said Patrick Quinlan , the founder and managing director of Convercent .	-2.9892
When a company is found that treats its employees poorly or behaves unethically , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycott , employee fluctuation , and complaints , said Quinlan .	-3.8935
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations , has deployed Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters .	-3.8498
Previously , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or e-mail to the corporate headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .	-3.5414
It was often intimidation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vitrano , Ruby Tuesday ’ s General Counsel , who said that there was no good way to track the complaints of employees .	-3.3327
Now that Convercent is using Convercent , problems that have previously been hidden and addressed by executives sitting in offices in cities or states , such as discrimination , harassment or unfair practice , can be identified and addressed more quickly .	-5.4407
" I can get closer to this holistic , 360-degree view in the experience of employment , " said Vitrano , who leads the Risk Management Group of Ruby Tuesday .	-3.8564
'And we protect our shareholders from employment disputes ' .	-2.8552
Companies began to take ethics , values and employee commitment more seriously in 2002 , after the accounting company Arthur Andersen collapsed due to the Enron scandal , said Quinlan .	-3.5331
But it took time for the " social media to came to their law " that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry from going online .	-20.3390
" Before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , " he said .	-1.5644
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service and burden companies with recurring fees for the use of their products .	-3.6531
It is a business model and an opportunity to obtain the approval of venture capital investors who supported both start-ups .	-3.2108
Convercent received $ 10 million in funding in February from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital , increasing the total capital to $ 47 million .	-2.8701
Glittern secured $ 10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners and brought its total funding to $ 60 million .	-3.2885
These investments hardly come as a surprise , given the networked nature of companies , culture and venture capital .	-2.4355
There is a growing complex of research that shows that today ’ s employees expect more from their jobs than they have done so far .	-3.2172
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley , high salaries and interesting projects are merely operations .	-17.4540
The employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .	-2.9090
" If people are glad to be in a company that belongs to their voices , and that the work they do is worth , then they feel more committed to making this company successful , " said Nina McQueen , vice president of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn , who uses both Convercent and Glint .	-24.6844
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies run well , and companies run well when employees are involved and engaged .	-14.7474
If the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and employment , it is no wonder that you will find support .	-3.5851
The data on employee engagement according to the experts in the workplace culture important .	-3.7319
But the data is useless if the managers of a company do not take action .	-2.9034
Indeed , when a company asks employees for your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way .	-17.0390
And if change does not come quickly enough , or not at all , it can breed disappointments and demotive employees .	-4.0319
" If you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be ready to have 4,000 conversations , " said Russell Raath , President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kotter International , who has seen companies that rely too much on collecting data .	-3.6602
" Because if you don 't follow , employees wonder , " Have you really heard me ?	-4.6474
Are you concerned about this ?	-2.1783
And whom do you not take care of this , why should I ? '	-17.5811
Madison Reed , who now carries out monthly staff surveys , was able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported about Glint , said Savior .	-4.0793
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees , it was able to reorganize several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems .	-4.0687
At Ruby Tuesday , the company is always gaining new insights into its employees , and it hopes that in the long run , this will lead to a better commitment of workers in an industry known for high turnover .	-5.3141
" If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , " said Vitrano .	-1.7233
" And if you lose people , you also lose customers .	-2.1172
And if you lose customers , you will lose companies .	-1.9897
The NCAA Eliminates Two Day Practices and Days for Bruins	-4.0042
It goes to 23 p.m. , when a lot of UCLA football players entertain on one side of the team 's new training fields on the campus .	-5.6269
Some have pulled out their jersey parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .	-3.2093
For a good part of the team , these inactive minutes are a lunch break .	-11.9990
Players who are registered for the summer courses will return to their final exams after the three-hour exercise before returning to the Wasserman Football Center the next morning at 6 : 30 .	-13.9705
" This is a real treat mill for the guys for the next three days , " said Bruin 's coach Jim Mora just before Monday became Tuesday .	-3.8159
The NCAA eliminates two day exercises to facilitate the burden of players , and it has actually extended its days - at least until Friday 's final .	-3.6820
Therefore , the first three UCLA trainings should start at 19 : 15 in order to satisfy the players ' already packed timetables .	-4.7576
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the bruins postponed the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and performed practical exercises during the summer school for the first time during Moras ’ six game seasons in Westwood .	-4.7112
They are scheduled to hold 18 exercises during August 20 before the start of the formal game preparations for their start against Texas A & M in September . . to in . to the in . to to in .	-12.7393
Mora said that he supported the NCAA ’ s change of rules , even if they add another point to players ’ multi-busy routes .	-5.0265
" We put this enormous burden on them three or four days , and it is very challenging , " said Mora .	-2.6910
" And they have simply pushed it through , they continue to paint themselves , they are great . . to to .	-13.7115
I think that as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will really be great . '	-3.3571
The UCLA will stop its practices once the camp is finished , which , given the clear visibility of its fields , will not be an easy task from adjacent parking and the adjacent Luskin Center , a hotel of the highest class , which has already been thrown with footballs that cleared a safety net behind a goal post .	-6.9671
Bruins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mora acknowledged that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .	-3.7306
" We will use our security , " said Mora .	-1.9934
" This is a real problem , and it is not far fetched to think that people are renting a room there and then seeking to record an exercise there .	-15.4030
If you have the video band of an exercise , it is quite a good business .	-2.9696
But we have security forces there , and we have security forces at parking 8 .	-2.4110
We will do the best with what we have .	-1.1362
That is why I am not too concerned .	-2.8292
We have a plan . '	-0.9205
Facebook wants to intensify fact checks in the fight against counterfeit messages	-3.1517
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false reports to third party fact reviewers and then display their results under the original contribution , said the world ’ s largest online social network on Thursday .	-4.2069
The company said in an opinion on its website that it will start using updated machine learning methods to identify possible false reports and send them to fact reviewers who may display results of fact examination from the original article .	-4.8084
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news , many of which believe that they have also influenced the 2016 US presidential elections .	-3.0122
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with French voters being flooded with false stories in the run-up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to eliminate hate-filled postings quickly , as before the elections there in September . to the .	-29.8647
On Thursday , Facebook said in a separate declaration in German that in the US , France , the Netherlands and Germany a test of the new fact review will be launched .	-3.5129
" Besides knowing what stories are contested by third-party fact reviewers , people want more context to make sound decisions about what they read and share , " said Sara Su , product manager for Facebook news in a blog .	-4.1125
She added that Facebook will continue to test his feature on the " related article " and will work on other changes to his message feed to reduce incorrect messages .	-3.6371
Creating a comic novel : A Castle in the History of England	-2.0921
In his recent past , the little Scotney Castle was shown in a Squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s .	-3.1354
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cosy seat in the Bewl River valley in Kent and has now become inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes , a mophaar Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents .	-3.9112
" I find it so beautiful to look at the manuscript of someone who has been dead for 300 years , " he says hurry .	-3.6182
" What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hands . "	-2.0331
" A Castle in England " spans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scotney .	-3.6689
It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive : in 2014 he wrote ' Dead Men 's Teeth and Other Stories ' , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly emotional .	-2.6154
" I only reacted to the thumbnail on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700s who worked for the Jacobiners , " he says .	-3.7874
" That is his thumbnail !	-2.0911
And letters always smell of smoke , because at that time a fire was ignited because of light .	-3.8596
For someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if it were there .	-3.5024
Oh , I love archives ! '	-1.4541
For someone who is beaten with old papers so that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council of England and lived in a castle for almost four months ( " To be honest : I have overvalued my welcome a little " ) , this seems all too nice to be true .	-5.3995
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian " new " castle , looking through the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle , such as the mounted heads of hyena on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the di.	-3.7815
He walked through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle and spoke to landscape carers , gardeners and sometimes also to the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .	-4.0226
Then , at night he drank " whiskey and began to write " .	-2.0628
The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust only received full access in 2006 when the last heir , Elizabeth Hussey , died .	-3.2466
When Rhodes arrived a decade later , employees just began to look after the archive he described as " hundreds of years in which aristocrats said " Oh , throw it on the attic " .	-3.4107
Diaries , letters from the English Empire period , maps that represent who owned what : " You might think that land conflicts would be boring , " says Rhodes , " but there was a birch that fought for the two families .	-13.7575
Guys , let everything go its way ! "	-2.6104
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive into English history on a broader basis , including ' The Labourer ' , following a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the farmer uprising of 1381 .	-16.0011
" There is a record of a riot that occurred in the castle in 1380 , in this book entitled ' Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex ' , says Rhodes .	-3.1295
" The farmer uprising began in this area and I thought that an uprising was a good start .	-2.8227
Perhaps the two are linked ? '	-2.2169
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - such as ' The Priest ' , which tells the story of the Jesuit patron hidden by the Darrell family for seven years during the English reformation .	-3.9008
Or ' The Smuggler ' , which presents the smuggler Arthur Darrell from the 18th century , who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones ( a discovery that was only made years later when his coffin was excavated ) .	-3.4843
The Darrells are Rhodes ' favorite family of Scotney : " The gentlemen seemed to be pretty gauntlets , always make debts and spend money on things they could not afford .	-4.4572
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marriing rich old women - I imagine them as a cluster of good looking guys , with a talent to advertise inheritance . "	-3.3728
After the end of his deployment in the castle , Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences	-3.0960
He brought behind a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel on Elämäki , the site of a sanatorium from the early 20th century , which has since been re-demanded by nature .	-12.6721
But Scotney has a special place for him .	-1.5789
" I was sad to go again , " he says .	-1.2587
It was like ' Oh , now I have to deal with the damned life again ' .	-3.6041
Campaign Launched : More than 300 years old Marian Chapel in Rhöndorf	-3.1943
On Friday , the city of Bad Honnef launched its campaign to introduce a new roof brand ( Rundschau von Thursday ) with the covering of the 301-year-old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf .	-4.6798
By Thursday , Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and slogan secret .	-3.2191
At the end of August there will be a celebration on the island of Grafenwerth .	-3.2801
" Too good for us .	-2.0249
Or ? " , since yesterday the action has been asking the posters at the Rhöndorf Chapel .	-4.2658
" We don 't really think this ( of course ! ) , " they write on their yesterday activated website .	-3.9516
" But we use this measure to attract your attention .	-2.0607
And to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .	-2.1441
Basically , we are firmly convinced that , as Bad Honnefer citizens , we are well aware of the beauty and attractiveness of our ci' .	-3.8572
The action is about more than " just " a logo and a slogan , it goes on .	-3.2556
" It is important to formulate a single promise , one that gives the city a distinctive unique characteristic " .	-4.4342
After all , it is competing with other municipalities .	-2.0788
The city of Bad Honnef can taste a medium five-digit amount of its new roof brand and campaign .	-4.3209
Military Reforms in Turkey - Erdogan ’ s Fear of the Army	-1.6450
Every year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( YAS ) is discussing retirement and transportation in the officer corps at Ank. the to the of to the .	-17.3999

But nothing is routine among Turkish forces one year after the coup attempt .	-2.4292
The sitting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff , as previously , but in the office of the Prime Minister .	-3.5798
The five Vice-Prime Ministers and the Ministers for Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs have now taken part in the discussions under the chairmanship of the Head of Government .	-3.9607
Thus , the civilians in the YAS were overwhelmingly .	-4.1776
The government attracts the reins in the military .	-2.6525
Hulusi Akar ’ s chief staff remains in office , but the commanders of the army , the air forces , and the navy have been deported .	-4.7090
Since the failed coup , Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals .	-2.5071
More than 10,000 soldiers have been removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged links to the movement of exile preacher Fethullah Gülen , who Erdogan sees as a wire driver of the coup trial .	-4.6304
There have been negotiations in Ankara since this week against 486 people who have been directly involved in the coup attempt .	-3.8686
Erdogan referred to the attempt to overthrow as " God 's Gift " on the day after the coup , giving him the opportunity to " fully clean " the armed forces .	-6.0278
But is Erdogan really in control of the army ?	-2.1137
At the end of February , the newspaper " Hürriyet " published an article entitled " Unease in the Military Headquarters " .	-2.7327
In the General Staff there were concerns about the increasing " Islamization " of the army , which manifested itself , among other things , in the lifting of the headscarf ban on soldiers , the newspaper wrote .	-11.7693
In any case , the major purity of the army and the security forces continues .	-13.9379
In mid-July , Erdogan decreed to fire another 7395 state servants , including 2303 police officers and 546 soldiers .	-3.3126
It seemed that Erdogan tamed the military .	-2.1670
The generals used to be considered the country ’ s actual masters .	-3.9207
Three times , they collapsed on their role as guardians of the secular state .	-4.1928
Following his election victory in 2002 , Erdogan pushed back the military ’ s power step by step , not least on the reform targets of the European Union .	-4.1139
Former officers say that Erdogan is pushing ahead with Islamization of the armed forces .	-3.6516

The draft law is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .	-2.4775
" This law will reduce poverty , increase wages , and save billions of dollars for taxpayers , and will do so by changing the way in which Green Cards are spent to citizens from other countries . "	-2.9500
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .	-1.1464
This new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English , who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , " said Trump , quoted by the American media .	-2.9988
Ministry wants to renovate route for racing shuttle	-4.3043
Over the past few months , the future of the racing huttle has been disputed over and over again - now it is to be done quickly .	-6.4232
Before the end of the year , the tourist railway will be built on the marvellous track .	-6.2896
In order to secure the future of the racing shuttle in the long term , construction work will begin this year , according to the Ministry of Transport .	-4.5389
" With the decision to continue ordering and renovating the Ilmenau race track , the country is committed to this particularly important link for tourism , " explained Secretary of State Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt .	-4.9405
The cost of repairing the route was around EUR 2.5 million .	-2.9960
Of this sum , the country accounts for 75 % .	-2.9032
The contract , on the basis of which the shuttle is to be ordered from the country in the future , is currently being finally voted , declared refrigerator .	-5.3404
The Ministry and the South Thuringia Railway as operators are already agreed on the technical details .	-3.2127
" This negotiates the road map , the vehicles used and the quality standards , " said Sühl .	-3.0587
The planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be concluded for a period of eleven years .	-2.6263
This is to be ordered regularly on December 2017 .	-3.6818
The Rennsteig-Shuttle is a popular railway connection between the Ilmenau railway stations and the Rennsteig .	-13.1391
In recent months , a pilot operation has tested whether the route is being used by sufficient numbers of people to regularly order it again in the future .	-5.4650
In addition , the route is strongly destructive in parts .	-5.4194
The rise of sex robots is real , and we should worry .	-2.2112
Especially when you thought it could not become even more crazy in 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots comes .	-4.4809
Yes , indeed .	-1.0829
Sex robots are currently a big thing .	-2.0363
Recently , the Foundation for Responsible Robotics ( FRR ) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years .	-1.8047
According to Noel Sharkey , an emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR , we must start to take their rise seriously .	-3.0308
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its form of chest black and the type of fingernail .	-3.0981
'People make fun of them , but businesses deliver a lot of them , and we will see them much more frequently , ' said Mr Sharkey when he published his new report .	-5.0134
Modern sex puppets have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with deliberately human reactions achieved through artificial intelligence .	-3.4960
The user can also " customize " his robot according to his convictions , choosing everything from the robot 's eye color to the form of chest blades to the type or color of his fingernails .	-5.0521
But it becomes even more worrying because many robots have the " personalities " that a Stepford woman would look progressive .	-3.6348
Modern sex puppets have become robots with a silicone skin .	-2.0486
For example , the RealBotix robot allows users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing , such as shyness .	-3.5717
And then there are the Roxxxy Gold Sex robots developed by True Companion with preprogrammed personalities such as " Frigid Farrah " , which gives the impression of shyness and " Wild Wendy " with an " adventurous " personality .	-4.0407
" Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is as adapted as possible to your personality , " swarms the website of True Companion .	-2.6982
So she likes what you like , and she does not like what you do not like , etc .	-2.8155
She also has her moods during the day - just like real people !	-3.6310
She can be tired , fixed on conversation , or she can be " in mood " !	-9.3276
There are many worrying aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace genuine human relations - but the submissive female characteristics , the allusions to rape , when one takes a step towards Frigid ( which means reluctant ) Farrah , worry one most .	-5.1962
On his website , True Companion Roxxxy compared with a vibrator , but for men .	-13.7856
" If women ( sic ) can have a vibrator , why can men not have Roxxxy ? " says on the site .	-3.1979
However , these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy .	-2.3285
Their emergence and increasing sophistication point to something darker and lower in our culture , to a withdrawal from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition .	-3.9570
Of course , most men will not hold sex robots , and while the FRR notes their rising popularity , they remain on the verge of consumer culture for the time being .	-4.1953
But what leaks out of the peripheral zones can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time in which we live .	-3.7557
And many people are not strange or offensive until the free market gives them permission .	-2.1947
There is a certain overlap that these advanced sex robots emerge at a time when the rights of women are threatened worldwide , when there is a president in the White House who has boasted to have attacked women sexually .	-4.2565
The most deterrent aspect of the television series ' The Handmaid 's Tale ' ( ' The Report of the Magd ' ) are not the graphic images , the swallowed bodies and the stunned eyes , but how realistic this vision works .	-4.6096
The Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap .	-2.9126
The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as possible ( albeit with porn star proportions ) .	-3.2005
Their builders want them to feel humane and emulate the movement of a real body .	-2.7232
But , to the point when it comes to their " personalities " , the robots are not real women .	-3.3854
You cannot separate yourself from your companion or just leave .	-10.0312
They have no mediation or background history , nothing indicating independence or anything that could disrupt the imagination of total submission .	-3.3977
In other words , they are pleasant slaves .	-1.1568
Or to put it in the 2017 speech : service girls	-2.5118
Trump ’ s Great Performance ?	-1.4916
He makes Mitt Romney the embodiment of common sense	-3.0077
It has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions that polarized the US electorate have also divided families in small format .	-2.8086
Around Christmas and harvesting , there were newspapers in the US with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump elected relatives .	-3.8887
We are all allegedly striving to burst our filter bubbles .	-2.7329
Less has been noted about Trump ’ s power to bring together families .	-2.4008
I mention this because my cousin , a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has been working with the Republicans in our family for a long time , visited me in New York this week .	-2.8679
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .	-1.7513
With Trump in the White House , everyone she knows , including the Republican relationship with which she had fought for decades for politics , is suddenly and strangely on the same side .	-3.4424
This is certainly a good thing around the dining table , but it strikes me in another context that this also involves significant risks .	-4.6786
The left was strengthened by Trump , but his presidency ’ s disastrous effect has the power to push us all to the right .	-3.2443
When we speak of ' normalization ' and Trump , we refer to the cruel possibility that one day his girls will no longer reject us .	-4.1965
But there is an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump ' normalizes ' right-wing Republicans , who suddenly appear to be the embodiment of reason compared to his standards .	-4.4163
Today , I find myself affected by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney ’ s urkomic version of the crazy – the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew what his tax declaration looked like ) – both of which , compared to Trump , are indeed a very mild crime .	-5.8860
If Trump goes , Republicans ’ next candidate must be mentally healthy to qualify as an immense improvement .	-2.9375
When my cousin was in the city , we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park , the largest of the carousel of the New York Park Department , and the best three dollars that can be spent in the city if you don 't need a caffeine .	-4.4354
The horses are enormously large , the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all the clowns are small and the animals are turning out to look full of fear over their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climbing music conveys this strangely .	-5.7470
So many clichés of a city disappoint : the views of high buildings become old , the skylines become familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city is not fair to the dream .	-3.6611
Thirty-five years later , and I am still not entirely over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a great roundabout in northern London .	-4.2330
The Central Park-Karussell , however , is still a strange magical experience , as two years old , a 11-year-old and two women in the 40s can go on it and everyone has a great time .	-5.8066
If I had been able to evaluate the carousel , I would have given him the full number of points , but fortunately no one asked for it .	-3.5803
On the other hand , I was forced this week in a department store to evaluate my " experience " with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card .	-3.5573
In the coffee house on the corner of my street , it is the same , plus the option of comparing the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something over the shop table .	-4.3844
This not only slows down what should be a neutral exchange , but also puts pressure on the server to introduce personality into a situation where none is required .	-3.8618
The poor woman in the department store was excusing , while I was tired of experiencing my five-star credit card .	-4.6835
Oscar Pistorius transfers breast pain from prison to hospital	-3.0562
For the second time Pistorius left the prison for a hospital visit .	-2.1942
Last year , he was brought to the hospital because of the treatment of cuts on his wrists , which , according to the prison authorities , he suffered in his cell after a case .	-4.4839
Pistorius was sentenced for murder after an appeal by the prosecutors against a first death sentence .	-4.1083
He killed Steenkamp in the early morning of Valentine ’ s Day 2013 by shot them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria .	-3.8293
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a night intruder who hidden in the cabin .	-3.0084
The prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal against the six-year prison sentence of Pistorius , which they say is too indulgent .	-15.3960
The National Legal Prosecution Authority said that it would object to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the objection could be heard this year .	-3.3775
Pistorius is in danger of increasing his punishment to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful .	-3.0405
There is no death penalty in South Africa .	-0.7986
As Farmer Arnold Finds a Strange Egg	-3.3951
As the last of the Blumberg schools , the four-classes from Fützen and Epfenhofen were released in the holidays and in the secondary schools .	-4.3899
Three of the dismissal students will go to the Gymnasium , four to the Real School .	-4.0984
School leader Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürgerhaus Biesental in Epfenhofen on Tuesday evening .	-2.9984
As a symbol of school release , the 29 students of the four classes , led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder , chose a young eagle who grows up in the Hühnerhof but then released into freedom .	-4.1648
The munter Shar performed a musical entitled " Der Adler im Hühnerhof " .	-3.4827
Farmer Arnold found a strange egg and let it breed from his chickens .	-3.2945
Instead of a chicken , a small eagle came out .	-1.9914
But the hope of making him a chicken devastated , the eagle spread his wings on a high mountain and disappeared .	-3.3007
After that , the classes showed three and four in Yvonne Frank 's studies a chicken dance .	-3.3988
The hens danced with the young gockels that carried cylinders to the bet .	-2.2923
The eagle stands for integration , said school leader Angelika Sitte .	-1.8223
Although the young animal is different from the other young animals ( chicks ) , it belongs to them to . to the of to to the . to to to	-12.6194
But he will never be like a chicken .	-1.4163
Its provision is to be free .	-1.9373
She wished every four-class school to be accepted .	-4.4575
Thank you to colleagues , former school leader Michael Müller , who keeps jumping in bottlenecks and parent representatives .	-4.8978
The chicken season is over , declared class teacher Sophia Schumacher .	-3.3107
She released her students after two years of lessons very reluctantly because it was a really great time .	-4.4571
Finally , she has been able to rely on the fourth classes .	-3.9166
To conclude , all students had a song of summer time and holiday time songs .	-23.8874
The children had great pleasure in this . .	-13.2732
Eight first classes have already been registered for the new school year .	-2.8466
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece	-1.4206
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal campsites in Greece , informed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted by television .	-2.8911
On the morning of 1 August , the police arrested a group of illegal campaigners in Sithonia , including the two Bulgarians .	-2.7532
On the same day they were released while an investigation is under way .	-3.2535
The Foreign Ministry reported bTV that the Bulgarians were later released .	-1.9673
The Greek authorities have tightened control of the free camp and impose substantial fines on anyone found to remain in a place that is not intended for this purpose .	-3.9183
The checks will continue throughout the season .	-2.2912
The Ministry said that the Court can impose a fine .	-2.1006
Software update for diesel vehicles : What the people affected need to know now	-3.1726
How exactly does the software update take place ?	-1.3949
Do diesel drivers need to participate in the action ?	-2.7139
The most important questions and answers overview .	-2.2289
At the Diesel Summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of 5.3 million cars .	-2.8287
They are intended to improve the exhaust gas behaviour of Euro 5 cars and partly Euro 6 cars .	-3.4546
Euro 4 diesel or worse are excluded .	-2.1753
Anja Smetanin of the ACE Auto Club Europa gives assessments :	-2.1317
Is the new action mandatory ?	-1.4996
No , the negotiated software updates are voluntary .	-1.2930
" The obligatory updates before apply only to the vehicles that have schummel software , " says Anja Smetanin .	-3.5336
The German Federal Authority ( KBA ) ordered its retrofitting .	-4.0109
How and when are customers informed about updates ?	-10.4487
The manufacturers have announced rapid implementation in the coming months , but have not yet given a precise date .	-4.0148
Daimler has announced that he will write to everyone concerned .	-4.1870
If an inspection is due in any case , it will be done within its context .	-11.4386
How long will the overall conversion take ?	-3.3270
" Hard to say , " says Smetanin .	-2.4852
This depends on manufacturers ' commitment and political pressure .	-2.3903
" We have seen that car manufacturers have not yet acted voluntarily on the environment . "	-3.8190
How long will the update take ?	-1.7462
The conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .	-2.3393
It may be more expensive to get an appointment .	-3.6902
What do drivers who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group do ?	-2.3572
The ACE advises you to wait .	-1.9913
Probably foreign manufacturers would follow , according to Smetanin .	-2.9719
Now is the threat of a massive fall in prices for Euro 4 cars ?	-3.3578
The ACE fears that .	-1.4041
But it is precisely in the regions where driving bans are to .	-14.2071
There has been no loss of value in rural areas for older diesel .	-3.1348
The ACE advises to wait for a sale .	-2.2943
LL Cool J Gains Kennedy Center Award	-1.8353
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington .	-1.5332
The first award ceremony under President Trump promises to become political .	-2.3450
One of the winners does not want to come from protest .	-10.5137
LL Cool J ( 49 ) is the first rapper to receive one of the coveted awards of the renowned Kennedy Center .	-2.9848
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday , this year , singer Gloria Estefan ( 59 ) , Lionel Richie ( 68 ) and choreographer Carmen de Lavallade ( 86 ) and TV producer Norman Lear ( 95 ) are among the honours .	-3.7754
The awards will be handed over at the beginning of Dec. the will to a .	-11.9782
Traditionally , US President Donald Trump will host a reception and participate in the award together with his wife Melania .	-2.2260
The award winner Lear , who has become known with progressive TV series , has therefore already announced that he will not participate in the gala .	-5.3451
He said the New York Times : ' This presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even to deprive them of the resources - and this burdens me ' .	-5.0160
The 59-year-old Estefan emphasized that she would use the talk with Trump to make her view clear .	-3.6893
The Kennedy Centre , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital .	-2.2619
Former winners include Meryl Streep , Aretha Franklin , Robert De Niro , George Lucas , Tom Hanks and Sting .	-1.9293
We Making the City Livable	-2.7841
Roland Wacker , Haslach ’ s city builder , will retire next year .	-3.3715
The job is already awarded - suitable candidates are rare .	-15.4787
Wacker has been a city builder for 31 years .	-2.7153
And the work still makes him great fun as he conveys in the press .	-4.3262
He reports on varied but also demanding tasks that await his successor .	-3.1990
At the same time , he is surprised that no application so far meets the requirements profile .	-3.7274
The city is looking for an architect or construction engineer at the next time possible .	-3.3226
Thus , with regard to the regular termination periods , there is still enough time to adapt .	-5.9401
Since Haslach acts as a lower construction law authority for the administrative community , the candidate must provide appropriate degrees .	-4.9701
Because this function definitely wants to keep the city .	-3.8548
If it could no longer complete it , citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice .	-4.1767
But closeness to the city is important to him and himself , says Wacker , who reports about a good business climate and good mood between the authority and the citizens .	-5.1868
In more than 30 years in office , some significant projects have been accumulated , which Wacker is proud of .	-4.9638
" We make the city worth living " , he is sure about the building office and its employees .	-3.7028
But varied projects are still on the agenda in the future too : the transformation of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofenparkplatz , for example , have been initiated .	-5.2578
The Kinzig Bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed , and the stadium renovation is still a topic .	-3.8127
The latter alone will beat around EUR 1.5 million " if we do it right " , Wacker appreciates .	-3.9463
" All in all , great tasks await my successor .	-2.0192
The work here is fun . '	-1.9686
Design is available for a city builder with great room for manoeuvre .	-4.9023
With Haslach ’ s own building farm and gardening facility , many things can be reacted quite flexibly .	-4.7531
" You can move a lot " , says Wacker , and the design of the green facilities is often mentioned by citizens and visitors .	-4.1623
Since the old town is under the protection of monuments , it is important to have an eye for what fits in with new buildings when approved , the outgoing town builder emphasises .	-6.0289
In any case , the town builder has a high responsibility .	-4.4944
He is a builder , " in the end everything runs over my table " .	-3.4467
He can count on long-standing employees in care and coordination : Markus Neumaier ( Hochbau ) has been involved for ten years , Manfred Schöner ( deep construction ) for already 15 years .	-5.9267
Wacker also wants his successor to remain long : " We are looking for someone who really wants to identify and remain with the place " .	-4.6217
Continuity is important not only for a good business climate , but also for the further design of the city .	-3.4091
Anyone who wishes to inherit Roland Wacker should be able , according to the information provided by the city of Haslach , to study as a diploma engineer or bachelor with specialized architecture and to have good expertise in the fields of construction and construction law .	-6.7202
The city building office is subject to high and low construction , construction planning , basic working matters , management of urban properties , urban factory with building yard and urban gardening , as well as underground construction authority including monument protection .	-7.6119
Bicycle thrown on lines : South railway track blocked	-3.6422
According to the police , unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bicycle off the railway transfer in the area of Leobener Stra<unk>e ( B116 ) .	-3.8409
These were so damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .	-3.0243
The investigators start from two male perpetrators and have been looking for them since the night .	-3.4329
A pink scooter and a bicycle rider had been observed by witnesses .	-3.7518
" That goes far beyond a bubble stroke , " said <unk>BB spokesman Christoph Posch to the APA .	-4.3714
The perpetrators would have put themselves in great danger and also put train traffic at risk .	-3.9546
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant , as well as the delay minutes and the costs of rail replacement traffic , rail customers could also have to pay for the perpetrators .	-6.9845
Overall , the spokesperson said that a " significant " sum should be assumed .	-5.2118
The damage was fixed again on Friday afternoon , rail traffic on the southern railway line could be carried out without disabilities .	-4.6195
Nearly ten passenger trains were found on Friday morning , two of which concerned long-distance traffic .	-4.1915
Freight trains were not off , but they were late .	-3.7359
According to <unk>BB spokesperson Christoph Posch , approximately 200 meters of lines had to be exchanged .	-3.3012
Isolators and masts have also been damaged .	-1.8820
Red meat , dairy products , and chocolate could help relieve IBD ( inflammatory intestinal disease )	-2.3924
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system .	-1.3830
But a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could relieve the symptoms of patients with inflammatory intestinal diseases .	-3.1626
The incurable state of around 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the UK causes stomach cramps and blowing , recurring or bloody diarrhea , weight loss , and extreme fatigue .	-3.6646
While those affected are normally advised to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms , researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine .	-3.8641
The leading researcher , Dr. Marco Colonna , explained that immune cells in the intestine patrol to ensure that harmful microbes hidden in food do not penetrate into the body . from to . to the , to the to the of the .	-16.8875
Cells capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue .	-2.5954
If the balance tends too far towards inflammation , it may result in inflammatory intestinal disease .	-2.9622
Experiments found that a kind of tolerance-promoting immune cell occurs in mice carrying a certain bacterium in their objections .	-4.7280
And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .	-2.8646
Professor Colonna said : " We have established a link between a bacterial type - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbiom , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .	-2.9134
The more tryptophan the mice had in their food , the more they had of these immune cells .	-10.4732
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and promote a more tolerant , less inflammatory intestinal diet rich in tryptophan , if the same system also works in humans .	-3.9854
The postdoctoral student Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which was housed separately , did not have this .	-4.0772
She suspected that the difference had to do with the intestinal biomas of the mice - the community of bacteria , viruses and mushrooms that usually live in the gastrointestinal tract .	-3.5094
The darms of the mice were sequenced DNA and six types of bacteria were found which were present in the mice with the immune cells , but without them missing .	-5.1144
Miss were raised in a sterile environment , so they lacked an intestinal robiom and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells emerged .	-4.7443
To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system , researchers L. reuteri grown in a liquid and then transferred small quantities of liquid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from the mice .	-3.5320
Immune cells developed into tolerance-promoting cells .	-2.5613
When the active component was cleaned from the fluid , it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as Indol-3 milk acid .	-3.4588
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in mice feed , the number of such cells increased by about 50 % , but when the tryptophan values were halved , the number of cells fell by half .	-3.4255
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice , and that most of us L. reuteri protect in our gastrointestinal tracts .	-2.2630
It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory intestinal disease .	-3.1700
She said : " The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote , as these cells control inflammation on the intestinal surface of the intestine .	-3.1566
Potentially , high tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population . "	-2.7781
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has committed a " genius " to Nemanja Matic	-2.3138
At Manchester United , Nemanja Matic signed a " genius " , Jose Mourinho believes , after the middle field player had his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening .	-3.5478
The 40 million pounds signed by Chelsea began with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup begins on Tuesday against Real Madrid , and impressed in the holder role when people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marched forward as they like .	-5.2595
However , Matic was excluded from the preparatory Asia tour of the blues and created only 45 minutes , admitting that he had to improve before the Premier League season began .	-3.9180
" He takes time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , " said Mourinho .	-1.8712
" We will help him to be prepared sooner than later . "	-2.3977
In addition to Matic , Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started at the Aviva Stadium , when Mourinho formed his start-XI for the beginning of the season .	-3.9734
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three more new commitments , but he insisted that the club had already done a " fantastic job " to fulfil three of its four priority new commitments .	-3.8408
" Three out of four to get , for which I thank the club " , he added .	-12.7487
" I will be happier if they get four out of four for me , but they have made a great effort . "	-3.3473
Boeing " paints " Dreamliner in the Heaven	-6.4524
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner in the sky .	-2.7134
The pilots flew from Seattle in the US state of Washington , but the drawing began in Marquette in the US state of Michigan , drawing over the US in the form of a Dreamliner , which is several thousand kilometres .	-4.3646
The action took 18 hours and one minute .	-1.8656
On the radar screens was the form of a dreamliner .	-2.5841
The whole thing was an endurance test for new engines .	-2.4402
Boeing had previously made such advertising .	-2.3887
Thus the number " 787 " and the boeing logo was painted in the sky .	-14.3076
New Deep Shift for Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a Problem	-3.4549
As the wind turns , when Sigmar Gabriel was still SPD chief , Social Democratic prime ministers always looked to Berlin with some concern before elecelections . to the to the .	-23.3349
Simply no disturbing fires from the party headquarters , no headwinds from the federal government - that was the most important wish of the electoral campaigners .	-6.3536
Since Martin Schulz led the party , this has changed radically .	-2.5441
Since then , employees from the Willy Brandt House have been watching events in the SPD ruled capitals with growing horror .	-4.0967
What Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in headwinds .	-3.5422
They were deep strikes .	-2.2917
One after another .	-2.4227
After the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of SPD and Green .	-3.2984
" This shows once again : Red Green simply cannot govern reliably , " said CDU Secretary-General Peter Tauber of the editorial network Germany ( RND ) .	-3.6011
The surprising dispute of a Green MEP has plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .	-3.2120
Five months before the election , his red-green coalition lost its one-vote majority to the opposition from CDU and FDP .	-2.9347
The Green Managing Director , Michael Kellner , has called on the breakaway Lower Saxony Green MEP Elke Twesten to return their mandate .	-17.6469
Transferring to the CDU means clearly distorting voter will .	-2.9542
Elke Twesten must immediately return its mandate , " said the federal manager and campaign manager of the Greens to the editorial network Germany ( RND ) .	-3.9517
" All this must not be true " , a SPD electoral campaigner appears when the new hiobsmessage reaches the headquarters on Friday morning .	-5.8246
Stephan Weil , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands without a majority of its own government following the transfer of Green MEP Elke Twesten to the CDU .	-4.6863
It is the preliminary highlight of a whole series of major and small crises in SPD associations .	-3.0291
And no one knows what comes next .	-1.4055
The misery began with the unexpectedly clear defeat at the Saarland election in March .	-2.8740
A blue eye , no longer , the comrades calmed down at the time .	-3.1373
After the national elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia , everything will be different .	-2.3689
That was also the case - and everything became much worse .	-4.8212
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the muddle , the Düsseldorf bankruptcy slippery the party .	-5.3608
In the weeks afterwards , the comrades resurrected .	-5.5677
Then , when they had just created new courage , the G-20 summit in Hamburg came .	-2.8947
And with him came the next deep strike .	-2.1296
Mayor Olaf Scholz , the last strong SPD chief , lost his nimbus at that weekend because he sat in the Elbphilharmony while his city burned .	-14.8978
And because , in crisis communication , he then made pretty much the wrong thing to do .	-4.7740
Since then , Scholz has been fighting for his political survival .	-1.5422
So Stephan Weil is still there to do . to to the . to the . to the . to	-12.3262
The Lower Saxon Prime Minister has long been critical of the VW exhaust affair and its role in the Supervisory Board .	-3.5785
Miese surveys added .	-2.4033
Nevertheless , or perhaps precisely for this reason , Because in the last few weeks has tried to put more and more emphasis on the covenant .	-5.8870
The attempt by the former mayor of Hannover to expand his power in Berlin was not hidden , either in the area of Martin Schulz .	-4.8506
They allowed him to be granted because they promised to stabilize the party from Because .	-3.4935
Now the exact opposite could happen .	-2.6862
Because , in fact , it does not blame the internal dispute between the Lower Saxon Greens .	-4.2180
And Schulz is not .	-2.2337
For the time being , the comrades are trying to keep their own ranks closed .	-4.1047
Her anger is directed towards the Greens , and above all towards the breakaway parliamentarian , Mrs , Mrs T. , to the of to the . to to the	-12.2572
" It is intolerable and democratically damaging , as Mrs Twesten puts her own career interests above the interests of everyone else , " says Matthias Miersch , head of the party left in the SPD Federal Group , the editorial network of Germany ( RND ) .	-11.2271
Mrs Twesten was elected to Parliament not because of her person as a direct candidate , but through the Lower Saxon Green List , so the Lower Saxon MEP continues .	-4.8937
The logical consequence would be to return its mandate .	-2.0838
Thomas Oppermann , head of the SPD Federal Group , complains of an " undemocratic manoeuvre " .	-3.0746
" The will to vote four years ago was clear : the people made Stephan Weil the Prime Minister , " says Oppermann , who leads the Lower Saxon SPD as the top candidate in the federal election , the RND .	-4.0804
" Now the personal career thinking of a future CDU MEP distorts the election result , " Oppermann continued .	-13.3455
He called for the background to be clarified .	-2.3447
I would like to know whether there have been more or more commitments from the CDU in Lower Saxony .	-3.8322
Funding for Centre III	-2.7784
Anyone who wants to renovate his house in the years can soon receive support from the country .	-4.2000
Mayor Albert Schindler informed about this and three representatives STEG city development on Wednesday in Empingen .	-14.8618
At the beginning of the information event , Schindler gave a review of what has happened so far .	-3.7521
Since 1991 there have been rehabilitation areas in recrec. to the of the . to the of . to the of to the .	-13.9213
At that time , in the Renovation Area I from 1991 to 2004 , the country of Baden-Württemberg took over two-thirds of the amount of funding .	-4.1092
In the Renovation Area II from 2005 to 2016 , the grant was still 60 % .	-3.6430
For Schindler , the previous renovations are a " success project " - finally it is important to promote interior development and not just to open up new construction areas .	-5.4634
On 4 April , the Bureau of the Government of Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a renovation area III .	-4.1594
The amount of funding amounted to EUR 833 333 , of which EUR 500 000 would come from the country , the rest of the municipality of Reception .	-3.8247
How does a recovery area emerge ?	-3.3060
One will examine where the " really old " houses are .	-4.1488
However , it also matters whether there is any interest in the planned area to renovate .	-4.3457
If necessary , the territorial borders could then be shifted again .	-3.7894
The STEG represented Martin Keller , Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening .	-1.7985
Keller presented the contents of the Federal Social City Programme , in which the rehabilitation would be carried out .	-4.7047
At the heart of the programme are the revitalisation of inner cities , the improvement of residential and working conditions and the preservation and expansion of infrastructure .	-4.2481
The measures would be implemented object-related , i.e. per plot .	-4.0424
The rehabilitation area would then be established as a statute .	-3.7662
The approval period for the funding has run from 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026 .	-3.2355
By September this year , however , the stocktaking would be carried out , in which the participants in the restoration area receive a questionnaire for completion .	-6.9409
In November or December , the Articles of Association Decision should be taken as far as possible , so that the rehabilitation can begin next year .	-17.5065
Pietzschmann subsequently explained that each local authority must carry out the said preliminary investigations .	-4.6447
It is a question of assessing urban maladministration and deciding when it will be reconstructed and to what extent .	-4.3236
A refurbishment notice will be entered in the land book for the respective plot .	-5.7488
Pietzschmann would come back to reception and take a picture of the situation , she promised .	-4.0334
Gotzel stressed that a major success factor for the project is the participation of the participants .	-3.1980
That is why there will be questionnaires that will be postally sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled out until the end of the summer holidays .	-4.0777
The yellow questionnaire is the " arch of buildings and plots " , which includes the construction and rehabilitation intentions .	-4.9572
In the grey questionnaire , the " household and housing arch " , information can be given on the size , division and residents of a home .	-4.9594
The blue " operating arc " is only to be filled if business premises are operated in the building .	-4.4681
However , it should be noted that Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not a request for funding at the same time .	-3.6472
Moreover , new construction measures are not eligible .	-2.5202
Schindler also stressed that the distribution of funds works according to the " greyhound principle " - who comes first grinds first .	-4.6137
You cannot " reserve " funds for later .	-4.0702
Finally , photographs of the project " Local Centre II " were shown to make the present a " tasty " restoration . to the .	-12.9186
British inventor sets himself a microchip to come to home and car with a hand movement	-4.0823
A British inventor is the first in the country equipped with a microchip to open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .	-3.7767
Steven Northam , 33 , had implanted the tiny chip between thumbs and pointing fingers and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company BioTeq .	-3.6470
He joined Dr. Geoff Watson , an advisory anaesthesist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester , Hants , to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards .	-3.0320
The technology resembles a cat and dog implanted microchip and takes only 30 seconds .	-2.1029
The company of Mr. Northam also wants to change the castles of houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip , all for an extra charge of $ 300 per castle .	-3.9714
The married father of one has now incorporated technology both at home and in his BMW Z4 technology that begins when his hand is on the drive .	-4.9098
The White House ’ s Advertising Cost Taxpayers Thousands	-2.5601
The White House ’ s decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South Lawn for an event highlighting American manufacturing last month costs taxpayers up to $ 24,000 according to the armed forces left to the TIME magazine .	-3.8814
The green and white Sikorsky VH-3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17 in the White House with American construction programs .	-3.3340
President Donald Trump , Vice-President Mike Pence , and senior White House officials took a tour of products from all 50 countries .	-2.5458
The helicopter manufactured in Connecticut was exhibited next to a yacht from Maine , a fire car from Wisconsin and a forklift truck from Mississippi .	-3.5103
The White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn , after the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One ( HMX-1 ) , the unit responsible for operating the helicopter .	-3.7668
" I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , " wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event of his superior , the deputy naval commander for aviation .	-3.6942
The news indicated that the helicopter arrived at the South Lawn on 17 July , at 7 o 'clock in the morning , until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 this evening .	-4.3695
The note adds that , if the departure from the White House was to be delayed , a second team would be needed for return flight due to the limitation of service hours .	-4.8458
The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event , while the unit security staff remained on the ground during the time .	-4.7113
The records made available by the TIME did not make it clear whether a second crew was required .	-3.8354
The Hatch Act prohibits federal staff from using state property for political purposes .	-2.1992
Records indicate that HMX-1 has asked whether the event could violate the destination .	-3.6420
" One question we asked was whether this was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case , " the commander wrote .	-2.9050
" Sounds as if you are closed , " the deputy commander replied .	-2.7844
The " Made in America " event was described by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act .	-2.6825
But official events also have political overtones .	-1.6642
At the event , the President gave an impetus to the reform of the health reform that took place in the Senate , and he promoted efforts to reduce government rules .	-4.9730
The use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon .	-2.5555
President are obliged to use them for the journey .	-2.2971
But requesting their use only for a photo OP is unusual .	-2.8910
Trump carried out an investigation in February , when the presidential aircraft did so against the background of his first campaign rally in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of reports complaining about the use of the presidential aircraft by his predecessor .	-4.0628
" The White House is enthusiastic about the show " Made in America " - which shows products from all 50 countries produced by American workers with American materials , " said the Deputy Press Secretary of the White House , Lindsay Walters .	-3.3353
HMX-1 crews often carry out training flights around Washington and South Lawn to remove US presidents in the White House with precise centimeter sets .	-3.7388
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , HMX-1 carried out 58 exercise landings in the White House .	-2.9115
The flight for the " Made in America " event counted on the training needs of the crew for the month , said a civil servant .	-3.3609
Helicopter units flew an additional 11 hours this day for " non-presidential support missions " .	-3.0748
The White House said that taxpayers did not take the burden of any of the other requisites presented at the event .	-2.5931
A spokesman from Sikorsky said that the company was not involved in issuing the helicopter on the South Lawn .	-2.9956
HMX-1 does not maintain budget records for presidential flights , and it is difficult to identify the exact cost of the event .	-3.5122
However , according to hourly rates of the US Department of Defence for the 2017 financial year , the DoD refund rate for the VH-3D is $ 24,380 per flight hour .	-12.4447
The unit records the aircraft ’ s flight time as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia .	-3.6245
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below this rate .	-2.4753
" Setting the cost of taxpayers on the basis of estimates for the refund rates is highly misleading , " said Walters .	-4.2699
" These estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual resources . "	-2.8808
According to a 2015 RAND study , the reimbursement rates for DoD do not include personnel costs , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and contract conclusion .	-3.5309
At that time , the former White House press spokesman , Sean Spicer , defended the use of the helicopter for the event .	-2.6224
" The idea is to present things that are made in America this week , " said Spicer .	-2.4057
" And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not thousands , are dependent on it .	-2.7740
And I think , like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly .	-2.2206
It is , of course , appropriate to highlight this . '	-2.2427
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter when he took his tour of the South Lawn for the event , but he placed himself in the driver seat of a fire brigade car .	-3.7014
In the White House , Trump spoke to Sikorsky representatives and joked with the media about his own fleet of corporate products .	-13.3808
" I know Sikorsky very well , " the President said , " I have three of them . "	-2.1985

How America Damages OMV	-2.1022
Really happy , Donald Trump did not work when he signed Wednesday evening under the law to tighten sanctions against Russia .	-3.6355

Narcos Season 3 Trailer : Without Pablo Escobar , the Cali Cartel is put into the center of Netflix ’ s hit series	-4.3956
Despite the second season of Narcos , which reveals Pablo Escobars Killer , the series of Netflix is far from over .	-2.9323
The seasons three and four were already confirmed by the streaming service , the first received their first trailer and showed the latest bad weights of the show .	-3.2178

Roll backwards : The City Acquires 46 kitchen aid	-4.6338
The city organizes the kita lunch table itself .	-3.0796
With firm contacts for the children and an assignment to the team .	-3.5502
The clock is turned back in the urban children ’ s places .	-3.9877
On September 1 , the city of Krefeld takes care of food in the urban children ’ s day-to-day facilities ( Kitas ) again in its own region .	-6.5808
For Sonja Pommeranz , Deputy Head of Youth Assistance , this is good news : ' We have all been very pleased ' .	-3.4616
Cooking is still outside the house : a caterer takes over this task and delivers freshly cooled cooking .	-4.6737
The town operates 46 children ’ s places in Krefelder region , in 44 children receive a warm meal at lunch time . .	-20.0122
In the last kita-year , 2,800 children each sat at the tables , and needs are growing steadily .	-4.5397
" Meanwhile , not only children who are cared for 45 hours a day , in the kita at lunch , " explains Pommeranz .	-4.8833
" The offer also applies in 35 hours care if children stay until 14 o 'clock . "	-4.2051
46 part-time forces will have kitchen service from 1 September : They will heat the dishes delivered , complement them with salad , raw food and fruit , portion the meal individually , spend the meal , clean up , rinse and clean the kitchen .	-5.8986

It is also about healthy diet and cooking lessons .	-2.7909
" The children should help prepare the food " .	-2.7473
The direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is useful .	-3.0878
For children too .	-2.2107
" They have a known power in the kita , a person who is familiar with them , and not constantly changing people " .	-15.5497
This continuity is important for children .	-1.3921
The cleaning of the kita-rooms - so far also the task of the kitchen forces - will be done by special cleaning staff .	-4.7278
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has , in addition to improving the quality of the kitchen performance , the charm that it has proved to be the most economical in the cost comparison between its own regime and its foreign allocation to the city .	-7.2587
And that , although 46 part-time forces are re-employed .	-3.1902
" But these hours do not fall so much in the weight of around 750 people in the educational sector , " says Sonja Pommeranz .	-4.4161

GMB concern about investment in the McVite factory in Glasgow	-1.8483
A trade union wants to assure itself of the managers of the biscuit manufacturer McVite about the long-term commitment to production at its factory in Glasgow .	-14.3472
GMB Scotland said that the company was silent about the future of investment at the Tollcross site .	-2.6828
More than 500 employees work at the factory , which produces hobnobs and rich tea biscuits alongside other products .	-12.5221
McVities owner Pladis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .	-2.5082
He added that employees and trade union representatives would " learn first " if their activities changed .	-2.9027
In a letter to the company ’ s branch manager , GMB Scotland McVite ’ s called on “ to express concerns that funding for the modernisation of production lines would not be pushed forward ” .	-4.9789
GMB senior organizer Drew Duffy , said : " The fact that we cannot gain clarity from the General Site Manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross is deeply concerned by our members .	-3.5814
Generations of families have worked here and workers are focusing heavily on the local community and the Glasgow area , an important pillar of decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage .	-3.6529
Therefore , from the perspective of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the background of Brexit , rising costs of living and the chronic decline in production , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a prosperous production presence at McVitie .

Interview : " Domspatzen report relieves Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger "	-2.2851
The Regensburg Cathedral Report on cases of abuse relieves Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger .	-2.9459
This means author and historian Michael Hesemann .	-1.7099
The final report on the abuse scandal in the cathedral of Regensburg continues to provide for discussion .	-3.6824
Christian Weisnder , spokesperson of the Reform Movement " We are Church " , declared after publication to the German Press Agency , he expected the former Regensburg bishop and today 's Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller and the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger , the 93-year-old brother of the emerited Pope Benedict XVI , an excuse .	-4.8446
It would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret at their own omissions or their false assessment of what happened at the time .	-4.4084
The Vatican Newspaper " Osservatore Romano " , on the other hand , criticized the measurement of " double standards " in the reporting on violence in the cathedral pats .	-5.0260
With regard to the attacks in Regensburg , nobody doubts that they are " shameful and shameful acts " that should be punished and prevented in future ; but the " degree of media manipulation " , according to the author Lucetta Scaraffia , historian and member of the national Italian Bioethics Committee is strito be . in to the of to in to the of the of .	-21.9416
" The habit of describing the Catholic Church as a source of all evils is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to consider it normal , " says Scaraffia .	-3.7714
Prince Gloria von Thurn and Taxis also mentioned in the interview with the Bavarian broadcasting : " You like to go to the church and this is a found eating " .	-4.6891
She also pointed out that in her youth ' strikes were a normal educational tool ' to deal with cheerful children , as I was one , ' .	-5.0981
It would find it unfair to apply today 's standards to previous decades , because the world has changed .	-2.7581
In connection with the reports on abuse cases , Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared .	-3.6190
Author and historian Michael Hesemann , who wrote with ratzinger the memory band " My brother of the Pope " ( translated into 12 languages ) .	-4.2535
" I must take Georg Ratzinger into protection , " says Hesemann , " because all this had nothing to do with him , " he values the results of the final report .	-3.9142
What exactly is the 440-page report submitted by the lawyer Ulrich Weber , who is responsible for the Enlightenment by the Bistum Regensburg ?	-4.5399
A total of 547 Regensburg cathedrals were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s " with high plausibility " victims of attacks , 67 cathedrals .	-3.8962
In the final report , Georg Ratzinger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 , says : " In summary , it can be noted that in many cases , Domkapellmeister R. used forms of physical and mental violence .	-5.1772
Especially with high emotionality , punishment for students could be more severe .	-4.5451
Nevertheless , unlike many other suspects , it is noticeable that many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and thus , in many cases , even connect positive memories with him despite violence . "	-13.6108
In the interview , Hesemann explains why the final report relieves the abuse scandal of the Regensburg Cathedral Pats Georg Ratzinger .	-4.2022
Mr Hesemann , the 440-page report on the ' incidents of violence on protective orders at the Regensburg Cathedral Pats ' gives a contradictory picture of the master of domain Georg Ratzinger .	-5.7334
On the one hand , many students highlight his " humanity " .	-2.4436
On the other hand , he also appears as a cholerist and perfectionist , who often became handy when a cathedral musically did not bring top performance .	-4.9530
How do you consider this final report as his biographer ?	-2.4448
Michael Hesemann : If you take the trouble and read the 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger appears in it .	-5.7038
Eight sides are devoted to him and he is clearly released from any suspicion of complicity or co-science in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .	-4.6946
The pre-school violence excesses also occurred outside its sphere of action .	-3.6329
One can accuse him of learning too late or not taking the first suggestions seriously enough .	-17.6099
The Cathedral Gymnasium , on which he worked , was felt by virtually all respondents as " redemption " , " sky " and " better world " . to the " " " " . " " " " " " " " " " is " " " . " to " "	-9.8547
Thus , the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger exhibits an excellent testimony , describes him as " warm " , " sincere " , " competent " and " understanding " , as an extremely good teacher who regularly supplied the guys with cakes , biscuits and bonbons and " always surrounded by grapes of children " .	-5.7719
Only a minority complains about its perfectionism and high emotionality , which has led to anger .	-3.4978
He admitted , deeply regretted and apologized for the fact that he did not only buckle with chairs and threw the key bundle on the ground , but also distributed earfigs and pulled too harsh guys to the hair or ears .	-8.2366
However , to save his honour , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the time in question , the 1960s and 1970s , both among parents and teachers .	-5.2570
Do you know such breeding methods ?	-3.1532
Of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 .	-2.0216
I , too , have seen this in a secular school , a state school .	-12.4909
However , compared to what is actually at stake in this report , namely the appalling sexual abuse and the pre-school violence processes , these are excesses .	-5.0339
The question is whether it is more likely to deal with his fame and role as a brother of Benedict XVI that many media have just fallen on him .	-6.0005
Many people who have never understood him are still eagerly working on the Bavarian Pope .	-3.7471
But the truth is that the report discharges Georg Ratzinger in every respect .	-2.9258
A great deal has been reported in the media in connection with the report on the issue of abuse in the cathedral of Regensburg .	-4.4852
Does Georg Ratzinger , in the final report , also put any involvement or co-science at the expense of sexual abuse ?	-4.3753
Michael Hesemann : No .	-2.0607
Not one of the 67 victims of sexual attacks claims to have entrusted to the Domkapellmeister .	-2.8786
Not even parents were inaugurated .	-11.1149
" I have never dared to speak to my father or mother about it , " said a person affected deputising for the others , " I was all very embarrassing " .	-5.4877
The real problem with the education of sexual abuse was , and still is , that most victims remain silent .	-3.1574
If they did not even entrust themselves to parents and brothers , then certainly not a choir leader who would have been a colleague of perpetrators in a certain way . to the of to the . to to the of to . to to to	-15.8959
How do the cathedral students of Ratzinger assess the role of abuse ?	-4.2734
Michael Hesemann : An interviewed student put it : " I see ... no case in which he ( Georg Ratzinger ) would have had timely findings and could have stopped the perpetrator .	-5.4967
I think it is also really absurd to assume that it is exactly him ... Jobs have opened more insistently or clearly or even more openly than towards their parents , boarding schools , trust teachers , etc .	-6.7469
That one speaks to him about sex ... - unthinkable . " .	-3.2687
The report thus comes to the very clear result : ' The fact that students and / or their environment were entrusted to him in the run-up to the investigation could not be confirmed ' .	-18.6813
As far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg Ratzinger must therefore be free from any scientific partici.	-3.8705
He cannot be accused of not preventing or displaying it .	-4.2545
There is therefore no reason to associate his good name with these repugnant crimes , as unfortunately happened in some cases .	-3.7963
In the media there was much to read about " excesses of violence " at the Regensburg Cathedral .	-4.3267
The former master of the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused in the report " Wegschauen " .	-4.6467
Do he have to live with this accusation ?	-2.2235
Michael Hesemann : This is the big problem that in the reporting everything has been mixed and mixed up to a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence excesses and somewhere , in the middle of Georg Ratzinger .	-4.6136
But that is precisely what the report abuses .	-12.0410
After all , it is clearly separated : between the pre-school and the school of cathedral pats , between sexual abuse and violence excesses and , let us say , other accusations .	-5.4286
In addition , the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945 , including four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choir leader of the cathedral patches .	-4.9091
All the terrible caning education , the cases in which boys were harassed and painted by sadistic teachers and suffered appallingly , all occurred at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen , where really scandalous conditions must have prevailed .	-5.2524
But Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with them , because he only got the boys face when they were already at the Cathedral Gymnasium .	-4.9506
On that , as most witnesses emphasize , the subject of " pre-school " was taboo .	-3.9080
One was only happy to have escaped her and enjoyed so much better treatment and for many even " paradise " states .	-3.3612
What was different at the Cathedral Gymnasium ?	-2.3553
Michael Hesemann : There was already discipline , but no sadistic violence .	-3.3370
This also applies to Georg Ratzinger , where the report concludes that ' many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore , in many cases , even connect positive memories with him ' .	-4.4781
At most , the accusation of looking away remains .	-4.5843
Despite all the efforts , however , the report has only been able to define two periods in which it has been reported on pre-school conditions .	-4.5952
The first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish himself and did not want to hear anything from the processes at a school at which he was not acting and responsible ( so the witness ) , and then again in 1993 .	-5.9261
Did Georg Ratzinger consistently close the ears before the states ?	-3.1165
Michael Hesemann : No , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Cathedral Gymnasium , which the report even reproduces .	-3.0005
In this he points out to them that ' the caning penalty will continue to be practised in pre-school ' .	-5.2555
Even in the face of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent intervention . to the of to . to to the . to the to the	-13.2356
This was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed , when caning was banned even in Bavaria long ago .	-3.9705
Before that , they occurred in a legal grey area , as we all know .	-3.1521
It was also difficult for him to estimate where the people affected were perhaps exaggerated or dramatized and where the permissible border had really been exceeded .	-5.3453
However , one cannot say that he has always looked away .	-12.4106
That is simply not true .	-1.2452
Only in 1980 was the official abolition of caning at schools in Bavaria .	-2.9300
Prince Gloria von Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today 's educational standards to the time .	-15.2863
How do you see this ?	-1.3623
Michael Hesemann : We historians are talking about the " trapping of anachronism " , i.e. the danger of assessing the past according to moral standards today .	-4.2995
The Prince is right .	-11.1136
But this does not apply , of course , to sexual abuse , which was abhorrent at all times , nor to what was broken down in the pre-school of revulsion and violence against innocent children ’ s souls , that goes far beyond the usual ones at that time .	-6.9361
That is all very terrible and I am glad that it is finally being processed .	-3.1645
At the same time , however , I must protect Georg Ratzinger , because all of this had nothing to do with him .	-3.7555
His means of disciplining and punishing , that is to say , earfigs and the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .	-4.1175
When physical punishment was then banned , he also kept strictly to it .	-4.1718
What image of his Regensburg period has Georg Ratzinger reproduced in the discussions with you for the book " My Brother of the Pope " ?	-11.4824
Did the topic of caning also be discussed ? to a on the .	-18.4611
Michael Hesemann : Well , the book deals with the life of his brother Joseph , i.e. Pope Benedict ’ s XVI , tells from his perspective , since the cathedral played only a side role .	-4.7173
Nevertheless , I do not conceal the fact that he had a strict regime there .	-3.8961
But this must also be said : without this perfectionism , without the requirement of unconditional discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world rank from the rather nationally known Regensburg cathedral pats , true cultural ambassadors of Europe and its musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the United States ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .	-6.6100
With biscuits and bonbons alone , you 're made up of resistant boys , no big singers and no success whatsoever , in whatever area , but always discipline , passion and self-overcoming .	-7.1998
What kind of person did you experience Georg Ratzinger in the talks on her book ?	-3.8262
Michael Hesemann : By working on the book and beyond , I have really met Georg Ratzinger very well and have repeatedly seen him as wonderful , humorous , fundamental , deep believers and heart-good people , who cannot imagine that he could suffer even one fly .	-6.4448
I regularly get to know how many former cathedral pats still today , 23 years after his emergence , regularly contact him , visit him , read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family .	-5.0180
Those who still do not forgive him that he was strict with them are clearly in the minority .	-3.9078
Most cathedral pats are grateful to him today for enriching their lives and bringing them close to the world of music .	-4.0076
And that he was always a good , paternal teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but he was also a loving respect person to whom they are still looking and worshipping today .	-5.6981
Please , once again , please make it quite clear that everything that he is accused of is educational methods that were on the agenda at that time .	-5.7329
We can be glad that we have long overcome this time .	-2.2083
But it is extremely unfair to make a man simply because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make a media scapegoat .	-3.5991
The evil intention behind it is all too obvious .	-2.8412
The report that has just been published relieves it .	-2.5758
Now the decency would be demanding that a 93-year-old man who has acquired great merit and would not know the Regensburg Cathedral Patches at last without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps even Germany .	-22.2038
