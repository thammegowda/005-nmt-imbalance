“ A doubling of spending on AI research would be a good start , given that all other countries are well behind the US , and a breakthrough in AI research is about to come , ” said Lee .	-4.0647
Doubling funding could double the chances of achieving the next achievement in the field of artificial intelligence in the US , said Lee CNBC in an interview this week .	-3.0060

Macedonia is voting in a referendum on whether the name of the country is to be changed to change Macto a referend.	-6.3694
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change their name to ' Republic of North Macedonia ' , a step that would resolve a decade-long dispute with Greece that blocked its accession offers for the European Union and NATO .	-3.7437
Greece , which has a province called Macedonia , insists that the name of its northern neighbour is a territorial claim to the Greek territory , and has vetoed the country 's entry into NATO and the EU .	-3.0850
The two governments concluded an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name , but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slav majority population of Macedonia .	-2.4937
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he will not vote in the referendum , and , given a boycott campaign , there is doubt as to whether the result will create the 50 % hurdle , which is a prerequisite for the validity of the referendum .	-3.8434
The question on the voting paper on the referendum was : ' Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with the adoption of the agreement with Greece ? '	-2.5481
Advocates of the name change , including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev , argue that it is worth the price to continue accession to institutions such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia , one of the countries to emerge from the collapse of Yugoslavia .	-3.4207
“ I came today to vote on the country ’ s future ; it is a decision for the young people of Macedonia to live freely under the umbrella of the European Union , because that means a life in greater security for all of us , ” said Olivera Georgievska , 79 , in Skopje .	-4.1637

Macedonia ’ s Prime Minister Zoran Zaev , his wife Zorica and his son , Dushko , have voted in favour of the referendum in Macedonia on the change in the name of the country , which would pave him the way for accession to NATO and the European Union to Strumica , Macedonia , on 30 September 2018 .	-14.9808
Before Parliament in Skopje , Vladimir Kavardarkov , 54 , prepared a small stage and put chairs in front of the tents set up by those who will boycott the referendum .	-3.0129

Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will bring urgently needed investment to Macedonia , a country with an unemployment rate of more than 20 % .	-2.2171
“ I believe that a large majority will vote in favour , because more than 80 % of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO , ” said Zaev after his vote .	-3.3105
According to him , the result “ Yes ” would be a “ strengthening of our future . ”	-3.0639
Last Monday , the Macedonian Institute of Political Research published the results of a poll : between 30 and 43 % of voters would therefore participate in the vote – less than necessary .	-2.6659

Of those who wish to participate , 70 % indicated that they voted ‘ yes ’ .	-3.6789
The referendum will only be adopted if voter turnout is more than 50 % .	-18.4575

Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling completed Brighton ’ s defense at the Manchester City 2-0 victory on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester , England .	-2.9068
Aguero made his hit look incredibly simple in the 65th minute .	-2.7421
At the beginning of the game sequence , the Argentine stormer received a passport in the middle field .	-2.7492
He tricked out three Brighton defenders to free himself .	-3.7201
Then Agüero looked surrounded by three green shirts .	-1.9412
He circumvented a defender before he ran several players on the edge of the Brighton punishment .	-3.6178
Then he made a pass to the left and left to Sterling .	-3.0420
The English stormer used his first contact to return the ball to Agüero , who then shot with the right – past Brighton Torwart Mathew Ryan to the right side of the gate .	-4.5214
“ Aguero has foot problems , ” said City Manager Pep Guardiola the reporters .	-2.2203
" We spoke about it ; he played 55.60 minutes .	-2.8292

The Labour Party is no longer a wide community .	-1.6896
It is intolerant of those who say what they think .	-1.1161
As momentum activists in my local party voted for criticising me , it was hardly a surprise .	-2.3344

Most of my time in the eight years as a local Labour MEP was the same as the GC meetings on Friday evening .	-3.1793
Unfortunately , it is not the tone of many meetings today , and the promise of a ' more friendly , gentle ' policy is long forgotten if it has ever started .	-3.9773
It has become increasingly clear that differences of opinion in the Labour Party are not tolerated , and every opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to party leadership .	-3.5721
This began shortly after Jeremy took office , because the colleagues with whom I had thought I had a similar political attitude expected me to turn back and take positions that I would never have agreed with , whether in terms of national security or the EU internal market .	-5.9764
Whenever I speak out publicly – and it does not matter what I say – there is a tirade of abuse in the social media that calls for vote , denounces the policy of the Centre and tells me that I should not be in the Labour Party .	-4.4276
This experience has not only been made .	-3.5748
Indeed , I know that there is more luck than some of my colleagues , because the comments that are addressed to me tend to be political .	-3.5161
I appreciate the professionalism and determination of my colleagues , who are exposed to a flood of sexist or racist abuse every day , but never shy away .	-3.5124

The reality is that we are no longer the broad church and , with every motion of censure or change in the selection rules , the party will be smaller .	-4.1177
I have received a lot of advice over the past two years to collect my neck , not to be so vocal , and then I would be ‘ fine ’ .	-4.4125
But that is why I did not come to politics .	-2.7405
Thirty-two years ago , I joined as a student , because of the neglect of the Thatcher Government , Labour , which led to my classroom collapsing literally , and as a result I tried to work for better public services for those who need it most , whether as a municipal council or minister .	-5.6880

Two late Tries may have distorted the final result somewhat , but there is no doubt that Ayr deserves to win in this wonderfully entertaining Tennent 's Premiership Match of the .	-3.1534
They are now the only unsuccessful of the ten teams to give the table .	-4.4180
In the end , it was due to the superior defense of the host , but also to the fact that opportunities were better exploited .	-5.6074

Robyn Christie von Melrose said : “ Thanks to Ayr , they have made better use of their opportunities . ”	-13.4136
Grant Anderson ’ s attempt in the 14th minute , transformed by Frazier Climo , brought Ayr forward , but a yellow card for Scotland ’ s captain Rory Hughes , who was given for the game of Warriors , allowed Melrose to speak numbers , and Jason Baggot a non-transformed attempt to make it a .	-5.4730
Climo extended the leadership of Ayr with a punishment before he reached a hit directly at the mid-term , and then made a solo trial to succeed in the 17-5 break for Ayr .	-7.1555
But Melrose began the second half well , and Patrick Anderson 's attempt , transformed by Baggot , reduced the backlog to five points .	-19.3573
There was a longer interruption due to the serious injury of Ruaridh Knott , who left the playing field on a carry .	-5.0278
Ayr 's current captain Blair Macpherson then got the yellow card , and again Melrose paid the additional man with an unconverted Bruce Colvine attempt , at the end of a curse of fierce pressure .	-3.8606

These hopes may have been at their peak for decades , as Bolivia is waiting for a judgment from the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of discussion .	-3.8376

“ We are about to regain access to the Pacific Ocean , ” he praised at the end of August .	-2.5095
However , some analysts find it unlikely that the court will decide in favour of Bolivia , and believe that even a positive decision for Bolivia will not bring about any change .	-3.4513
The Dutch UN institution has no authority to grant Chilean territory and has established that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks .	-3.2890

Thom Browne showed a number of bizarre masks - and just in time for Halloween .	-1.8251

Independent schools in Scotland have a success balance of academic top quality , which continued in 2018 with excellent examination results , including individual and group successes in sport , art , music and other joint enterprises .	-5.4541
With over 30,000 students across Scotland , these schools , represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools ( SCIS ) , aim to offer their students and parents the best service level .	-3.2413
Independent schools are aimed at preparing pupils – for further education , including at universities , for their desired career and for their role as world citizens .	-19.5519
In the educational sector , we have the opportunity to develop and implement a tailor-made school curriculum , while noting that modern languages are still popular and desirable in schools .	-4.0521

The examination results this year show that languages are at the top of the tables with the highest existing quotas in independent schools .	-3.2875
68 percent of the students who have studied foreign languages have reached the so-called “ higher grade A ” class A .	-3.4298
The data collected by the 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 % of students reached a “ higher grade A ” in Mandarin , while among the students who learned German , French and Spanish , 72 , 69 and 63 each reached note A .	-4.3478
This shows that independent schools in Scotland promote foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future .	-2.2697
Language subjects have the same rank in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere as MINT subjects ( mathematics , information technology , science and technology ) .	-3.1273
A 2014 survey by the British Commission on Employment and Qualifications showed that 17 % of the reasons why employers had difficulty occupying vacancies are attributable to a lack of language skills .	-3.8822
That is why language skills are becoming increasingly necessary to prepare young people for their professional future .	-13.3891
Given the more prospective employment opportunities that languages require , these skills are essential in a globalised world .	-3.1473
Regardless of the career that someone chooses when he has learned a second language , he has a real advantage in the future with a lifelong ability like this .	-3.5436
Through the possibility of communicating directly with people from abroad , a multilingual person will automatically be ahead of the competitors .	-3.3063
According to a YouGov survey with more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013 , 75 % were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation , and French is the only language spoken with a two-digit percentage , namely 15 % .	-3.4643
That is why the current investment in language teaching is important for today 's children .	-2.7714
When children learn to speak several languages – especially those of developing countries – they later have better chances of finding meaningful employment in the labour market .	-3.0957
Schools in Scotland differ in terms of their language offerings .	-14.9122
Some schools focus on classical modern languages , while other languages that are most important for Britain in terms of 2020 , such as Mandarin or Japanese .	-3.0870
Whatever your child is interested , there will always be a number of languages available in independent schools , with teachers specialized in this field .	-3.4125
Independent schools in Scotland want to provide a learning environment that is well prepared for children , and they should be given the necessary equipment for their success , whatever the future may bring .	-4.7583
In today ’ s global business world , languages are undeniably still important for the country ’ s future , and this must also be reflected in education .	-3.6396
Indeed , modern languages should really be viewed as “ international communication skills . ”	-2.2927
Independent schools will continue to offer young people in Scotland this selection , diversity , and top quality .	-11.9591

LeBron ’ s Sunday debut in San Diego	-1.5778
Soon it is so far , and the fans can fire LeBron James at his first game for the Los Angeles Lakers .	-3.8706
Lakers-Trainer Luke Walton announced that James will play against the Denver Nuggets in the opening season in San Diego on Sunday .	-3.0381
But how many minutes it will spend in the place is not yet decided .	-3.2889
Walton said on the official website of the Lakers : " It will be more than one and less than 48 " .	-2.2910
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will probably play limited minutes .	-2.1339
After training at the beginning of this week , James was asked for his plans for the six pre-season games of the Lakers .	-3.3195
“ I do not need pre-season games at this stage of my career to prepare me , ” he said .	-2.3438
Trump ’ s Rally in West Virginia , YouTube Channel	-1.2390
President Donald Trump begins this evening in Wheeling , West Virginia , with a flood of campaign events .	-2.1662
It is the first of five planned electoral events next week , and on his tour Trump is also visiting the Republican-friendly states of Tennessee and Mississito .	-25.7674
While his candidate ’ s confirmation is still outstanding for the vacant Supreme Court , Trump must mobilize his electorate for the forthcoming midterm elections , otherwise there is a fear that Republicans will lose the majority in Congress when elected in November .	-5.0421
When is Trump ’ s West Virginia Rally tonight and how can you look at it online ?	-2.4846
Trump 's rally in Wheeling , West Virginia , is scheduled for 7 p.m. tonight , Saturday , September 29 , 2018 .	-2.6479
You can watch Trump ’ s West Virginia Rally online by live stream on YouTube .	-2.1077
Trump will certainly refer to the hearings this week about accusations of sexual abuse against his Supreme Court candidate , Board Kavanaugh , who has been postponed until the end of FBI investigations by at least a week .	-4.7320
The main objective of these electoral events , however , is to mobilize the Republicans who are about to vote in November .	-4.1725
According to Reuters , the aim of Trump ’ s campaign is to mobilize volunteers and supporters with the five election events next week to defend and expand the majority of Republicans in the Senate and House of Representatives .	-2.8297
“ The majority in Congress is primarily on the president ’ s agenda , which is why he is visiting as many states as possible shortly before the start of the turbulent election season , ” said Reuters , a spokesman of the Trump campaign , who does not want to be named .	-5.2163
According to the West Virginia MetroNews radio network , tonight ’ s Wesbanco Arena election event in Wheeling could attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract the attention of the Pittsburgh media .	-3.8868
On Saturday , Trump West Virgina , the state he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016 , will visit for the second time this month .	-2.5745
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the Senate of West Virginia , Patrick Morrisey , lagging behind in surveys .	-2.4649
According to Reuters , Simon Haeder , politologist at the University of West Virginia , said that it was not a good sign for Morrisey that the president had to come to improve his survey values .	-3.7248
Ryder Cup 2018 : The US team is ready to fight to maintain the hope of Sunday ’ s singles	-15.0538
After three unilateral encounters , the four games on Saturday afternoon were probably exactly what the Ryder Cup needed .	-2.4629
The vibrating pendulum is a freely invented sports concept that players have internalized , especially in competitions like this .	-3.2755
So where would they say is the dynamic now ?	-2.3320
“ They had a six-point lead , and now there are four , so it gives us a bit of momentum , ” Jordan Spieth said when he withdrew for the day . ”	-3.9966
Europe is , of course , in the advantage of 4 points , and twelve more are still to be played .	-3.9928
However , as Spieth says , Americans feel a little wind in their sails , and there was much encouraging for them , not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas , who have played together all day and each have three out of four points .	-4.3181
Spieth was superior from the beginning and went on with a good example .	-3.5831
These cheerful screams became louder when his round continued , he sunk a decisive putt to reach a draw in game 4 after he and Thomas scored 2 points after 2 games .	-4.9971
His joy at the putt on the 15th hole with which she won the game was so that one thought he still believed in the victory of the Americans .	-24.3938
" You really have to focus on you and only worry about your own game , " said Spieth .	-4.0226
This is all that remains for each of these players .	-3.3708
18 holes to leave impression .	-1.7899
In the last two days , Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood have been the only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas .	-2.8348
Europe ’ s strange but admirable couple plays faultlessly and is just doing everything right .	-3.8551
" Moliwood " was the only couple that did not reach a bogey on Saturday afternoon , but they also avoided them on Saturday morning , Friday afternoon and on Friday morning the back nine .	-3.6586
This race and the way their energy seems to flow from and from this missed crowd of spectators , makes them the favorites on Sunday and if the sun goes down over Le Golf National , there would be no more popular player sealing a possible European victory than Fleetwood or Molinari .	-23.9400
Probably both at the same time on different holes .	-2.1894
To talk about a European victory now would be too hasty .	-2.8037
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short trial with Sergio Garcia , who was victorious with his partner Alex Noren in the morning .	-2.8846
With a bogey and two doubles on the first nine , the Spaniard and the Swede died in a hole from which they never came out again .	-3.8231
But on Sunday there is nobody who helps you out of your hole .	-3.1943
Because of the interactions between the couples , the given advice , the non-given advice and the way a strategy can change in the hand , it is very fascinating to observe fourballs and foursomes close by .	-5.3013
Europe , as a team , has played better and taken a clear lead in the last day , but this Foursome session has also shown that the US team has the desire to fight what some , particularly statesides , have doubted .	-15.3143
Europe leads 10-6 on the Ryder Cup Final Day	-2.3647
Europe will take advantage of a solid advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after it emerged from the four-and-four games on Saturday with a 10-6 leadership over the United States .	-4.4336
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the group with two victories over a fighting tiger woods to bring its previous balance sheet to four points in the Le Golf National .	-3.5015
The European team of Thomas Bjorn , who took over the preservation of the trophy she had lost in Hazeltine two years ago , dominated an American team fighting with suspensions in the morning fourball , and won the series with 3-1 .	-4.8917
The US offered more resistance in the fours and won two games , but it could not digest the deficit .	-2.5762
The team of Jim Furyk needs eight points from the 12 individual games of Sunday to keep the trophy .	-2.8339
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four consecutive points , while he and Molinari , after a sensational weekend called " Molliwood " , are only the second pair that wins four points from their first four games in the history of the Ryder Cup .	-3.5679
After breaking Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs , it was considered certain that they would beat a sobered woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau by an even clearer 5 & 4 .	-4.8007
Woods , who dragged through two games on Saturday , occasionally showed brilliant actions , but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in four-balls and four-four and seven in a row .	-5.1768
Justin Rose , rested for the morning fourballs , returned to his partner Henrik Stenson to the Foursomes and beat in a 2 & 1 defeat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – one and three in the world .	-3.7232
On a pleasant , airy day southwest of Paris , however , Europe did not have it in its own way .	-2.3957
The three main winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the standard for Americans on Saturday with two points .	-3.3902
They won a courageous 2 : 1 victory against the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-pack and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 : 3 in the four-pack after they had lost the first two holes .	-3.4600
Only twice in Ryder Cup history a team returns from a four-point deficit to the singles , even though Halter Furyk 's site only needs a draw to keep the trophy .	-3.7729
After two days of second best time , however , a Sunday account looks like it would go beyond it .	-3.4383
North Korea says that there will be “ no ” one-sided disarmament without confidence . to the of ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ s ’ s ’ s	-12.0230
North Korea ’ s Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions would deepen its distrust of the United States , and that , under such circumstances , the country would not unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons .	-3.5157
Ri Yong Ho said to the annual General Assembly of the World Body that North Korea took " important goodwill measures " last year , such as the suspension of nuclear and missile tests , the dismantling of the nuclear test area and the commitment not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology .	-4.7516
" There is no response from the US , " he said .	-3.1250
“ Without any confidence in the US , there will be no confidence in our national security , and in such circumstances there is no possibility that we will first unilaterally disarm ourselves . ”	-3.3480
While Ri returned to the well-known North Korean complaints about Washington ’ s resistance to a “ gradual ” approach to denuclearization , in which North Korea was rewarded with gradual steps , his declaration seemed significant insofar as it did not completely reject unilateral denuclearization , as Pyongyang has done in the past .	-4.4660
Ri referred to a joint declaration by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a first summit between an incumbent US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June , when Kim undertook to work towards " denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula " , while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea 's security .	-3.7268
North Korea sought a formal end to the Korean war in 1950-53 , but the United States said that Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons .	-2.8399
Washington has also opposed the demands for relaxation of tough international sanctions against North Korea .	-12.9177
The US insists on " denuclearization-first " ( first denuclearization ) and increase pressure through sanctions to achieve its purpose in a mandatory way , and even reject the " declaration of the end of the war , " said Ri .	-4.4226
" The perception that sanctions can force us into the knees is a dream of people who are ignorant to us .	-3.0340
But the problem is that continued sanctions exacerbate our distrust . ”	-2.0488
Ri did not mention any plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump , which the US President highlighted at the United Nations at the beginning of the wee.	-3.1208
Instead , the Minister emphasized three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the last five months and added : ' If the party were to denuclearize South Korea and not the US , the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not be a dead end ' .	-4.4366
Nevertheless , the tone of Ri ’ s speech was dramatically different from last year when he reported it to the U.N. . The General Assembly , which targeted the US mainland with North Korea ’ s missiles , was inevitable after “ Mr. Evil President ” Trump Kim called a “ missile man ” on a suicide mission .	-4.2287
This year at the United Nations , Trump , who threatened last year to “ destroy North Korea completely , ” commended Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm , but he also said that much work had to be done , and sanctions must remain until North Korea destroyed denuclearization .	-3.9318
On Wednesday , Trump said that he did not have a time frame and said , " It does not matter whether it takes two years , three years or five months ' .	-3.6335
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken .	-1.9250
However , in the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the UN . Security Council on Thursday : ' Enforcing the Security Council sanctions must be pursued vigorously and without defects until we achieve full , definitive and verified denuclearization ' ' .	-13.7215
Since 2006 , the Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea in order to prevent the financing of Pyongyang ’ s nuclear and ballistic missile programs .	-14.3441
Pompeo met Ri on the outskirts of the UN General Assembly and then said that he would go back to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit .	-2.8301
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year , but his last journey was not good .	-2.2628
He left Pyongyang in July , saying that progress has been made , and that only a few hours after that , North Korea condemned him to “ pioneering demands . ”	-4.9581
North Korea promised at a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex when the United States takes ' appropriate measures ' .	-3.4378
He said that Kim told him that the ' appropriate measures ' he sought were security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore , and steps to normalize relations with Washington .	-3.0285
Harvard students take part in the course to find enough calm .	-2.4333
With a new course at Harvard University this year , all students get more sleep to fight against the growing macho culture of studying the caffein-made nights .	-4.6729
A scientist has found that students at a global leading university are often unsuspicious when it comes to helping themselves , even when it comes to very simple mechanisms .	-3.6299
Charles Czeisler , Professor of Sleep Medicine at the Harvard Medical School and specialist at the Brigham and Women 's Hospital , designed the course that he believes is the first of its kind in the US .	-3.5567
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the effects of sleep shortage on learning .	-3.0297
In the end a girl came to me and said : " Why is this only now , in my final year , being told to me ?	-4.2016
She said that she never told anyone about the meaning of sleep – which surprised me , " he said to Telegraph .	-3.7659
The course offered for the first time this year explains to students how good sleeping habits promote academic and sporting performance and improve their general well-being .	-3.5073
Paul Barreira , Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Managing Director of the University Health Service , said that the university decided to introduce the course after it found that students had slept extremely little during the week .	-3.8500
The 1-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks .	-2.2155
In one section there is a picture of a sleeping hall where students click on coffee cups , curtains , trainers and books to be informed about the effects of caffeine and light , and how sports performance affects the sleep shortage and the meaning of a sleeping time routine .	-5.2369
Another section explains to participants how long-term sleep withdrawal can increase the risk of heart attack , stroke , depression , and cancer .	-3.2437
A map of the campus with interactive symbols encourages participants to think about their everyday lives .	-2.2281
We know that it will not immediately change the behaviour of students .	-2.0215
" But we believe that they have a right - just as you have a right to know the health effects of the decision to smoke cigarettes , " added Prof. Czeisler .	-3.1492
The culture of pride still exists , he said and added that modern technology and the increasing pressure on students and sleep withdrawal make sleep a growing problem .	-3.9541
Having enough sleep of good quality should be the " secret weapon " of a student to combat stress , exhaustion and fear , he said - even not to increase because sleep withdrawal puts the brain into hunger mode and makes it constantly hungry .	-4.4486
Raymond So , a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology , helped Professor Czeisler design the course after visiting one of his classes last year in Harvard .	-3.2385
He said that the course had opened its eyes and inspired him to push for a campus-wide course .	-2.4223
The next step , he hopes , is to ask all doctoral students to complete a similar programme of studies before entering the Competition College .	-3.5592
Prof. Czeisler recommended that students put an alarm when they should go into bed and wake up , and be aware of the harmful effects of the " blue light " broadcast by electronic screens and LED lighting , which can bring their circadian rhythm out of step , leading to problems in sleeping .	-5.5979
Livingston 1-0 Rangers : Mengas Goal erupts Gerrards Men	-2.1049
Further Foreign Problems of Rangers : After a hit by Dolly Menga , the 1-to-0 defeat for the divided team of Steven Gerrard came in Livingston .	-5.0069
The Ibrox team wanted to record their first victory in St. Johnstone in February since the 4 : 1 triumph , but the team of Gary Holt added Gerrard ’ s second defeat in 18 games as a coach who left his team at eight points behind the disappointed Ladbrokes Premiership chief Hearts .	-5.3632
Menga landed a hit seven minutes before the mid-term and an inspirational Rangers setting did not look like it could bring about a balance . to the . of to the of .	-14.0650
While the Rangers are now falling back to sixth place , Livingston climb to three and are only behind Hibernian because of the Tordifference .	-5.2013
New difficulties for the rangers are emerging , as Calum Spence ’ s director had to provide a headwound after hitting a litter – apparently thrown away from the foreign fan sector .	-6.6214
Gerrard made eight changes to the side that passed Ayr and swept directly into the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup .	-3.5282
Holt , on the other hand , set up the same Livi Elf that decreased the Hearts last week , and he should have been enthusiastic about how his well-trained team did not leave the opponents room for action at any time .	-6.4247
The Rangers dominated the ball , but Livingston implemented better opportunities .	-13.8682
They should have met after just two minutes , when Menga ’ s first depositor sent Scott Pittman toward Allan McGregor ’ s Tor , but the middle field player passed his great change at the gate .	-5.9205
His defensive partner , Alan Lithgow , was able to shoot far in the direction of back posts .	-5.3453
The Rangers took control , but there seemed to be more hope than trauma in their own game , in the last third .	-3.6015
After the first quarter of an hour , Alfredo Morelos was clearly considered to have earned a penalty after he and Steven Lawless clashed , but referee Steven Thomson did not respond to the Colombian appeals .	-5.4323
The Rangers reach only two shots in the first half , but the former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was hardly from Lassana Coulibaly ’ s headjump and the hit of an unprecedented Ovie Ejaria .	-4.6799
Even though Livi ’ s opening matches may have been contrary to the 34th minute , no one can deny that they deserve it for their efforts alone .	-4.2442
Again , the Rangers failed to master a Jacobs standard situation .	-2.4475
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher Scott Robinson played the ball , keeping the calm and picking Menga for a simple finish .	-4.4250
Gerrard acted during the break when he exchanged Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the change immediately affected the game when the wing player played to Morelos , but the impressive Kelly ran from his line to block .	-3.8640
But Livingston repeatedly drew guests to play exactly the kind of game they like , with Lithgow and Halkett sweeping long balls after long balls .	-4.2422
Holt ’ s team could have expanded its leadership in the final phase , but McGregor stood up well to refuse Jacobs before Lithgow was passing the corner .	-4.8843
The Rangers representative , Glenn Middleton , had another delayed claim to a penalty because he had devastated himself with Jacobs , but again he looked away Thomson .	-5.2887
Almannach : The Inventor of the Geiger Counter	-2.8339
And now a page from our almanac “ Sunday morning ” : September 30 , 1882 , which was more than 136 years ago ... The day on which the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm , called Hans , violinist in Germany was born .	-3.7023
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity , an invention that eventually produced the device known as violin counter .	-3.8386
The violin teller has since become a mainstay of science , as in the 1950s of the film " Bells of Coronado " , which seemingly unlikely cowpoke scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans breathed :	-4.5430
Man : ' What about everything in the world is this ? '	-2.2354
Rogers : “ It is a violin counter that is used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium .	-12.4973
If you set up these headphones , you can actually hear the effects of atoms released by radioactivity in minerals . ”	-3.2387
Evans : “ Say , but now it cracks huge ! ”	-3.9291
Hans Geiger died in 1945 , just a few days before his 63rd birthday .	-1.4210
But the invention that bears its name continues to be used .	-2.0438

New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to " see " and kill malicious cells .	-2.0621
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of treatment	-10.9401
The procedure involves extracting immune cells from a patient , changing them in the laboratory	-2.5835
You can then see a protein that is common to many cancers and then inject again .	-3.5032
A study vaccine shows promising results in patients with a number of cancers .	-2.2255
A woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize rogue cells saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months .	-2.6068
The method is to extract immune cells from a patient , change them in the laboratory , so that a protein called HER2 becomes “ visible ” that occurs in many types of cancer , and then reinject the cells .	-3.6598
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda , Maryland , said : ' Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine ' .	-2.1870
HER2 “ promotes the growth of various types of cancer ” , including breast , ovarian , lung and intestinal cancer , explained Prof. Berzofsky .	-3.5526
A similar approach to taking patients from immune cells and teaching them how to attack cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a kind of leukaemia .	-3.0133
After his performance at Saturday Night Live , Kanye West , dressed with MAGA cap , left a pro-Trump tirade from the stack .	-3.4484
It Was Not Good	-2.7619
Kanye West was buried in the studio during a Saturday Night Live show after a gradual speech in which he praised the US . President Donald Trump said he will take in 2020 .	-5.2338
After listing his third song of the night , Ghost Town , while wearing a Make America Great cap , he instigated against the Democrats and reaffirmed his support for Trump .	-4.0153
" As often as I speak to a white person , she says , “ How can you like Trump , he is a racist ? ”	-2.8557
Well , if I were concerned about racism , I would have been out of America a long time ago , " he said .	-2.7070
The Saturday night live show began with a sketch where Hollywood star Matt Damon made fun of Brett Kavanaugh ’ s statement before the Senate ’ s Justice Committee on Christine Blasey Ford ’ s accusations that Kavanaugh needed them sexually .	-4.7013
Although it was not broadcast , the film material was divided by the comedian Chris Rock in the social media .	-3.5221
It is unclear whether Rock has tried to mock West with the post .	-2.6867
West , too , had complained to the audience that he had hard behind the stage , because of his head cover .	-4.3385
" They harassed me behind the stage .	-1.1836
You said : ' Do not go out with your hat ' .	-3.2268
You annoyed me !	-1.8154
And then they say that I am in a given place , " he said , according to the Washington Examiner .	-2.2927
West continued : " Do you want to see the sunken place ? " and said that he would attract " my superman cloak , because that means you cannot tell me what to do , you want the world to move forward ?	-5.4645
Try it with love . ”	-1.1082
His comments were received by the audience at least twice , and the comedians of Saturday Night Live seemed to be relocated , reported variety , and quoted a person with the words : “ The whole studio was deadly . ”	-18.6714
West was used as a substitute for the singer Ariana Grande , whose former friend , Rapper Mac Miller , died a few days ago .	-2.6217
West surprised many with a performance of the song " I Love it " , dressed as Perrier Bottle .	-2.6979
West received support from the leader of the conservative group TPUSA , Candace Turner , who tweeted : " This is for one of the bravest spirits : DANKE , THE MAFIA WIDERSETZT HAST . "	-3.9020
But talkmaster Karen Hunter tweeted that West is " what he is , and that is absolutely wonderful " .	-2.5626
“ But I will not reward anyone ( by bought his music or clothing or supporting his art ) , from whom I believe he accepts and disseminates an ideology that is harmful to my community . ”	-4.0012
It is free .	-0.7604
We also added it .	-2.0270
Before the show , the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and now called “ the being formally known as Kanye West ” .	-2.8361
He is not the first artist to change their name and enters the footsteps of Diddy , also known as Puff Daddy , Puffy and P Diddy .	-2.5385

" Game of Thrones " -Star Kit Harington Lives Toxic Male	-2.7753
Kit Harington is known for his sword-vibrating role as Jon Snow in the brachial medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones by HBO .	-2.8700
But the actor , 31 , has annoyed the stereotype of the Machohero and said that such roles on the canvas lead to small guys often feeling that they must be hard to be respected .	-3.8217

Kit , who recently married his co-star Rose Leslie , also 31 , admitted that he considered it very important to solve the problem .	-2.7750
I personally feel quite strong at the moment - what did we do wrong with masculinity ? , he said .	-3.3279
What have we taught men in their young people about the problem we are now seeing ?	-3.1113
Kit believes that television can partly be responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity by its very masculine characters .	-2.8313
He continues : What is innate and what is taught ?	-1.9956
What is taught on television and on the street gives the little boy the feeling that they have to have this particular side of man ?	-3.2915
I think that is really one of the big questions in our time – how can we change that ?	-3.5670
For young men obviously went wrong .	-2.7372

HIV / AIDS : China Reports 14 % increase in new cases	-1.9174
China has reported an increase of 14 % among fellow citizens living with HIV and AIDS .	-2.1849
According to the health authorities , 820,000 people are affected in the country .	-1.8492
In the second quarter of 2018 alone , 40,000 new cases were reported .	-1.4823
In the vast majority of new cases , the virus was transmitted by sex , this is a change to the past .	-3.9482
Usually , HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions .	-2.2414

Homosexuality has not been a crime in China since 1997 , but discrimination against LGBT people is widespread .	-1.8347

Maxine Waters denies that an employee has leaked the data of GOP senators , criticizes accusations as “ dangerous lies ” and “ conspiracy theories ”	-2.6065
On Saturday , US MEP Maxine Waters rejected claims that one of its employees should have published personal data from three Republican US senators on the Wikipedia pages of legislators .	-4.1360
The democrat based in Los Angeles is convinced that the claims of members of the ultra-left wing and websites have been launched .	-3.3019
“ Lies , lies and even more repugnant lies , ” Waters announced in a statement on Twitter .	-3.9603
According to reports published , US Senator Lindsey Graham ’ s private addresses and telephone numbers from South Carolina and US senators Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch , both from Utah , included private addresses and telephone numbers .	-4.1426
The information appeared online Thursday , posted by an unknown person on the Capitol Hill during a hearing of the Senate on accusations of sexual misconduct against the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh .	-3.1526
The data of the three senators were published shortly after the survey of Kavanaugh .	-2.3749
Conservative websites like Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identified the source of the jobs was associated with Waters ' office and published the information of an employee of Waters , Hill reports .	-15.8157
“ This unfounded accusation is completely wrong and an absolute lie , ” Waters continues .	-3.2494
“ The employee among my employees – whose identity , personal information , personal data and security were affected as a result of these fraudulent and false claims – was in no way responsible for leaking this information .	-4.2725
This untenable claim is completely wrong and an absolute lie .	-2.7743
Water ’ s declaration quickly led to criticism online , including the former press secretary of the White House Ari Fleischer .	-2.7466
“ The denial of the matter is extremely annoying , ” wrote meat .	-3.5626
" This suggests that she is unsuitable as a congressional member .	-3.1970
If someone is accused of having done something , he must not be evil .	-2.1602
They must not be awkward .	-3.0503
You must not question the motives of the plaintiff .	-2.3730
They must be calm and left ” .	-2.4355
Meat seemed to compare Water ’ s response to the Democrats ’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh , accused by critics of seeing too angry during the hearing on Thursday .	-3.8599
Omar Navarro , a Republican candidate who runs in the mid-term elections alongside the sittless waters , also expressed his thoughts on Twitter .	-4.3847

Review of " Johnny English – Only three times " – badly occupied parody with Rowan Atkinson	-3.0562
It is tradition to search for Brexit suggestions in every new movie with a British tendency , and this seems to be applicable to this revival of the Johnny English Action Comedy Spoof Franchise , which began in 2003 with Johnny English and was relaunched in 2011 with " Johnny English Reborn " .	-5.2933
Is the ironic self-satire about the abyss of humanity the new possibility of exporting the nation ?	-2.7883
In any case , Johnny English has been given the license for the second time to re-massage things , and his name to to show a great reach of a comic that was designed for novicvisiviin . to to the from to in . to the of to in to the . to to to the to	-24.3472
He is , of course , the stupid secret agent who , despite his bizarre demands on smoothy glamour , has received a little clouseau , a sprayer Mr. Bean and a clacket of this guy , contributing a single note to the guiding melody of the fire brigade cars at the 2012 Olympic Games opening ceremony in London .	-5.8483
It is also based on the traveller and international , mysterious Atkinson , who once participated in the forgotten Barclaycard TV advertisements , always leaving chaos behind .	-4.3673
There are one or two beautiful moments in this latest Johnny English comedy .	-1.7482
I loved Johnny English , who approaches a helicopter in a medieval armor and shortly beats the main rotor against his helmet .	-3.2863
Atkinson 's talent for body comedy is to be seen , but the humor feels rather weak and strange superfluous , especially since the " serious " film brands like 007 and mission Impossible self-confidently offer comedy as an ingredient .	-4.0824
Humor feels as if he is more directed at children than adults , and for me the crazy misfortunes of Johnny English are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson 's Mr. Bean silent films .	-4.0894
The everlasting premise is that Britain is in great difficulty .	-2.0549
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the highly secret British network of spies and revealed the identity of all British agents on the ground , to the horror of the service agent – a regrettably small role for Kevin Eldon .	-3.2492
Emma Thompson does her best with this Quasi-Teresa May figure , but there is not much in the script to work with .	-4.2123
Their intelligence advisers inform them that , as every single active spy has been compromised , they have to get someone out of retirement .	-3.6082
And that means that the fantastic Johnny English himself , who is now a school champion in a noble institution , but gives unsurpassed lessons about how to operate as an undercover agent : some nice gags here , while English offers a School of Rock Academy on espionage .	-5.2512
English is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunified with his former long-suffering cumple Bough , again played by Ben Miller .	-4.3319
Bough is now a married man who meets a submarine commander , an overwhelming , burschikosis role in which Vicki Pepperdine is not entirely valid .	-4.7992
So , the Batman and Robin of Chaos at the Secret Service of her Majesty are back in action and meet at Olga Kurylenkos beautiful Femme Fatale Ophelia Bulletova .	-3.0283
Meanwhile , the Prime Minister is dangerously becoming the spell of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain ’ s computer problems : the dark Jason Volta , played by Jake Lacy .	-4.0855
English and Bough begin their odyssey of colourful highjinks : as a waiter , they light a French Flash restaurant ; they create chaos by smuggling on board Voltas luxury yacht ; and English triggers pure anarchy when he tries to familiarise himself with a virtual reality headset with the interior of Voltas Haus .	-5.0467
All the registers have certainly been drawn for this last sequence , but as lovingly and forgotten as it is , the whole thing reminds us of child television .	-5.9434
Rather moderate .	-1.5944
And , as with the other Johnny English films , I could not help thinking : Can the British film industry Rowan Atkinson not give a role that really does justice to his talent ?	-4.3878
Labour denied to have developed a plan for Britain for a four-day week for which five days are paid .	-3.0981
Jeremy Corbyn ’ s Labour Party is examining a radical plan in which British work only four days a week , but paid for five .	-3.1429
According to reports , the party wants corporate leaders to pass on the savings achieved by the Artificial Intelligence Revolution ( AI ) to the workers by releasing them an additional day .	-3.9400
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend - but still bring the same money back home . .	-13.0028
Sources said that the idea would fit with the party 's economic agenda and plans to tip the country for the benefit of the workers .	-14.0997
The Trade Union Congress approved the changeover to a four-day week as an opportunity for workers to use the changing economy .	-3.9103
A high-level source from the Labour Party said the Sunday Times : a review of politics is expected to be announced before the end of the year .	-3.1115
A four-day week is an objective that is in line with the party ’ s approach to restoring economic balance in favour of workers and the Party ’ s general industrial strategy , but this objective will not be realised overnight .	-4.3011
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea , as the Green Party promised a four-day working week during its 2017 election campaign .	-2.3320
However , the whole Labour Party is not supporting this initiative .	-4.3709
A Labour spokesman said : ' A four-day week is not a party policy and is not intended by the party ' .	-2.7894
Treasury Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Party Conference last week to concrete his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy .	-3.0016

The plans of the Shadow Chancellor also mean that the current shareholders of the water companies may not receive their entire share , as a Labour government could make ' deductions ' because of alleged misconduct .	-4.8130

Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy speak in “ 60 minutes ” about whether FBI investigations against Kavanaugh might change their minds .	-8.7058
Due to an ongoing FBI investigation into accusations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh , the final vote on appeal to the Supreme Court of Justice has been postponed by at least a week , and the question is raised as to whether the FBI ’ s investigation results could lead Republican Senators to abandon their support for Kavanaugh .	-25.5981
In an interview conveyed on Sunday , Scott Pelley , a correspondent of “ 60 minutes , ” asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI ’ s investigation results could lead them to change their minds .	-4.3519
Kennedy appeared more open than his colleague from South Carolina .	-1.7467
“ In any case , ” Kennedy said .	-2.0298
" I said at the beginning of the hearing that I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh .	-2.1335
I called him after that happened after this claim came out , I said : ' Have you done it ? '	-3.6767
He was determined , targeted , unequivocal . '	-2.3028
Graham 's voice , however , seemed to be in stone .	-3.1753
" I have an opinion on board Kavanaugh and it would need a bomb charge , " he said .	-2.6404
“ Dr. Ford , I do not know what happened , but I know that Brett has vehemently disputed the accusation , ” Graham added with a reference to Christine Blasey Ford .	-3.8495

" What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it ensured that poverty is reduced ? "	-1.8198
This Saturday , the Global Citizen Festival takes place in New York , an annual music event with an impressive selection of stars and an equally impressive mission to end world poverty .	-3.1343
This year ’ s seventh Global Citizen Festival will bring together tens of thousands of people at the Great Lawn in Central Park to experience not only stars like Janet Jackson , Cardi B , and Shawn Mendes , but also to draw attention to the true goal of the event : to end extreme poverty by 2030 .	-3.9462
The Global Citizen Festival , which took place in 2012 , is an expansion of the Global Poverty Project , an international stakeholder aimed at fighting poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it .	-3.3608
In order to receive a free ticket for the event , concert visitors had a whole range of tasks or " actions " , such as voluntary work , an email to a guide in the world , a telephone or another meaningful way to increase the target of poverty reduction and raise awareness of it .	-5.2785
But how successful has Global Citizen been with 12 remaining years to achieve its goal ?	-2.3560
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert , a real way to persuade people to call for action , or simply another case of so-called " clicktivism " - people who feel that by signing an online petition or an online application or thus sending a tweet as if they were making a real difference ?	-4.1682
Global Citizen says that since 2011 , it has recorded more than 19 million “ actions ” from its supporters , who have pushed for a variety of targets .	-3.6067
It is said that these actions have motivated world leaders to make financial and political commitments worth more than $ 37 billion , which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030 .	-3.2829
At the beginning of 2018 , the Group led 390 missions and announcements from its actions , of which at least $ 10 billion have already been paid or funded .	-3.6110

The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions in the United Kingdom that depended on improving the nutrition of mothers and children , the government will reach the funding of the Power of Nutrition project 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions .	-4.2049
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on their website , “ Why do you think we can end extreme poverty ? ”	-2.6888
Global citizens replied : it will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will fall and fail .	-12.1921

US might build a “ blockade , ” with the Navy , to hamper Russian energy exports – Home Secretary	-17.1439
Washington can resort to his navy “ if necessary ” to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets , including in the Middle East , US Secretary of State Ryan Zinke is quoted by the Washington Examiner .	-3.2855
Zinke said that Russia ’ s commitment to Syria is an excuse for exploring new energy markets , especially when it comes to activities at the invitation of the legitimate government .	-3.9917
“ I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is more following : they want to negotiate energy , just as they do in Eastern Europe , the southern part of Europe , ” he said .	-2.8252
And , according to the officials , there are ways to deal with this .	-3.2178
" The United States has this capacity to ensure with our navy that maritime paths are open and , if necessary , block to ensure that their energy does not come on the market , " he said .	-4.8424
Zinke spoke to the participants of an event of the Consumer Energy Alliance , a non-profit organization that calls itself the “ voice of energy consumers ” in the US .	-3.2646
He compared Washington ’ s approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran , and noted that they are indeed the same .	-2.6249
" The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less to use and replace fuels , " he said , while he called Russia a " one-trick pony " with an economy dependent on fossil fuels .	-2.6882

U.S. President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to the paid supplement of China Daily in the Des Moines Register - the state with the best-selling newspaper of Iowa - after accusing China of interfering in the US Congress elections of 6 November , which China denies .	-4.2571
US officials claim to Reuters that Trump ’ s accusation of trying to interfere in US elections was a new phase in an escalating Washington campaign to put pressure on China .	-2.8928
While it is normal for foreign states to make advertisements to promote trade , Beijing and Washington are currently in an escalating trade war with several rounds of tariffs on imports .	-3.6801
At an early stage of trade war , China ’ s retaliation tariffs on Chinese and US professionals should hit exporters in US states like Iowa , where many supporters of Trump ’ s Republican Party live .	-3.8431
Terry Branstad , American Ambassador to China and former long-standing governor of Iowa , a significant exporter of agricultural products to China , said that Beijing injured American workers , farmers , and businesses .	-3.2073
China , wrote Branstad in an article of opinion in the Des Moines Register on Sunday , “ now pursues this harassment strongly through propaganda advertising in our own free press .	-13.0911
“ By disseminating propaganda as a paid ad in the Des Moines register , China ’ s government takes advantage of the estimated American tradition of freedom of expression and press , ” Branstad wrote .	-3.4599

Desert Island Discs : Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality .	-1.9515
The Olympic diver Tom Daley says that he has grown up with the feeling of being undermined by everyone because of his sexuality - but that gave him the motivation to become a success .	-4.6689
The 24-year-old said that he had only become aware at secondary school that “ not everyone is as I am . ”	-3.4510
In the first edition of Desert Island Discs at Radio 4 , Lauren Laverne said he publicly talked about the rights of homosexuals to give other “ hope . ”	-3.4420
He also said that a victory at the Olympic Games after the birth of his first child would have become less important for him .	-3.0420
The regular presenter of the long-running show , Kristy Young , has freed himself for several months due to a disease .	-3.4424
Daley appeared in Laverne ’ s first program , saying that he felt “ less worth ” than the others , because “ it was not accepted by society to stand on men and women . ”	-3.7620
He said , “ To date , these feelings of less value and difference have given me the strength and strength I needed to succeed . ”	-3.3934
He wanted to prove that he was “ something , ” he said , in order not to disappoint anyone when he led his sexual orientation .	-3.8187
The two-time bronze medal winner has become a top-class LGBT activist and used his presence at this year 's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality .	-3.8671
He said he was pronounced because he was lucky to be able to live openly and without consequences , and because he wanted to give other ' hope ' .	-13.7939
The Triple World Champion said that he fallen in love with a man , the US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black , whom he met in 2013 , and he was very surprised .	-12.0330

My gold medal is Robbie . ”	-0.7115
His son bears the name of his father , Robert , who died in 2011 at only 40 years of cancer diagnosis .	-2.8642
Daley said that his father did not accept that he would die , and one of the last things he had asked was whether they had their tickets for London in 2012 - because he wanted to be in the first row .	-3.4219
“ I could not tell him : <unk> You will no longer experience sitting in the first row , Dad <unk> , he said .	-3.2765

The Weak Mickelson Sat on the Ryder Cup Saturday	-3.3384
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game , but he needs to drastically improve his form so that it will not become a sad milestone .	-3.8936
Mickelson , who played for the 12th time at the event that takes place every two years , was put on the bank by Captain Jim Furyk for the fourballs and Foursomes on Saturday .	-3.7666
Instead of , as so often happens for the US , being at the heart of what happened , the five Major winner divided his day between fires and rounds of practice in the golf course , in the hope of overcoming his depth .	-5.2143
The 48-year-old is never the most straightforward driver even at the height of his career and is not suitable for the narrow Le Golf National Square where the long Rough regularly punishes failures .	-4.1758
And as if the square were not alone challenging enough , Mickelson meets the British Open Champion Francesco Molinari , who won all four matches this week , together with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood , on Sin the .	-25.3295
If Americans lag behind four points and have a hot start at the start of the 12 individual games , Mickelson ’ s Match may be absolutely crucial .	-3.8249
Furyk expressed his confidence in his husband ; what remained to him . to to . to to the . to to to the . to to to	-13.8719
" He fully understood the role he had today , gave me a flap on my back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow , " said Furyk .	-3.2654
" He has a lot of confidence in himself .	-3.0828
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has done so much in the past for these teams , and this week .	-1.8896
I would probably not have thought he would play two games .	-2.6988
I had wished for more , but it has now emerged and that is the way we felt we had to tackle it .	-5.8451
He wants to be out there , just like everyone else .	-2.1423
So far , Nick Faldo holds the record of most played matches at the Ryder Cup , which will break Mickelson on Sunday .	-4.2554
This could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never fitted to the heights of its individual record .	-3.4526
Mickelson has won 18 times , lost 20 times and played seven times undecided , while Furyk said that his presence would have been invaluable for the team .	-20.2015
" He is funny , he is sarcastic , funny , he loves to entertain people , and he is a great guy he can have in the team room , " he explained .	-2.5060
I think the younger players had fun measuring with him this week , that was nice to look at . ”	-3.9451

European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great lead can soon disappear .	-2.5961
Thomas Bjorn , the European captain , knows from experience that a great lead in the last day ’ s individual games at the Ryder Cup can quickly become an inconvenient ride .	-4.0193

It is only over when the points are displayed on the board .	-3.3925
Our goal is to win this cup , and that is what we are focusing on .	-3.7840
I have always said that I firmly believe in the 12 players in our team , but we are dealing with a strong opponent , the best players in the world . ”	-2.7378
Enthusiastic how his players played on a hard golf course , Björn added : " I would never be fast here .	-3.8261
Tomorrow is also a day .	-1.5234
Tomorrow are the personal appearances , and that is another thing .	-2.8227
It is great to be out there with a partner if things are going well , but if you are out there alone , you will be testing your own skills as a golfer .	-5.7052
This is the message you need to convey to the players : tomorrow to get the best out of you .	-12.4514
Now you pass to your partner and he must do just as you do . ”	-4.6228
Unlike Björn , the opponent Jim Furyk will strive for his players to do better individually than they do as partners , with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas , who have earned three out of four points .	-4.4833
Furyk himself experienced such a sensational turn on the final day , at the time he was part of the winning team in Brookline , now he belongs to the losers after the European team has completed the “ miracle of Medinah ” .	-14.6151
" I remember every condemned word , " he said on the question of how Ben Crenshaw , the captain of 1999 , had gathered his players on the way to the last day .	-3.7517
We have 12 important games tomorrow , but we want to get started as soon as possible , as we saw in Brookline , in Medinah .	-3.7011
Once an independent dynamic has developed , the great pressure on the middle matches is exerted .	-4.7824
We have built up our list accordingly and brought the guys out as we felt , you know we are trying to create something special tomorrow . ”	-4.4250
Thomas , together with Paul Casey , Justin Rose , Jon Rahm , Tommy Fleetwood , and Ian Poulter , should lead the other Europeans in top rankings against Rory McIlroy in the to.	-4.1389

Renewed postponement of the timetable for Germany ’ s new warship	-3.2746
The German Navy ’ s latest frigate should have been put in service as early as 2014 in order to replace warships coming into the years from the Cold War , but it will now take at least until next year because of incorrect systems and escalating costs .	-6.2270
The commissioning of the “ Rhineland-Palatinate ” , the leading ship of the brand new frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class , has now been postponed to the first half of 2019 , according to the newspaper “ Die Zeit ” , calling on a military spokesman .	-4.7072
The navy should have put the vessels into operation in 2014 , but serious problems after the first delivery weighed on the ambitious project .	-20.3950
The four frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the older vessels of the Bremen class .	-3.2959
It is assumed that they have a powerful cannon , a series of flight defence and ship defense missiles , and some stealth technologies , such as reduced radar , infrared and acoustic signatures .	-4.2819
Another important advantage is longer maintenance intervals : the latest frigates are supposed to be usable for up to two years without attracting the home port .	-5.0531
But the state-of-the-art warships that Germany should allow overseas power projection will already be outdated by constant delays when they are finally put into service , as the weekly newspaper “ Time ” notes .	-5.1774
The unfortunate F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German navy officially refused to start the ship and returned it to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg .	-4.1380
This was the first time that the navy returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery .	-2.9617
Little was known about the reasons for ship return ; German media mentioned a series of critical “ software and hardware defects ” that would make the warship useless in combat operations .	-3.9362
Software deficiencies were especially important because the ships of the Baden-Württemberg class are served by a crew of around 120 seafarers - only half of the crew on older frigates of the Bremen class .	-3.9884
It also turned out that the ship has a considerable overweight , which would limit performance and make future upgrades to the navy more difficult .	-4.7388
It is assumed that the 7,000 tonnes “ Rhineland-Palatinate ” is twice as heavy as ships of the same class used by the Germans during the Second World War .	-4.0289
In addition to faulty hardware , the price shield of the entire project - including the training of the crew - will also be the subject of the top.	-16.9198
Instead of the EUR 2.2 billion initially estimated , the cost now appears to have reached the dizzying EUR 3.1 billion ( around $ 3.6 billion ) .	-3.6602
The problems with the latest frigates are particularly important in the light of recent warnings that Germany ’ s maritime power is dwindling . to the of to the of the .	-26.0042
At the beginning of this year , Hans-Peter Bartels , Chairman of the Defence Committee of the German Parliament , admitted that the war fleet actually “ goes out of operational vessels . ”	-3.7720
The official said that the problem has grown avalanche over time , as old vessels were put out of service without any replacement .	-5.1933
He complained that none of the Baden-Württemberg frigates were put into service by the navy .	-2.7924
The National Trust listens to the secret life of bats .	-1.7987
New research on a property in the Scottish Highlands attempts to find out how bats use the landscape for food .	-3.5433
It is hoped that it will gain new insights into the behaviour of the unique flying mammals that will guide future measures to protect animals .	-4.3606
The study by scientists of the National Trust for Scotland will follow meanings and soprano pistrelles as well as brown long and dubentone bats in the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross .	-4.0331
Special recording devices are placed at the main points of the accommodation to track bat activities throughout the season .	-3.7843
NHS employees and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys with hand detectors .	-2.0033
An expert tone analysis of all recordings determines the frequency of bat calls and assigns the calls to species .	-3.7840
The habitat card to be created and the corresponding report should provide a detailed overview of the behavior .	-4.0078
Rob Dewar , National Trust for Scotland ( NTS ) Nature Protection Adviser , hopes to find out which areas of the habitat are most important for the bats and used by their species .	-15.5564
This information will help to identify the benefits of habitat management , how best to preserve meadows and how forests for bats and other species associated with them .	-4.1533
There has been a sharp decline in bat populations in Scotland and the United Kingdom over the last hundred years .	-3.5168
They are threatened by construction work that affects their sleeping places and the loss of habitat .	-2.9908
Wind power plants and lighting can also pose a risk , as can fly strips and some chemical treatments of building materials .	-4.8140
Bats are not actually blind .	-1.4365
Adapted to their night hunting activities , the ears are more useful when catching pouts than the eyes .	-4.1538
They use sophisticated echo-location technology to locate errors and obstacles in their flight path .	-3.4390
The NTS , which is responsible for supervising more than 270 historical buildings , 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country , takes the bats very seriously .	-2.7610
There are ten trained experts who carry out regular surveys , inspect sleeping places , and sometimes carry out rescues .	-3.8056
The organization has even established Scotland ’ s first and only dedicated bat reserve in the thread property in Dumfries and Galloway , which houses eight of the ten Scottish bats .	-3.9940
According to Manager David Thompson , the property is an ideal habitat for them :	-2.3030
“ Here in Threade we have a great area for bats . ”	-2.1754
“ We have the old buildings , many old trees and all the good habitat .	-2.3254
But there is still much unknown about bats and the work we do here and on other plots helps us to understand better what they need to live . ”	-3.2922
He emphasises that it is important to check whether bats are there before maintenance work in buildings , according to which it is possible that when a single sleeping place is destroyed , up to 400 females and boys are killed – a whole local population may be erased .	-15.8360
Bats are protected ; it is forbidden to kill , harass or disturb them and destroy their sleeping places .	-2.6331
Elisabeth Ferrell , Scottish employee of the Bat Conservation Trust , has encouraged the public to help .	-1.9095
She said , “ We still have a lot to learn about our bats , and for many of our species we simply do not know how their populations are . ”	-2.5238

“ That is normal .	-1.4776
They want to draw attention to themselves when they say my name , but it is part of the job .	-2.0444
I am a happy man , and everything is good , ” the player added smiling .	-2.4538
Ronaldo ’ s lawyers prepare a complaint against the “ Der Spiegel ” magazine for claims ; according to Reuters , you spoke of “ unacceptable reporting on privacy suspicions . ”	-4.6459
Attorney Christian Schertz said that the player would demand compensation for “ intangible damages equal to the seriousness of the injury , which is probably one of the most serious infringements of personal rights in recent years . ”	-3.9039
The alleged incident is scheduled to take place in June 2009 in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas .	-3.5873
According to documents submitted to the district court of Clark County in the state of Nevada , Ronaldo and Mayorga withdrew into the room of the player after meeting in a nightclub , where he raped them anal .	-4.7129
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo had fallen to her knees following the alleged incident , and told her that he was “ 99 % ” a “ good guy ” that was abandoned by the “ one percent ” .	-5.3256
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex , but it was consensual .	-2.1882
Mayorga also claims that she had gone to the police and made photos of her injuries in a hospital , but later agreed to an extrajudicial agreement because she had " fear of retaliation " and worried about being " publicly humiliated " .	-4.2075
The 34-year-old is saying that it is now trying to declare the agreement invalid , as it remains traumatised by the alleged incident .	-3.8253
Ronaldo switched to Real Madrid by Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack and changed to the Italian giant Juve this summer with a EUR 100 million deal .	-4.1800
Brexit : Britain would forever regret losing car manufacturers	-1.9701
“ The United Kingdom would regret it life if it lost its position as the world ’ s leading car manufacturer after Brexit , ” said Economic Minister Greg Clark .	-4.1609
He added that it was ' worrying ' that Toyota UK announced to the BBC that they would stop production at their plant in Burnaston , near Derby , if Britain left the EU without a deal .	-3.6035
“ We need an agreement , ” said Clark .	-1.5166
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of delays on borders in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs .	-3.0984
The factory in Burnaston , which manufactures Auris and Avensis for Toyota , produced almost 150,000 cars last year , 90 % of which were exported to the rest of the European Union .	-11.1761
“ When Britain leaves the EU at the end of March without an agreement , I believe that production stops are coming at our plant , ” said Marvin Cooke , Chairman of the Executive Board at Toyota in Burnaston .	-4.2694
Other British car manufacturers have expressed concerns about leaving the EU without agreement on cross-border trade methods , including Honda , BMW , and Jaguar Land Rover .	-2.7436
BMW , for example , has already announced closing his plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit .	-17.9714
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers say about the risks of the supply chain in the event of a ' no deal Brexit ' .	-2.7758
Toyota production facilities are based on demand-oriented manufacturing , i.e. , the parts are delivered every 37 minutes by suppliers from the United Kingdom and the EU to speciproducfrom producfrom producto from from from from from to from from from	-13.5703
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without an agreement , there may be delays at the border that , according to industry indications , may lead to bottlenecks and shortages of delivery .	-3.9491
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day of the stock in his plant in Derbyshire , said the company , and so production would be stopped .	-14.2415
Mr Clark said that Theresa May ’ s Chequers plan for future relations with the EU was ‘ exactly calibrated to avoid these border controls ’ .	-3.0311
We must have a deal : we want the best deal that not only enables us to succeed , we also want to seize this opportunity , ” he said to the Today programme of BBC Radio 4 .	-4.6332
“ The indication not only of Toyota , but also of other manufacturers , is that we absolutely must be able to continue with what has become a very successful range of supply chains . ”	-3.5312
Toyota did not indicate how long the production stop could take , but warned that the cost increase could suffer the competitiveness of the factory in the long term and eventually lost jobs .	-5.1529
Peter Tsouvalaris , trade union representatives , and has been employed in Burnaston for 24 years , said that trade union members are increasingly concerned : “ In my experience , once they are lost , jobs are lost forever . ”	-4.4338

The Trump meeting with Rosenstein could shift again , says the White House	-2.7623
Donald Trump ’ s top-class meeting with Deputy Prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein could be “ postponed another week , ” as the fight for Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues , read the White House on Sunday .	-3.9001
Rosenstein supervises the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller , who investigates Russian interventions in the elections , links between Trump and Russia , and the possible disability of the judiciary by the president .	-12.8586
Whether or not Trump will fire the Deputy Prosecutor General , and to jeopardise Müller ’ s independence , Washington has made a lot of condolences for months .	-4.0651
Earlier this month , the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed wearing a cable to record talks with Trump and make it possible to remove the president from the 25th amendment to the constitution .	-3.1315
Rosenstein rejected an opinion .	-1.4423
But last Monday he went to the White House , while reports hailed that he was about to resign .	-3.5167
Instead , a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday , which was at the United Nations in New York .	-13.9905
Trump said that he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein , but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a clash with the Senate Justice Committee hearing , in which Kavanaugh and one of the women , Dr Christine Blasey Ford , who accused him of sexual misconduct , had sown .	-4.7414
On Friday , Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into the claims against Kavanaugh , and further delayed a full Senate vote .	-3.1349
Donald Trump ’ s press spokesman , Sarah Sanders , was on Fox News on Sunday .	-2.1452
After the Rosenstein meeting asked , she said : " A date for this has not yet been set , it could be this week , I could see that I was going back another week , given all the other things that are going on with the Supreme Court .	-4.9000

Milk pump advertising that compares mothers with cows led to controversial online discussions	-2.9910
A milk pump company has caused controversial online discussions due to an advertisement comparing breastfeeding mothers with milk cows .	-3.5548
On the occasion of the market launch of the supposedly " first noiseless and portable milk pump " , the consumer technology company Elvie published an ironic advertising inspired by music videos to show which freedoms mothers are offered with this new pump .	-4.0855
Four real mothers dance in a barn amidst cows to a number with the following song text : " Yes , I milk , but you see no cock " and " If you have not noticed that there are no euters , it is my breasts . "	-4.3010
The slogan continues : " pump off , pump off , I feed the babies , pump off , pump , pump off , I milk my ladies . "	-3.5453
However , the display published on the Facebook site of the company has caused controversy online .	-15.8791
With 77,000 calls and hundreds of comments , the video has received mixed reactions from spectators , many of whom say that it illuminates the " horrors " of the dairy industry .	-2.8407
" It is a very bad decision to advertise cows for this product . "	-2.1176

This is a brilliant product , " wrote a person .	-2.1016
Another commented : " This is a funny advertising for mothers who pump ( often at their jobs or toilets ) and feel like " cows " .	-3.0983
This is not an advertising that praises or judges the dairy industry . '	-2.8058
At the end of the video , the group of women reveals that they all danced with the decent pumps in their bras .	-2.7024
The concept of the campaign is based on the recognition that many women pumping milk say that they feel like cows .	-2.4947
However , the Elvie Pump is completely soundless , has no wires or hoses and fits inconspicuously in a still bra , giving women the freedom to move , keep their babies , and even go out with the pump .	-13.9563
Ana Balarin , Partner and ECD at Mother commented : " The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that deserves a courageous and provocative market launch .	-3.0944
By drawing a parallel between the expression of women and dairy cows , we wanted to focus on breast pumps and all its challenges while demonstrating in an entertaining and comparable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring .	-4.0561

Hundreds of migrant children went quietly to a tent camp on the Texan border .	-2.6794
The number of imprisoned children with a migrant background increased , even though monthly border crossings remained relatively unchanged , partly because the Trump administration ’ s harsh rhetoric and policies made it more difficult to find sponsors for children .	-13.0850
Traditionally , most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves , fearing that they are risking being referred to the country when they defend a child .	-3.8939
The risk increased in June , when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members would have to give fingerprints to their households and that the data would be passed on to the immigration authorities .	-3.4335
Last week , Matthew Albence , a senior official within the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Authority , testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to support unaccompanied minors .	-2.9539

" Almost 80 % of people who are either sponsors or budget members of sponsors are illegal here in the country , and much of them are criminal aliens .	-3.4372

The longer children remain in prison , the more likely they will be fearful or depressed , leading to violent outbreaks or escape attempts .	-3.5010
Advocates said that these concerns are increased in a larger institution such as Tornillo , where signs that a child has to fight are rather overlooked because of their size .	-4.3642
They added that moving children to the tent town without having enough time to prepare them emotionally or to abandon friends could exacerbate a trauma that many already struggle with .	-4.2455
Syria calls on US , French , and Turkish “ occupying forces ” to withdraw immediately	-2.1157
Foreign Secretary Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home before the UN General Assembly , even though the war in the country has now lasted for eight years .	-3.3918
Moualem , who is also Deputy Prime Minister , said that foreign forces are illegal on Syrian soil on the pretext of combating terrorism , and “ they will deal with it accordingly . ”	-3.8979
“ They must withdraw immediately , ” he said to the Assembly .	-2.9018
Moualem stiffly claimed that Syria ’ s “ war on terror was almost over . ” More than 360,000 people have died in the country since 2011 , millions more have been driven out of their homes .	-3.9254
He said that Damascus will continue to fight “ this sacred battle until we have freed all Syrian territories ” from both terrorist groups and “ any illegal foreign presence . ”	-2.9635
The US has around 2,000 troops in Syria ; mainly training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad .	-2.9247
France has used more than 1,000 ground soldiers in the war-destroyed country .	-19.3167
On the question of refugees , Moualem said that the conditions for returning are fine , and he accused of fueling “ some Western countries of irrational fears ” that led refugees to keep away .	-4.5878
“ We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate the return , ” says Moualem .	-2.5313
“ They politicize a purely humanitarian issue . ”	-1.5050
The United States and the European Union drew attention to the fact that only when a political agreement between Assad and the opposition on an end to the war could there be reconstruction aid for Syria .	-4.0278
UN diplomats said that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last major rebel castle , Idlib , provides the opportunity to advance political talks .	-4.1152
The Russian-Turkish deal prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian troops on the province where three million people live .	-2.5314
Moualem , however , emphasised that the agreement sets “ clear deadlines , ” hoping that military action will be directed against jihadists , including fighters from the Nusra Front associated with Al Qaeda , who will be “ extinguished . ”	-5.2646
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee of government and opposition members to draw up a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections .	-3.0415

Paul Rowlett , analyst at the US Department of Justice , has stated several hours as an expert in the field of information evaluation .	-3.2557
He outlined for the jury how he compiled the movements of the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chamber during the night of her death on the basis of mobile phone recordings .	-4.0111
Rowlett said that he received location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chamber in the evening of her death , contrary to his previous claims , The Clarion Ledger reported .	-3.8263

Nancy Pelosi describes Brett Kavanaugh as hysterical and says that he is inappropriate for the Supreme Court service	-3.1785
The chairman of the Democratic Minority Group , Nancy Pelosi , called Brett Kavanaugh , “ hysterical ” the candidate for a seat in the Supreme Court , saying that he was inappropriate from temperament to serve the Supreme Court .	-4.2099
Pelosi made the comments on an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin , Texas .	-1.4685
“ I couldn ’ t think that if a woman had ever behaved in this way , they had called it “ hysterical , ” Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh ’ s statement before the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday .	-18.1097
Kavanaugh denied the claims emotionally that he had attacked Dr. sexually .	-3.8204
During his opening speech , Kavanaugh was very emotional , sometimes he shouted almost and fought with the tears when he talked about his family and his high-school years .	-3.1349
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in committee and called the accusations against him of a “ grotesque and coordinated reputation murder campaign , ” organized by Liberals , angry at Clinton ’ s loss of the 2016 presidential election .	-3.9344
Pelosi said that she believed that Kavanaugh ’ s statement proved that he could not serve before the Supreme Court , as he showed that he was biased against democrats .	-3.4884
“ I believe that he himself disqualifies himself with such statements and the way in which he can be influenced by the Clintons and the Democrats , ” she said .	-3.4222
When asked whether , in the House of Representatives ’ confirmation and a democratic majority , she would seek an impeachment procedure against Kavanaugh , Pelosi hesitated .	-5.1333
“ I want to say the following : if he tells neither Congress nor the FBI the truth , he is not only inappropriate for the Supreme Court service , but also for the service to the court at which he is currently busy , ” Pelosi explained .	-5.0210
Kavanaugh is currently a district judge in D.C. Appeal Court .	-2.4075
Pelosi added that she was a democrat concerned about possible Kavanaugh judgments against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade because he stands for conservative justice .	-3.2966
