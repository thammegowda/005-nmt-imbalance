Munich 1856 : Four cards that change your view of the city	-2.2661
An Irrish institution where young people should meet today .	-2.8472
A casting chapel where the S-Bahn tunnel is now dug .	-9.2913
Small gardeners manage the former reason for farmers .	-2.0995
The oldest official card in Munich promotes exciting stories to days .	-2.4148
It nerves if maps are not current .	-1.7848
This knows everyone who had to excite because the car Navi displayed a green meadow rather than a bypass road .	-5.4592
The historical maps of the digital Bavarian Atlas , an offer of the Geoportal of Bavaria of the State Government , are far from current - but that is why it is very insightful .	-4.0874
Especially if you compare them with current online cards .	-2.0278
Then clearly how cities and communities have changed since the 19th century in the Munich dissemination area .	-3.1665
The digital Bavarian atlas is a patchwork that you do not recognize as such .	-2.8453
The large overview card includes more detailed cards for cities and communities , so-called sheets of urposition    .	-3.9050
These were created according to the Bavarian measurement management between 1810 and 1864 and the first measurement of Bavaria .	-3.6193
Your client : Napoleon .	-1.2009
The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .	-2.3208
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .	-2.8623
Although the French troops eventually deducted the peace of Lunéville of 9 February 1801 , today ’ s neighbors were creating the idea of an area covering Bavarian card .	-9.0142
Kurfürst Max IV Joseph continued to progress the project , founded the " Topographic Bureau " - and thus the Bavarian measurement management .	-3.2446
The urposition sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and is like all the others on the website of the Bavarian Library of t  C .	-4.0970
The comparison of sooner / today is the most impressive example of the capital of the country .	-3.1845
The city has extended in all directions and has grown together .	-2.4589
An example of this is subsendling , which appears relatively isolated in the 1856 map .	-2.8364
Sendling was integrated 21 years after the creation of the map , i.e. in 1877 , as a Munich district .	-3.4219
Today subsequently lies in the middle of the city .	-2.9125
The houses subsendlings concentrate around 1856 along the current Plinganserstra<unk>e , named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878 , a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705 .	-3.7717
Where the West Park is today , you can see nothing as fields - at first glance : a smaller card with dozens of lines and numbers will appear : handwritten river pieces from the so-called " reception " from which the land tax was derived .	-5.3963
Small plots there are no longer farmers there today - but small gardeners of the plant " Land in Sun "                 	-5.9340
A large green area is characterized north of subsendling .	-2.9468
The Theresienwiese , since 1810 the scene of the Oktoberfest , was actually a meadow in the 19th centu -  not a concrete desert .	-3.7818
On the other hand , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine .    Th     S         .  T   .	-6.2780
In the Au-Haidhausen district you will read not only the street name " am Gasteig " or the height " On the Air " - but also in large letters " Irren Anstalt " .	-4.6081
Yes , here on the Auerfeldstra<unk>e you once blocked people with madness .	-3.5492
In 1858 / 59 , the Munich circle mistake " Auer Lüften " was established .	-4.2636
From 1872 Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the establishment - the psychiatrist who is brought into connection with the death of King Ludwig 's II .	-3.7011
" He was progressive for his time and finished , for example , the chain of so-called mistakes .	-2.8562
He has also prohibited the staff from applying violence against the occupations , " says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Haidhausen Museum , who dealt with the institution for an exhibition .	-3.7199
For 280 patients , first place was extended to 500 places later .	-3.2301
At some point , this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for building the circular mistress in Hair 1905 .	-5.6319
The Isar-Amper-Klinikum München-Ost , one of the largest psychiatries in Germany , is located there since 2006 .	-3.4528
On the area of the former Auer institution , young people are now encountering in Munich 's Salesianum .     T        	-5.2545
The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth home with training companies .	-5.8371
West is the football place of the TSV Munich East , east of residential houses from the 1980s .	-3.3766
In 2015 , the children 's house " Casa Don Bosco " was built in architectural approach to the construction of the misery office , which was destroyed in bombings during the Second Wo       W      .       i    .    	-8.2910
The Marienplatz was registered around 1856 as " Haupt Platz " , the Kaufingerstra<unk>e called " Kaufinger Gasse " .	-3.3599
A crucial change in World War II also brought about in the heart of Munich .	-5.0900
In December 1944 , the Allied bombs took many holes into the city centre .	-5.5627
A large remained - at the Marienhof .	-3.0455
The English Institute , small business houses and a castle chapel from the Middle Ages were once at the Marienhof , where these days the preparatory work and on 5 April 2017 the Spatenstich for the second S-Bahn railway track took place .	-4.7705
With the slider controller , the old Munich card can be compared to the air picture of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof .	-3.5887
Civil rights group publishes travel warning for Miss   .    1     .	-9.4460
The National Association for the Promotion of Colours has issued a warning for coloured people travelling to Missouri because of the discriminatory policy and the racist attacks of the state .	-5.6714
" The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri , which is to enter into force until 28 August 2017 , calls on Afro-American travellers , visitors and missourians to pay particular attention to travel through the state and to provide extreme caution because a number of questionable , racial-based incidents have occurred recently throughout the state and noted here " , it says in the opinion of the group .	-5.3526
A recently adopted law of Missouri , which makes it more difficult for people to win discrimination complaints , as well as the law enforcement authorities of the state aimed disproportionately at minorities , led the group to publish the travel warning , NAACP said .	-4.1427
" They have violations of civil rights that happen to people .	-1.8531
They are stopped because of their skin colour , they are beaten together or killed " , said the President of Missouri NAACP , Rod Chapel , the Kansas City Star .	-3.0693
" We hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not yet heard . "	-2.1598
It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the US .	-2.4941
The group quoted incidents such as racist crimes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .	-2.5209
Sanders died in questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year after having no petrol during the trip through the state and taken into custody by the Missouri police without being accused of crime .	-4.0668
The Council also points out a recent report by the office of the Missouri General Prosecutor , which shows that black drivers in the state are stopped 75 % more often than white .	-3.6719
" The recommendation is that people are aware of and their families , friends and staff inform about what could happen in Missouri " , said Chapel .	-2.7455
" People must be prepared to bring deposit money or let the relatives know that they travel through the state . "	-3.0107
In 2015 , Missouri recorded 100 hatred crimes , according to the latest figures from the FBI 's hate crime programme , which classified the state in relation to the number of such injuries to the country 's 16th rank .	-3.7860
The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company because of housing or employment discrimination .	-2.9198
Previously , the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) had published travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states had adopted immigration laws , committing local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration violations , which , in the view of the ACLU , will contribute to further racial profiling .	-4.1036
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Foreign Ministry for other countries , but recently stakeholders have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the Unit .                a            	-5.6692
Weidezaun Project is Elementary	-2.5519
The Fischerbacher Weidezaun project is a success project and will continue next year .	-2.1220
The CDU MEPs Peter Wei<unk> and Kordula Kovac have given an image on the ground .	-2.8711
Representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU local association , together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two Members , met with the Schwendemann family 's legal tomb .	-4.2000
Markus Schwendemann first granted insights into his operation , where he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and accommodated in five apartments in           a          a s       	-7.9287
The " Black Forest Milk " is the alternative marketing path for the milk of his cows , said Schwendemann .	-3.1256
On the table of vacation guests comes exclusively region      .	-3.9903
As he is also BLHV chairman of Fischerbach , he called the Weidezaun project " elementary important " .	-3.3589
I cannot economise profitably on such steep areas .	-2.8463
The greenland area ensures a lot of work , much needs to be edited with the engine sense .	-3.3878
" We have to fight here with the conditions and with topography , " emphasized Schwendemann .	-2.6282
In 2003 he took over parental operations and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if he does not have a bio-farm .	-3.8419
For mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : " The commune has recognized the importance of the pasture project and is glad about leader promotion " .	-3.6188
At the expense of EUR 3000 to 4000 per hectare , farmers should be supported .	-2.4689
It is hoped that the afforestation of the areas could be drawn for a while .	-3.6432
" The greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and thought about how they continue to bring their business , " emphasized the mayor .	-4.1138
Farmers are often in criticism	-1.6126
A total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced about the promotion of pastures in 2013 .	-3.3647
The surface of openness is 40 hectares , which must not be forested by at least 202    .	-3.8556
Of the total cost of EUR 71 500 , half was promoted over leaders , a quarter wearing the community of Fischerbach .	-6.0624
Thus , farmers remained EUR 12 610 , which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of pasture fence .	-2.9749
" The great advantage is the durability of fences , " explained Swendemann .	-2.5638
Kordula Kovac emphasized : " You make a properly good job , without farmers and farmers it does not " .	-3.4201
Peter Wei<unk> also stood : " The best food is produced here .	-7.0669
The Landscape Care Directive ( LPR ) Baden-Württemberg enables the state promotion of pasture fences .	-2.7399
The aim is to keep the Black Forest open .	-2.0034
The prerequisite is the presence of a support scene described by the LPR .	-3.4427
Moreover , the fencing area must not be traffic manageable ( hanging over 35 % ) and must be threatened by afforestation .	-3.9400
For the Fischerbacher Weidezaunprojekt 2018 , the application of eight participants with 24 plots currently wanting to build almost 16 kilometres of fence .	-3.6423
The disclosure area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than EUR 112 000 .	-3.1467
Is nothing sacred ?	-1.5826
The White House of Trump is Now taking the Statue	-2.6480
The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .	-2.2290
The Americans appreciate them as well as any other - therefore the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein in Firdos Place in Baghdad in 2003 .	-3.5100
Stephen Miller , one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN on the President 's proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration to freedom statue .	-3.4281
To stay fair , Miller did not attack the statue itself .	-1.8257
A horde of boat owners and liberty imitators would have lynched him if he had done so .	-2.1672
But he attacked their importance , and in particular the importance that it was attributed when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to h base .	-3.6533
When Miller Acosta described : " I do not want to refer to a complete thing about history , but the freedom statue is ... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world .	-3.3738
The poem you refer to later and is not part of the original freedom statue . '	-2.7685
Miller is right , but as he said himself , it is not really about history .	-3.1746
It is about the contemporary response to the fragmenting words of Lazarus , the only one in which a state invites not only any old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : ' Your tires , your poor , / your pressed masses , which look forward to breathing freely , / the miserable waste of your rich coasts ' .	-4.8385
There was never a time when the " misery waste " was better seen on our screens .	-2.5449
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump ’ s US .	-2.7091
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural dispute : it is indeed a conflict on the importance of America .	-2.8316
Lazarus - and their friends who worked to place their words after their deaths on the basis - knew very well that they carried out a highly political a                 	-5.4592
The sculpture should show the links between French and American republicanism by representing the female embodiment of freedom in a classically used picture .	-3.2599
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received one voice .	-2.7728
And it gives itself a completely different name : mother of the exile .                	-4.9744
The combination of poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism .	-2.1553
And just as Lazarus changed the importance of the statue , people wanted to change this for a long time from the right wing .	-2.8145
The great Schreihals Rush Limbaugh , a kind of Johannes of the baptism for the coming of Trump , argued in 2010 that the freedom statue did not invite anyone , but rather be an early neo-conservative that brings the American flame to the disdained world : " Lady Liberty is progressing .	-4.4116
It is intended to bear the torches of freedom from the United States into the rest of the worl                     . (	-6.4610
The torch should not enlighten the way to the United States . '	-2.1903
Rather unusual , Limbaugh has come to someth                	-6.7584
The importance of the statue is a question of the position of perception .	-2.4132
The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted , miserable but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships .	-3.5268
It is true to see the world from the perspective of people , seek refuge and an opportunity to improve their lives .	-8.0566
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they must hear .	-2.1234
Of course , this is not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to recognize .	-4.2809
Their torches should not enlighten the way , but inflame the hatred that is their only source of power .	-2.9223
World Cup 2017 : Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team	-2.1968
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots belonged to the UK team	-2.7296
The Director of Light Athletics of the United Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16-head Scottish quota will make a massive contribution to the team in the World Championship Cadre .	-3.5263
A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which starts on Friday .	-2.1232
Black believes that ' something special is developing in Scotland ' and the UK 's light athletics must learn something from it .	-3.0310
" We welcome it , and we try to understand it , and we will continue it until we find it out , " said Black .                  	-4.4528
" I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done .	-2.2629
The Scottish athletes think that there is something to do with what they have done .	-3.7292
British athletics : it has something to do with what they have done .	-2.0466
And also with the type of street corner .	-2.3335
Whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . '	-4.1206
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal applicants , including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will take place against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track , while Eilidh Doyle was elected by the team to the team captain .	-4.0465
" Eilidh is quite modest .	-1.2864
Your captain speech was incredible , " says Black .	-2.0073
" A number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the space and felt very proud and were very motivated .	-2.6464
The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh put in place were great . '	-3.5607
The Commonwealth silver medal winner , who will take place at the 400 m hurdles at her fifth World Cup , says that it is " incredible " that 16 Scots are in the British team .	-3.9300
Scotland ’ s best total of athletes at the World Cup was seven that were achieved in 1983 and 2015 .	-2.7458
The medium-haul runner Muir leads on this path and last year set five British and two European records .	-7.4370
It will participate in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m running .	-2.5008
Chris O 'Hare , which runs 1,500 metres , is another Scot that should be observed after a great season which included the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games .	-3.7744
Doyle remembers her first World Championships when the only other Scot was in the team Lee McConnell .	-3.0611
The team captain says that she is " enormously proud " on the fact that many of her compatriots will not only belong to the team , but in some cases will also be involved in the medals and finals  .               .i                     	-8.1428
" The special thing to be team captain is that it was elected by the other members of the team , so it was a great honour anyway , but to know that my team colleagues voted for me and chose me , it makes it something special for me " , she added .	-4.3095
" Obviously I am very proud of all the Scots belonging to the team .	-1.9780
It shows just how far we came .	-4.2027
And they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to rise on podiums .	-2.1973
What concerns my speech as captain ?	-2.0670
Yes , I think she went well .	-1.3973
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation because we have a home World Cup .	-2.7098
It is therefore really important to set this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back in the Olympic Stadium .	-4.7786
I get a second opportunity to go out and compete there , and it will simply be such a great atmosphere outside there . '	-3.1042
Blocking critics about Facebook : Do not apply for a public office if you cannot contract the inheating of electorat                    	-5.6418
The father of our country knew something of bad press .	-1.7701
Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until newspapers began him because of everything , from home affairs to his political principles .	-3.2600
He shamed with criticism , safe .	-3.0291
But he did not silence his critics .	-1.5732
Because in 1783 Washington said : ' Freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupidly and stupidly , like the sheep , we are led to slaughter ' .	-3.7852
This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan , who must work to be more like Washington .	-2.2357
Hogan 's employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .	-2.8127
And the American Civil Liberties Union therefore sued him at the beginning of this week .	-2.6575
The staff of the governor released the complaint as frivol , and the online comment was full of a counter-reaction with " Na , and ? " .	-3.1490
" It 's only Facebook " , said many people .	-1.6593
But it is important .	-0.9270
And it is particularly important if it is a type like Hogan .	-1.8943
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state which is amazingly popular .	-5.4553
He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation .	-2.0767
Hogan is not a reactionary heat .	-1.3003
He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and rigorous compliance with the princi    .	-3.1215
He was also very sent to use Facebook as a primary means of combining with his voters and playing his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side .	-3.1070
Therefore , blocking people who come to the side of the governor is a public forum that is called official and ultimately dangerous by employees paid with public tax dollars .	-3.7272
In an interview with The Washington Post , Hogan ’ s spokesman Amelia Chasse defended the acts of the governor and argued that blocking comments was nothing more than a moderation .	-8.4582
But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hate-filled people that swing online the sticks .	-8.8610
The post spoke to some of the real people blocked by Hogan .	-2.0289
And these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur and a parish , no troll .	-2.7366
They all said that their comments were respectful , thoughtful and not profane .	-1.8333
The parish quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan ’ s Catholic faith .	-2.3381
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie , Md . , was not haterful , but she asked for hatred crimes .	-5.5195
" I could comment that I was disappointed that there was no response to hatred crimes and other current news , " she wrote in the comments area of the news sent " The Post " .	-3.0651
" I do not appreciate this idea either when a number of people take a position on the same subject , some of them are disregarded as so-called collective use and not recognised as a large group of citizens affected " .	-6.0647
What the Governor 's employees referred to as a " concentrated spam attack " would probably call others " advocat      .                	-5.9271
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment .	-2.2522
It is much cleaner than in previous times if we had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical leading articles or to arrest and silence demonstrators .	-3.9209
But that is exactly what is happening digitally .	-2.5832
Hogan is not the first public official to criticize Facebook and other social media .	-2.0160
President Trump is sued by Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed .	-1.8574
One of the first milestones in this question fell last week in Virginia               	-4.4008
The chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County violated the First Amendment , according to the US district Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria , when she banned a voter from her Facebook page .	-3.3882
And in Kentucky , Governor Matt Bevin ( R ) also received a visit from the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitt      .	-7.6854
That should not be so difficult .	-1.3645
At the moment of Washington , the time of affordable porto had a similar effect as the Internet .	-2.7161
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800 , and anonymous writers suggested his leadership .	-3.1425
And even then Washington had anonymous trolls .	-1.5994
People who used pseudonyms such as " Juricola " , " Valerius " , " Belisarius " and " Portius " wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington 's decisions .	-2.8636
Petitions that criticized his position on the Treaty of Amity , trade and shipping with the United Kingdom overwhelmed his office , according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington P         .	-3.8351
But he did not silence them .                  	-4.9305
Freedom of speech , disagreement and discourse are the basis of our nation .	-2.0952
And true leadership means accepting that .	-1.6040
Ronan Rafferty hopes for domestic comfort	-6.4704
Former European no . 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope for domestic comfort in the next three days , as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian organizes the 25th issue of the Scottish Senior Open .	-3.3124

House connections prove to be very complex .	-2.3846
The construction works in Villinger Strasse are in full swing and " lie somewhat in time " , says the head of the Bauhof Fred Heinze .	-3.9654
In the area of house connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as there is much hidden in the underground , which is not noted in the plans .	-4.0847

It is a rare insight into the daily life in the Highlands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was included in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,026 elders should vote through public transport before the occupying forces .	-3.8875
An existing movement that started for independence against Dutch rule quickly turned against the Jakarta government , which maintains control over the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers from it .	-3.4100

Papua is Indonesia ’ s poorest province , where 28 % of people live under the poverty line and have some of the worst child mortality and literacy rates in Asia .	-6.9251
But it is also Indonesia ’ s Goldland .	-1.4694
The largest and most profitable goldmine in the world , Grasberg , owned by the Freeport McMoran from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Paniai , a highland province in the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants .	-3.3519
In 2015 alone , Freeport reduced $ 3.1 billion in gold and copper .	-2.5462
Moreover , Papua has wood resources worth $ 78 billion .	-2.2893
However , these riches are a source of misery for the Papua , who ensure that Indonesia ’ s powerful military retains a stifling presence .	-2.8825

Indonesian President Joko Widodo , known as Jokowi in the people 's mouth , promised inequalities and legal violations in Papua during his 2014 election campaign .	-3.3986
The former rooms ensured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua - including Paniai - on the way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta .	-2.9818
But there has been little change in Papua , and today the locals feel cheated .	-2.7924
" Our hearts have been broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014 , with the expectation that he will meet our hopes that justice will be restored " , says You .	-2.8082

One of the soldiers took off their tone and later returned with four soldiers , so the local pastor Yavedt Tebai      .	-3.8509
The soldiers who had drunk hunted and suggested the group with their guns , said victims and witnesses .	-3.2385
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .	-1.8340
One child , the 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo , was beaten so hard that he fell into coma .	-2.3307

Some demonstrators began to smite stones on police and military posts .	-2.7644
When the mood was heated , the soldiers were sent a command about an internal radio : " If the masses do more than three times resistance , they shoot them dead , " it says in an official document of TIME that was not released to the local media .	-3.9270
Yeremias Kayame , 56 , the head of the Kego Koto quarter of Enarotali , saw the threat and called for peace and called on the amount to return home .	-3.0938
No one was listening in the mood .	-1.7459
" When I turned around , I was suddenly shot into my left hand joint , " he said TIME on the veranda of his colourful wooden house .	-7.6945

Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he established an extrajudicial mechanism for settling historic human rights violations    .   1 .	-7.3576
But the excuses began almost immediately .	-1.3502
" Most injuries have occurred long ago .	-1.6384
Some were in the 90s and beginning of the 2000s .	-1.9771
The point is that we have committed ourselves to addressing these infringements , but there are processes that need to be gone through ' , he said .	-4.9959
Then Wiranto made a withdrawal when he spoke in Jakarta on 5 June and said that he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua .	-2.8631
Instead , " everything is regulated legally " , he said .	-2.3530
Wiranto , which the UN accused of ' crimes against humanity ' , which demanded more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor 's bloody independence vote in 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been settled , including the Paniai incident .	-3.5184
Families of the Paniai victims took such claims with grim incredibility                     	-5.6654
" I have been interviewed four times in the last three years , but there was no progress , " says Yohanes .	-2.3460
'I am tired ' .	-1.2397
He says that he still fears years later .	-1.7998
" I am afraid " , he says .	-1.8316
" I am afraid to be arrested by the military , fear of being shot . "	-2.5485
His brother Yacobus repeated the view that the people of Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident              	-4.1949
He says that he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims .	-2.1219
" Having buried the bodies , the military looked for me " , he says .	-2.6893
Shooting has not stopped .	-1.8009
On Tuesday the Indonesian police shot on villagers in Paniai ’ s neighborhood Deiyai .	-2.6839
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company , which refused to bring an unconscious man to the hospital , one person and 17 others were injured , including children .	-4.8688
The man , the 24-year-old Ravianus Douw , who drowned when he fished in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .	-2.4436
Excited villagers protested before the company ’ s location office .	-2.1888
The police said that the villagers threw stones to officers who responded by fireing warning shots .	-5.2705
But locals say that the mobile brigade ( Indonesian paramilitary police ) began to shoot the amount and killed one .	-2.4129
" We were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge " , says the 29-year-old Dominggu Badii , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured here has been quickly delivered , so the TIME .	-3.5599
" I hid two days in my house " .	-5.3851
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the officers involved to be accountable and to withdraw the mobile brigade of the police from the area .	-2.8939
Paniai has always been a trouble for the Indonesian Government .	-2.0261
The lack of sensible development strengthens the dissatisfaction of the tribal members of the Mee , Moni , Dani and Damal , who live in the green highlands of Papua .	-3.8064
Many joined the " Free Papua Movement " ( OPM ) , the Rebel Army , which claims to defend the rights of the Papua by imposing sporadic attacks and kidnappings on Indonesian soldiers .	-3.3683
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai , including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya .	-2.0947
In response , thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and arbitrarily arrested in recent years , on the pretext of ' securing national sovereignty ' .	-3.1022
Some never dive again .	-1.8488
Among the people of Papua , Paniai is known as a " tragic , forgotten place " . It is also known as the " t         i "   	-7.0378
Poverty strengthens discontent .	-1.5466
The bit of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals .	-1.7931
Bread is just as out of reach .	-2.1002
People here build everything they eat : especially nota and fruit and vegetables .	-2.8273
Agriculture is the task of women who can handle four or five fields of sweet potatoes each .                  	-5.4888
They retain most of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market .	-2.4738
Ten pieces of Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees ( 75 cents ) .	-1.9068
Over time , economic inequalities have grown between the local Papua and the new migrants , who have arrived in larger numbers since the opening of new airport routes to Nabire .	-3.6734
The few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better trained and more prosperous migrants .	-2.6683
Papua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to lead their own companies competitively .	-2.5624
" Young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money here , " says John Gobai , the chairman of the tribal council of Paniai .	-2.8087
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua .	-1.6606
Moreover , restrictions on reporting remain tense international media .	-2.2104
At the beginning of the year , French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported for lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua , although they were given the rare permission to film .	-3.0841
According to Phelim Kine , the Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jokowi ’ s election campaign to lift restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development have not been implemented .	-3.2955
" There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report of Indonesia 's troubled eastern provinces of Papua and Westpapua : visa refusal and a blacklist , " he said in a declaration .	-3.1705
Lack of press control means that international pressure to the Indonesian Government is largely limited to the immediate neighbours of Papua .	-2.6113
In March , six Pacific countries - Tonga , Nauru , Palau , Tuvalu , the Marshall Islands and the Salomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the ' various and widespread violations ' in Papua , including the Paniai shooting se    .	-3.8622
The same countries have historically supported OPM .	-1.6679
The spokesman of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Arranatha Nasir rejected the accusations of the group and said journalists in Jakarta : ' In Indonesia a democratic system still applies , and there is free media , so it is difficult to cover evidence of human rights cases ' .	-3.7504
People on the ground want more foreign governments to take note of this .	-1.8755
As an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of the human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar , Jayapura visited Jayapura on 4 May , locals broke their silence and pressed him " We want freedom " , according to a source that also participated in the sitting , but wanted to remain anonymous .	-3.9805
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua say that they will probably not vote for Jokowi again .	-2.3622
" Jokowi is a person who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai shots , " says Gobai , Chairman of the Tribal Council .	-2.7233
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people , apart from the fact that it lives under the constant threat of a predatory military , are in poor education and health services .	-2.9399
Gobai says that the Paniai people , like other Papua , regard their voice for Jokowi as a " blame " he has to repay .	-3.0245
" They do not need money , they just want justice , " he says .	-2.0761
Despite the threats and intimidations , families of the Paniai victims exposed a last symbolic act of despite the fact that the body of a victim was buried on a terrain precisely towards the police and the military station .	-4.1004
They know that they may never have justice , but at least they are not forgetting their crimes .	-6.3508

Fire capture the ' Torch ' skyscraper from Dubai for the second time	-2.8044
A fire took place on Friday in one of the highest living towers in the world in Dubai and forced hundreds of inhabitants to flee from the 337 meters high , 79-floor building .	-3.3307
It is the second fire , which is called the Torch-Tower ( torch tower ) in just two years through the high house .	-4.1474
The building was evacuated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of flame .	-3.6968
" We have sleeped and we have stood up with the fire alarm and the crying of people .	-3.5631
We ran down the staircase , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50th floor , " told a resident who stated his name as George , Reuters .	-5.3031
Dubai ’ s civil protection authorities said that the units of fire fighting against 4.00 am local time ( 00.00 am GMT ) deleted the fire and cooled the building .	-3.0883
The government said that it worked to provide accommodation to those affected .	-2.4027
The incident can revive questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high houses around the world .	-2.8606
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 showed that the majority of the damage came from the clothing , outdoor clothing to decoration or isolation .	-3.4389
In Britain , the police said that it believed that the system of plates to isolate and clothing at the London Grenfell Tower could help in June to spread a fire where about 80 people died .	-4.1950
No Davis Cup Reform : Continue Best-Of-Five	-2.0279
The President of the International Tennis Association ( ITF ) has fallen through his great Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly .	-2.7739
At the meeting in Ho-Chi-Minh-City , the revolutionary proposal for this sport to play Davis-Cup individuals only on two profits was not supported by the necessary two-thirds majority .	-4.0202
The five-sentence classics , which are often very long , but also very estimated , are therefore still given the traditional application .	-5.1121
63.54 % of the Member States voted in favour of reform , so the ITF President David Haggerty 's objective was missing .	-3.2671
" We respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup .	-2.4862
We need a change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historical competitions ' , said Haggerty .	-2.3345
We will continue to work to improve applications .	-2.1269
After many objections , the proposal was not to be voted only before the finals came into a neutral place .	-4.7408
New from 2018 , only smaller details are comparable : in the future , the finalists will have the host law in the first round in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup .	-4.3034
In order to reduce the cost of the organizers , the requirements for training places and so on are facilitated and players will have to complete less official media dates before the Davis Cup .	-3.8977
More than 1 out of 5 US travellers brings forbidden items to the aircraft , finds a survey out	-7.3100
A survey under air passengers showed that more than 20 % were conscious or unconsciously forbidden items passed to the US Transportation Security Administration ’ s control points , including at least 6 % entering the aircraft , while they carried accidentally banned knifes or other items with blades .	-4.7809
Less than 1 % claimed that they discovered late that they were mistaken with firearms , ammunition or explosives .	-2.7233
The survey of more than 1,000 people - carried out by a jet charter service , the Stratos Jet Charters Inc . - also noted that younger travellers disregarded the rules .	-3.4981
Of the respondents who admitted that they have knowingly tried to fly with something prohibited by the TSA , 19.7 % were millennials , compared to less than 15 % that were members of Generation X.	-3.3958
The most common items that were deliberately smuggled by TSA agents were food and liquids .	-3.2657
More than 3 % admitted to having knowledgeably borne items with blades through security control , while 2.2 % of female respondents and 3.7 % of male respondents also confirmed that they would have deliberately banned drugs into the aircraft .	-4.2491
The company said that it has questioned travellers throughout the country to find out how many accidentally smuggling goods would have brought through airport safety and how many it would have deliberately done .	-3.6849
It is no surprise that people who have been the most smuggling goods - knowingly or inknowledgeably - through security were those who fly most frequently .	-3.8523
However , the company points out that the TSA directives are somewhat complicated and confusing .	-2.1720
People are often uncertain which liquids they may take with or how much of them .	-2.8871
It is therefore no surprise that the largest amount of liquids prohibited by the TSA are liquids .	-3.0049
For a while , people thought that TSA could view books as smuggling .	-2.7881
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .	-1.8596
Elon Musk is No matter : Tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel Order	-2.6540
Elektro-Tausendsassa Elon Musk will be happy to provide the huge number of pre-orders for his new tesla " Model 3 " .	-3.5343
He has so far suggested that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation .	-3.2337
In addition to the always triumphal numbers of sales increases and even more gigantic paragraphs , Tesla-Chief Elon Musk has betrayed another , less glorious number for the first time in the announcement of the recent quarterly record : the cancellations in the new mass market model 3 .	-4.5069
In recent months , Musk often advertised more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car , whose delivery starts .	-3.7076
Now Musk admits : Of the total 518,000 pre-orders , 63,000 have already been withdrawn .	-3.4764
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations .	-2.6991
When cancelling , Tesla pays the 1000 euro ( US $ 1000 in the US and UK 1000 pounds ) " Reservation deposit " fully back .	-4.7085
Currently 455,000 such non-binding reservations were proposed , Musk included in a telephone conference with analysts                   	-6.4097
However , the Tesla leader does not believe that cancellation of around 12 % of all orders could become the problem .	-5.1732
His argument : The challenge of ambitious growth targets is not demand , but on the production side .	-2.6238
Last year , Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles .	-1.5996
In 2018 , all models taken together , it should be 500,000 , one million in 2020 .	-3.2334
The demand for this is obviously there .	-2.0020
According to Musk , 1800 reservations are currently being made .	-2.5039
Anyone who orders a " model 3 " may expect the extradition in the second half of 2018 at the earliest - if Tesla manages to drive its brand-new production roads without greater interruptions with maximum utilization .	-5.0321
Many experts doubt that this is possible .	-1.4823
But if there is greater delay , then the non-binding reservations could become a problem for Tesla .	-7.9389
Because then the company cannot prevent dissatisfied customers from running from running  in sha    .                      	-7.6661
EPA Chief Pruitt is withdrawing from the delay in the rules of the Obama Era to reduce emissions .	-5.6362
One day after he was sued by 15 countries , Scott Pruitt , the leader of the environmental protection authority , returned his previous decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce emissions of smog of air pollut   .	-5.2381
Pruitt presented the change when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of the state environmental authorities than his previous administrations                	-4.7112
He did not mention the complaint that was collected against his previous place in a federal appeal court .	-3.0281
It is a deadline that was released on 1 October for states to comply with the 2015 standards for soil-close ozone .	-3.9240
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by one year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid interfering in local decisions or hindering economic growth .	-6.1117
Pruitt , who was President Donald Trump ’ s prosecutor of Oklahoma for his appointment , was a long time a reliable opponent of stricter environmental protection rules .	-3.4099
Since his arrival in Washington , Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations that oppose the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .	-3.1137
The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the recent legal setback for the Pruitt ’ s regulatory rollback agenda .	-6.5382
Last month , a federal appeal court in Washington decided that the EPA manager exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration that committed oil and gas companies to monitoring and reducing methane leaks .	-3.2291
In an opinion published on Wednesday evening , Pruitt suggested that his turn of ozone standards simply strengthened the willingness of the EPA to cooperate with the countries through the complex process of fulfilling the new standards in good time .	-5.1152
" Under previous administrations , the EPA has often not respected the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be charged by activist groups and others , and in an agreement to set the date for implementation , " said Pruitt , who sued the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job .	-4.2619
" We do not believe in regulation through legal proceedings , and we take deadlines seriously .	-2.6049
We also take the law and authority that we have seriously . '	-5.2996
Nevertheless , the opinion of the EPA said that Pruitt will eventually use its ' power to delay and all other legally available powers ' to ensure that the rules are based on a sound policy and the best available information ' .	-3.9249
The Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broader recast of the ozone rules .	-2.5081
A draft law approved last month will delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .	-2.5301

Tumlingen Celebrates St. Hilarius Church	-1.5014
750 years of St. Hilarius Church : On the occasion of the anniversary of the Mountain Church , the old cemetery area in Tumlingen will be invited to a serenade in Tumlingen on Sunday , July 16 , at 16.30 .	-4.0520
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village is the historic St. Hilarius complex a popular place to stay .	-3.1686
Visitors to the sixth Benefit serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place .	-2.5565
The salvation and conservation of the oldest building in the place have made the friends and supporters of Tumlingen their concern .	-3.1861
Walter Martini stresses : " It is a unique village Kleinod " .	-2.4948
In 1267 the St. Hilarius Chapel was first mentioned in the Württembergische Urkundenbuch : Count Hermann von Sulz sold " the mountain with the parish church to Tumlingen and the Vogtei " to Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver .	-4.0776
The wording of the document after the Tumlinger Mountain was also a dominant courtyard , including the church or patronage law , a         . T .  1 : 3 : 3   : 3    1 :       1     :   3 	-12.7300
So people lived there too  .                              	-6.8692
As emerged from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt of 1858 , alongside the subvillage and the Oberdorf , which are still still to be recognized in the village of Tumlingen , the " Mountain " of the third , the dominant settlement core of the village .	-5.0452
Old cards from time around 1600 underpin these historical circumstances .	-2.7258
Patronage law was created from early Medieval Eigenkirchenrecht .	-3.0424
A Lord who built a church equipped and occupied with a parish remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this own church .	-3.0183
This was the right to use a parish or to propose a new parish to the bishop .	-2.8759
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower .	-1.9942
The greater of the two broken on Christmas in 1673 .	-3.2137
The newly acquired bell sounded for the first time in 1692 , but had to be made later in World War II in 1942 .	-8.1491
In the 30th anniversary of the war ( 1616 to 1648 ) the windows were taken and the bell ropes were stolen .	-3.2319
The roof was light .	-4.3587
In 1796 , French troops stored near the church .	-1.9805
They broke out the chancellors and chairs and used them as firewood .	-2.6137
Remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809 .	-4.1186
Until 1869 , the Tumlinger Hilarius graveyard also served as the last retirement site for the dead from Hörschweiler .	-3.3933
In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Hilarius Church was aborted .	-2.5778
Only the church tower was left .	-2.9507
In New Year 's Night in 1834 , a storm divided the church tower and half crashed .	-3.2148
To prevent an accident , the tower was aborted .	-2.2585
Only the existing tower dwarf remained as a witness to the 750 years old church history .	-3.1223
Today , Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem from the " Schaffigen Rentnern " as successor of Dieter Dockhorn maintain the Hilarius plant .	-3.2746
As an organizer , friends and supporters invite Tumlingens to the sixth serenade in the old cemetery to the St. Hilarius Chapel on Sunday , July 16 .	-4.8869
It is designed by the combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with words by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis .	-2.7321
Hartmut November speaks the final word .	-2.5963
The programme starts at 6.30 p.m.	-1.5490
Admission is from 15.30 a.m.	-3.0166
For the sound of the serenade a return takes place in front of the graveyard .	-3.5424
" Enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest " , the organizers present the fantastic view .	-3.6629
The serenade takes place only in dry weather .	-2.2303
The organisers hope for many supporters to receive the historical St. Hilarius system , which is important for Tumlingen and Hörschweiler .	-3.2226
The friends and supporters of Tumlingen feel particularly committed to home care , as serenade organizer Walter Martini reaffirms .	-3.3154
Association wants to examine wind wheels	-2.8990
" Boisheim refuses " does not see a legal prerequisite for construction and has therefore applied to the Council of Land .	-5.0946
The Boisheim Association has called on Landrat Andreas Coenen ( CDU ) to withdraw its permission for the establishment of planned wind turbines in the Boisheim Nette .	-6.0954
It was unlawful .	-1.8006
The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 on the Boisheimer Nette no wind power stations could have been approved , since at the time in Viersen only at the city border with Schwalm Valley a wind-power concentration zone existed .	-4.8953
Within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind energy systems are principally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes an exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city .	-3.8152
Such zones should prevent a " savings " of the landscape .	-2.8242
Although the city of Viersen decided a second wind power concentration zone on the Boisheim Nette by amending the surface use plan a few days earlier , the Düsseldorf district government had not approved because of a form error .	-4.4757
" The lack of planning law requires the decision of authorisation to be taken illegally and therefore withdrawn , " said Christoph Erkens , Chairman of " Boisheim refuses himself " .	-4.7027
The current state of affairs : the city council once again decided on the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette before the summer break ; the approval of the district government is still out of i        	-5.4713
Recognition : " This excludes the granting of authorisation for the establishment of wind energy systems in planning law " .	-4.2470
The circle confirms the receipt of the call .	-1.8718
" The appropriate letters have been received at the circle of Viersen for last week , " said a speaker .	-3.4438
The circle takes it to re-examine the matter .	-2.6891
But they probably do not lead to the procedure being stopped .	-2.5736
With regard to ongoing procedures in the Administrative Court , the circle on Thursday did not want to speak content on the arguments of the Boisheim Association .	-3.7971
The NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , plans to build four 200 meters high wind wheels on an area on the Boisheimer Nette .	-3.0903
Last year , the company where the city of Viersen is involved in indirect contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of large terrain was closed .	-4.3333
With the establishment of the four wind energy plants , the need for electricity can be covered by around 11 400 households - about one-fifth of the electricity needs of all Fourseen households .	-4.2285
The NEW Re wants to invest around EUR 20 million .	-1.6016
Last summer , Viersen ’ s city council gave green light for the purchase of three wind power plants in the Windpark Linnich near Aachen and a participation in a wind energy system in <unk>bach-Palenberg in the Heinsberg district .	-4.1416
Cars and tractors crake together : Women die in terrible accidents	-3.1648

City and dealers plan " Home Shopping " weekend	-2.8557
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region should rediscover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September .	-2.7544
The commercial association and the city administration want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to attract the inhabitants to the shopping street into the city centre .	-3.6346
As the Chairman of the Commercial Association , Christian König , announced , the " Home Shopping " weekend should awareness the customers of their own city away from the usual supermarket goods .	-4.3021
A market with regional suppliers is therefore planned , similar to the weekly market .	-2.6927
Domestic companies should also present themselves with their training places .	-2.7086
In addition , the shops of the city centre should be invited to " Midnight Shopping " .	-3.5771
The action is not only aimed at inhabitants of the city and the nearer region .            	-4.9432
In preparation , advertising spots in radio , an Internet video and printed bags referring to the action weekend , says Christian King .	-3.3634
Urban administration and commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and C  . T         	-5.0815
The commercial association and the city go to another stage of the project " Attractive City " .	-3.2723
This includes new offers such as the first " active day " to the well festival as well as sales open Sunday , talks with all commercial operators and hosts to move them to active participation .	-4.6812
Also attractive offers to Saturday and the renunciation of parking fees this day are part of the concept .	-3.2827
In addition , customer potential should be reopened or restored .	-2.9175
These include guests and tourists .	-2.1111
But also many locals would have lost the city centre when shopping .	-6.9645
At the end of the day , everyone would have to contribute to reviving the city centre - up to lessors , the companies of the whole city and clubs .	-4.5899
It is important to overcome the lethargy with a network that had partly broadened , king said in the spring .	-4.0559
Birgit Streich , director of the IHK center in Mühlhausen , shared that the third " home shopping " day , first time five Thuringian cities participated in the Germany .	-4.6885
In addition to Bad Langensalza these are Weimar , Sömmerda , Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode .	-2.5459
The day should ' advertise the appreciation of local trade and emphasize its importance for the common good of our cities ' , says Streich .	-3.5490
The action under the leadership of the IHK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence their own direct environment with their purchasing behaviour .	-3.8630

Trump set pressure for payment of the border walls	-19.5110
Transcripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .	-2.3299
On 27 January , in a telephone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto stopped saying publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall .	-2.8447
The US President condemned him because he had denounced the wall publicly , according to reports he said to him : ' You cannot say the press ' .	-4.0367
Trump launched his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern border of the US , and swore to pay Mexico for the project .	-3.1013
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and revealed a tense exchange .	-2.3181
Mr. Trump said Mr. Turnbull that a trade for the US was refugees who emigrated to Australia to ' ridiculous ' , ' mies ' and ' stupid ' , and that the existence of the Obama administration would let him look like a ' depp ' after proposing a ban on the relocation of refugees to the US .	-4.2721
Mr Trump ended the call after saying to Mr Turnbull , ' that is the most unpleasant call for the whole day ' .	-2.7492
Moores Ford Massacre : Activists resume racist lynchact as a call for justice .	-2.4612
A 1948-here Ford Mercury drove through a group of viewers in rural Monroe , Georgia , and rumped to the Ford bridge of Moore .	-3.5541
Before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver that could achieve the bridge , a group of white men emerged with guns to block his way .	-5.9050
The leader of the mob - a man of middle age in a needle strip - took a long train at his cigar and looked checking through the windscreen .	-3.6209
Inside the occupations floated in fear .	-4.9689
" We want this n ---r Roger ! " the man brulled .	-2.7829
" Get him from the car ! "	-2.1189
Crying torn the silence when a young black man was drained by the front-passenger seat .	-3.4770
Fortunately , this terrible scene played on 22 July is just one report .	-2.7983
But when a snake is thrown around the neck of " Roger " , almost all of them experienced very real sigh in the audience .	-4.1607
Since 2005 , civil rights have returned to the Moore 's Ford Bridge to imitate the night where two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946 .	-7.2941
No one has ever been charged because of the           	-4.5358
" It is really inconceivable that in all these years not a single person has been arrested - although we see them in our communities , although we know who they are , " said Tyrone Brooks , who helps the organization of the exposure .	-4.0689
" It is a dirt spot on a story , but it is a burden on our souls . "	-2.2652
Brooks is a 71-year-old former congressman of the state of Georgia and a life of civil right                       	-7.7433
For him , it serves as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual memory of the Monroe community that a wrong was never corrected .	-3.4815
" We want criminal prosecution , we want the end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must get justice , " he said .	-3.0701
" We cannot reach healing and reconciliation until we receive justice . "	-2.2706
A court medicine puts a bed over the body of one of the victims of the Moore Ford lynch on 27 July 1946 .	-2.8768
According to FBI files received by the NBC news , more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the lynch process .	-2.6976
But no one has ever been charged .	-1.9314
Although suspects have remained free for decades , civil rights say that double motivation for lynch actions across the city was always known : politics and sex .	-3.3439
In April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court allowed black citizens in Georgia to vote for the first time in the summer 's pre-election campaign .	-3.2807
Approximately at the same time as the choice , according to the FBI , the black farm power Roger Malcom a white landowner , Barnett Hester , during a fight down - allegedly because of a woman    .	-6.1684
Brooks said that the rumor in the city had been that Hester had sleeped with Malcoms Mrs Dorothy and that the baby that she weared did not come from her husband .	-3.5562
On 25 July 1946 , Loy Harrison , a prominent white landowner , paid $ 600 to liberate Malcom from prison , so the FBI .	-8.7245
He was accompanied by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey to prison .	-1.9712
But when they removed from prison and approached the Moore 's Ford Bridge , a lynchmob surrounded the car .	-2.6692
" As it turns out , it was Harrison , who prepared and ordered the murder , " follows an FBI report .	-3.2412
" It is also obvious that there was a complot between the state and local prosecution , which was not only involved in the murders , eliminated evidence and covered the identity of witnesses       . " . T i                           	-7.1759
Brooks formulates it even more pregnant .	-2.3821
" It was an electoral massacre , " he said .	-1.5411
" You were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : " If you let yourself be registered and if you vote , that will happen here . "	-3.0928
For almost a decade , Cassandra Greene has led the annual exhibition of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch Murder .	-3.0564
Their presentation is illustrative , strong and is founded in a kind of deep racism , many of which want to believe that it no longer exists in America .	-3.8256
It is hard to look at and look even more difficult , but Greene said that this is the point .	-2.4759
" We do not want to talk about the lynch because then we are faced with its ugly in all of us , " she said .	-3.0018
" But I cannot build a relationship with you if you do not want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have done through " .	-2.5573
The samples for this year 's production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest of Black - pushed themselves into a space and listened when Greene started a well-played overview of the piece .	-3.8510
Wade Marbaugh is here Greenes Co-director .	-1.6406
He has played the role of the chief clan member for years , but he said that the role will never be easier .	-2.4421
" I feel dirty because I am not so , " said Marbaugh .	-2.0333
" But I think it is very important to get this story alive because we do not want to return at these times . "	-2.5890
On the other hand , the actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona , who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester , tried their lines .	-2.4612
The piece begins with Malcom , the hester steps and pushes him , angry that he has sleeped with his wife Dorothy .	-3.8909
" I said n --- he disappeared from my property ! "	-1.9718
Rascona replies the fire .	-1.3913
There is a break .	-0.8742
And then everyone ( at least all black actors ) erupts in laughter .	-2.3378
Greene laughs the loudest .	-1.5746
" What ? ! " , asked Rascona .	-1.8378
It is alarmed and confused .	-1.1329
Was I too hard ?	-1.0168
" No " , said Greene , still kichering .	-1.6965
" I simply do not believe that white people said ' n --- he ' .              .     "      .	-8.3965
" But " , one of the other black accidents was joking .	-6.2119
'You just have to meet the hard ' R. ' .	-1.9098
And exactly there the energy in the space moves , a feeling of camera jumping replaces the unease .	-3.6755
Everyone is concerned to get this right , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .          i                  an ex	-8.6807
The scene starts again .	-1.5431
This time , when Rascona says the N word , he says it sharp and emphatically .       . (    ) . I w w   	-7.5181
Absolutely nobody laughs .	-1.4782
This repetition ends violently and quickly .	-1.5764
There are shots , shots and then silence .	-1.9107
A woman who clothes with a mourning dress is above the body of the actors and executes Billie Holidays mourning praise " Strange Fruit " .	-4.3405
Your vote breaks in every second word .	-2.1201
About a hundred metres behind this , a group of about four dozen spectators beat sweat and tears from the eyes .	-3.7436
The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white .	-1.8577
A couple has travelled from Ithaca , New York , to see the performance , many come only down the street .	-2.8333
You have experienced almost eight hours of Georgia ’ s pressing moisture when Brooks leads it on a pilgrimage to the tombs of Malcoms and Dorseys .	-3.4264
Until this point , the killings have remained an anecdote , but now when you stand on the same country where the lynch murders took place , the air feels spenstic .	-3.7305
When the last notes of the song invite Greene to come closer and inspect the body name .	-2.8373
Children attract their heads , register the fake blood and the silent bodies and flush each other .	-3.4792
" They are not really dead " , murmurs a small boy as if he wants to remember it .	-5.7644
After a few minutes thanks Greene the quantity - and suddenly it is over .	-2.2977
The actors throw away the lynch rope and discard their tears .	-2.7166
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh , the man in suit that played the clan member .	-2.7232
Nick Rascona embraces two of his players and then breaks together in her poor , the emotional burden of performance eventually breaks with him .	-3.6701
" It is okay " , whispers one of the women .	-2.3078
" We know that this is not in your heart .	-1.4696
You did that for one reason . '	-1.7396
Later , the audience comprises the actors for dinner .	-2.9747
At a table , a white couple from Atlanta stimulates the deposit with a black couple they have just met .	-3.9314
Denise Duplinski fought to find words that left the performance .	-2.4687
" It is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... to come from people who look like you yourself and who do that because they look like you " , she said .	-3.0596
" What that really does with me lets me believe that the lynch still goes on , " she added , " today this is only called police shooting . "	-3.7169
In the same space , Tyrone Brooks Hof holds his table , he eats and reminds of civil rights .	-2.7682
He said that he had already begun to plan the performance next year       .	-5.0612
" The deposit is inspiring in some way , because it describes the horrors of what we have beared , but it is also a moment of learning , " he said .	-3.1773
" It is so if we learn nothing from it , it can happen again .	-2.5042
Anyone who does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat them . '	-3.0530
The Wagnerians in Bayreuth	-2.1247
Also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner ’ s monumental work , director Frank Castorf places a colourful stage on a gigantic , six-floor scene .	-3.9314
The stage ( designed by Aleksandar Denic ) shows a shabby street corner , along with the Wall Rest and Dönerbude in Berlin , a " Plaste and Elaste " logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange .	-3.8999
Before that , an open Mercedes-Oldtimer where the Rhine Daughters pose as Rockergirls , or alternatively an isetta .	-3.7072
Stacked oil barrels remember Castorf 's leitmotiv - money , power and greed - which is drawn by its " ring " stage .	-3.6087

The audience thanks the ensemble with strong applause .	-2.0369
Stormy celebrations are fosters , milling , vinke and conductor Janowski , who are modest and formally bowing the hands to the Merkel route .	-4.2154
There is a great applause for the Festival Orchestra , which is first showing on stage - given the great heat again in leisure clothing .	-4.7016
With tension , the performance of Frank Castorf and his director was expected .	-3.0097
Had he still needed to go about himself in 2013 , there were five years later great cheers in which the separate " Buh " calls were suspended .	-5.1234
Festival chief Katharina Wagner is likely to have looked forward to it .	-3.0690
" You notice that the audience has grown together with the " ring " in a way , " she said just before the performance of the dpa .	-3.4510
The audience has not only made a form of peace with Castorf , but it has also grown an understanding of its view      .	-3.7332

And then I wondered what do you do .	-1.9377

EPA reverses decisions to delay the smog rule by complaints	-5.7197
The US Environmental Protection Authority has lifted a decision to delay a regulation of the Obama administration that the states are obliged to contain smog-causing emissions , one day after 15 states sued the agency because of the step .	-4.2919
The EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to promote the so-called ' ozone rules 2015 ' and said it showed the Agency 's commitment to cooperate with states .	-3.3164
" We believe in the dialogue with and believe that we respond to our state partners , " said EPA-Chief Scott Pruitt in a statement .	-2.9627
In June , Pruitt announced the intention of the EPA to measure the ozone provisions - in which part of the country should measure pollutant emissions to determine where cuts need to be made to comply with stricter air quality standards - to delay one year until October 2018 .	-4.2465
A group of 15 largely democratic states , together with the district of Colombia , submitted complaint on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .	-3.0457

Council of the Community area	-2.2618
In the end , the decision was clear : in two votes against the Municipal Council of Fluorn Wines , the establishment of a Community area in the future senior housing system was decided .	-6.9521
Before the discussion , there is an important information : the purchasing contract for the lack of property is signed , reports Bernhard Tjaden .	-5.3962
While it will still take until the church community has been part of the community , there is no obstacle to planning the project to be adopted by a private investor .	-4.6156
There is a discussion on a Community area for this .	-2.2013
One of the two investors still in the boat has offered to come to the community .	-2.6810
On the ground floor , it would provide a living area - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with at least 70 square meters for a special price .	-3.5537
The administration and the majority of the Council of Municipal Council intends to provide such a Community area not just as a meeting place for the inhabitants of senior housing , but openly into the community .	-4.4769
As an example , the word of the " knitting café " made the round .	-2.7124
The decision that has already been predecided by the provision of resources for the current budget last autumn is sweetened by promotion                               	-6.9128
The construction is located in the restoration area .	-2.3672
The establishment of a Community area would be , Tjaden reports , with 60 % of 30 % .	-2.6288
The proposal for a decision to signal to the investor is that in this respect it does not want to throw a stick between the legs , the statement that both seed and environmental construction - and pultry roof - would be possible , which would reduce the height of the dream and make the construction more economic .                    	-7.4760
Unnecessary , not only Wilfried Sohmer means that this addition .	-4.8577
If 's helping , he unanimously happens the body .	-2.8041
The Community area is not as simple as it is .	-2.9151
Daniela Ruf refers to the many own buildings with which you do not make such progress , for which you are now rejecting the Community room from the window , she says : " I do myself difficult to do so " .	-5.0613
Yvonne Staiger is absolutely in favour of the Community area , but absolutely against local participation .	-2.9282
It sees a hidden subsidy to anyway or even foreign investors .	-2.9995
That is not the case , because with the acquisition of the area you do not give any grant , but you will receive a real , in case of doubt marketable value , the opposite s .	-6.3895
Staiger 's request to split the decision proposal accordingly is three supporters .	-3.4581
For example , there are two votes against the original programme that Stefan Haller summarizes : ' If we take the decision so , we make a giant step towards closing a giant gap in our infrastructure ' .	-4.0183

Seven professionals lack the title defender in the supercup against the pocal winner .	-2.5501
The staff worries at the German Football Record Master Bavaria Munich are becoming increasingly greater before the Supercup on Saturday ( 20.30 am / ZDF and Eurosport ) at Pokal Winner Borussia Dortmund .	-4.4593
Trainer Carlo Ancelotti must also renounce David Alaba in duel with the BVB .	-2.9426
That confirmed the Italians on Friday .	-1.8062
Moreover , Manuel Neuer , James , Thiago , Jerome Boateng , Arjen Seals and Juan Bernat are missing .	-2.4136
For the five defeats in the past six test games , Ancelotti has made the physical state and the lack of balance in the game of his team responsible .	-3.0281
" We know that we are not in the best physical constitution , " said Ancelotti and added : " The most important point is the balance in the team .	-2.2239
That was not good . '	-1.9524
The 58-year-old believes in an increase in performance in the first official obligation of the season .	-2.7537

In the resin the first " star path " should be created .	-6.8720
The association Sternwarte Sankt Andreasberg plans to d this .	-3.3924
There is a planet trail in Göttingen - since 2003 .	-5.2025
A " star path " comes across the need for information from many resin visitors , said .	-3.6679
He combines nature , science , movement and sporting performance .	-2.0460
The members want to set up tables along the planned route and inform them about stars and constellations .	-3.7385
In a first phase until 2018 , the association plans " well accessible installations in five to six places " in the upper resin .	-3.4353
St. Andreasberg , Braunlage , Hohegeiss and Sieber would come into question .	-3.3737
The information on the tables should be complemented via the Internet .	-2.6104
Therefore , a good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection .	-3.3265
Accessibility is also a criterion .	-1.4101
Later , the star path should be extended to train .	-2.9441
" On the star path the viewers learned a lot of knowledge , for example about the physics of the individual stars , " explained the association .	-3.7284
Moreover , they learned why stars had different colors or why a star shined stronger than another , even though it is much further away .	-3.8315
Also , which constellation is a selected star and when it is best to see .	-4.3061
The association has been operating the highest northern Germany since 2014 in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg .	-3.4780
The location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany after the Federal Office of Nature Protection .	-3.3714
From there the Milky Way and even the Andromeda galaxy are often clear .	-3.5727
Since 2003 there has been something similar to the planet path since 2003 on the initiative of the Planetarium Göttingen support association - the planet route .	-4.6172
Starting in front of Gebhards Hotel in the Goetheallee , which forms the interior of our sun system , the planet route with its places up to the Hainberg and the starwait - as well as an " extra-earth " location in Diemarden ( municipalities ) with the planet Sedna .	-5.0165
The positions with the individual planets - including the pluto degraded to the dwarf planet at the end of the day - are set exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .	-3.9234
The earth thus shrinks to a ball of 6.5 millimetres of diameter , while the exact 75 metres away sun measures 70 centimetres .	-3.5393
The entire distance of the planet path is well four kilometres .	-2.3618
While the light from sun to the pluto requires about eight hours , pedestrians need a good hour to pluto   .	-3.6753
So pedestrians are faster than light in world all .	-2.3084

Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time , discuss a possible showdown	-1.7414
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia , who should be in a collision course to stage the most exciting box campaign in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .	-2.9497
They were in separate rooms in ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia , the unbeaten World Boxing Council lightweight champion down the floor to welcome Lomachenko , the World Boxing Organization Super-Federweicht-Champion .	-3.2558
After Garcia ’ s victory through unanimous decision on the former four-division World Champion Adrien Broner on Saturday on Showtime , both fighters are members of the Top-Five Pound-for Pound list .               A       	-5.5687
Garcia stretched the right hand and said : " How do you go , Champion ?	-2.4658
I wish you good luck . '	-1.4561
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday evening at 9 p.m. on ESPN .	-2.4985
When the couple positioned for photos , Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas noticed that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the " perfect size " .	-2.9898
" I am a former spring weight " , reminded Garcia .	-1.7997
" I have risen for Broner [ to 140 pounds ] , but I 'm not so great .	-3.0951
I am small for 140 .	-1.0797
I would like to come down to lightweight .	-2.3018
And he must move on lightweight [ 135 pounds ] and then we fight .	-2.3931
That is what the fans demand .	-1.9805
Let us give them that . '	-1.6010
Lomachenko agreed .	-0.8480
'Boxing needs this struggle . '	-2.1186
Climate asked whether it should be on Pay-per-View , part of a strategy that Lomachenko has to fight with a 135-pound debut this year to agree next summer with Garcia a date ( 37-0 , 30 knockouts ) which also has interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight title struggle in the forum on 23 September .	-4.2191
" This struggle could take place in pay-per-view mode because all fans asked him , " said Garcia and later expressed himself openly to fight with the network that offers the best financial package     .	-3.8750
We are the best .	-0.8770
No other name can create this kind of attention .	-1.9144
Whenever they are ready ... "	-1.3372
Garcia said he valued Lomachenko as " an enormous fighter " , and he may be participating in his Saturday struggle .	-3.0075
But Lomachenko held in the generous praise for Garcia and said that he thinked the triple champion from Riverside look " very slow , do me sorry Mikey ... you wanted to see the co-out " .	-4.2254
Garcia said that the focus was to show strong strokes , then bo boxes .              	-5.4483
Both said that they could feel the momentum built for their own fight .	-2.4442
" This is the fight that needs to be carried out .                           	-7.2253
No other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm .	-1.7565
I am more than happy to work on this " , said Garcia .                  . " .      I 	-8.9242

Four Injured According to Tires	-2.4865
In an accident on the A7 , four people were seriously injured on Thursday afternoon .	-2.9175
After first information , the driver of an Opel Zafira lost the control of his vehicle after a tire square at 6.30 p.m. shortly before the connection point Market Width probably lost control of his vehicle .	-5.8532
The car turned right into the mouth where he surpassed and then remained on the roof in the green strip .	-4.6708
The four occupations - two adults and two children - were partly difficult to injure in the accident .	-2.6779
During the primary supply of the injured by the rescue service , the A7 was locked towards the north for about one hour , and then traffic could be passed on to the left strip at the accident site .	-4.9038
Fortunas Hoffmann : " Three chains works better "	-2.3060
Andre Hoffmann hopes that the optimization of the defense formation will bring Aue points after 2 : 2 to the seasonal take against Braunschweig .	-4.4220
With the first season game , Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the result also , there would not have been the two opponents at the 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .	-3.7638
" These were two opposites too much , and we have to care even better in Aue , " says the defender of Fortuna Düsseldorf .	-3.3525
In the Ore Mountains the tripartite chain should be optimized further .	-2.9862
And a gateway after a free kill the fortunes do not want to catch up anymore .	-4.5002
" For the future , it will be the case that none of them will put themselves on the line beside Michael ( rensing ) .	-7.2017
Hoffmann is convinced that his team also comes better after the experience in preparation with the triple chain than with the four chain .	-3.3801
" I do not know how we will act in Aue , " says his trainer Friedhelm Funkel , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , " because in the triple chain we have on the half positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gie<unk>elmann players who can build well " , said Hoffmann .	-4.2226
'Prerequisite is , but that we harmonise even better and we do not afford so many players in the construction . '	-4.0836
Of course Hoffmann also travels to Aue to win the game .	-2.5430
" But whether you can talk about a failed start after a decision , don 't know .	-3.7522
The performance may well be okay , " meant Hoffmann .	-6.0989
" However , if we can stand with four points on Sunday and concentrate on the pocal , we will certainly be able to talk about a proper seasonal start . "	-3.9081
His trainer did not want to know anything about this .	-2.5813
" The start in the season I judge only after six to eight days " , said Friedhelm Funkel , who does not want to talk about an advantage over Aue , just because the game of the Saxons in Heidenheim had to be aborted early because of an unweather .	-4.1804
" Now they can start the season with a home game , " said Funkel and Hoffmann believes that players from Aue might be somewhat fresher , because they would not have a serious and complete game like Fortuna against an ascent favorite in the bones .	-4.2143
" But they do not know so 100 % where they are currently , " says the interior defender of Fortuna .	-2.7097
Although guests from the Rhineland go to the encounter in the final ( almost ) finished stadium of Aue on Sunday .	-3.6802
" That we away them , just because we have the claim to come under the first six is bloodsense , " says Funkel , whose balance sheet is positive in just a defeat against Aue from nine games .	-4.5985
" There is no team in the second federal league that you have to beat from the outset " , explains Fortunas Chef Coach .	-3.5625
" To meet such a statement would be arrogant and considerable " .	-2.7341
And so Funkel does not want to experience his players on Sunday .	-2.9703
Published new results of the Swedish asylum assessment tests         re .     i  t  . Th     	-12.0848
The recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , which have been subjected to a new method of medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 % of those tested are older than 18 years , but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .	-3.8005
The Swedish Authority for Forensian Medicine ( Council Medicinal Verket ) started with the implementation of the tests last year .	-3.4417
During the asylum procedure , they should make the assessment of age more precise after the Swedish Migration Authority ( Migration Verket ) was criticised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were underage .	-4.3206
To date , migration verket has sent 6,880 cases to test and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31 July 2017 .	-3.3560
Eighty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the person was " possibly 18 years or older " .	-2.7912
In 432 cases , the conclusion was that the person ' may be under 18 years old ' .	-2.2318
The tests are only carried out in cases where the age of the person is called into question .	-2.4017
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency , the results are consistent in recent months .	-2.5214
" We do not see a great difference in the statistics of recent months , the numbers are quite constant " , he said the magazine The Local .	-2.7837
The high proportion of cases in which the person was judged over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has lied over his age .	-3.0587
In May , the agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases which " propose that the investigated person was 18 years or older " .	-2.6892
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 results , she found that in 243 of these cases the person had frankly said that it was 18 years old this year .	-3.1127
The method of medical assessment , where the X-ray images of wisdom teeth and MRT pictures of knees are made , which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists , have also been critic en in some areas .	-6.7171
A sceptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute , whose work includes the assessment of the biological maturity of people to see whether they went sooner or later than usual through puberty .	-3.2895
" I had reason to think about this and I do not believe that the type of measurement should be used .	-2.2729
Judging biological age in this way is very uncertain .	-1.9496
If we cannot say it safely , we should not do as if we could , " he said the newspaper Metro .	-2.7213
However , Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests : " In general , you can say that the risk of a child incorrectly assessing a child is l                   	-5.0679
The greatest risk is when the person is just below 18 , in this case these are about 10 % . '	-3.0695

The work on the three bridges of the road 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg comes well .	-7.1275
On Wednesday a seven tonnes of heavy concrete emphasis was installed at the bridge at the eastern reception of Lauterbach .	-3.1226
" We are very good in the time it runs super " , says Reinhold Leicht , construction head of the department of road and transport in the government presidency of Freiburg .	-4.6369
In April the works began at the same time at all three renovated bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach .	-2.7218
The construction is planned for October and easy to respect the timetable .	-3.0952
The first bridge , coming from Schramberg , leads over the Trombach .	-2.4304
It is a vaulted archery from concrete dressed with red sandstone and has a total length of 4.80 meters .	-3.0612
It was built in 1900 .	-1.1913
Like the other bridges , it has now come into years .	-2.3867
In order to ensure strength and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated .	-8.2221
The other bridges lead through the Lauterbach .	-2.1408
They are built from red sandstone .	-1.8692
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve , or 10.60 meters long                   	-6.7448
The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach has now received a 1.30 metre wide and seven tonnes of severe so-called bridge cap on the north side on Wednesday morning .	-3.7436
This is a marginal fortification that is also used as a way of operation .	-3.1391
The southern part of the bridge is to use a 2.20 metre bridge cap on Friday .	-3.3216
The pedestrian trail should then be done .	-3.7125
This is particularly because it is a patent of the Schramberg company Dizwo .	-3.2676
The other two bridges are already provided with the patented bridge caps .	-2.4053
Special fingertips have required the publishing of lines through the building in Lauterbach .	-3.5422
There is also a glass fibre cable to which many companies are connected .	-2.8567
The residents were informed about the project in advance of the work b hand ta .	-3.7748
In addition , fish and cancer had to be fished .	-2.2505
For the bridges between the Bauhofgebäude and the Sammelweiher towards Schramberg , the traffic is settled in a traffic light .	-6.3462
For the construction work at the bridge at the Lauterbacher village entrance the street is fully blocked in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels " Tannenhof " and " Seven Linden " .	-4.0032
The cost of the three bridge renovations is EUR 700 000 .	-2.5571
It is financed by the country .	-2.3353
AfD in Gerolstein : Bunter Protest at German Potato Salad	-2.2135
It is not so often that parties are drawing on a strange , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( AfD ) , which is difficult to bring under a hat .	-4.5482
The parties ( CDU , SPD , Green , FDP , FWG , Left ) represented in the district day belong to a broad alliance that shows peacefully this day because the AfD invites the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle Rondell to according to the poster " great campaign act " .	-4.9108
And well-known names to start - like Alice Weidel , who , together with Alexander Gauland , forms the top duo for the federal election on 24 September , and the Deputy Chairman Beatrix of Storch .	-4.0943
But those who are already hours before the beginning of the event want not to listen to the AfD learning but to demonstrate .	-3.1423
The motto " The Eifel remains colorful " .	-1.6862
Originally the city picnic was planned under the motto " All at a table " on the fountain square , but now takes place at the parking lot below the rondel - and thus directly before the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the city hall .	-4.2962
A colourful picture that offers itself .	-6.5025
And what Christa Karoli , Chairman of the Forums A World and one of the major organizers , is right to look forward to : " Great how many people have come together here " .	-3.8681
There are music and a lot of food , including a " German potato salad , which the AfD could eat without any problems " , says the woman who brought h  him . "	-8.2708
The police has ordered many officials to Gerolstein , showing presence especially at the train station , which is just a few metres away from the events .	-3.7838

He does not , however , intend to be occupied in his French homeland .	-2.9071
Prince Henrik had never made a mistake from having been unhappy with his title .	-6.1519
Following the climbing of his wife Margrethe in 1972 , he would like to become king .	-3.1851
In 2016 he went into retirement and also deposits the title " Prinzgemahl " .	-3.4170

Lower Saxony ’ s Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) is after the loss of the red green government majority for a rapid re-election of the land day , but he does not want to withdraw .	-3.7801
Because on Friday , Parliament 's dissolution was apparent .	-3.3206
Previously , the surprising exit of a Green Member from her local group in Lower Saxony had plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) into a sev  cr .             a               	-6.5714
Five months before the official date of the land election , the red green coalition in Hanover lost its scarce one-vote majority in Parliament to the opposition from CDU and FDP .	-3.3094
The previous Green Member , Elke Twesten , founded her step with non-nomination for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg ( Wümme ) .	-3.2186
" I see my political future in the CDU " , she explained on Friday in Hannover .	-2.1283
CDU leader Björn Thümler wants his group to recommend them .	-2.4156
This would have CDU and FDP together 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Day , SPD and Green 68 seats .	-2.9641
The relationship has been reversed so far .	-2.3947
The new day will be elected regularly on 14 January next year .	-2.5365
Thumler said that the red green national government must now decide whether it can govern without a majority in this situation .	-2.6556
However , Stephan Weil considers it essential that the land day decides his self-resolution as soon as possible .	-3.5516
The CDU Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .	-2.2573
The national constitution also provides for the possibility that the land day deprives the Prime Minister of Trust and elects a successor .	-5.0930
" Our Constitution offers several options .	-1.4961
These possibilities must be legally clean " , said Thumler .	-2.4320
'One will discuss all the questions in peace when they are legally reasonable . '	-3.5309
Thumler called Twesten 's step " something kurios " .	-2.2749
The politician himself stressed : ' I am not a traitor .	-2.0586
I feel very good ' .	-0.9850
She called herself a supporter of Black Green .	-2.2239
The Greens called on the broken Members to return their land mandate .	-2.8089
" We assume , of course , that it returns its land mandate , which it has received via the green list of countries , with immediate effect , " shared the country chairman Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner .	-4.2593
The Group Chairman of the Green Anja Piel said : ' We extraordinarily regret the decision of Elke Twesten  '    .	-4.3964
She has deliberately decided not to hold a debate in the group .	-2.2617
" Even in the light of the fact that there were no content differences , we cannot understand this step . "	-2.9519
SPD Chancellor Candidate Martin Schulz condemns the transfer of the Lower Saxony Members of the Green Group Elke Twesten to the CDU .	-3.4977
'The behaviour of former Green MEPs in Lower Saxony is not only betrayal to the electorate but also betrayal of Red Green ' , wrote the head of the Social Democrats on Friday to Facebook .	-3.7074
He supports Prime Minister Stephan Weil 's decision to re-elect the land day quickly .	-2.5593
The exit of Twest costs Red Green in Lower Saxony the majority .	-2.3795
The politician put her personal interests against the well-being of the country in her violated eagerness and in her frustration , " criticized SPD Secretary-General Hubertus Heil .	-4.3856
" It is a scandal that the CDU involves this dirty intriguing game in Lower Saxony and tries to beat political capital from it " .	-3.1404
Lower Saxony ’ s CDU leader , Björn Thümler , wants to recommend his Members to include Elke Twesten in the CDU .	-2.9363
The Group leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Oppermann , asked Twesten to distort the result of the 2013 land election with personal career thinking .	-3.9203

Agriculture Minister in the interview - How do we protect ourselves against toxic , Mr Schmidt ?	-2.4861
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs .	-1.2889
How could the scandal happen ?	-1.2060
How can consumers protect themselves .	-1.3609
Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt ( CSU ) is in the interview with the editorial network Germany ( RND ) speech and answer .	-2.6524
Mr Schmidt , how can consumers protect themselves against poisoned eggs ?	-1.9597
I can only encourage all consumers to look carefully at the eggs in your refrigerator and review the stamp pressure .	-2.9975
On the consumer protection portal www.food warning.de , the federal states provide the latest information about the eggs charges concerned .	-5.1646
Eggs affected should be destroyed or returned .	-1.5822
Although , after everything we know , a health threat is virtually excluded .	-3.1871
Does Aldi now take over the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the enlightener is not really perceived by the Federal Agriculture Minister ?	-3.5777
Food surveillance is the task of the federal states .	-2.3065
Nevertheless , my house has switched off immediately and has been in close exchange with the authorities of the countries since Germany is aware of the concern .	-4.0061
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers .	-1.8771
Trade , like manufacturers , has to ensure that sold products are transportable and health-care .	-2.8651
If eggs of the maximum residue content of 0.005mg / kg have exceeded , they are not transportable .	-3.8374
However , unburdened eggs can be sold and eaten .	-2.3539
This time the companies are not guilty .	-2.6296
Sitting production companies and consumers in the same boat ?	-2.2127
After the current level of knowledge , the production companies do not blame immediately .	-3.6023
Rather , they have to expect economic damage due to illegal practices from service companies .	-3.3591
As always , there are too little controllers in the serious case .	-2.2371
Is there only a lack of staff or a coherent responsibility ?	-3.3001
It was precisely the official controls that discovered the process .	-2.7524
However , the truth is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded from 100 % .	-8.2174
It is precisely for this reason that consistent information of such events and the handing over to public prosecutors in the cases where crimes can be found are crucial .	-4.3055
I have already made it clear several times that I expect from the responsible authorities to be completely informed .	-3.4369
Is the regular alarmism in food scandals really necessary ?	-2.2115
Consumers have the right to get exclusively safe and transportable food .	-2.4641
If an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food economy , consumers are rightly outraged .	-2.2811
The panned resources allocate manufacturers , dealers and consumers to a situation that is absolutely not necessary .	-3.5704
In principle , it must be clear that the illegal use of the insecticide Fipronil in the attitude of food delivery animals is unacceptable and must be ended immediately .	-3.3592
This must be consistent and highly pressured at all levels .	-2.3173
I expect all the relevant authorities to enlighten the matter quickly and completely .	-3.1565
How the financial rules of football affect Neymar ’ s Move to Paris	-2.7240
The rules aimed at preventing unhindered expenditure of European football clubs will not disrupt Neymar ’ s world record transfer from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain .	-3.0230
Any consequences will come from UEFA for Paris Saint-Germain , because the leading organization that monitored the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .	-3.2988
Financial fair play rules created by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG must eventually prove that the transfer of Neymar was financed without losses .	-3.4345
Barcelona has paid EUR 222 million ( $ 262 million ) to buy the Brazilians out of his Treaty , and Neymar will receive a salary that will be several $ 10 million per year .    i         i     i      i .    	-7.0274
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar ’ s move to France .	-1.9427
PSG certainly can make the money easier to sign Neymar and bring it into a galaxy of other stars , given the funding of the team through the energy rich ruler family of Qatar .	-3.6244
Clubs may spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players , but must control with legitimate sources of revenue that allow them to buy the Break Even point in their football business .	-4.2024
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA President in 2007 .	-2.0666
The former French player believed that clubs that had taken enormous debt in their quest for success effectively fraud and risked ruining when banks or owners withdrew their support .	-3.5696
In 2011 , FFP shifted from concentration to club debt to monitoring its losses .	-2.5137
The change meant that the business model that novel Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then strongly invested to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a harder matter .	-3.3649
During the current three-year FFP presentation period running until 2018 , clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million .	-2.4867
And , although Platini disgracefully fallen from the presidency in 2015 , his UEFA successor , Aleksander Ceferin , continues to encourage excessive expenditure .	-3.6636
" Certainly FFP is not dead and we will definitely strengthen the rules for the future , " said Andrea Traverso , who is responsible for FFP , to The Associated Press last week .	-3.2368
Although the PSG paid the Neymar buy-out clause in a package , it can distribute the amount for invoicing over the duration of its treaty .	-3.3633
Neymar has signed a five-year treaty so that the replacement amount can be expelled for the next five years of EUR 44.4 million in the annual accounts .	-3.2391
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has met the PSG with the heaviest sanctions together with Abu Dhabi , owned by Manchester City .	-3.1287
The PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million ( then $ 82 million ) later reduced to EUR 20 million - and it was ordered that team members remain limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players for the 2014 / 15 Champions League .	-3.8626
UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to overlist its financial supervision by blowing up its revenues through companies linked to the owners of a club                                	-7.5038
While a Cataric company could sponsor PSG if the value of sponsoring exceeds the standard market rates , UEFA would not leave this as a legitimate income .	-3.3476
This was exactly what happened in 2014 when UEFA decided that the value of the sponsoring of the PSA was bloated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .	-2.9953
It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come into Qatar on payments from the World Cup 2022 .      T C  . ( N 2022 ) .	-5.5557
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have disputed that Neymar World Cup Ambassadors will become and such a manoeuvre for the UEFA regulatory authorities could simply be found out .	-3.4773
The previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules .	-2.8016
UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG on Neymar ’ s transfer , said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .	-2.6393
They spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press , because they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation               	-4.3765
The last published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 has achieved a profit of more than EUR 10 million with a turnover of EUR 542.4 million .	-2.9308
The accounts for the last fiscal year still need to be published .	-2.1191
PSG expects Neymar ’ s arrival to be a blessing for sponsoring deals , merchandising and tricot sales .	-2.0355
The association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 % after signing .	-2.5180
The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players going , and she tried to prevent Neymar ’ s train by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP .	-3.2005
" It is a clear case of " financial doping " with the club and the state " , said the President of La Liga , Javier Tebas , the Spanish newspaper AS on Qatar 's ultimate ownership of PSG .	-2.7639
Arsenal Manager Arsene Wenger , whose association is in possession of an American sports tycoon , shares the reservations of La Liga against a state financing an association .	-2.9942
" It is the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , " said Wenger on Thursday .	-2.7346
" Once a country has an association , everything is possible .	-1.9346
It will be very difficult to respect the financial fairplay because one can go different ways or have different interests if a country has such a large player to represent a country . '	-3.1286

This repetition of history is at the same time nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80s , for which the 90s Grunge-Era ( when the promoter David Wain and Michael Showalter turned the sketch comedy " The State " for MTV ) , and for himself - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , such as Elizabeth Banks , Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to greater things .	-6.5477

The main roles - a hard-southered gregory and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici , whose dialogues of Channing Tatum ( also an executive producer ) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt are synchronized in English .	-3.2907

Wise Complains Gaps in Foreign Register	-3.0282
" Data from citizens who should not appear there " : According to a report , the foreigner register in Germany has significant defects .	-3.4612
This leads to serious misdecisions in asylum procedures .	-2.4055
According to a media report , the Federal Government 's representative for refugee management , Frank-Jürgen , has drawn attention to great gaps in the foreign central register .	-3.2896
Defects in the data registered there could lead to serious misdecisions in asylum procedures and deportations , warned in an analysis that the " Southern German newspaper " has been pr .	-4.5366
According to the register , ten million people are covered by foreign nationality , including about 5.7 million from non-EU countries .	-2.9225
The data is therefore managed by about 600 foreign authorities in Germany .	-2.1928
Because the data has not been sufficiently maintained , data quality has not yet been good in parts .	-3.0534
In individual cases , data was found in 1921 , ' by people who are no longer alive or by citizens who have become German citizens and who should no longer appear in the register ' .	-3.6138

The Bank of England will Keep Interest  Rates         2   :         	-4.7819
The Bank of England will expect to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and the weakening of inflation have stemmed speculation about rising .	-3.3542
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain " wearing " when it retains interest rates on family incomes in the midst of increasing pressure .	-3.2190
The policymakers of the Monetary Committee ( MPC ) of the Bank voted in favour of keeping interest rates to 0.25 % this month , with less members aspiring to rise , as weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase .	-3.9345
In its quarterly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and 1.6 % for 2018 , and warned that pressure on household incomes would continue , with inflation likely to rise to almost 3 % in autumn .	-3.5116
But it signaled that in the next few years interest rates would be necessary to reinforce Brexit-fueled inflation and said that borrowing costs might have to increase more than expected in financial markets .            .	-6.1769
Members also voted in favour of withdrawing part of the Mammut Economic Recovery Package , which was published a year ago after Brexit .	-2.7506
It will call for the financing plan to provide cheaper funding for banks from next February , even though it has been said that it is now expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds of sterling .	-3.8234
Minutes after the decision on interest rates , the Bank said : ' In the central forecast of the MPC , GDP remains weak in the short term because pressure on household real incomes continues to burden consu                       	-5.1962
As far as interest rates are concerned , it repeated that ' some streamlining of monetary policy ' would be necessary to cool inflation and a ' slightly greater ' scale than markets expect .	-3.7802
The markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .	-5.2470
However , the Bank stressed that increases would be " gradually " and " limited " .	-2.4191
The Bank ’ s growth forecasts for this year and next year are compared to the 1.9 % predicted in May and 1.7 % .	-3.1732
It retained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .	-1.7852
The pound fell after these news to the dollar and the euro .	-2.3534
The pound fell by 0.5 % to $ 1.31 and fell by 0.4 % to EUR 1.11 .	-2.1999
The decision does not come to any change after the recent disappointing growth figures have dampened the rising expectations for an interest rate increase , and GDP increased from 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % in the second quarter .	-4.7783
Growth will probably be 0.3 % in the third quarter , even though it will easily recover after the bank at the end of the year .	-2.8832
The recent inflation report provided little enthusiasm for budgets affected by rising inflation and slight increases in salaries , as tightening will be worse before it will improve .	-3.7678
She added that monetary policy cannot ' prevent income in the next few years ' , but she added that wages will be ' clear ' at the end of its three-year forecast .	-3.6574
The economy is also strengthened by rising demand for British goods , which is due to the weak pound , which will compensate part of lower consumption spending .	-2.9291
The decision comes a year after the reduction in interest rates to 0.25 % last August following the shocking EU vote that caused the decline in the pou                                    	-7.2917
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will completely achieve prices and the economy .	-2.4369
Before the Bank ’ s last ruling on interest rates , the reputation for an interest-rate increase had increased because inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households , with three policymakers calling for an increase to 0.5 % in July .	-3.8998
Inflation has fallen from 2.9 % last month to 2.6 % in June , even though the Bank said that this was expected and it will attract it over the coming months  .           . This  wil be         .   T 	-6.4311

NHS England announced that a pre-exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) taken before gender transport , which can reduce the infectious risk of high-risk patients by around 86 % , is now delivered by the health service over a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people .	-4.2003

The chess train announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England-Chief Simon Stevens as " important new intervention " , while the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) called this " decisive moment " .	-3.5404
Sexual health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool and Sheffield will be one of the first to enable people to register and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 .	-3.0401
Pre-exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) is a result of HIV preparations taken before the sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .	-2.9343
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission for infectious people .	-2.7923
Taking PrEP before gender means that enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .	-3.1017
Such drugs can be taken every day or two hours before gender traffic .	-5.7599
Those who come into question for treatment include gay or bisexual men , transsexuals and people with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated .	-3.1444
Clinics identify appropriate participants who agree to the study , including men , women , transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known by antiretroviral treatment .	-2.9955
People living in England and registered with a doctor can also register for possible participation in their local sexual clinic .	-2.9657
The programme will sign $ 10 million and NHS England a contract to deliver medicines this week after an international competitive procurement   .	-6.4963
The study is intended to judge the whole potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence , as targeted on a large scale , included , and implemented .	-5.8767
Stevens said : " This great new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .	-2.4257
It is another milestone in the progress made over three decades in tackling one of the greatest human health challenges . '	-3.0604
Deborah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National Aids Trust ) , said : " This is a key moment in the fight against HIV .	-3.5034
PrEP , if targeted at needy and vulnerable people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic .	-3.0174
From September to high HIV risk people will have access to this NHS-financed attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and not subject to a negotiation with a partner , which will lead to improving many , many lives .	-3.9583
We very much welcome this announcement . '	-1.6354
Ian Green , Chairman of the Terrence Higgins Trust , said : " The priority must now be to ensure that the study is carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk to HIV is left behind .	-3.6934
Now that PrEP test medicine has been obtained , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people . '	-2.5032
Sharon Hodgson , Shadow Minister for Health , said : " The beginning of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and hesitant implementation by the government .	-4.3301
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and end the transfer of this life-changing infection .	-2.8160
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP .	-2.0937
It is now important that this study be carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country in order to protect people who are infected with HIV and that they will help to end the spread of HIV in society ' .	-3.5212
Living the great life : Intermediate floor and clever designer tricks have turned these small Earls Court apartments into a generous home .	-7.3485
Joanne Leigh , a former banker with a passion for real estate , reduced in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment .	-2.5574
It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags .	-4.6793
" Before that I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger space " , says Joanne .	-2.3806
" I was looking for something that was comparable to my price  .      .          	-5.2691
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings .	-4.1200
I loved them and made an offer this day . '	-2.9085
Since the first visit the 1,000 square feet has been completely overtaken .	-7.8720
Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne Stauraum and an intermediate floor wanted to optimally use the spacious ceiling height .	-3.6441
" I wanted high ceilings , large windows , much light .	-1.8701
That was my request ' she says .	-1.9594
For this purpose she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill , who used 12.5 feet high ceilings and created a home which was not only a development but also a place for life for Joanne .	-3.7126
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms across each other , so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor where you could stand .	-8.3450
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the preset .	-2.5287
" The steel mill is quite complicated " , he explains .	-2.1329
" We had to arrange the spaces so that they were stacked across each other without having to book ourselves .	-2.8715
It was not just a question of building a simple platform , but of creating the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or below . '	-3.3179
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms fully across each other - with a lot of additional drama    .    T    i  .	-6.3974
For the intermediate floor a classic copper light window overlooks the glamorous living area .	-3.1708
Mirrored gold furniture , silver accents and Vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program .	-2.1611
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .	-1.9854
At both ends , a short corridor is mirrored to leave it longer .	-2.6206
The kitchen feels like a window in another room .	-2.4164
At the entrance there are mirrored units space for all the cutlery and glasses of Joa                 	-6.4702
By perceiving a more glamorous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .	-2.5208
Collapsible kitchens are nothing new .	-2.1543
The particular thing is that this is a garage door .               i      i        a  	-11.1846
" A bit of engineering went there " , Erfan explains from the steel-reinforced , furnished MDF door .	-3.5392
" It is counterweight , so if you postpone the door very easily slides . "	-3.3224
Thanks to the clever use of space and closet space , Joanne won additional 16 m <unk> , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .	-3.1194
" At the end of the day you will sell the basic area - or how your property is estimated " , says Erfan .	-2.6559
" In a rudimentary form , a real estate broker will enter and calculate a calculation based on the size of the ground . "	-3.3322
Here they managed to increase the soil area and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the space its luxurious advantage .	-3.3574
" The materials are the things you touch and therefore help to create an emotional tie in a home " , says Erfan .	-2.7066
" You don 't love yourself in the electric sockets in the walls .	-2.8270
These are important , but they do not play with your heart . '	-1.8883
It shows that an apartment can transform through good design and increased square meters of something by default into something surprising .	-3.2563
Indeed , like Joanne , you could decide not to leave them .	-1.7588
Brothers fight because of a USD 500 million real estate	-5.5106
Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty , in a confrontation because of one of the largest property imperials in Victoria , worth more than $ 500 million     .      . T '             	-5.9329
The former director of the ' Carlton Football Club ' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak , just three doors away from his younger brother Paul , who brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business wealth should be divided .	-3.8130
Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp discussion of the separation will take place in the Supreme Court .	-3.3266
Together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 real estate value of more than half a billion dollars , since the family bought a business in Smith Street , Collingwood in 1973 .	-2.8723
The Westco Jeans family founded there and grew to a chain of 160 retail businesses .	-2.6190
It was sold for $ 85 million in 1999 .	-1.3453
This money has been invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the city centre , the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller , as well as shopping centres in the suburb   .	-3.5185
After an agreement with her deceased father , Colin - described by Paul as " main operator and dominant personality " in the De Lutis family - has about two thirds of the company 's assets and Paul about one third .	-3.8226
A judicial act states that this means that Colin has property worth $ 316 million and Paul at $ 176 million .	-3.0845
The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .	-2.4478
" The divisions proposed by Colin left him with what I thought for the best objects , " he wrote in a first affidavit in 2015 .	-2.6441
Last Friday , after several failed mediations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place .	-2.3296
The brothers are now fighting for control over the existing business - as Colin says , Paul has excluded it .	-3.3199
Colin argues that this is not true , but rather raises Paul to manage some ownership incompetently .	-4.6606
In an early Affidavit submitted by Colin , he says that he hopes to settle the dispute .	-2.2137
" My Italian heritage states that the family is the most important priority , " he wrote .	-2.2534
The costs increase in the case , with hundreds of pages with Affidavits , emails and reports by companies , including Deloitte , Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan Myers , QC , and law firms held by both sides .	-3.2014
Mrs De Lutis and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicacy businesses from the late 1950s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early 1970s         .                          	-6.2808
They used the security to buy the Collingwood property in which Colin opened the first jeanslades of the family .	-4.8703
Colin says that he started Westco there when he was " the high school in my last years when Paul was a small child ( about 10 years old ) . "	-3.2773
Anna De Lutis says that they and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass their property validly to their sons .	-2.6862
" Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land to justice , " she wrote .	-2.3387
Two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lutis Group , with Colin claiming that Mark has been paid $ 26 million in leaving the company $ 10 million and Luke $ 26 million .	-3.2893
Both Lukas and Mark are , Paul says , " bittered about the conditions of their financial separation " .	-3.2563
Colin has been very reticent , even though he was a former AFL board member and after a 2015 biography by Eddie McGuire the best friend of the TV star .	-3.9820
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers .	-1.8618
Only Colin replied by SMS to say " I really cannot say much " because the case is before the courts .	-2.7631
" It is very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and draw our family name through the courts " , he wrote .	-2.7745
In mid-2016 , Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to meet the demands of his brother .	-2.4820
" Our father would not have wanted Paul and I would end in our current dispute , " he said and added that he still hoped for a solution .	-2.8628

Trump ’ s new head of staff is planning to restrict the president ’ s media abstinence .	-4.9780
Others have tried and failed .	-1.4694
Perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do i                 	-4.8047
If so , he will be the first .	-1.4481
Politico reports that the new head of the White House plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including the reports of the news media - in the hope of keeping the boss on a more evenly course .	-3.4780
Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey :	-1.3122
" When John F. Kelly , the new head of the White House , met his first working day with leading employees , he represented a major problem in President Donald Trump 's White House , which he wanted to repair : bad information that enters the hands of the President .	-4.0554
Kelly said to employees that information should flow about him - whether on paper or in briefings - because the President would make better decisions if he were to receive good information . '	-3.3965
Kelly ’ s diagnosis makes sense , but others tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet .	-1.8864
President Trump ’ s relationship with television results in decades - and now he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong .	-2.9153
" If candidate Trump was annoyed because of unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of bodies that were convinced , " said the former election campaign adviser Sam Nunberg in February to Politico .	-5.7568
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that " the key to keeping Trump 's Twitter habit under control , according to six former electoral campaign officials , is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a constant praise prize . "	-3.5700
Okay .	-0.4186
But the idea that Trump ’ s Twitter habit has ever been “ under control ” is ridiculous .	-1.9909
Perhaps these campaign officials know something that we do not know - that Trump ’ s tweets would have contained even more ignition without their interventions .	-2.8677
We will probably never know something about the tweets that Trump has not sent .	-2.3025
When his employees managed to keep him away from him , their efforts have been worthwhile .	-3.7384
But nobody has consistently prevented Trump from causing controversy .	-2.3484
Part of the problem is that people in a White House composed of competing parties are trying to promote their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views from the world .	-3.3548
Politico - entirely working on this story - reported in May on the preference of the advisers to give the president dubious information for strategic reasons .	-3.7020
This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher :	-1.4514
" Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can respond like a volcano to negative press cuts , particularly such with damaging leaks , and that he finds out where they come from .	-3.2971
Exactly that happened at the end of February , when someone maliciously gave to the president a printed copy of an article of GotNews.com , the website of the Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy staff Katie Walsh of being " the source behind a cluster to be of leaks " in the White House .	-3.8722
Although Johnson was lastingly banned from Twitter because of harassment , or that he has not offered concrete evidence or that he has expressed false accusations and revoked them in the past .	-3.9627
Trump read the article and began to question employees about Walsh . '	-2.0513
Goldmacher added that the then Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House , Rob Porter , " have tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper cram that Trump receives " .	-3.3777
How did that follow ?	-1.9862
Kelly tries three months later to do the same .	-1.4254
Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective manager than a priebus , but Trump is still his impulsive self , and his consultants strive for influence .	-2.9736
These inchangeable factors make Kelly ’ s mission very difficult .	-1.8244
Most searched criminals get post of Europol	-2.7295

The police throughout Europe sends this summer ( virtual ) postcards to dangerous criminals on escape .	-2.6152

Europol reported on Friday of the action following the " EU Most Wanted " advent calendar from winter .	-2.5857

There have been 21 postcards for searched criminals from 21 EU countries .	-2.4923

Travellers negotiate a digging and return to the ' Millionaire ' series .	-2.6428
Some of the most prosperous homeowners of the West Midlands are once again negotiated with some determined travellers on war foot , who have negotiated a divide drawn by the community to reclaim a field before their mansions .	-4.8249
The travellers have parked their 20 caravans in a field outside a wealthy street of Solihull , called the " Millionaire " .       Th  i      .  T   .    i  .. " 	-10.3590
They have brought horses , babies and an army of transporters after they were only thrown out in May , but without having been discouraged from a divide excavated by the Council to prevent their incidents .	-4.0488
The tactical group found a gap in the defence plants and pressed their vehicles through a section that remained unhindered to find a way .	-5.8140
Angry inhabitants have pushed the Solihull Council , which said that it was ' useless to deal with the problem ' .	-2.9372
An anonymous inhabitant said : " They were drawn there on Monday evening after they were sent forward by Bentley Heath , where they thrown stones onto the pass                           . T '  	-7.5288
The Council must be forced to implement by shame , because it was useless in dealing with the problem .	-2.9130
The travellers were there in May , were moved and now returned .	-5.2134
More arrived yesterday evening , probably tonight more .        .      .	-6.2689
She added : ' The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with this by keeping long statements to protect their parks .	-8.1089
I live on the Streetsbrook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my community tax if the Council cannot even stop it . '	-2.4968
A resident who did not want to be mentioned said : " It is ridiculous that we have just seen the last round of these travellers just to be plundered by another round .	-3.3753
The figures have increased this time and even a horse has been seen in the parking area . '	-3.0185
A spokesman of the Solihull Council said : ' We are aware of an unauthorised camp on the country beyond the Streetsbrook Road and work with the police of Solihull , and we take the necessary legal steps to continue as soon as possible .	-3.9893
In order to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible report anti-social or criminal behaviour with the police by calling 101 .	-3.0540
This contributes to creating an image of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case . '	-2.7922
From Birkenhof , Waldhotel Luise	-1.5174
From the former Hotel Birkenhof , the Waldhotel Luise is becoming a p .	-3.4516
The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and will be reopened on 1 March next year .	-3.3895
These are good news for the city .	-1.2802
Because , with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof through the then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014 , around 30 000 nights were lost per year and also revenues by the spa tax                   	-6.2736
In autumn 2014 , given the dramatic rise in numbers of refugees came into the countryside , the hotel building offered the Landratsamt as a collection accommodation , which ensured controversial discussions .	-4.3607
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .	-3.0610
The decision was not indisputable at the time in the Council of M   Munici .	-4.3714
But especially pleasure city ’ s Mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and spoke of serious interested parties at the house at that time .	-4.3428
He should be right .	-1.1514
The group Luisenhotels with managing director Birgit Scherer based in Bad Bergzabern has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof when voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it again a house of the three-star plus category under the name of Waldhotel Luise .	-3.9313
The group has four houses with the Freudenstädter Object .	-2.3664
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb .	-1.5821
They are called Hotel Luise , Luisenpark , Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise .           	-3.9030
The former Hotel Birkenhof has been construction containers in front of the entrance for a long time , and if you enter the hotel , it is clear what extensive renovation works are done .	-7.0939
The floors have been torn out , ceilings were partly decorated , old bathtubs from the rooms are away          a        	-6.6281
The entire hotel building is a single building site .	-1.8705
There is still a lot to be done by March .	-1.8108
" It 's actually a beautiful hotel " , says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper .	-3.8837
Everything should be renewed in the Black Forest Style .	-1.9509
The rooms are equipped with large walkable showers , the entrance area is redesigned , new windows are built .	-7.0293
Everything should be close to the citizens later , as Thomas Scherer expresses .	-3.0176
" We want to make a jewel out of it . "	-2.3374
Swimming pool , spa area and meeting room are among the facilities .	-6.4804
You don 't want to position yourself at the high level of hotels in Lauterbad , but already at a high city level , Scherer emphasizes .	-3.8047
The Waldhotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to stay wide , explains Scherer .	-5.3066
Both individual holidays , groups or businessmen should feel comfortable in    the  ho .	-5.3185
Talks with OB Julian Osswald and Tourism Director Michael Krause he has already guided , says Scherer .	-3.1225
The ideas of the city are covered with those of the hotel group .	-2.7297
" We are on the same line . "	-1.4419
After investment has been asked , Thomas Scherer does not want to define exac     .	-5.2887
Shortly after one million euros , he expects .            	-5.6060
The external facilities are also brought to front , and that is already clearly visible .	-3.3924
In an interior courtyard a large terrace will be accessible from the restaurant , which is public                	-5.1118
Thomas Scherer is optimistic : " Freudenstadt is a good market " .	-1.6793
Russia ’ s Affair : US Special Investigators Uses Grand Jury	-2.2686
In the Russian affair of US President Donald Trump , special investigators Robert Mueller should have used a so-called Grand Jury after a report .	-2.9320
The body has included the work in recent weeks , wrote the " Wall Street Journal " while appealing to people familiar with the matter .	-4.0315
The newspaper valued the step as a sign that Mueller had extended and intensified his investigations .	-2.6055
The transmitter CNN reported that there are already first submissions of the body in connection with a meeting between Trump ’ s oldest son and a Russian lawyer .	-3.4492
US intelligence services have longer accused the Kremlin of interfering specifically in the 2016 presidential election campaign .	-2.6176
Mueller examines whether there were agreements between Trump ’ s campaign team and Moscow .	-2.3665
In the focus of investigations , several men who acted in the election campaign as a consultant of the Republican .	-3.2509
According to reports , Mueller also took more and more Trump ’ s private and business environment .	-2.3819
The " Washington Post " wrote a few weeks ago that the special investigator Trump personally made the centre and investigated the accusation of whether the President may hamper the judiciary in the course of the affair .	-4.3006
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine this evidence in possible crime cases and to decide whether it should be charged .	-5.1313
Grand Jurys are therefore called chambers of indictment .	-2.7035
Most of them are turned on when they are larger and controversial cases .	-2.8617
The procedure is always behind closed doors .	-1.8007
The body can also be enabled by the public prosecutor to provide people with oath to hear .	-3.8683
According to the transmitter CNN , templates have already been issued that rotate around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian       lai .	-5.6467
People who have been involved in the meeting have been called upon to say that it was in the report .	-3.5005
They should also provide documents .	-1.4500
In addition to Trump Jr. , Trump ’ s consultants and son Jared Kushner , as well as his then election campaign , Paul Manafort , were talking about it .	-5.2274
Legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that showing that Mueller did not intimidate himself in his work and that , if necessary , he wants to act quickly .	-3.6956
However , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the survey of a  charge .	-3.6195
Nevertheless , the establishment of the body of the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Trump      .	-3.3868
In the midst of the new revelations , on Thursday evening , the President used a speech in West Virginia to portray the Russian affair as a campaign of its political opponents .	-3.0364
" Russia 's history is a total invention , " said Trump .	-1.8255
The issue gives the Democrats a way to ' feel good because they have nothing else to discuss ' .	-2.7725
His special adviser Ty Cobb explained in an opinion , he knows nothing about the establishment of a Grand Jury .	-3.0101
But this work usually worked in secret , he emphasized .	-3.4990
The White House supports any measures that speeded up the work of the special investigator in a fair way .	-4.8296
Former FBI leader James Comey said three times that the president was not identified .	-2.6479
We have no reason to assume that something has changed , it said in the declaration .	-3.3482
Mueller was only used after Trump Comey fired .	-2.2869
Because of this discard , accusations of Trump have become loud , he wanted to hinder the judiciary .	-3.3207
Comey said in June before a Senate Committee , Trump asked him to attack the investigations against the national security adviser Michael Flynn .	-3.2071
The President is under great pressure for the investigation .	-2.1656
After presenting US media , the White House collected material against the special investigator and his employees .	-2.8024
The solved speculation about whether Trump Mueller wants to release .	-2.3905
Unlike an independent special investigator of the Congress , such as the Watergate affair around the later resigned President Richard Nixon , Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired by the Ministry of Justice on pressure from the President .	-3.9056
Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step .	-1.9334
Two groups of Republican and democratic senators presented legislative drafts on Thursday , which the special investigator could no longer be so easy to release .	-3.7238
Antarctica : Gigantic Iceberg drives in Antarctica	-2.3819
In the West Antarctic , a gigantic iceberg has resolved from the nearly seven size of Berlin from Schelfeis .	-3.6262
This shared the Bremerhaven Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Sea Research on Wednesday .	-2.2367
The more than a trillion tonnes of severe and 5800 square kilometres now drive to the north and will need two , three years until it is melted .	-4.0259
It is 175 kilometres long and a width of up to 50 kilometres of one of the largest ice giants who have registered researchers over the past three decades .	-3.1676
There is no danger for people .	-5.3411
To what extent climate change has played a role in breaking the iceberg is unclear according to research   .	-5.4765
However , there have been a series of unusual collapses of ice cuts in the region for about 30 years , writing the US Snow and Ice Center ( NSIDC ) in a fact background .	-4.0579
In the opinion of many researchers , this can be related to global warming .                	-5.0351
The now aborted coloss has been part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis .	-3.1683
Schelfeis swims on the sea and is fed by large glaciers .	-2.4405
It continues to grow into the sea and breaks off regularly .	-3.3065
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic peninsul .                        	-6.6557
North of this hell fish was the balance of growth and cancellation a few years ago .	-3.2098
AWI researcher Daniela Jansen writes a complete shellfish there .	-3.7364
It speaks something for the fact that the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is also in danger , because the front edge has never withdrawn as far as it is currently concerned .	-4.0841
In addition , the ice plate is under voltage and can disintegrate if a key is cancelled .	-4.0679
Melting Schelfeis and Iceberg does not increase the sea level because they swim on the water and displace ice as much water as it results from melting itself .                                     	-7.3943
However , the loss of the shellfish leads to the fact that the glaciers can lead directly to the sea and flow much faster than before .	-4.0567
This could possibly increase sea levels , but only to a low extent , writes the British research project to observe the Antarctic ( Midas ) .	-3.5270
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is the fourth largest helicopter of the Antarctic after AWI information with almost 50 000 square kilometres .	-3.8092
At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , on the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters .	-2.8804
There it regularly breaks down .	-3.0699
" Although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct connection with climate change , the ice shield now comes into a more vulnerable position , " said Martin O 'Leary of the British Swansea University .	-3.5228
" This is the broadest withdrawal since the beginning of records , " he also confirmed .	-2.5674
Among scientists , it is controversial whether the Larsen-C-Schelfeis will grow again or long-term decline and possibly coincide , his colleague , Adrian Luckman , added : ' Our models say that it will be less stable ' .	-4.3147
But this will take decades .	-5.9011
Even though these researchers do not rely on climate change on the demolition of this gigantic iceberg , there have been a great many ice-cream of the Antarctic Peninsula in recent decades .	-4.1774
This long Antarctic summit extends towards South America .	-2.2891
According to the data of the British Antarctic Survey research programme , the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has fallen by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s .	-3.0781
The rise in temperature has contributed to the decline .	-2.1831
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed around three degrees in the past 50 years and has thus become one of the areas where temperature is rising most quickly .	-5.2537
CDU Wants H  Rates	-12.9771
Because it is becoming increasingly difficult to occupy free jobs , the CDU is calling for employers ' association to become more attractive .	-3.3891
Only just before the summer break , the district has gained 41 new posts in the administration .	-3.8840
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the circle management in Mettmann .	-2.4001
Now , once again , 17 trainees have their first working da  behi       .	-3.7885
The teaching places at the circle are apparently very much desired .	-3.5642
Around 620 applications were recorded for the places to be awarded this year .	-2.6517
Nevertheless , the circle is lacking staff to meet the increased requirements and tasks .	-3.2415
There are still 50 unoccupied posts at the Mettmann circle .	-6.0040
Among other things , doctors and engineers are searched and forces of general administration .	-3.0076
The CDU would now like to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UEG and counter the shortage of professionals in the administration .	-3.5614
The administration should draw up a concept for personnel generation and personnel development after the desire of the parties .	-5.1133
The aim is not only to cover short-term needs for professionals , but to counteract the shortage of applicants for the future , it sa .	-3.8505
The overall concept should be oriented towards the internal and outside , showing concrete measures for cross-border entries and including an educational offensive , calling for CDU , FDP and U Group .	-5.3911
This is a good approach .	-2.8963
Because the circle has personnel problems that were not known earlier .	-3.4798
Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .	-2.1439
The speech is a real ' competition for public employers ' .	-2.5784
In addition , a high number of employees that leave disease or age from the service .	-7.3535
High time to act , therefore , so that there are no more jobs that are unoccupied .	-4.3310
But Klaus-Dieter Völker , Chief of the CDU Group , goes beyond the joint motion with his party .	-3.0865
He recently carried out a fist-thick surprise when he questioned public staff coverage and amazed the other parties .	-4.2994
Peoples want all the opportunities to be reviewed that will enable an exit from the local employers ' association .	-3.9190
" If we do not come to a satisfactory solution here in the short term , the circle administration with trade unions - perhaps in cooperation with the cities of cities - should seek a household rate , " peoples .	-4.6112
The CDU is trying to pay better for employees and officials than it actually provides for the public service .	-3.7038
The salaries are currently exactly required , increases or more money are only available if you change to a higher level oriented to professional years .	-3.7028
But the tasks of the circle have increasingly grown in recent years .	-2.3670
Only a few weeks ago new spaces had to be established where employees take care of the provisions of the new prostitute protection law .	-3.3197
Last but not least by the rising number of asylum seekers , Thomas Hendele and Director Martin Judge have a problem : they have too little staff .	-2.9474
Italy Exacerbates the Tone o   NGO  Mig  Bai  Boat             	-6.7917
Italy has warned NGOs that use rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they must not continue if they do not comply with new rules for their operations .	-3.3025
" If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue to work , " Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with the Turin newspaper La Stampa .	-2.9866
Minniti 's warning came one day after the Italian authorities seized a boat of the German aid organization ' Youth Saving ' because their team had effectively worked with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration .	-3.6003
The aid organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to express itself to detailed accusations of the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio .	-3.7505
" For us , saving human life remains our top priority , so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , " said the organisation in an opinion on social media .	-3.5741
'We can only judge all the accusations currently being collected after we have collected all the information and judge the situation ' .	-3.4427
The Italian authorities had monitored the boat of ' Youth Savings ' , the Iuventa , since October .	-4.0012
It is suspected that his occupation takes hoseboat migrants on board directly delivered by traffickers and that the smugglers can depart so that the ships can be used again .	-3.9794
At least such a meeting was supposedly only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the acts of the public prosecutor , whose content was published by Italian me  .    1 % of the prosecutor              	-6.2191
The occupation is suspected of monitoring the authority of the Italian coastguard , the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other motives .	-3.4882
Under the Code of Conduct , boats like the Iuventa must have an Italian police officer on board , who monitors their activities .	-5.5668
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far explained to keep to the code : Save the Children , MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain .	-3.1352
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be regarded as unnecessary , but acceptable because they would not bring about ' major changes or disabilities ' of their bailouts .	-3.1802
Among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel Prize Laureate Organization is doctors without frontiers ( MSF ) .	-5.4657
Minniti has now said that the number of migrants arriving after the rescue measures in Italy has fallen sharply in recent weeks , suggesting that the efforts to strengthen Libyan coastguards and cooperate with local mayors have borne fruit .	-3.8743
" In recent days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel , " said the minister .	-2.2155
He announced plans for further discussions with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants that leave these countries in the hope of achieving Europe .	-3.1053

With prominent e-sportsmen under the contract , online one could be far more often present in these markets than sending the Federal Liga Team to Asia only once a year .	-3.9052
What is it all about ?	-1.7768
At e-sport , computer games such as " League Of Legends " , " Dota 2 " , " Counterstrike " or the FIFA football simulation are challenged at competition level .	-3.5896
Long ago , as in normal sport , Ligen established leagues in which professionals are against each other .	-3.8187
And in 2022 , e-sport is already part of the official program .	-2.6818
But is it a real sport ?	-2.2822
For many , the idea is certainly needed .	-2.4897
Ingo Froböse has long addressed the question .	-2.7050
For the professor at the Deutsche Sporthochschule in Cologne , E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in classical sport - for example increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormonal changes .	-3.7357
It also needs cognitive skills , technical and tactical understanding and rapid response capability .	-2.6767
Professional gamers should train not only in the console but also their bodies and respect food .	-2.7207
" The fitting player is a good player . "	-1.7101
Frobosis also sees problems : " Doping becomes more and more a topic " .	-3.0669
Controls are difficult to perform in online games and the scene lacked the structures of classic sport .	-5.5637
The scientist positively highlights the high integrative effect of e-sport .	-2.8578
Players are internationally on the way , that is like a large global family , because there are no intercultural barriers .	-3.0179

In 2016 , it implemented EUR 50 million in Germany , mainly about advertising , sponsoring and large tournaments .	-2.8590
In three years , sales should be 130 million .	-2.0575
This is little against the almost EUR 2.4 billion of the Federal League .	-2.8879
However , e-sport is no longer far from the other established sports such as handball , basketball or ice hockey , " the Deloitte consultants write .	-3.2820
Internationally , many countries are already further .	-2.1363
Large markets are Asia and the US , where ex-basketball players Shaquille O<unk>Neal and Baseballstar Alex Rodriguez participate in the US Team NRG eSports .	-2.5778
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSport betting provider Unikrn .	-1.9620
Some things are doing in Europe too .	-2.3001
In a Norwegian school , e-sport was introduced as a course of teaching , says Froböse .	-3.1662
In the Netherlands and France , according to Dutt , football first league clubs are now obliged to set up an e-sports department .	-3.2435
" In the European comparison Germany lags behind " , VfB explains Röttgermann .	-8.4004

Michelle Carter condemns  Conrad Roy to Suicide b     T  T   S . , M Carter	-11.8306
A woman from Massachusetts has been condemned to two and a half years because she has encouraged her friend to suicide by texts and c c       calls .	-4.3753
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of condemnation behind grids and five years have been suspended on proven proven .	-4.9855
Carter was condemned in June for the negligent killing of Conrad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 .	-2.6881
The father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : " My family is comfortable .	-2.2062
My son was my best friend . '	-1.1614
Carter was allowed to remain free until the appeal .	-2.5268
It was faced with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but its legal representatives argued that both they and Mr Roy suffered a mental disease .	-4.9166
In red trousers and a cream-coloured blouse , Carter stood with tears in the eyes , with folded hands and downward eyes when it was condemned .	-3.6761
" Your actions have brought Conrad Roy " , said the prosecutor said   t  c     .	-3.7906
" She finished his life to make their own better              .	-3.7226
She has not taken responsibility " she said .	-2.0381
" She has not shown repentance " .	-2.7497
But Carter 's lawyer said that it was a ' terrible circumstance that she completely regrets ' .	-3.0234
Judge Lawrence Moniz said , however , that he did not find out that their " age or maturity , or even their mind disease , have a significant impact on their actions " .	-3.4256
A public prosecutor read a statement by Roys Mother Lynn Roy , who said that there is ' no day when I do not mourn the loss of my beloved so                    	-5.2545
I would like him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything .	-10.0674
Roy 's sister , Camdyn Roy , said that it was " persecuted " by the knowledge that it would never participate in the wedding of her brother or be an aunt for his children .	-3.2671
" No longer have this only person with whom I have been together since my birth every day , is a pain that I will always keep for the rest of my life with me , " she said .	-3.2652
The case seems to be setting a legal precedent because there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to call on another to commit suicide     .	-3.2438
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was dead by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014 .	-2.2462
The case drew national attention to itself after Carter ’ s text messages revealed that it encouraged him to end his life .	-7.9155
" Depend on you , jump from a building , start yourself , I do not know there are many ways , " she said in several messages she had sent them in the two weeks before his death while he was on holiday with his family .	-4.3903
At the moment before his suicide she wrote : ' You have to do Conrad ' and ' Everything you need to do is to turn on the generator and you will be free and happy ' .	-3.2919
Judge Moniz said that Carter was looking for attention through the death of Roy and ordered that they should benefit from the case through any      press .	-3.5042
The case has shared legal opinion .	-1.6891
One of the few that Carter defended was Amanda Knox , who was condemned in 2007 because of the murder of her British fellow inhabitant in Italy , before it was freed two years ago .	-7.6657
Mrs Knox , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : ' Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not prison ' .	-2.2678

Joshua Kimmich was allowed to run as a captain at the Audi Cup is no coincidence .	-2.8739
The FC Bavaria dares to the Confed Cup winner a large season - Extra motivation does not harm there .	-3.5051
Something was different from his place in the cabin , which saw Joshua Kimmich immediately , even if the additional piece of clothing was very small                  	-5.1055
But since the second day of the Audi Cup was not , of course , a Philipp Lahm and no manual newer , he made himself the allocated binding to the arm .	-4.7500
" The trainer did not announce it " , the confed cup winner told him , after his first use as Bavarian captain .                      	-6.3445

Those who have been cored to enter Lahm ’ s heritage can only well use a small extra motivation .	-3.9835
Kimmich confirmed : " This is what you want to take responsibility as a player .	-2.9225
On Wednesday , the 22-year-old flied as a mini-lahm over the field .	-2.8432
On the right , that is now his position , the white binding in the poor did their rest .	-3.2850
And at all , Kimmich worked in this starting formation like those who can best take the rower i  hand .	-4.1575
He gave instructions , tried to direct the unplayed force .	-2.4537
He had a glance for the whole , while many others were employed with himself .	-3.2228
Vidal thus overplaying his lack of fitness ( hardly flapped ) ; Renato Sanches with the devil coming out of the services of the Asian journey ( flapped even only ) ; and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle with not negative in their first performance in the Bavarian trikot .	-5.5870
After all , that was very good .	-2.6002
Süle ran next to Kimmich , Rudy before the defense , both acted sovereign .	-2.6807

Companies are satisfied with Rhineland-Palatinate Minister : Economics praises Wissing ’ s Pace	-3.6156
It was often irreconcilable , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when Eveline Lemke ( Green ) was still the economic minister of Rheinland-Palatinate .	-3.2098
This is shown after more than a year in which the new economic minister Volker Wissing ( FDP ) is in office .	-2.6574
Chambers and companies from the region talk about T V request from change in economic policy - and at the same time deal with the old minister .	-3.3121
Frank Natus , Chairman of the Association of Trierer Companies ( VTU ) , says : " Wissing attacks the wishes of the economy that Lemke has all blocked " .	-3.2450
The biggest turn of the turn is Natus in infrastructure policy : the gap of motorway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now top of the country 's priorities .	-4.3376
This year , the Ministry is hoping for a planning procedure , by 2021                       	-6.9900
A role in the country ’ s plans also plays the Trier Western evasion , which is in the priority need of the Federal Route Plan .	-4.4451
The objective is to take the route in December 2020 , says Ministry Speaker Cornelia Holtmann .	-5.2246
Natus sees it as a way to support regional but internationally competing companies .	-2.6835
The Industrial and Commercial Chamber ( IHK ) Trier aims to increase the paragraph in supermarkets and stop the trend of German wine exports for ten years , a Rhineland palate label sug b Wissing .	-4.7303

A premium of EUR 1000 is planned for the existing master test and EUR 2500 when graduates make themselves self-employed within ten years after master training .	-4.4122
But the homework list for the country remains long .	-4.4965
With the planned road engineering , the country misses the necessary staff , Jan Glockauer , the main managing director of the IHK Trier .	-4.3157

Sobering is also the previous broadband expansion in the country .	-2.8357
In 2016 , regional companies evaluated network supplies in an IHK survey only with note 3.4 .	-2.8278

Audi is supposed to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter-reaction	-2.6423
One day before the announcement of Audi said BMW that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles .	-2.3614
The BMW Chairman said that the company believed that ' there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions ' , thereby banning or restricting diesel vehicles to European cities , including Munich , where BMW is based .	-3.6203
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .	-2.2655
None of the companies described companies as a recall .	-1.9152
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules on carbon dioxide emissions .	-2.7318
But the nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma .	-2.3065
The cost of automotive manufacturers to install equipment to neutralize the exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles also increases , which makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .	-3.6406
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of behaving the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem .	-2.9706
Companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so-called switching devices to respect the rules when a car has been tested , but return to normal driving conditions .	-4.0294
Several employees of Volkswagen have been charged in the United States , others are investigated on both sides of the Atlantic               	-4.4961
Last month , the former head of thermodynamics in the engine development of Audi was arrested in Germany .	-4.1314
The former manager , Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be put in court in the United States .	-5.5888
At the beginning of this year , Audi was included in German criminal investigations in Volkswagen after the Audi authorities accused of having installed a system to circumvent emissions rules in Europe , and a request focused on the United States has been extended .	-7.8988
The involvement of Audi in the investigation could hardly burden Volkswagen : the luxury automotive manufacturer contributes disproportionately to the profit of Volkswagen .	-3.5684

Guillermo Mordillo was born on August 4 , 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .	-2.0649
In the first few years as an artist , he became a drawer for congratulations - which frustrated him .	-3.5208
" The happiest day in my professional life was the day when lost in my job , " he said once .	-2.2272
After stations in Lima , New York and Paris , he managed to break through the late 1960s : with the publication of his cartoons in " Paris Match " and then also in " Star " and other leading magazines around the world .	-3.6069
Even in China , Mordillo found many fans .	-1.4468
Time and again , the artist of cities was inspired .	-2.8521
Large , round Mordillo figures are stumbled in drawings with the sleeping tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .	-3.4291
In the early morning , he sits on his own information , according to the character table today , works nearly ten hours daily .	-5.7682
About calendars , puzzles , books for big and small , t-shirts , plush animals and watches , his throlling figures continue to find a lot of dissemination worldwide .	-3.6988
For six years he has been working on a character film and a TV series with his figures .	-2.7004
The main person in the movie " Crazy Island " is a giraffe - murderless most popular animal in his drawings - which has a thousand fusslers as opponents .	-3.2043
For the first time his figures speak in the 3D movie , which will come to the cinema in 2019 .	-3.2009
" I do not know exactly what they will say , it is strange for me " , says Mordillo .	-2.0706
The script is not written by him .	-1.5786

Lavender of Provence of Climate Change	-1.9109
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .	-2.2283
The lavender is declining because of the drought-reminding conditions and insects transmitting diseases , preparing great headaches for scientists and farmers trying to find solutions .	-3.8279
Eric Chaisse , expert of the CRIEPPAM agricultural research institute in Provence , said : " The lavender in the Provence is effectively endangered because in recent years the plant was exposed to the impact of climate change , which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn .	-4.3482
This has an effect on the lifetime of lavender .	-6.5240
There is also a small cicade , a microbacterium that transfers dwarf cicades , and in very dry weather there are very many of them .            .      .	-7.0481
And there is much at stake .	-1.6711
Lavender oil attracts not only for holidays , it is also very much asked for perfumes and cosmetics .  It    i        . I   	-7.8580
Eric Chaisse said : " Instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , underdeveloped and either lacking or weakened .	-2.6469
So we have less parts of essential oil . '	-1.5860
The solutions that are considered include better water distribution and the slowdown of evaporation from the ground , but also the spraying of plants with a protective mix of sound and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dryness .	-3.8436

Murdering a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico	-2.2321
The weekly newspapers Riodoce usually meet Wednesday to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in Sinaloa by organised crime , corrupt officials and continuous drug wars .	-3.9133
But on this day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .	-1.9729
They were informed that it is important to change their routines .	-1.9454
Two high-level journalists discuss what feels safer : they should take their children with the office that were the goal of an attack with grenades in 2009 or let them at home .	-3.6103
Security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the space : opponents , neutrals , allies .	-2.6084
Please propose the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary to reach perceptions and feelings of bel .	-4.7684
There are drug smugglers , politicians , businessmen , journalists who are suspected of standing on the government 's list of salaries or cartels , a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .	-3.2260
There is no rest break from violence , and throughout the country there are more and more journalists in this : at least 25 , since President Enrique Pena Nieto joined office in December 2012 , 589 are under federal protection and until now there have been at least seven deaths in seven states .	-4.5068
Among the latter is their publisher and its inspirator of Riodoce , the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas .	-2.6034
" The biggest error is to live in Mexico and be journalist " , Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books about violence related to drugs .	-2.6496
His mission is deeply felt , although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez , which shows his middle finger with the word " Justice " , depends on the facade of the Riodoce building .	-4.2477
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the reporters discuss their shared topics , the trauma , their nightmares , sleeplessness , pa  paran  .	-4.2117
Although a special attorney was built in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists , the Committee only initiated two criminal proceedings to protect journalists .	-7.8343
As with most thousands of murderers linked to drug trafficking and organized crime every year , the murderers of journalists are rarely being put to justice .	-3.4340
At Riodoce , they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa , even though they are comfortable and although the terrain is now even more traceable .	-3.3560
Without information about the killers , without justice , the meeting to discuss security has little benefit , says Ibarra .	-2.4961
" It is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , " he says .	-1.8370
" As long as we do not know the why , we suspect everyone . "	-2.7676
On May 15 , Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan .	-2.5470
He managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men , for    his         c .       12 t       w           . ,  1 th r  .                              a  s  .                     	-21.6352
The protection drove away in his car and damaged it near .	-5.0384
Valdez was 50 years old .	-1.0085
He left a woman and two adult children .	-1.3900
Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan .	-1.7947
But there is virtually nothing silence on Valdez .	-7.1767
Since Guzman ’ s arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January , Sinaloa has become one of the country ’ s bloodiest battlegrounds , as rival groups fight here to fill the vacuum .	-3.1044
It does not matter that in Sinaloa someone or more people are shot on the street every day or that the graveyard is full of decorated , two-storey mausoleums for drug kings that are greater than many houses for the living .	-3.8591
Forget for one minute that there is a state of " peace " if only one cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trading routes to the United States .	-3.0732
Nevertheless , and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work , Ismail Bojorquez ( 60 ) , a co-founder and director of Riodoce , broke with the blame that he could not protect his friend                     	-4.9308
He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder .	-1.6326
First of all , in February , there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez , a leader of one of the rival cartel groups in the war with Guzman ’ s sons .	-3.1345
This publication may have annoyed the sons , suspected gang members bought each copy of the output as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks .	-3.2613
The second error was not to force Valdez to leave the country to its own security after seizing another newspaper that published the same story .	-2.9629
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists                 	-4.5881
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there .	-2.0353
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined with five colleagues to found Riodoce and sold $ 50 involvement .	-3.2933
In Sinaloa , " it was impossible to operate journalism without encountering the noise problem , " said Bojorquez .	-2.5459
Over time , the newspaper deserved a reputation for bold and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .	-2.6969
Reporters loved to be able to publish hard research without fear of censorship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to treat .	-3.2824
Eight years after the establishment of Riodoce , she received the prestigious " Maria-Moors-Cabot Prize " for her reporting in Latin America  .                            	-6.5045
In the same year , Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in pursuing Mexican drug history , wherever she led .	-4.9862
He admitted voluntarily that he was afraid .	-1.8834
" I want to live on " , he said at the time of the CPJ award .	-2.9298
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa is a way of life , " he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV .	-2.2952
" You have to take over the task that randomly happens to you as a journalist - either that or you play the stupid .	-3.5571
I would not like to be asked : ' What did you do in the face of so many dead ... why did you not say what was going on ? '	-4.6924
The Riodoce team misses Valdez , the fun bird that could curse like a port worker , the friend who was generous with embraces and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .	-2.9480
They familiarized with their routines .	-4.6620
He would always bear his hat .	-1.6743
He would always go to El Guayabo , the bar opposite the office , and always sit at the same table .	-2.6266
Now they ask : Was his love for routine his spoiling ?	-2.4719
His death has also forced her to question her own assumptions about how they can do their work best and remain alive .	-3.3155
" You do not like it if you deal with their women , their children , their clean shops , their secret runways , " to move drugs .	-3.1429
" These things were not allowed " , said Bojorquez .	-1.6150
The result is , even in the best times , a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation .	-2.2873
His own instincts trust .	-1.3437
If it smells wrong , that will remain away .       .	-5.2398
The trouble is , said the publisher of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal that " smell a sense that can be deceived ... and then the cause has happened with Javier . "	-6.5631
The old rules , as he and others say , are no longer applicable in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas , Veracruz , Guerrero and other states where a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home .	-3.3901
The landscape is constantly changing .	-1.7042
In the space where Riodoce employees met for security training , no mobile phones were suddenly allowed , days before known that spyware used exclusively to governments has been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .	-4.2891
Outside , two policemen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 <unk> C ) in the shadow of a tree .	-2.7121
They were charged by the national government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a mid-class district of Culiacan .	-2.9055
Half in joke , some of the reporters wondered whether these officers belonged to the 50 % of the policemen who the governor himself called not trustworthy .	-3.1058
It has been months since the reporters have gone to the mountain landscape , where the drug gangs are in fact under control .	-6.5164
For the output of this week , Riodoce has looked at three main stories .            ...	-7.5860
There was the murder of the brother of the former known Boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa .	-3.9274
They also had an exposé to government expenditure that focused on the home city of the governor .	-7.8097
And there was a group that removed a block from the office of the prosecutor in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan .	-2.7770
There was no official word about who was abducted or as happened , so was cautious when it was time to write what everyone knows in the city : that the restaurant is a favourite local of drug traffickers and authorities .	-3.5152
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belongs to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party ( PRI ) , who dominated almost all the political levels throughout the cent . The restaurant w w                 	-5.4967
Recently , several PRI governors were accused of corruption because of high-quality cases .	-2.7561
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this local , including a son of " El Chapo " Guzman escaped a military attack .	-3.0158
Only a few months earlier would have seen the Valdez column as the best informed source of kidnapping .	-2.8417
" Sooner we would have known what happened " , said Villarreal , 46 , with the nickname " El Flaco " because of its slender body stature .                                	-8.2956
" Now all channels of communication are broken with our sources . "	-2.0160
The Valdez office was dedicated to the storage area for signs and stickers protesting against the murders of journalists because the employees have become something they never expected : activists on behalf of the press .	-3.5207
Reporter Miriam Ramirez snapped a few signs and the next morning went to a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the public prosecutor .	-3.2054
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed , in the western state of Michoacan .	-1.9660
A burned body has been discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is its own .	-2.3466
Throughout the country , journalists have become more vocal by writing in organized protests " SOS Press " on walks and buildings .	-3.1742
On this day the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez .	-2.6894
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day after the murder of Valdez , Ramirez accused the authorities of spying journalists and killing them because they said the truth .	-3.0398
She has since asked that it be redivided by the government because it is concerned that its anger has violated its objectivity .	-3.0792
Valdez repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were " surrounded by organised crime , government officials and an indifferent society " .	-5.2185
In his last book " Narco-Journalism " he wrote that reporters are killed not only by drug gangs , but also by command of politicians and security forces , who have been under a ceiling with organised crime .	-3.8397
Last year , the media guardian " Articulo 19 " assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials .	-2.9691
" In Mexico you die because they want you to keep the mouth " , said Ramirez .	-2.2418
Obviously , the killings have a deterrent effect .	-1.8080
No one forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipa six years ago .	-2.0212
Your body was found with a note supposedly signed by the Zetas cartel : ' Here I am because of my reports ' .	-2.6164
A computer keyboard and headphones were next to their separate head .	-2.0883
Some branches have chosen to close , such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March .	-2.7627
Others continue , as El Manana did from Nuevo Laredo after the murder of her director in 2004 .	-2.4880
In 2010 , the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartel with a leading article on the front page with the heading " What do you want from us ? "	-3.3966
Some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country   .                         	-7.1580
It is a painful decision .	-1.0681
It is difficult to find work in exile , and they still observe the roads and look for risks .	-4.9784
And sometimes they are hunted , as apparently the photographer Ruben Espinosa , who was murdered together with four women in an apartment in Mexico city three months after the escape from Veracruz .	-3.1212
For those who lag behind and continue work , it is a daily dance with risky decisions .	-5.3044
Ibarra , who once wanted to be poet , admits that drug trafficking frightens him .	-2.2922
" Mexico goes to hell , and therefore I was reporter , " he said .	-2.1415
At midnight last Friday , when the last edition was already finished , the editors of Riodoce sat on the citizenship before the office and drank beer when all their telephones began to sum up at once .	-4.0215
A number of shooters with band rivals and security forces near the seaside resort of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed deaths .	-6.3240
The war continued to escalate as promised by a number of cartel messages in the region .	-2.0264
From the boardstone edge they have published the news on the Riodoce website via mobile phone  .      ) . In  this section        t i  	-9.3810
The front page had to be changed next day .	-2.2225
Sirens close by - another shooting in the area .	-3.3606
Bojorquez took a look at the policemen who held guard to see whether they were willing .	-3.0097
If they were afraid , they did not show it .	-4.9086
Under the huge portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose medium finger was visible for all of Sinaloa , Riodoce 's employees followed his tracks .	-3.4598
" How can you only remember this , " said Bojorquez , " if on the same day Javier was murdered , the internship asked me to send her to report on the road . "	-4.0164
Dinosaurs used to evade his enemies	-3.2209
At first glance it looks like a statue , albeit a frightening one .	-2.2058
Now researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible nashorn of a Canadian miner were so well received that experts described it as the " Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs "  .                                            	-7.9008
It was so well received that they could even find that his scary skin was of reddish brown - and they said that she had had something of a " unrest past " .	-6.3628
The report in the magazine ' Current Biology ' called it ' the best-preserved dinosaur ever found and one of the best dinosaurs in the world ' .	-3.0618
The fossil is a newly discovered type of Nodosaurians living in the middle of the crossroads between 110 million and 112 million years ago .	-5.3927
His incredibly well-preserved state has amazed researchers who describe it as " really remarkable " .	-3.0953
According to reports in National Geographic , the tanked plant fresser is the best preserved fossil of his kind .	-3.3112
It was found by Shawn Funk when he found on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta , Canada .	-5.2865
He met something that seemed missing from the surrounding rock and decided to look more precisely .	-2.8406
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology .	-2.1070
They spent the next six years of discovering the wild animal within the 2,500 pound ( 1,100 kg ) heavy earth clumps .	-2.8179
After all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .	-2.2190
" If you blink only a little with the eyes , you could almost believe it has sleeped , " said the main author Caleb Brown , scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum , where the creature is to be seen .	-3.3734
" It will enter scientific history as one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaur copies - the Mona Lisa of Dinosaurs . "	-3.1945
Researchers have found that , although he is covered with an armor and resembles a changing tank , this plant header was probably threatened by meat-freshing dinosaurs .	-4.3287
The strongly tanked dinosaur used a red and white tarning to hide before predators , and used a shielding technique known as counter-shading that is also used by many modern animals .	-4.1759
This would have allowed to mix better into its surroundings and evade its enemies , say experts saying that it was threatened by greater dinosaurs .	-3.5682
The 110 million years old creature from the family of the Nodosaurians made headlines in May for the first time and is now seen in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology .	-4.5485
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell , one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours of discovering it carefully .	-3.3680
The amazing conservation of the copy allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of shapes and armors about his body .	-3.1886
They discovered the contershading , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was darker than its b  bas  .	-3.3986
Although the contershadow is usual , the results are surprising , as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds the animals living today .	-3.2078
It suggests that the dinosaur has been hunted by enough pressure by meat fressing dinosaurs that evolution favored the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival .	-3.6038
But most contemporary animals who use contershading - think of range , zebras or belt animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey , which signals that this nodosaur was exposed to a real struggle for survival .	-4.1282
" Strong predatory behavior on a massive , strongly armed dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the cross-time have been , " said Brown .	-4.0910
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was red brown .	-2.2207
Scientists continue to examine the animal on indications about his life , including his preserved content to find out what it has eaten as his last meal .	-3.4430
They believe that the dinosaur when he died river and driven into the sea where he fell on the back to the sea .	-3.1575
At that time , Alberta was as warm as South Florida today , and rivers and oceans probably were much more landing than they are today .	-2.8649
" This nodo sauries is really remarkable because it is covered with preserved scarved skin , but also remains in three dimensions and maintains the original form of animal " , said Brown .                     	-6.4198
" The result is that the animal today looks almost as much as in the early craft time .	-3.3102
You don 't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it , if you sleep a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that it is at sleep . '	-4.1052
The crossing time was a time when huge theropods , meat-freshing dinosaurs that were on two legs through the earth .	-4.1461
Although the king of them who lived Tyrannosaurus Rex , millions of years after Borealopelta , the armed dinosaur was hunted by some of his fearful ancestors .	-3.1914
This includes Acrocanthosaurus , a 38 feet ( 11.5 m ) long , six tonnes of heavy monsters .	-7.6059
The scientists whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology believe that Borealopelta was sinked and mumified after death in the sea .	-3.5375
The creature was found by Shawn Funk on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta , Canada , g   .	-4.8247
According to the museum it is the best preserved dinosaur in the world , including skin and armor , and is completely from the snow to the hip .	-3.2203
The creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,300 kg ) .	-2.6673
It contained two 20 inches long tips that raised from its shoulders .	-3.2457
The researchers believe that the tanked plant flooder was flooded by the Western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea .	-3.6488
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur preserved his armor in exquisite detail .	-2.5125
The remains of this particular copy are so well received that the skin remains still cover tanks along the dinosaur      t st   ta r .                                	-10.7253
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic , such a level of conservation is as ' rare as a profit in the lottery .	-2.5142
The more I look at it , the more confusing it will .	-1.8649
The remains of the skin are still covered by the hollow tank plates that wear the skull of the animal .	-5.8990
His right foot lies on his side , his five fingers are spread up .	-2.8836
I can count the scales on his sole ' .	-1.8098
In the Width : Mass Carambolage on A8 : Many Injured	-2.9680
Heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : just 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carambolage .	-2.9910
There are many injured people , kilometres of congestion - and gaffers .	-6.3629
On the motorway Stuttgart-Munich ( A8 ) , about 20 people were injured on the late Thursday afternoon at a mass carambolage .	-3.4352
According to the first information of the police , nearly 30 vehicles were interconnected between Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen ( district Aichach-Friedberg ) during a tender .	-4.5405
There was no information about the exact number of injured people fir   e     .     1   	-5.8239
It is light to medium-sized injuries , said a police speaker .	-2.5422
A large range of rescue vehicles was at the accident point .	-2.8151
The A8 was fully locked towards Munich .	-2.1248
In the direction of Munich , an around ten kilometres of long retreat was formed .	-3.7607
As an AZ reporter reports , there were also massive disabilities on the counter-track - through numerous gaffers .	-3.5517
The fire brigade listed the characteristics of the vehicle markers , who now have to expect sensitive penalties .	-3.7769
Shortly after 18 : 45 then a second accident on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and Dasing .	-3.0818
There was a collision between a car transporter and a car .	-2.4003
A rescue helicopter was on the road to the accident point .	-2.1902
Deutsche Bahn : Group tests " Comfort Check-in "	-1.6295
It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced : nothing is sitting in the train and sleeping .              	-4.7472
Or you are deepening in your work and have a genius thought .	-5.9421
And then : bufff .	-1.5653
Comes the creator and arouses a gentle or traps the passenger in the middle of the workflow .	-3.8963
Ticket control .	-1.2681
But the times of interruptions are soon over .	-1.8602
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing creative ticket control .	-2.0974
You simply confirm by mobile phone that you take your place and devalue the ticket .	-3.0857
Currently a test operation is running on two routes .	-2.6417
" Comes the offer , we extend it .	-2.9522
It will then probably be available at the beginning of next year on many other distance routes in Germany " , said a railway sp .	-5.3888
" Comfort Check-in " calls the ticket devaluation without creator .	-2.5111
In order to be able to use them , however , some conditions must be met : you need a smartphone or a tablet .	-3.4211
And you have to book an online ticket - which already does most passengers .	-2.8811
It is also necessary to buy the DB Navigator via the app of the railway , which is also the most convenient type of ticket booking .	-4.0471
Finally , you need a seat reservation .	-2.2673
Because the " Comfort Check-in " works so : you get into the train , call its ticket under " My Tickets " .	-3.8466
A button for electronic devaluation appears at the test customers .	-3.0606
The train accompaniments receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and has taken the booked seat Y                 	-5.0728
Comes the train accompaniment at the ticket control to Platz Y he knows that there is a passenger with already devalued online ticket .	-4.0346
So you can continue to sleep , continue working , silence .	-5.3770
The " Check-in " has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should use passengers .	-3.2382
" If you want to relax without ticket control through our train accompaniment staff , just check in the DB Navigator itse     i           	-6.4342
This allows passengers to make their travel time more personal in the train " , says Michael Peterson , Marketing Board of DB Television .	-2.9071
Second Plus : " And our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs "                 	-5.1845
Those who often drive trains know that , besides delays and missed trains , ticket controls are one of the greatest troubles .	-4.0787
Because often you have yourself , but in any case one of the travellers do not have all the documents you need to devalue online tickets .	-4.1458
Either the credit card or personnel identification card or otherwise a document you must provide .	-3.2093
The result is endless discussions between train companions and passengers , which leads to bad mood in the department or large area and delays in controlling their own ticket and takes the creator time to take care of other concerns at the end of the day .	-4.2724
Only a small number of test customers can use the new service .	-2.0010
And this only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen .	-2.6598
Other train numbers on the same route are not yet opened .	-2.5795
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question : ' Whose Streets ? '	-1.9903
On August 9 , 2014 Brittany Ferrell was shaken until her core .	-2.5205
Only one day after she arrived in New York City sat the born in St. Louis on the bed of an Airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone .	-3.5163
She stumbled over a post of someone from the High School .	-2.1419
" The police has just killed a 18-year-old child , and it is still on the street " , it said there .	-2.7484
Confused because no one else posted the information on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .	-2.8100
A user with the Handle <unk> TheePharoah has been constantly released on their timeline .	-2.6608
The rapper from the area of St. Louis was killing the death of Michael Brown , an unarmed black 18-year-old killed by a white policeman in Ferguson , Mo .	-6.0519
He posted an image of Brown ’ s lively body , which was extended on the street and would remain there four hours .	-3.3592
" This is wild " , thought Ferrell with himself .	-2.7109
But death was nothing new for them and their community .	-1.7527
She deposited her mobile phone to return later in the evening to tweets about people on the Canfield Drive .	-2.8034
There were photos of the police band and people who cried , and by a man who claimed to be Brown 's father , who was a sign with the sign : ' Ferguson 's police has just killed my unarmed son ! '	-3.8921
She was observing a live feed where a policeman was before a group of demonstrators with a blissing dog .	-3.6343
In another video , she said , another policeman ensured his gun and cry : " I will kill you ... animals all . "	-2.9149
" This is not usual " , Ferrell reminded her statement .	-2.5743
" This is not the kind of murder we have got used to and which we can call typical . "	-3.1753
At this moment I felt shaken frost .	-4.5247
I was angry and wined . '	-1.7277
She booked a return flight and went home next day .	-1.8929
After the landing at 23 o 'clock , she brought her 6-year-old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two would travel to Ferguson next morning .	-5.6044
What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the topic of a new documentary , " Whose Streets ? " , in the cinemas from the 11th century .	-2.8001
It is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance , which consists of the perspective of people living in the Community and filling the roads to demand answers .	-3.2696
When Ferrell went to Ferguson with her daughter , who wore a flower dress and a suitable crown , the two discussed a conversation that they had countless times before this morning » about the black experience and the black state <unk> .	-4.1262
" You remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? " she remembered what she said .	-2.8402
" We are now going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and which was not right .	-4.5884
I could not take it with it " , said Ferrell later .	-2.4173
" What happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .	-2.0541
It must know it and see it and be raised in it .	-3.1185
It must be well developed , not only activism and organisation , but also know the different layers of black experience and the black constitution , and what we must do to become free to liberate ourselve         .	-3.8088
Even though I have the happiness to give her an experience where she personally does not experience blatant racism , she is not unlike the next black women 's child .	-7.2343
I have the feeling that I would prove it a bad service to keep them far from it . '	-5.0270
The first station when they arrived in Ferguson was on the South Florissant Road , a place towards the police authority that became a camp area when the activists waited for the possible non-charge of Officer Darren Wilson .	-3.4151
There Ferrell and her daughter have connected to a local business holder who made lunch .	-3.2575
They prepared bags and helped pass them on to demonstrators .	-2.2550
Slowly began to accept a new kind of activism for Ferrell shape                	-5.7352
" My activism has changed completely after 9 August " , she said and noted that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on Essens justice and health inequalities in black communities .                 i  . " I                           	-8.5432
" I had no experience in organizing .	-1.5538
Everything has come . '	-1.5819
Weeks later , Ferrell met during an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan , one of the co-directors of the film .	-2.1051
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to " document " what happened .	-2.1561
One question came to the meaning : ' Do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use ?                       	-6.0818
This scepticism has been fed by countless cases of people , often by whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and their resi cap      comm  .                             	-8.5005
As Folayan recently said in an interview : ' We had heard that people born and grew up in Ferguson did not center their voices and we wanted to do it differently . '	-3.0178
Folayan had already worked with the then Co-director Damon Davis , an artist from the area known for his activism around death stract occupations .	-3.2370
His commitment Ferrell brought the project closer together with six other locals the team followed by " Whose Streets ? " in the years after Brown 's shooting .	-3.2232
" This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us .	-5.8979
'That was the main thing for me , as these people are portrayed , because that is how I will be presented . '	-3.7562
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell 's experience - to show that the movement ' is not a Messiah leader , but a community that comes together ' , said Folayan - she proved to be the most open participant in the film .	-3.4547
As a result , documents of " Whose Streets ? " show surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell 's life as she loves and marries her wife .	-4.9871
" I felt like naked " , said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time .	-2.0548
" But I understood that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanisation of black people . "	-2.9164
Moreover , Ferrell ’ s history repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black-Lives-Matter movement .	-2.4893
Two of the three founders of the movement , which , after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 , have characterized the film " BlacklivesMatter " in social media , identify themselves as  g    gay .	-4.9722
" Black , gay women in leadership have worn the movement as a whole , " said Ferrell , " and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts .	-3.0234
Black , gay women must bear the main burden of everything . '	-2.0496
Folayan agreed to note that ' the movement is really kept up by black women and many black women ' .	-2.4579
However , it insists that " this is not an affirmative type of action " where Ferrell was selected as the heart of the film due to its identity .	-3.2563
" She was the person who shaken this energy , " she said .	-3.1441
" It is no coincidence , although she was on the front , because in a life at these crossroads as a black gay woman stands as much at stake .	-8.3483
You can feel your energy by screen . '	-4.7253
Meanwhile , the news cameras in Ferguson have long disappeared , but the racial links between the community and the police continue to exist .	-2.8798
Ferrell is on proven for 2 <unk> years because of blocking a motorway in a demonstration .	-3.0336
It describes the social atmosphere of the area it calls its home : " A chaos " .	-2.5941
Nevertheless , it clings to a singing and feels committed to this memory since it went on the street three years ago in Ferguson .	-3.8592
" It is our duty to fight for our freedom .	-1.3427
It is our duty to win .	-1.1821

From " Dream " to " Size Madness " : TV readers discuss bit galler             	-6.3982
The bit gallery moves people , even though it is not built for a long ti          i                  	-7.7657
But the idea of a shopping centre on the southern end of the pedestrian zone has divided the population into advocates and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .	-2.9601
Cold leaves the subject hardly any one .	-4.2193
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page " Volksfreund Bitburg " .	-2.5290
While one says to the bit gallery : " This would be a dream " ( Anja Becker ) or " That would be really class " ( Nicole shows ) , comes from the other side : " Need no man " ( Siggi beds ) or simply " size madness ! " ( Lars Scholz ) .	-6.1310
While supporters build on a gallery drawing more customers into the city , which also benefits the rest of the business , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone then bleeds .	-7.6207
In addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the plot on which the farmers ' market hall offers 13 direct marketers its produ . T        i ,           	-6.5092
At the beginning of the construction work this will conclude .	-2.9369
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Beda square with possibility to sit outside .	-3.6905
Simone Rooms : " We have been buying almost weekly in the farm market hall for many years .	-2.5392
Mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of land women are always very happy to have .	-3.7858
We have also discovered the butchery .	-5.4629
We would like to see this offer maintained during and especially after the construction of the gallery .	-3.0361
In other cities there are also .	-2.3825
Above all , the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . '	-2.0857
Gerd Densing : " Whether direct marketers are settled in a market hall in the gallery , the amount of the rent is approxim   .	-5.4050
However , the new project should not be low . '	-3.0748
Eva Kilic : " Why shopping palaces in Bitburg ?	-1.8027
Whether clothing , shoes , drugs or supermarkets : I find that unnecessary .	-2.3976
There is already enough in our city .	-2.3055
You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .	-2.8111
However , since there is not even a proper weekly market here , it is all the more important that we at least have the market hall .	-3.2446
After all , the goods offered there are fresh , mostly directly offered by the producer and is also cheap .	-3.3157
As you can see , shops in a shopping centre are only rented by larger companies , because the rents there are often not portable for a retailer .	-3.7638
There is almost no longer a pity , special transactions , and what is still left of them will probably disappear . '	-4.0725
Wolf Fandel : " A shopping centre with a market hall does not fit together for me .	-2.2230
And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg .	-1.5233
In particular , where should the farmer market hall during the construction period be ?	-3.6441
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long term if the bit gallery comes at some point .	-2.9055
Or does the Ghost Bit-Gallery manage to distribute all the shops from Bitburg ? '	-3.6492
George Marquet : " This will simply not work .	-1.7771
And no one needs a shopping centre that is empty .	-2.5784
In my view , it would have been better to promote a right farming market rather than this gallery .	-2.7377
But for a farm market hall , thanks to the madness of many - I think - pointless construction projects in Bitburg no longer have any place any                  . T 	-7.5800
If the farmer market hall is broken , a piece of culture will disappear again . '	-2.6824
A suitable similarity : Artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA	-2.1851
In the middle of the space of the Fridman Gallery in New York are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which are almost immercial - which depend on cables of the ceiling .	-3.7053
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfern and Haircuts who were sent to her by Chelsea Man      .	-3.4589
Manning sent the cuts from the prison Fort Leavenworth , where the former intelligence analyst sent a 35-year prison sentence after making public diplomatic reports on the WikiLeaks website as secretly classified .	-4.0178
The new exhibition opened on 2 August means A Becoming Resemblance ( A suitable similarity ) .	-2.4101
It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg , whose discipline combined its expertise in technology , computer sciences and art , and manning , a transfer and groundbreaking dissident , whose condemnation of Barack Obama was converted when he had only three days in his office .	-3.9825
Dewey-Hagborg has created a sharp , if also something intellectual , comment not only on the formality of DNA data - the many ways in which they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also on identity                                                                                          	-12.4338
Manning who was born as Bradley Edward , but has already spoken openly about identification as a woman since her puberty , was condemned in 2013 because of 20 charges , including six infringements of the Spy Act , Computer Fraud and Theft .	-5.6424
The prison suppressed her image , so much that there was only one photo - a grainy , black-and-white selfish in which manning visibly sits uncomfortably on a driving seat and wears a platin blond performance - with which she was associated .	-8.5225
In 2015 , Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of her 2012 project ' Stranger Visions ' .	-2.2923
It produced the artist portraits of strangers from Forensian artifacts such as cigarette sum and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from waste to produce an image of what these people could look like .                    	-5.5049
This was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine .	-2.1638
" They led an interview with Chelsea Manning , while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , " said Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition .	-2.8076
And it could not be visited at this time and it could not be photographed , so you contacted Chelsea and asked if it wanted to make a DNA portrait .	-3.1499
The artist and her imprisoned muse have become unequal letter friends who exchanged several letters over two years .	-3.2156
They even created a comic " Suppressed Images " illustrated by Shoili Kanungo , which predicted a future in which President Chelsea 's judgment would be converted and would be able to see the exhibition personally .	-5.4643
Indeed , that Obama was only a few days after the book was published , Manning ’ s release after seven brutal years would demand in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome kind of     ha  fortunat       .	-8.3703
There is also something deep and strong now in the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Trump is leading a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new , tweetable ways to further flame the rigid divisions he should resolve .	-4.5411
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things , she said that ' things happen for a particular reason ' .	-2.8241
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Manning called for an end to the " automatic fragmentation , whose basis has been gender , race , sexuality and culture " .	-3.8940
On the opposite wall its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand fissurer of Cs and Gs and As , is written in pencil .	-3.0165
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to demonstrate how amazingly similar , at least in biological terms , we are all involved in the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucleotides after the advanced scientific lexicon of the artist ) .	-3.8073
" What people will hopefully take with it is that our genome does not take care of who we are and how open genetic data for interpretation and how subjective they are , " said Dewey-Hagborg , whose video work of 2007 , Spurious Memories , is also to be seen .	-5.0487
" DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . "	-2.0876
The last piece in the exhibition stored in its own room is a page from the above mentioned comic novella .	-2.9230
She shows Manning how she appears with an outdoor phone in hand from the disciplinary barracks of the United States such as King-Kong .	-3.4997
" If you cold your speech , then they have won " , it says .	-3.4265
" So never keeps the mouth " .	-1.8591
" It came directly from a letter she wrote to me , " said the artist who greets from Philadelphia .	-2.3346
" I still get goose skin when I talk about it . "	-2.4292
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition personally - just as it was predicted in the comic book - but if it was to do so , it will be welcomed in the middle of the space by the masks , by their own genomic simulations that combine themselves like Hordes of Protesters .	-4.9112
This was also targeted as everything in the exhibition , to the size ( 5 " 2 , Mannings Stature ) , where their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil .	-4.9713
" In the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a lot of human beings " , said Dewey-Hagborg of the portrai .                  	-5.1190
" I wanted it to be like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , such as the movement that was also behind its liberation . "                   	-6.4206
Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of the University of Oxford sought for killing .            	-4.6396
A nationwide hunt is under way for a professor at the Northwestern University and an employee of the University of Oxford , who are sought as suspects after a man had been stopped in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries .	-3.8186
On Monday for Wyndham Lathem ( 42 ) and Andrew Warren ( 56 ) arrest warrants were issued because of murder because of their alleged participation in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau , as the files of the Official Court of Cook County s            	-4.5921
The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau , 26 , died after several sticks .	-1.9315
A Community warning system published by the Chicago police authority says that the body was discovered on 27 July .	-2.3886
Officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza apartments and found the victim with several injuries on its body .	-2.5481
Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead in the place of events , and detectives examine the sticks as murder , while the police actively looks for the two suspects , officials said .	-3.5443
Lathem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at the Northwestern University since 2007 .	-2.0905
Alan K. Cubbage , the Vice-President of University Relations , said in an e-mail declaration that Lathem has now been vacated and has been excluded from the entry of the campus of the Northwestern Univers Universit                  	-5.5555
" This is now a criminal matter investigated by the competent authorities , and the Northwestern University cooperates in this investigation " , said Cubbage .	-2.9374
Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford .	-1.5327
A spokesman of the University and the Somerville College said in an e-mail declaration that ' we are in contact with the police in Britain and ready to help the US investigation authorities in any way possible . '	-3.6117
The statement added that Warren ’ s colleagues were shocked and wanted him to face .              	-4.8287
Chief Communications Officer of the police authority of Chicago , Anthony Guglielmi , said that he strongly called on the suspects to face up to the authorities                              	-6.6823
" The police has an idea of their site , and our efforts to localize them are increasing , " said Guglielmi .	-2.8365
Guglielmi said that local , regional and national authorities are helping to find the susp               	-4.8306
Guglielmi said that the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received a mysterious tip that said that something happened in apartment 1008 .	-3.2706
The police described the scene as very cruel .	-1.2848
Guglielmi said it is unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July .	-2.2400
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and goods were in the building .	-2.0240
" We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship , " said Guglielmi .	-1.9028

" We will conclude the WADA roadmap in the near future " - the Russian Vice-Premier Mutko	-2.4015
The Russian Vice-Premier Vitaly Mutko said that it will not take long until the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency ( RUS   - ) .	-4.3870
" At a particular stage of fulfilling the criteria of the roadmap , RUSADA has received the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD ( UK Anti-Dopin                          	-6.2992
The WADA timetable was updated in this respect , " explained Mutko on Thursday .	-2.5109
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA timetable to comply with the code describing the criteria for the reinsertion of RUSADA and recently published on the organization website .	-3.4818
According to Mutko , he contains nothing that could give cause for concern to Russia .	-2.5073
" Everything has been announced , everything is implemented .	-1.7881
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and WADA in the near future " , he added .	-2.1430
However , one of the criteria mentioned in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must accept the reported results of the WADA-approved investigation by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on supposed public-sponsored dopings in Russian sport .	-3.8862
With regard to the matter , Mutko said : " We are carrying out the investigation because our anti-doping system has admitted an error .	-4.4552
All measures have been implemented .	-1.3149
But there were no state programmes and we will not admit something that does not exist . '	-4.2754
Mutko ’ s words agreed with those of Vitaly Smirnov , the head of the independent Russian anti-doping commission .	-2.1582
In discussion with the Russian sales office RSport at the beginning of the day , Smirnov added problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organisations , but then added : ' We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .	-3.3225
Nobody intends to accept this report unconditionally , ' added Smirnov .	-2.3532
RUSADA was excluded from the implementation of doping controls in Russia in November 2015 in the course of the doping scandal .	-4.7511

The start-ups that will help your company not to become the next Uber	-2.4986
Amy Errett wanted to measure happiness at your e-commerce start-up , but the surveys did not work .	-2.5326
Answers were often vague , little helpful or - even worse - fraudulent .	-1.9788
Even if you promised anonymity , some workers did not trust the process .	-1.7942
" There was simply never consistency and objectivity " , said Errett , who operates the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Company Madison Reed .	-2.6724
She has called people from outside to help .	-2.4395
A new breed of Human Resources Start-ups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel .	-6.4068
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee commitment , it enables companies to carry out surveys , address special groups and demographic groups , offer employees anonymity and complaint hotlines , and in some cases allowing whistleblowers to circumvent the C-Suite managers and to turn directly to the Board of Directors .	-4.2752
" You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for the pursuit of their health , but where is the fitbit for your company ? " said Jim Barnett , co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint , whose software analytics tools is used by companies to measure employees commitment .	-3.4564
Saved she said that she had a better insight into what your employees think and feel won with Glint in the three years .	-3.1413
In addition to the snap surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which managers have low consent results - so you can drill why .	-3.6192
Companies come to realize that at the top of the job culture must remain so that you do not become the next Uber involved in scandals since a former employee published a blog post describing an environment of harassment where those who have spoken were punished .	-4.3388
For start-ups like Glint , this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity .	-2.2468
The global governance , regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 118.7 billion in 2020 , according to the Let 's Talk Payments financial technical site .	-4.2569
Denver , Colorado , Start-up Convercent , which helps companies prevent and recognize bad behaviour , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of the Uber Fall in discredit .	-4.4601
Convercent has almost 600 clients , including Airbnb , Microsoft and Tesla .	-1.5299
Uber hat vor kurzem als Klient angemeldet .	-1.7284
Like Glint , Convercent lets companies send tailored " pulse " surveys , gather confidential answers in real time and view the heat cards of your problem areas .	-3.3628
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behaviou              	-5.8010
And if the main manager is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .	-2.3202
" The court of public opinion has collected the regulators , " said Patrick Quinlan , the founder and managing director of Convercent .	-2.6648
If a company is found that treats its employees badly or behaves unethically , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycott , worker fluctuation and complaints , said Quinlan .	-3.5229
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations , has used Convercent for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have a simple way to achieve their corporate centr                                  a              	-7.6061
Sooner , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .	-3.2958
It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vitrano , Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel , who said that there was no good way to pursue the complaints of employees .	-4.0218
Now that the company uses Convercent , problems hidden and addressed by leaders who have been in offices in cities or states , such as discrimination , harassment or unfair practices .	-7.5817

Companies started to take ethics , values and employee commitment seriously in 2002 after the accounting company Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical infringements by the Enron scandal , Quinlan                	-4.8651
But it took until the " social media came to their right " that companies recognized that you could not prevent their dirty linen from went online .	-2.7099
" Before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , " he said .	-1.8289
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service and burden companies with recurring fees for the use of their products .	-2.8461
It is a business model and an opportunity that finds the agreement of Venture Capital Investors who supported both start-ups .      i  .	-5.8483
Convercent received $ 10 million in financing in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital , thereby increasing all capital to $ 47 million .	-3.1059
Glitzern secured $ 10 million in November of Bessemer Venture Partners and brought his entire funding to $ 60 million .	-2.8378
These investments are hardly surprising , given the networked nature of companies , culture and venture capital .	-2.4904
There is a growing complex of research , which shows that today 's employees are expecting their jobs more than they have been up to   momen  .             	-4.7050
In competitive markets like Silicon Valley , high salaries and interesting projects are only bets .	-7.3917
Employees want to feel that you are accepted and estimated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .	-2.6981
" If people are glad to be in a company that belongs to their voices , and that the work you are doing , they feel more committed to making this company successful , " said Nina McQueen , Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn , which uses both Convercent and Glint .	-3.5138
Investors reach returns when their portfolio companies run well , companies run well when employees are using and committed .	-3.4781
When the Analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and use of employees , it is no wonder that you find support .	-3.1301
The data on employee commitment according to the experts of the job culture important .	-2.7905
But the data is useless if the managers of a company do not take measures .	-2.5302
Indeed , if a company asks employees for your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way .	-2.6809
And if change does not come fast enough , or at all , this can breed disappointment and demotivate employees .	-3.1733
" If you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be ready to have 4,000 conversations , " said Russell Raath , President of Consulting at the business management company Kotter International , who has seen companies that have relyed too much on collecting data .	-3.3615
" Because if you do not follow , employees wonder , " Have you really heard me ?	-5.3402
Do you take care of this ?	-1.5086
And if you do not take care of why should I ? '	-2.2997
Madison Reed , who is now carrying out monthly employee surveys , was able to take measures on the same day when a problem is reported about Glint , so Errett .	-3.5782
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees , it was capable of reorganizing several teams within the company and adding a communication training to address the pro                                           	-7.5253
At Ruby Tuesday , the company always receives new insights on the employees , and it hopes in the long term that this will lead to better linking workers in an industry known for high sales .	-3.7899
" If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people " , said Vitrano .	-1.9674
" And if you lose people , you also lose customers .	-1.8758
And if you lose customers , you will lose companies .	-1.7928
NCAA eliminates the two-day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins	-2.4160
It approaches at 23 am when a lot of UCLA football players maintain themselves on one side of the new exercise fields of the team on the campus .	-4.2957
Some have drawn their tricoto parts and show the backs full of welding from the first day of the training camp .	-4.7574

Players who are registered at the summer courses will return to their final tests after the three-hour exercise before they return to the Waterman Football Center the next morning at 6 : 30 .                     	-5.8529
" This is a real mill for the guys the next three days , " said Bruins trainer Jim Mora shortly before Monday became Tuesday .	-3.2138
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to facilitate the burden of the players , and it has actually extended its days - at least until the final                  	-4.7578
Therefore , the first three trainings of UCLA should start at 19 : 15 to meet the already fully packed timetables of the playe    .	-4.0049
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day on which the Bruins postponed the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras six times in Westwood practical exercises .	-3.7733
You should hold 18 exercises during the course of August , 20 before the beginning of the formal preparations for their act against Texas A & M in September .	-4.1880
Mora said that he supported the regulation of NCAA , even if they add another point to the many employed routes of players .	-3.1930
" We put this enormous burden on them three or four days , and it is very challenging " , said Mora .	-2.4858
" And they simply pressed it , they continue to place , they are great people .	-4.3159
I think it will really be great as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time . '	-2.8337
The UCLA will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished , which will not be an easy task , given the clear views of its fields , by an adjacent car park and the adjacent Luskin Center , a hotel of the highlighted class , which has already been thrown out with footballs that allowed a protection network behind a gate fost .	-5.6975
Bruins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mora acknowledged that there might be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the seas .         s  .	-7.0595
" We will use our security " , said Mora .	-1.7041
" This is a real problem , and it is not far to think that people rent a room there and then adjust to recording an exercise .	-3.2689
If you have the video band from an exercise , it is a fairly good business .	-2.5876
But we have security forces there and we have security forces at parking lot 8 .	-6.9600
We will do the best with what we have .	-1.3502
I am therefore not too great concerns .	-2.5209

Facebook wants to intensify fact ch in the fight against falsified messages	-2.9877
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false messages to third party facts checkers and then display their results under the original contribution , said the world 's largest online social network on Thursday .	-6.8054
The company said in an opinion on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to recognize possible false messages and send them to facts verifiers who may show results of fact checking from the original article .	-4.0662
Facebook was criticized as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news , many of which believe that they also influenced the US presidential elections in 2016 .	-2.8067
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French electorate flooded with false stories in the run-up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan that social media networks should be punished if they do not succeed in removing hatred postings like the elections there quickly in Septembe  .     T                                    	-7.2787
On Thursday , Facebook said in a separate declaration in German that in the US , France , the Netherlands and Germany a test of the new facts review was started .	-3.0859
" In addition to the recognition of the stories of facts checkers of third parties , people want more context to make sound decisions about what they read and share , " said Sara Su , product manager for Facebook news in a blog .	-3.6309

But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cosy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become an inspiration for a graphical novel by Jamie Rhodes , a mophaarised Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents .	-3.5709
" I find it so beautiful to look at the manuscript of someone who has been dead for 300 years , " he says humble .	-2.7806
" What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hands . "	-4.6750
" A Castle in England " spans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scotney .	-21.1993
It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive : he wrote ' Dead Men 's Teeth and Other Stories ' in 2014 , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly emotional .	-2.7468
" I responded only to the thumb printing on the page of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700 's who worked for the Jacobiners " , he says .	-5.8260
" That is his thumb printing !	-2.1239
And letters always smell after smoke , because at that time one lighted a fire because of light .	-3.6819
For someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he were himself also here .	-2.9011
Oh , I love archives ! '	-1.3128
For someone beaten with old papers , he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( " To be honest : I have my welcome greeting a little overvalued " ) this seems too beautiful to be true .	-3.6899
Rhodos spent his days exploring the Victorian " new " castle , looking through the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle , such as the mounted heads on the walls and the bottles that spent centuries in the digging .	-3.6919
He walked through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape carers , gardeners and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .	-3.0322
Then , at night he drank " whiskey and began to write " .	-1.8664
The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown , as the National Trust received full access only in 2006 when the last Erbin , Elizabeth Hussey , died .	-2.9908
When Rhodes arrived a decade later , employees began to take care of the archive that he described as " hundreds of years in which Aristocrats said " Oh , thrown it on the roof bottom .	-3.9718
Diaries , letters from the time of the English Empire , cards that represent who owned what : " You could think that land conflicts would be boring " , says Rhodes , " but there was a birch to fight two families .	-3.9171
Guys , let everything go ! '	-2.3601
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive into English history on a broader basis , including ' The Labourer ' , who follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the 1381 farm uprising .	-3.8039
" There is a record of a turmoil which occurred in the castle in 1380 , in this book with the title ' Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex ' , says Rhodes .	-4.5454
" The farmers ' uprising started in this area and I thought that an uprising was a good start .     I      	-4.5473
Perhaps the two are linked together ? '	-1.9594
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - such as ' The Priest ' , which tells the history of the Jesuit patern hidden by the Darrell family for seven years during English reformation .	-3.2821
Or ' The Smuggler ' , where the smuggler Arthur Darrell was displayed from the 18th century , who staged his own funeral by filling a collar with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later than his color was excavated ) .	-4.5058
The darrels are Rhodes ' favorite family of Scotney : ' The gentlemen seemed to be rather gauners , repeated debt and spend money on things they could not afford .	-3.7531
Other generations of darrell men resolved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a cluster of well-looking guys , with a talent to advertise her . '	-3.5465
After the end of his use in the castle , Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences	-2.5101
He has brought a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel over Elämänmäki , the terrain of a sanatorium from the early 20th century , which has since been reclaimed by nature .	-3.6835
But Scotney has a special place for him .	-1.7328
" I was sad to go back , " he says .	-1.5027
It was like : ' Oh , now I have to cope with the damned life ' .	-2.9993
Campaign started : More than 300 years old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf	-2.4709
With the prevention of the 301-year-old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf , the city of Bad Honnef launched its campaign on Friday to introduce a new roof brand ( Thursday ) .	-3.7151
Until Thursday , Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and slogan secret .	-2.4969
At the end of August there should be a celebration of the campaign on the island of Grafenwerth .	-2.8696
" Too beautiful for us .	-1.3218
Or ? " , the makers of the action have asked the posters at the Rhöndorf Chapel since yesterday .	-3.2544
" We do not really think this ( of course ! ) , " they write on their website yesterday .	-3.6117
" But we use this measure to win your attention .	-1.8439
And to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .	-2.0069
Basically , we are firmly convinced that we as Bad Honnefer citizens know very well about the beauty and attractiveness of our city . '       .  .         . !  ! !	-7.4504
The action is about more than " just " a logo and a slogan , it continues .	-2.7833
" It is important to formulate a single promise , one that gives the city an unmistakable sole feature " .	-3.4322
Finally , they are in competition with other municipalities .	-2.3456
The city of Bad Honnef can cost its new roof brand and the campaign at a medium five-digit amount .	-3.6337
Military Reforms in Turkey - Erdogan ’ s Fear of the Army	-1.5948
Every year at the beginning of August , Ankara advises the Supreme Military Council ( YAS ) on retirement and transport in the officer corps .	-3.3345
So this week .	-1.9245
At first glance a normal process .	-1.6513
But nothing is routine at Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt .	-2.7693
The sitting took place no longer in the building of the general staff , as previously but at the headquarters of the Prime Minister .	-3.1407
The Heads of Government now also participated in the discussions of the five Vice-Premiers and the Ministers for Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs .	-3.5048
The civilians in the YAS were therefore in the number .	-7.5526
The government attracts the reins in the military .	-2.0184
General Staff Hulusi Akar remains in office , but the commanders of the army , the air forces and the navy were deposited .	-3.2930
Since the failed coup , Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals .	-2.4600
More than 10,000 soldiers have been removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged connections to the movement of the exile preacher Fethullah Gülen , who sees Erdogan as a wire drawer of the coup test .	-3.9514
Negotiations have been negotiated in Ankara since this week against 486 people who have been directly involved in the coup atte .	-7.7994
Erdogan had already described the trial as a " gift of god " on the day after the coup , because he gave him the opportunity to clean the armed forces " fully "   .	-4.8925
But does Erdogan really have the army under control ?	-2.2624
At the end of February , the newspaper " Hürriyet " published an article with the heading " Unease in the military headquarters " .	-2.5873
In the general staff , there are concerns about an increasing " Islamisation " of the army , which , among other things , manifested in the waiver of the headscarf ban for soldiers , wrote the newspaper .	-4.0433
In any case , the major cleaning of the army and the security forces continues .	-3.2664
In mid-July , Erdogan fired another 7395 state servants by decree , including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers .	-2.8501
It seemed that Erdogan had tamed the military .	-2.0339
The generals were considered earlier than the country ’ s real masters .	-2.8684
Three times they couped on their role as guardians of the secular system .	-3.1174
After his electoral victory in 2002 , Erdogan pushed back the power of the military ’ s step backwards , not least with regard to the European Union ’ s reform standard      .	-5.6859
Former officers say that Erdogan specifically pushes forward Islamisation of the armed forces .	-2.8310
In the " Vocal Europe " magazine , a non-called officer warned that the Turkish army would be full of extremists and salafists in a few years ' time for fear of persecution abroad .	-4.0714
If that is true , such a development could not leave NATO cold .	-2.5651
In any case , there are doubts about the willingness to use the Turkish army in the alliance .	-3.3040
The leadership structures and operational skills are " weakened " , say NATO diplomats .	-2.1301
Washington Changes the Green Card	-1.4185
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Trump , quoted by the media .    i            	-4.3370
It provides for legal immigrants to be reduced to 50,000 per year , stricter rules for the achievement of visas for a temporary working permit and restrictions on family-oriented visas .	-3.3493
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President .	-1.6172
The draft law is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .	-2.4286
'This law will reduce poverty , increase wages , and save billions of dollars for taxpayers , and will do so by changing the way in which citizens from other countries are spent on Green Cards . '	-3.0028
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .	-1.5325
This new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , " said Trump , quoted by the American media .	-3.0917
Ministry Wants to Race Shuttle	-2.7136
Over the past few months , time and again , the future of the racing shuttle has been disputed - now it is to go quickly .	-4.6478
Before the end of the year , the marode route on which the tourist train drives is to be built .	-3.8523
In order to safeguard the future of the racing shuttle in the long term , according to the Ministry of Transport , construction work should begin on the track this year .	-4.1101
" With the decision to continue ordering and restoring the Ilmenau race route , the country commits itself to this mainly important connection to tourism , " explained Secretary of Transport Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt .	-4.0975
The cost of repairing the track was around EUR 2.5 million .                  	-6.8705
From this sum , the country takes over 75 percent .	-2.7280
The contract , on which the shuttle should be ordered by the country in the future , is currently being finally voted , explained sense .	-3.6701
The Ministry and South Thuringia Railway as operators are already agreed on technical details .	-2.7132
" This negotiates the timetable , the vehicles used and the quality standards " , said Sühl                                .   	-9.3195
The planned contract between the Ministry and the Railway Company is closed for a duration of 11 years .	-2.5396
This will regularly order the race shuttle at December 2017 .	-2.9117
The racing shuttle is a popular tourist connection between Ilmenau and Race Stations ,  esp    .       2                             	-11.1310
Over the past few months , pilot operations have been tested whether the route is used by sufficiently many people to regularly order it in the future .	-3.7822
The route is also strongly conspicuous in parts .	-2.7421
The rise of sex robots is real and we should worry about	-5.5456
Just as you thought that it could not become even more crazy in 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots comes .	-3.1800
Yes , indeed .	-1.3136
Sex robots are currently a great thing .	-1.7970
Recently , the Foundation for Responsible Robotics ( Foundation for Responsible Robotics ) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years .	-2.4505
According to Noel Sharkey , emerited professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR , we must start taking their rise seriously .	-2.5931
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its form of breast roll and the type of fingernail .	-3.0252
" People are funny about them , but companies deliver a lot of them , and we will see them even more frequently , " said Mr Sharkey in publishing his new report .                            	-6.8139
Modern sex dolls have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with deliberately human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence .	-3.0231
The user can also choose to " adjust " his robot according to his convictions , from the eye color of the robot to the form of breast warts to the type or color of his fingernails .	-4.5043
But it will be even more worrying because many robots have the ' personalities ' that a Stepford woman would look progressive .	-4.7133
Modern sex dolls have developed into robots with a silicone skin .	-2.0361
The RealBotix robot allows , for example , its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing , such as shy .	-5.9165
And then there are the Roxxy Gold Sex robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as " Frigid Farrah " , which gives the impression of shy and " Wild Wendy " with an " adventurous " personality .	-3.5040
" Roxxy Gold has a personality that is as good as possible to your personality , " swarms the website of True Companion .	-2.7351
So they like what you like , and they do not like what you like , etc .	-2.3932
She also has her atmosphere over the course of the day - just lik    re          	-5.8473
It can be tired of being fixed on conversation or it can be " in atmosphere " !	-2.8278
There are many worrying aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subject female properties , the allegations of rape when you take a step towards Frigid ( here : reluctant ) Farrah , concern one most .	-4.2076
On his website compared True Companion Roxxy with a vibrator , but for men .	-2.0230
" If women ( sic ) can have a vibrator , why can men not have Roxxy ? " is it on the website .	-10.5595
However , these sex robots are not just a fetish or just keep another sex toy .	-2.6592
Their emergence and increasing refinement point to something darker and deeper in our culture , to a withdrawal from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with subjugation as optional addition .	-3.3579
Most men will , of course , not keep sex robots , and while the FRR notes its rising popularity , they will remain provisionally on the edge of consumer culture .	-3.7905
But what through the peripheral zones can be very instructive with regard to the spirit of the time we live in .	-3.6853
And many people are not strange or insulting until they give the free market permission to do so .	-2.4691
There is a certain overlap that these advanced sex robots are appearing at a time when women 's rights are threatened worldwide , in which there is a president in the White House who has booked to attack women sexually .	-3.9880
The most deterrent aspect of the television series ' The Handmaid 's Tale ' ( ' The Report of the Magd ' ) are not the graphical images , the swinged bodies and the eyes emerged , but how realistic this vision works .	-4.0654
The Republic of Gilead is a jump , but at the moment this does not feel like a great jump .	-2.4186
The goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as possible technically ( albeit with pornostar proportions ) .	-3.0263
Their builders want them to feel humane that they are imitating the movement of a real body .	-3.0758
But , when it comes to ' personalities ' , the robots are not real women .	-2.4492
You cannot separate yourself from your companion or just go away .	-2.5929
They have no conciliation or background history , nothing that suggests independence or anything that could disrupt the imagination of total subjugation .	-3.3108
In other words , they are complacent slaves .	-1.8298
Or to express it in the 2017 speech : Service girls	-2.0846
Trump ’ s Great Performance ?	-1.5480
He Makes Common Sense	-2.8038
It has become an interesting wisdom of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarized the US electorate have also divided families in small format .	-3.1826
Around Christmas and harvesting festivals , there were newspapers in the United States with advice about how to deal with the horror of Trump    elec   in                          	-8.9703
We all supposedly strict ourselves to place our filter bubbles .	-2.9290
Less noted has Trump ’ s power to bring together families .	-2.1624
I mention this because my cousine , a left-wing poet living in Chicago and has long been dealing with the Republicans in our family , visiting me in New York this week .	-3.0852
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .	-1.9873
With Trump in the White House , anyone who knows it , including the Republican relationship with which it had fought for decades because of politics , is suddenly on the same side .	-3.3170
This is certainly a good thing to do with the dining table , but it strikes me in another context that this also brings considerable risks .	-3.8341
The left was strengthened by Trump , but the distorting effect of his presidency has the power to postpone us all to the right .	-4.1434
When we talk about ' normalisation ' and Trump , we refer to the grussy opportunity that one day his matches will no longer remove us .	-4.2327
However , there is an even more terrible long-term scenario in which Trump " normalizes " Republicans of the right wing , who suddenly appear sensible at once compared to its standards .	-3.7651
Today I find myself falling from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney 's urcomic version of the crazy - the dog on the roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew what his tax declaration looked like ) - the two occurred as very mild crimes compared to Trump .	-4.4479
If Trump goes , the next Republican candidate must be only mentally healthy to qualify itself as an immeasurable improvement .	-3.0377
When my cousin was in the city , we brought our children to the carousel in the Central Park , the largest of the carousels of the New York parking department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don 't need a caf .	-5.4049
The horses are enormously large , the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are stunning and the animals turn to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climping music transmits this in a stran                                    . The    	-9.3579
So many clichés of a city disappoint : the views of high buildings are old , the skylines are familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city is not fair to the dream .	-3.3868
Thirty-five years later , and I am still not entirely above the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the topic Pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage counts not - but a large roundabout in the north of London .	-3.6527
However , the Central Park Carousel is still a strange magical experience , because here two two-year-olds , a 11-year-old and two women can go to it in the 1940s and have a great time all .	-8.6961
If I could have assessed the carousel , I would have given him the full number of points , but fortunately no one has asked him for t   .	-4.9170
On the other hand , I was forced in a department store this week to evaluate my " experience " with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could push through my credit ca .                        a       .  T 	-7.3689
In the coffee house on the corner of my road it is the same , plus the option to compare the evaluation with a 15 % drink money - this is to buy something about the shop table .	-3.4417
This not only leads to a slowdown of what should actually be a neutral exchange , but also exerts pressure on the server to introduce personality into a situation where none is needed .	-3.4855
The poor woman in the department store was apologizing , while I tired of experience to reach my credit card with five stars .	-3.3879
Oscar Pistorius with breast pain from prison to hospital	-2.8123
For the second time , Pistorius has left the prison for a hospital visit . T '     '      	-4.8396
Last year he was brought to the hospital because of the treatment of cuts to his hand joints , according to which he suffered the prison authorities after a case in his cell .	-3.6490
Pistorius was condemned against a first dead sentence because of murder after an appeal by public prosecutors .	-3.2658
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine 's Day 2013 by shotting them several times by a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria .	-3.3800
Pistorius claimed that he considered his girlfriend to be a nightly intruder who hid himself in the cabin .	-3.3011
The public prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six-year prison sentence of Pistorius Appell , which they say that they are too inte .	-3.9075
The National Criminal Enforcement Authority said that it will object to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the opposition can be heard this year .	-2.9038
Pistorius risks increasing his punishment to 15 years when prosecutors are successful .	-2.4811
There is no death penalty in South Africa .	-1.0843
As Bauer Arnold a Strange Egg	-2.3800
As the last of the Blumberg schools , the fourth classles were released from fuets and epfenhofen in the holidays and in the continuing schools .	-4.6262
Three of the dismissal students in the future go to the gymnasium , four to the real school .	-3.1640
On Tuesday evening , Schuler Angelika Sitte welcomed parents and representatives of the public in the Bürgerhaus Biesental in Epfenhofen .	-2.7997
As a symbol of school redundancy , the 29 students of the four classes , led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder , chose a young eagle who grows up in the chicken courtyard , but then will be released into freedom .	-4.3019
The mutere shar led a musical with the title " Der Adler im Hühnerhof auf " .	-3.5394
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg , and let it breed from his chickens .	-2.6996
Instead of a chicken came out a small eagle .	-2.2641
But the hope of making a chicken from him dismantled , the eagle spread his wings on a high mountain and decided to d .	-3.8557
After that , the classes showed three and four chicken dances in the study of Yvonne Frank .	-2.9432
The hens danced with the young gockles that weared cylinders to the bet .	-2.4481
The eagle stands for integration , said school head Angelika Sitte .	-4.1042
The young animal is different from the other young animals ( chicks ) , but it is one of them .	-3.3747
He will never be like a chicken .	-1.4875
His provision is to be free .	-1.5749
She wished every fourth classle that he feels accepted in his new school .	-3.1594
It was followed by thanks to my fellow Members , the former school director Michael Müller , who repeatedly jumps into teaching bottlenecks and parental representatives .     T    . (      ) . T  	-7.6135
The chicken time is now over , explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher .	-4.6955
They released their students after two years of lessons only very unfortunately , because it was a really great time .	-3.9402
Finally , they have been able to rely on the fourth classes .	-2.8712
To conclude , all students sounded a song of summer time and holiday time .	-2.9728
In this respect , children expressed great pleasure .	-3.5308
For the new school year eight first-class classes are already registered .	-3.3557
Two Bulgarians Arrested for Illegal Camping	-6.1809
Two Bulgarians were imprisoned for illegal campings in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted by television .	-2.6769
On the morning of 1 August , a group of illegally tentative people was arrested by the police in Sithonia , including the two Bulgarians .	-2.7059
On the same day they were released while an investigation is currently under way .	-2.6273
The Foreign Ministry reported bTV that the Bulgarians were later released .	-2.0739
The Greek authorities have exacerbated control over the free camps and put significant fines to anyone who is found in a place that is not intended for this purpose .	-3.5986
Controls are continued throughout the season .	-2.0848
The Ministry said that the court can impose a fine .	-1.6780
Software update for diesel vehicles : What the people affected now need to know ?	-2.8535
How exactly does the software update take place ?	-1.5443
Do diesel drivers have to participate in the action ?	-2.1561
The most important questions and answers are about to t   l    .	-3.4606
At the Diesel Summit BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars .       i                  	-6.7266
They should improve the exhaust behaviour of cars of the emission classes Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 .	-2.9561
Euro-4 diesel or worse are excluded .	-1.8921
Anja Smetanin from the ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments :	-2.0667
Is the new action obligatory ?	-1.4723
No , the negotiated software updates are voluntary .	-1.4269
" The obligatory updates previously apply only to vehicles that have shummle software " , says Anja Smetanin .	-2.9360
The Federal Bundesamt ( KBA ) has arranged their retrofitting .	-4.2767
How and when will customers be informed about updates ?	-2.0274
The manufacturers have announced a speedy implementation over the next few months , but have not yet mentioned any precise date .	-4.5958
Daimler has informed everyone involved .	-2.4841
If any inspection is due , it will be done within their framework .	-2.6942
How long will the conversions as a whole be d               	-6.1995
" Hard to say " , means Smetanin .	-2.3057
This depends on the commitment of manufacturers and political pressure .	-2.1810
" Because we have seen that voluntarily the car manufacturers do not act on the environment so far . "	-4.8853
How long should the update take ?	-1.5943
The conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .	-2.1314

Traditionally , US President Donald Trump will receive a reception and participate together with his wife Melania .	-2.7336
The progressive TV series announced Lear winner therefore already announced that participation in the gala should be participated .	-4.3539
The ' New York Times ' said : ' This presidency has decided to completely neglect arts and human rights - even to escape funds - and that burdens me . '	-3.8730
The 59-year-old Estefan stressed that it would use the talks with Trump to make its view clear .	-3.0552
The Kennedy Centre , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital .	-2.5327
Former winners include Meryl Streep , Aretha Franklin , Robert De Niro , George Lucas , Tom Hanks and Sting .	-2.0294
We Make the City Worth L  . 	-5.8890
Roland Wacker , Haslach 's city building master , is going to pension next year .	-3.3430
The position is already tendered - appropriate candidates are rare    .	-3.6929
For 31 years Wacker Stadtbaumeister has been .	-2.2681
And the work still makes him great fun as he provides in the press conversation              	-5.3165
He reports of varied , but also demanding tasks waiting for his successors .	-6.5722
At the same time , it is wondering that no application has been met with the requirements profile .	-3.2352
The city is looking for an architect or construction engineer at the nearest possible time .	-2.5180
This means - with regard to the regular termination periods - that enough time should be for inpu .    T         	-6.2841
As Haslach functions as a lower construction authority for the administrative community , the applicant must provide appropriate conclusions .	-3.2226
Because this function wants to keep the city in any case .	-2.8246
If they could no longer complete them , the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for consultation .	-3.6841
But closeness to the city and its own importance is Wacker , who reports of a good operating climate and good mood between the authority and citizens .	-3.4807
In more than 30 years in office , some important projects have collected , which look back on wackers with pride .	-3.8733
" We make the city lifeworthy " , he is safe about the building office and his employees .	-3.3920
In the future , however , varied projects are on the agenda : the transformation of the former Hukla area and the Lower Hofenparkplatz have increased .	-4.6686
The cinema bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed , also the stadium renovation is still topic .	-3.1781
The latter alone will be beating around EUR 1.5 million , " if we make it right , " Wacker estimates .	-10.7133
" All in all , great tasks are waiting for my successor .                        a  i	-8.7137
The work here is fun . '	-1.3715
Design is available for a city master of large margins .	-3.5463
With Haslach ’ s own building station and gardening , much can be responded quite flexibly to much .	-3.6197
" You can move much " , says Wacker , and the design of the green plants is often mentioned by citizens and visitors .	-3.0925
Since the old town is under monument protection , whether it is important to have " an eye to what purely fits " when new buildings are approved , the divine city builder emphasizes .	-6.2150
In any case , the city master has a high responsibility .	-2.9992
He is Bauherr , " in the end everything runs here above my table " .	-2.6449
In support and coordination , he can count on many years of employees : Markus Neumaier ( high construction ) has been in place for ten years , Manfred Schöner ( deep-building ) has been already in the past 15 years .	-5.0210
Also that his successor remains long , Wacker wishes himself : " We are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the place " .	-3.5508
Because continuity is not only important for a good operating climate , but also for further design of the city .	-2.6582
If you want to inherit Roland Wacker , you should be able to present a completed study as a diploma engineer or bachelor with architecture and have good expertise in the areas of construction and construction planning .	-4.5377
The city construction office subjects to high and deep construction , construction planning , basic advertising matters , management of urban properties , urban operations with building station and city gardening as well as lower construction rights authority , including monument protection .	-5.2420
Bicycle thrown on lines : South railway line	-3.7267
According to the police , the unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bicycle of the railway transfer in the area of the Leobener Stra<unk>e ( B116 ) .	-5.8939
These were so damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .	-3.0345
The investigators have two male perpetrators and have been looking for them since the night .	-3.0587
Near the Tatort , witnesses were observed a rosarote scooter and a bicycle driver .	-3.6405
" This goes far beyond a bubble dispute " , said <unk>BB spokesman Christoph Posch to the APA .	-5.5650
The perpetrators or the perpetrators would have brought themselves into great danger and would also have jeopardised trains .	-3.9411
In addition to the damage to the loc and the equipment , as well as the minutes of delay and the cost of rail replacement transport , poenals of the railway customers could also be attached to the perpetrators .	-5.1096
Overall , the spokesman said that there was a " significant " sum to take out .	-6.0770
The damage was fixed again on Friday afternoon and rail transport could be carried out on the southern railway line without disabilities .	-3.9947
Almost ten passenger trains were falling on Friday morning , two of which concerned distance transport .	-3.6242
Freight trains did not fall , but they had delay .	-2.9211
According to <unk>BB speaker Christoph Posch , about 200 metres of top lines had to be exchanged .	-2.9095
Isolators and masts have also been damaged .	-1.4294
Red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help relieve IBD ( inflammatory illness ) .	-2.3114
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system .	-1.6235
But a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could relieve the symptoms of patients with inflammatory illnesses .	-2.8837
The incurable state of around 1.3 million in the United States , and 300,000 in the United Kingdom , causes stomach cramps and flows , recurring or bloody diarrhea , weight loss and extreme tiredness .	-3.9772
While the people affected are normally advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine .	-4.2251
The leading researcher , Dr. Marco Colonna , explained that immune cells patrol in the intestine to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in food do not enter the body .                    	-5.5468
Cells capable of triggering inflammation are compensated from cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue          .            	-5.1436
If the balance tends too far towards inflammation , it may result in an inflammatory illness .	-2.7341
Experiments have noted that some kind of tolerance promoting immunocells occur in mice , which wear a certain bacterium in their initiatives .	-4.7911
And the bacterium needs tryptophane - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .	-2.7564
Professor Colonna said : " We have made a connection between a bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intelligent microbioma , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .	-3.2987
The more tryptophane the mice had in their food , the more they had from these immune cells .	-2.4555
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a rich nutrition to tryptophane promotes more tolerant , less inflammatory threat when the same system appears to people .	-4.3445
The postdoctorand Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which was separately housed , did not have this .	-3.8373
She suspected that the difference was to do with the intelligent microbiomas of the mice - the community of bacteria , viruses and mushrooms that usually live in the stomach intelligence tract .	-3.7449
The darms of the mice were sequenced DNA and six bacteria species were found that were present in the mice with the immune cells , but without them lacking in the mice .	-4.0363
Mice was drawn up in a sterile environment , so they lacked a darmicrobioma and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells .	-3.7610
To understand how bacteria had an immune system , researchers L. reuteri grew in a liquid and then transferred small quantities of liquid - without bacteria - to immune immune cells isolated by the mice .	-3.5285
The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promot c cell              	-6.3597
When the active component was cleaned from liquid , it proved to be a by-product of tryptophane metabolism known as indol-3 milk acid .	-3.0263
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophane in the feed of the mice , the number of such cells increased by about 50 % , but if the tryptophane values have been halved , the number of cells fell by half .	-3.5294
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan stated that people have the same tolerance cells as mice , and that most of us L. reuteri protect in our stomach intelligence tracts .	-3.0006
It is not known whether tryptophane by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in people as in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory illness .	-3.4331
She said : " The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote , as these cells control inflammation on the internal surface of the intestine .	-3.0802
Potentially , high tryptophane values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an extension of this population . '	-2.7193
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United with Nemanja Matic has committed a " genius " .             	-4.9715
At Manchester United , Nemanja Matic signed a " genius " , Jose Mourinho believes , after the Middle Field player had his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening .	-3.2236
The 40 million pound signature of Chelsea began with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last preseason game before the UEFA Super Cup begins against Real Madrid on Tuesday , and impressed in the holder role when people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira premached .	-5.7276
However , Matic was excluded from the preparatory Asia-Tour of the Blues and created only 45 minutes , which Mourinho admitted that he had to improve before the beginning of the Premier League season .	-3.2084
" He needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , " said Mourinho .	-2.1757
" We will help him to be prepared sooner than later . "	-5.0541
Besides Matic , Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started in the Aviva stadium when Mourinho shaped his start-XI for the beginning of the season .	-3.0575
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three other new obligations , but he insisted that the club had already done a " fantastic work " to meet three of its four priority recommitments .	-3.4193
" Three of four to get , for that I thank the association , " he added .	-2.6768
'I will be happier when they get four out of four of me , but they have given great effort . '	-5.2732
Boeing Paints Dreamliners	-2.1666
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing painted the silhouette of a dreamliner in the sky .	-2.3290
The pilots flew from Seattle in the US State of Washington , but the drawing began in Marquette in US state Michigan , and moved in the form of a dreamliner about the US , these are several thousand kilometres .	-3.4782
The action took 18 hours and one minute .	-1.5766
On the radar screens was the form of a dreamliner .	-9.1282
This was an endurance test for new engines .	-2.0700
Boeing had made such advertising earlier .	-1.9749
So the number " 787 " and the Boeing logo was painted in the sky .	-2.4245
New Deep Blow for Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem	-2.4862
As the wind spins , when Sigmar Gabriel was still SPD leader , social democratic prime ministers always looked at Berlin before elections .	-9.0385
Merely no fire from the party headquarters , no counterwind from the covenant - that is the most important wish of the electoral campaign  is .	-5.7228
Since Martin Schulz , the party has changed fundamentally .	-2.1746
Since then , the Willy-Brandt-Haus employees have been watching the events in the SPD-ruled capitals with growing horror .	-3.5690
What Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in the approach .	-2.5321
There were deep strikes .	-2.5098
One after the other .	-1.9561
After the surprising end of the red green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CDU sees a general signal against coalitions between SPD and Green .	-2.9406
" This shows once again : Red Green cannot simply govern reliably , " said CDU Secretary-General Peter Tauber to the editorial network Germany ( RND ) .	-3.2693
The surprising group exit of a Green MEP has plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .	-2.9061
Five months before the land election , his red-green coalition lost her one-vote majority to the opposition from CDU and FDP .	-2.8970
The Green Managing Director Michael Kellner has called on the breakaway Lower Saxony MEP Elke Twesten to return their mandate .	-3.6790
Transgression to the CDU means a clear distortion of the electorate ’ s will .	-6.0970
Elke Twesten must immediately return her mandate " , said the Federal Manager and Campaign Leader of the Greens to the Editorial Network Germany ( RND ) .	-3.3431
" This must not be true everything , " suffers an SPD election campaigner , when the new hiobshop reaches the party centre on Friday morning .	-4.6736
Stephan Weil , Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , is there without his own government majority after the transgression of the Green Members of Elke Twesten .	-3.7832
It is the preliminary culmination of a whole range of large and small crises in SPD country associations .	-2.6289
And nobody knows what comes next .	-1.5094
The misery began with the unexpectedly clear defeat in the Saarland election in March .	-2.3538
A blue eye , not more , reassured the compassions at the time .	-2.7059
After the land elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia , everything will be different .	-2.4157
It was then - and everything was much worse .	-3.1551
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the deam , the Düsseldorf panel removed the party smoothly .	-3.9997
In the weeks afterwards , the compassions rappled again .	-4.6210
Then , when they had just created new courage , the G-20 summit of Hamburg came .	-2.7515
And with him the next deep strike came .    !        	-5.3722
Mayor Olaf Scholz , the last strong SPD leader , lost his nimbus at that weekend because he sat in the Elbphilharmonie while burning his city .	-3.0298
And because , in crisis communication , he made so quite wrong everything that could be done wrong .	-3.6038
Since then , Scholz has been fighting for his political survival .	-1.6633
So now Stephan Weil .	-1.7602
Because of the VW exhaust affair and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Dutch Prime Minister has been in criticism for a long time .	-2.9727
These surveys were added .	-2.0806
Nevertheless , or perhaps precisely therefore , tried because in recent weeks increasingly to set accents in the covenant  .	-4.2537
The desire of the former mayor of Hannover to expand his power in Berlin was not hidden either by colleagues in Martin Schulz .	-3.8363
They were granted it because they promised to stabilize the party from because of because they promised to stabilize the party .	-3.5548
Now the exact opposite could happen .	-2.2188
Because of this , the internal intermediary of the Dutch Greens is basically not a f        f .	-5.7397
And Schulz is not at all at all .	-2.7932
Sometimes the colleagues are trying to keep their own ranks closed .	-3.2197
Her anger is directed towards the Greens , and here in particular the breaking parliamentarian Twestern .	-3.7831
" It is intolerable and democratic , as Mrs Twesten puts her own career interests about the interests of all the others , " says Matthias Miersch , head of the party left in the SPD Group , the editorial network Germany ( RND ) .	-3.4306
Mrs Twesten has not been elected to Parliament because of her person as a direct candidate , but through the list of nationalities of the Dutch Greens , the Lower Saxony Member continues .	-4.2886
The logical consequence would be that it returns its mandate .	-1.8247
Thomas Oppermann , head of the SPD Group , complains an ' undemocratic manoeuvre ' .	-2.4617
" The electoral will was clear four years ago : people have made Stephan Weil the Prime Minister , " says Oppermann , who leads the Dutch Saxon SPD as a top candidate into the federal election , the RND .	-4.1692
" Now the personal career thinking of a future CDU Member distorts the election result , " Oppermann said .	-3.1525
He called for the background to be enlightened .	-1.9022
I want to know whether there has been more or there has been further promises from the CDU Lower Saxony .	-5.0182
Support for Local Core III	-2.6254
Those who want to be restored in the years can soon receive support from the country .               	-6.3694
Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives STEG received urban development on Wednesday .	-2.8888
At the beginning of the information event , Schindler gave another review of the previous event .	-3.2298
There have been reception areas since 1991 .	-2.0720
At that time , in renovation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the country of Baden-Württemberg took over two-thirds of the support amount .	-3.4025
In renovation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the grant was still 60 % .	-3.0036
For shindlers , the previous renovations are a " success project " - it is eventually important to promote internal development and not only to open up new construction areas .	-3.8781
On 4 April , the Karlsruhe Government Presidency received information that there will be a renovation area III .	-3.0806
The funding amount is EUR 833 333 , of which EUR 500 000 would be received from the country , the rest of the community .	-3.2889
How does a renovation area emerge ?	-2.6315
You will continue to investigate where the " really old " houses are .	-2.6773
However , it also plays a role if there is any interest in renovating the planned area .	-3.3658
If necessary , the limits could then be moved again .	-3.0115
The STEG represented on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel .	-2.2620
Keller presented the content of the Federal State Programme " Social City " , where the renovations would then be carried out .	-3.5667
The core of the programme is the revitalisation of cities , the improvement of housing and working conditions and the preservation and development of infrastructure .	-3.3989
The measures would be object-related , in other words per plot .	-2.4347
Finally , the renovation area would be set as a statute .	-2.7610
The approval period for subsidies has been running until 30 April 2026 since 1 January 2017 .	-2.9845
However , until September this year , the inventory would first be carried out , within the framework of which those involved in the renovation area get a questionnaire for filling out a questionnaire .	-5.7507
In November or December , the decision on the statutes shall be taken as possible , so that the renovations can begin next year .	-6.1282
Pietzschmann then declared that each local community must carry out the said pre-ab investigations .	-3.6352
It is a question of assessing and deciding when renovated and to what extent .	-3.0066
For the respective plot there will also be a renovation note in the land book .	-4.3135
Pietzschmann will come again after receiving and make an image of the situation , she promised .	-3.1876
Gotzel emphasized that the project is an essential factor of success .	-5.8131
That is why there will be questionnaires that will be sent postally to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled up until the end of the summer holidays .	-3.2127
The yellow questionnaire is the " building and plot arch " , which includes the construction state and renovation intentions .	-3.9384
In the grey questionnaire , the ' budget and housing arch ' , information can be made on size , distribution and inhabitants of a housing space .	-3.6890
The blue " operating arch " can only be filled if business rooms are operated in the building .	-2.9198
However , note that Gotzel points out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time a request for funding .	-3.2621
Moreover , new construction measures are not eligible .	-2.4443
Schindler stressed that the distribution of subsidies works according to the " greyhound principle " - who comes first mills .	-5.4766
You cannot reserve any subsidies for later ones .	-5.9325
Finally , photos of the project " Local Core II " were shown to make the present a restoration " tasty " .	-3.4857
British inventors set themselves a microchip to come with a hand movement in house and cars	-3.0032
A British inventor is the first in the country equipped with a microchip so that he can open his doorstep , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .	-3.2554
Steven Northam , 33 , had implanted the tiny chip between thumbs and fingers and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company BioTeq .	-2.9868
He has joined with Dr. Geoff Watson , an advisory anaesthesist in the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester , Hants , to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards .	-3.2977
The technology resembles a cat and dogs implanted microchip and takes only 30 seconds .	-2.1844
The company of Mr. Northam also wants to change the castles of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , everything for an additional charge of $ 300 per castle   .	-4.7712

The advertising costs of the White House cost the taxpayer thousands	-2.3188
The White House ’ s decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlights American production last month costs taxpayers according to the military ’ s information left to the TIME magazine up to $ 24,   0 .                  1                  	-5.9995
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on 17 July in the White House with American construction programmes .	-2.8602
President Donald Trump , Vice-President Mike Pence and leading White House officials made a tour of products from all 50 states .	-2.4713
The helicopter manufactured in Connecticut was issued next to a yacht from Maine , a fire car from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi .	-3.2260
The military office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO , hardly 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn , after the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One ( HMX-1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .	-3.5974
" I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility " , the commander of the HMX-1 wrote on the eve of the evening of its superior , the Deputy Navy Commander for Avia       .	-4.0177
The message showed that the helicopter entered the South Lawn on 17 July at 7 a.m. for the event at 15 a.m. and so long until the lawn was roomed between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening .               i  w a    i                    	-10.0050
The note adds that if the departure from the White House were to be delayed , a second team would be needed for the return flight due to the restriction of service hours .	-3.6388
The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event , while the safety staff of the unit remained on the ground during the time .	-6.0887
The records provided by the TIME did not clearly show whether a second flight crew was ultimately required .	-3.1589
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees to use public property for political purposes .	-4.1152
Records show that HMX-1 has asked whether the event could violate the provision .	-2.3874
" A question we asked was whether this was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case , " wrote the commander .	-2.8721
" Sounds as if you are closed " , the Deputy Commander replied .	-2.4003
The event " Made in America " was called an official event by the White House and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act .	-2.5724
But official events also have political overtones .	-1.8904
At the event , the President gave an impetus to reform the health reform that was under way in the Senate , and he promoted efforts to contain government regulations                     	-5.9842
The use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One is hardly a new phenomenon from politically beneficial purposes .	-2.4867
Presidents are obliged to use them for the trip .	-4.7381
But requesting their use only for a photo op is unusual .	-2.3876
In February , Trump carried out an investigation when the presidential aircraft provided in the light of his first campaign rally in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of reports complaining about the use of presidential aircraft by his predecessors .	-3.7297
" The White House is enthusiastic of the show " Made In America " - the products from all 50 countries manufactured by American workers with American materials " , said the deputy press secretary of the White House , Lindsay Walters .	-3.1967
HMX-1 occupations often carry out training flights in the area around Washington and the South Lawn to set the US president in the White House with precise centimetre rates .	-3.3106
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany early July , HMX-1 carried out 58 exercise landings in the White House .	-2.7194
The flight for the " Made in America " event counted in the training needs of the flight crew for the month , said a civil servant .	-2.8446
Helicopter units also flew 11 hours a day for ' non-presidential support missions ' .	-2.6360
The White House said that taxpayers took over the burden of none of the other requisites presented at the event .	-2.3556
A spokesman of Sikorsky said that the company was not involved in issuing the helicopter on the South Lawn .	-2.3300
HMX-1 does not maintain budget records for presidential flights , and it is difficult to identify the exact cost of the event .	-2.6569
However , according to hourly rates of the US Department of Defence for the financial year 2017 , the VH-3D rate is USD 24,380 per hour .	-5.1165
Records of the unit record the aircraft ’ s aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia .	-4.6667
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below this rate .	-2.5445
" Setting the cost of taxpayers on the basis of estimates for the rates of reimbursement is highly misleading , " said Walters .	-3.3267
" These estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual resources . "	-2.4590
According to an RAND study from 2015 , the rates of refunds for DoD do not contain staff costs , but take account of the costs of fuel , maintenance and conclusion of the contract .	-3.8247
At this time , the former press spokesman of the White House , Sean Spicer , defended the use of the helicopter for the event .	-2.5492
" The idea is to present this week things that are manufactured in America " , sa Sp .  .	-5.2463
" And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not thousands of people , are dependent on                       	-5.0234
And I think how most Americans are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly .	-2.5431
It is , of course , appropriate to highlight that ' .	-2.1859
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter when he entered his tour over the South Lawn for the event , but he set himself in the driving seat of a fire car .	-3.2635
In the White House , Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of company products .	-2.5179

On September 1 , the city of Krefeld takes over the food supply in the urban children 's day facilities ( Kitas ) .	-4.1413
For Sonja Pommeranz , Deputy Head of Youth Assistance , this is a good news : " We have all been very pleased " .	-2.9192
Cooking is still out of house : a caterer takes over this task and delivers freshly cooked .	-3.8925
The city operates 46 children 's day centres in the Krefeld area , in 44 children get a warm meal at lunch time .	-3.5692
In the past kita year 2800 children sat at the tables , and the need is growing constantly .	-3.3981
" Meanwhile not only eat children who are supported 45 hours in the kita to lunch " , explains Pommerance .    i      iiiii      ii .	-11.3434
" The offer also applies in the 35-hour support when children remain until 14 a.m. "	-8.2904

GMB Scotland said that the company has silenced the future of investment at the Tollcross location .	-2.4452
More than 500 employees are working in the factory , which manufactures hobnobs and rich tea biscuits alongside other products .           	-4.7918
McVities owner Pladis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .	-1.9283
He added that employees and trade union representatives would be the first to experience if their activities changed .	-7.0125
In a letter to the branch manager of the company , GMB Scotland McVitie 's called on ' concerns that funding for modernizing production lines would not be pushed forward ' .	-3.7300
GMB Senior Organizer Drew Duffy said : " The fact that we cannot win clarity from the General Site Manager on business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross deeply affects our members .	-3.2131
Generations of families have worked here and labour focuses strongly on the local community and the Glasgow area , an important pillar for decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage .	-8.4163
Therefore , under the perspective of jobs , pay and prosperity , and against the backdrop of Brexit , the increasing living costs and the chronic decline in production , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a flourishing production presence at McVitie                        	-5.7428
A speaker of Pladis said : " The branch manager at Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday , and the company will respond directly to it , as we appreciate the continuous commitment of employees and trade union representatives .	-3.9778
Two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross , where some questions had been discussed openly        .	-4.8858
We discussed with the staff that , like all companies working in a very competitive and insecure economic climate , we continuously review our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive .	-4.1243
She added : " In recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our Tollcross location , especially in production lines and operational improvements .	-2.8342

Interview : ' Domspatzen report discharges Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger '	-2.2206
The Regensburg Domspatzen report on abuses discharges Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger .	-2.4135
This means author and historian Michael Hesemann .	-1.7257
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Cathedral Spaces continues to provide discussions .	-3.0879
Christian Weisnder , spokesperson of the reform movement " We are Church " , explained an excuse after release to the German Press Agency , he expected from the former Regensburg Bishop and today 's Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , as well as from the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger , the 93-year-old brother of the emerited Pope Benedict XVI .	-4.3778
It would be very serving the reputation of the Catholic Church if Muller and Ratzinger were to express their deep regret at their own omissions or their false assessment of the processes .	-5.2116
The vatican newspaper " Osservatore Romano " , on the other hand , criticized that the reporting on violence at the cathedral was measured with " two standards " .	-4.3318
As far as the attacks in Regensburg are concerned , no one doubts that these are ' shameful and shameful acts ' which would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; but the ' degree of media manipulation ' , the author Lucetta Scaraffia , historian and member of the national Italian bioethics committee .	-4.3161
" The habit of calling the Catholic Church a source of all evils is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep that normal " , writes Scaraffia .	-3.3337
Prince Gloria von Thurn and Taxis also said in the interview with the Bavarian broadcasting : " You like to go to the church and this is a found eating " .	-3.9782
Moreover , she pointed out that in her youth ' beats had been a very normal educational means ' to become ready with fresh children , as I was one thing .    ' .   ' T ' i a s    '  . '	-11.4988
It would find it unfair to apply current standards to previous decades , because the world has changed .	-2.5456
In connection with the reports on abuses , Pope brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared .	-2.9231
Completely wrong , author and historian Michael Hesemann , who wrote with Ratzinger the memory band " My brother of the Pope " ( translated into 12 languages ) .	-3.4043
" I must take Georg Ratzinger into protection , " says Hesemann , " because all this had nothing to do with him , " he values the results of the final report .	-2.9423
What exactly is the 440-page report presented by the lawyer Ulrich Weber , commissioned by the Bistum Regensburg ?	-3.2028
A total of 547 Regensburg cathedrals were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s " with high plausibility " victims of attacks , 67 cathedrals .	-3.1689
The final report states that Georg Ratzinger worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : ' In summary , it is possible that Domkapellmeister R. in many cases applied forms of physical and mental violence .	-6.6764
Especially with high emotionality , punishment for the students could be more violent .	-3.7035
Nevertheless , unlike many other accused , many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore , in many cases , even combine positive memories with him , despite violence .	-3.9625
In the interview , Hesemann declares why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg cathedral Georg Ratzinger in his opinion discharges .	-3.5648
Mr Hesemann , the 440-page report on the ' incidents of violence to protected orders at the Regensburg Cathedral ' gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger .	-3.5202
On the one hand , many students highlight his " humanity " .	-2.4592
On the other hand , it also appears as a choleric and perfectionist who often became handgrippled when a cathedral brought no top performance musically .	-4.0946
How do you regard this final report as its biographer ?	-2.3230
Michael Hesemann : If you take the effort and read the whole 440 pages long from the front to the back , you must ask yourself more why the name Georg Ratzinger is at all in it .	-4.7664
He has just been dedicated to eight pages and is clearly accepted by any suspicion of competence or co-science in the terrible cases of sexual abuse       .	-4.7554
The excesses of violence at pre-school also occurred outside its effectiveness .	-2.8951
You can accuse him of learning from it too late or having taken first suggestions seriously enough .	-3.5551
The cathedral gymnasium on which he acted was felt by virtually all respondents than - as literally - " redemption " , " sky " and " better world " .	-3.6625
For example , the broad majority of his students Georg Ratzinger exhibits a very excellent testimony , describes him as " warm hearty " , " popular " , " sincere " , " competent " and " understanding " , as extremely beneficial teachers who regularly supplied the guys with cakes , biscuits and bonbons and " always surrounded by grapes of children " .	-4.6547
Only a minority complains about its perfectionism and its high emotionality , which has already led to rage outbreaks .	-2.8872
The fact that he was not only chairs and threw the key covenant on the ground , but also distributed ear figs and all too fresh guys to the hairs or ears , he himself admitted , deeply regretted and apologized for this .	-5.4597
However , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the time in question , the 1960s and 1970s , in parents like teachers .	-3.7474
Do you know such breeding methods ?	-5.3505
Of course , I think everyone who was born before 1968 .	-1.8329
I , too , have experienced this in a secondary school , a state gymn .        . This            	-6.4277
Compared to what is actually at stake in this report , namely the appalling sexual abuse and the excesses of violence on pre-school , these are , however , excavators .	-4.8967
There is already a question of whether it is not more to do with its awareness and role as a brother of Benedict XVI that many media have just plunged onto it .	-4.7982
Many who have never understood him are still working on the Bavarian Pope .	-2.8908
But the truth is that the report discharges Georg Ratzinger in every respect .	-3.3410
Much has been reported in the media in the context of the report on the issue of abuse in the cathedral of Regensburg .	-3.2329
Will Georg Ratzinger also put any implementation or co-science on sexual abuse in the final report ?	-3.2616
Michael Hesemann : Clearly no .	-1.7773
Not one of the 67 victims of sexual attacks claims to have entrusted to the Cathedral o       C              	-5.2060
Not even parents were inaugurated .	-1.4947
" I have never trusted to speak with my father or my mother about it , " said a person affected deputy for the others , " It was all very embarrassing " .	-6.0425
The real problem with the education of sexual abuse was and is that most victims silence shame .	-3.2176
If they did not even entrust parents and siblings , then certainly not a choir leader , who would have been a professional colleague of the perpetrators .	-6.3419
How do the cathedral students evaluate Ratzinger ’ s role in terms of abuses               	-6.2841
Michael Hesemann : A surveyed student formulated it : " With regard to sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he ( Georg Ratzinger ) had had timely knowledge and could have stopped the perpetrator .	-4.0534
I believe it ... also really absurd to assume that opened up him ... Buben more intrusive or clearer or even more than their parents , International managers , confidence teachers etc .	-4.9895
That you talk to him about sex ... - unthinkable . '	-2.1659
The report comes to the very clear outcome : ' The fact that students and / or their environment were affected beforehand could not be confirmed within the framework of the investigation ' .	-4.2607
As far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg Ratzinger must therefore be free of every co-science .	-3.1435
Nor can it be accused of not preventing it or having displayed it .	-3.2408
There is therefore no reason to connect its good name with these opposing crimes , as unfortunately happened in some cases .	-3.2619
In the media , there was a lot of " violence excesses " at the Regensburg cathedral .	-5.2775
The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger was accused of in the report on ' Looking a   ' .                 	-6.0258
Should he live with this accusation ?	-1.9057
Michael Hesemann : This is the big problem that in the reporting everything has been mixed and mixed into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence excesses and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg Ratzinger .	-3.7747
But that is , in turn , an abuse of the report .	-2.3811
In fact , there is clean separation : between the pre-school and the gymnasium of the cathedrals , between sexual abuse and excesses of violence , and , let us say , other allegation              	-5.1679
In addition , the report has been dealing with incidents from the period since 1945 , including four decades when Georg Ratzinger was not the choir leader of the cathedral cou  .              	-5.7640
The whole terrible educational education , the cases in which boys were harassed and maltrated by sadistic teachers , and including horrific suffering , happened all over the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen , where truly scandalous states have to be dominated .	-5.8664
But with those who had nothing to do with Georg Ratzinger , because he got the boys only face when they were already on the cathedral gymnasium .	-5.5327
On this , as most witnesses stressed , the topic of " Preschool " was taboo .	-3.3809
One was only happy to escape her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even " paradisian " states .	-3.2837
What was different from the cathedral gymnasium ?	-2.4538
Michael Hesemann : Although there was discipline , there was no sadistic violenc       .     (       ) .     	-5.7717
And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger , where the report concludes that ' many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore , in many cases , even combine positive memories with him despite violence ' .	-3.9806
That is the accusation of having looked away .	-2.8279
But , despite all the efforts , the report could define only two periods in which it was reported by the states on pre-school .	-3.3147
The first time in 1970 / 71 , when he started to establish himself and from the processes at a school where he was not acting and responsible ( so the witnesses ) wanted to hear nothing , and then only again around 1                                	-7.2728
Closed Georg Ratzinger to the states consistently the ears ?	-2.7279
Michael Hesemann : No , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the Cathedral Gymnasium , which the report even reproduces .	-2.6160
In this respect , he points out that ' the pre-school continues to practise the penalty ' .	-4.4025
In view of the risk of negative press releases , he recommended urgent intervention .	-2.4467
This was , of course , at a time when there was legal clarity , when brush penalties were long banned in Bavaria .	-3.5711
Before that they took place in a legal grey area , as everyone knows .	-2.9891
It was also difficult to assess where the people affected were perhaps exaggerated or dramatised , and where the permissible border was really exceeded   .	-4.2644
You cannot say , however , that he has always looked away .	-2.7246
That is simply not true .	-1.4087
Only in 1980 was the official abolition of schools in Bavaria .	-3.3475
Prince Gloria von Thurn and Taxis said that it was unfair to apply today 's educational standards to the time then .	-9.1653
How do you see this    ?  ?        ? !  !     ! ! !	-5.9899
Michael Hesemann : We historians are talking about the ' fallstrick of anachronism ' , that is , the danger of evaluating past according today 's moral standards .	-3.6384
The Prince is quite right .	-6.5260
Of course , this does not apply to sexual abuse , which was abhorrent at all times and not to what was criminally committed in the pre-school of refusals and violence of innocent children 's souls , which is already going far beyond the usual then .	-5.1021
That is all very terrible and I am glad that it will finally be worked on .	-2.7845
But at the same time I must take Georg Ratzinger into protection , because all this had nothing to do with him .	-2.7161
His resources for disciplining and punishment , that is to say , ears and hairs and ears , were widespread in the 1    70                        	-6.2128
When physical punishment was then prohibited , he was also strictly able to do so .	-8.0069
What image of his Regensburg time has Georg Ratzinger reproduced in the talks with you for the book " My brother of the Pope                  	-5.2642
Came the subject of penalty also raised ?	-3.8357
Michael Hesemann : Well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , that is , Pope Benedict XVI , tells from his perspective , because the cathedrals played only a  sid  ro       i                    	-6.9931
Nevertheless , I am not concealing that he had a strict regime there .	-3.1170
But this must also be said : without this perfectionism , without the requirement of absolute discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to shape an institution of world ranking from the rather nationally known Regensburg cathedral , true cultural ambassadors of Europe and its musical tradition , which went to tour twice in the US ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .                                                           	-9.7097
With biscuits and bonbons alone , you make no major singers and before every success , whatever area , but always discipline , passion and self-overcoming .	-4.5709
As what kind of people have you experienced Georg Ratzinger at the talks on their book ?	-5.2317
Michael Hesemann : Through the work on the book and beyond , I have really met Georg Ratzinger very well and again experienced as wonderful , humorous , basic , deeply believed and heart-good people , who cannot imagine that he could also do something suffering from a             . I                     a                          	-11.1857
I get regularly with how many former cathedrals still today , 23 years after his emeritation , keep regular contact with him , visit him , read him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family .	-3.3256
So those who do not forgive him that he was once strict to them are clearly in the minority .	-3.2437
Most cathedrals are grateful today for enriching their lives and brought them close to the world of music .	-2.7738
And that he has always been a good , fatherly teacher - a strict father , certainly that may be - but also a lovely respect person to whom they still look at today and whom they are devoting them to .	-6.2633
Once again , please make it quite clear that everything that is accused of him is educational methods which were on the agenda at the time                   a    	-7.0579
We can be pleased that we have long overcome that time .	-5.0720
But it is highly unfair to make a man just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to media scapegoat .	-2.6974
There is the evil intention behind it , only t    i       .      	-6.2228
For the report that has just been published discharges it .                 	-5.0215
Now the decency would come to a 93-year-old man who has acquired great merits and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps no one would know the Regensburg cathedral to finally leave peace .	-4.8904
