Gutach : Even more security for pedestrians	-1.6398
They are not 100 metres from each other : on Tuesday , the new B 33 pedestrian ramp was opened at the village parking lot in Gutach - in view of the older town hall lamps .	-4.6289
Two systems so close to each other : Intention or citizenship ?	-5.1109
This question clearly answered Gutach 's mayor yesterday .	-2.0173
" The town hall lamp was installed at the time because it secures the school path " , explained corner yesterday .	-3.3786
The cluster traffic lights secure both cyclists and bus passengers and mountain residents .	-3.1314
The system officially taken into operation yesterday is important for the Sulzbachweg / Kirchstra<unk>e intersection .	-3.7085
We have the museum , two churches , Kurpark , the bus stop , a doctor and a bank as well as the flow of transport from the residential area <unk> Grub <unk>  .	-4.6910
" In the high traffic and pedestrian emergence , another traffic light had to be secured , " said Eckert .	-4.3681
This also confirms Peter Arnold from the Offenburg Council .	-2.2029
" According to current measurements , on the B 33 , about 12 000 vehicles per day pass through the Gutach municipality , of which are about ten percent of heavy load traffic " , emphasizes Arnold .	-4.9801
Therefore , the construction of another traffic light is more than necessary : " Security goes here simply " , says Arnold .	-3.6504
In total , four traffic looks have been carried out , a roundabout was also intended , but rejected because of the closeness in the Sulzbachweg / Kirchstra<unk>e crossroads .	-4.1693
According to Arnold , everything has been tested in the location of the traffic masts previously : " By means of an extra transporter with particularly long wooden tribes , we have tested whether these vehicles can exit from the Sulzbachweg to the B 33 without cnicking the traffic masts                       	-7.1657
The around EUR 15 000 expensive traffic itself is the " most modern thing there are currently on the market " , explained Arnold .	-3.4901
The complex is equipped with coloured LEDs , which are so strongly shining that the lights of the drivers , for example , are well recognized at deep sun .	-4.9717
And economically it is also : the older lighting systems consume about 100 watts , the new just eight watts .	-3.6367
There are three lights per direction .	-2.2294
Arnold explained the technique of the new plant : this is equipped with two radar sensors .	-2.5567
Pressing the pedestrian button , the upper radar sensor tests the traffic location .	-2.6016
If the road is free , comes immediately green for the pedestrian , if not , it takes about 15 seconds .	-2.3102
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase can be ended for the pedestrian .	-2.6638
" If a group or handicapped people go over the road , the green phase will be extended , so everyone can certainly go over the road " , explained Arnold .	-4.0707
Of course the driver must think here as a partner and observe the road .	-2.9538
This was not the case yesterday : hardly showed the traffic lights for pedestrians green , noised a upper class vehicle through - with bright red .	-3.7261
Josef Winkler has been writing his childhood and youth from the soul for more than 30 years .	-2.3603
The disasters of its Catholic village childhood - languagelessness , the slope to raw violence and dull sexuality , the closeness and friendliness - have often described the Carinthian poet .	-3.5892
The Büchner Prize winner is primarily known as a prosecutor , theatre texts are rare in his work .	-3.4875
Collage from prosatexts Gerhard Fresacher presents for his performance " Weather lights on the tongue top " , which is now seen in Garage X at Petersplatz , therefore collage from prosatexts .	-4.3463
The theatre maker combines elements from the autobiographically characterized novel " Der Leibeigene " ( 1987 ) with prosaminiatures from " Leichnam , his family belauering " ( 2003 ) .	-3.6378
On the largely empty-stage stage - important requisite : a concentrated sofa on which insignificantly copulated and masturbed is copulated and masturbed - the eight-head ensemble is accompanied by the text material .	-4.6343
Director Fresacher seems little to trust the text .	-2.1060
The 70-minute performance surpasses the template with a wealth of government incidents , known from the repertoire of post-dramatic forms of game      .   Th       i i  	-7.1258
In particular , the actresses come to the sometimes questionable scenic implementations .	-3.7579
They are tacked hard with the head under water , tacked with their evening surfaces to the wall .               	-6.0697
Forced into cellophane or miters , they stake on dangerously high sticks through the stage , either monologize them volume or lie completely mutilated on the stage gro .                                      	-9.2538
However , the text does not convey itself in this effortless way .	-3.8130
The best moments have the evening when sung - the bandwidth ranges from Deep Purple to popular songs .	-2.6801
Only at the end comes the overturned performance something to rest , and Winkler ’ s absurd humor flashes after                	-6.4059
A blackbox in the car ?	-1.4391
American road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the declining highway system , and believe that the solution has found in a small black caste that finds space in the armature board of each car .	-4.0775
The devices that record every kilometre and report the information to the authorities are the key point of a controversial attempt by Washington and the federal state planning offices to revise the outdated system of financing US roads .	-3.6572
The normally boring area of road planning has suddenly debated an intense debate with colourful alliances .	-3.3040
Libertarians have allied with environmental groups and assume that the government can use small boxes to record the driven kilometres – and possibly where they have been driven – and then use information to calculate tax modes .	-3.8218
The Tea Party is appalled .	-1.5157
The American Civil Liberties Association ( ACLU ) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of data protection concerns .	-2.2741
But , while Congress cannot agree on an action , several states are no longer waiting for .	-3.0027
They are currently checking how to switch to a system over the next ten years where drivers pay per driven mile .	-3.4572
Thousands of drivers have already tested the tachographs , some of which are equipped with GPS sur  c .	-5.4238
That is really a must for our country .	-1.7058
“ It is nothing that we may only be using , ” said Hasan Ikhrata , CEO of Southern California Assn. of Governments , who plans to record the driven miles for all Californian drivers in the state from 202      .	-7.3738
The way we pay these taxes will change .	-1.3347
The technology is there .	-1.5463
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund , which is financed from taxes paying US Americans at the pillar , is bankrupt .	-3.9650
But America is no longer going as much as before .	-3.2319
Cars consume less petrol .	-1.1417
The government mineral oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon ( less than 4 euro cents per litre ) has not increased for 20 years .     .	-5.1799
Politicians do not dare at high injection prices to increase the tax even by a cent .	-4.8699
“ The petrol tax is simply not sustainable , ” says Lee Munnich , an expert in transport legislation at the University of Minnesota .	-2.8005
Its state has recently equipped 500 cars with tachographs to test a mile-based payment system .	-2.3534
“ This is the most sensible alternative in the long run , ” he said .  He    said .	-5.9937
Bureaucrats describe it as a mile-based user f    .	-2.5275
It is not surprising that the idea of urban liberal accusation is found , because the tax could be used , for example , to influence driving behaviour in such a way that congestion and climate-harmful exhaust gases are reduced .	-4.4232
The Californian planners are putting the system on the development of strategies to achieve the ambitious , legally enshrined objectives of the federal state on climate  ch     .	-4.1744
But the Republican Bill Shuster from Pennsylvania , Chairman of the House Transportation Committee , has also stated that he sees the most vulnerable long-term alternative .	-2.9514
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are also done by the idea of letting drivers pay after returned routes .	-3.4439
“ This is not a tax that disappears in a black hole , ” explains Adrian Moore , Vice-President of Reason Directives .	-2.4604
People pay directly for what they get .	-1.4335
The movement is also supported by two previous American transport ministers who had called on Congress in a report in 2011 to move towards mile-based settlement .	-3.1320
Last year , the US Senate approved a $ 90 million of expensive pilot project that would have included 10,00  ca .                	-5.2228
But the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the progress , responding to the concerns of Members from rural areas that represent people who often have to put many miles on the way to work or to the city in everyday life .	-4.2093
Nevertheless , several states and large cities are moving in this direction on their own fist .                              	-8.2915
Most committed is Oregon , which currently attracts 5,000 drivers for the country ’ s largest experiment .	-3.0687
These drivers will soon pay the mileage fees instead of the mineral oil tax to the state .	-2.7046
Nevada has already completed a pilot project .	-1.2721
New York City also considers such a thing .	-1.5654
Illinois tests it to a limited extent with lorries .	-2.1141
And the I-95 coalition , including the transport ministries of 17 states on the east coast ( including Maryland , Pennsylvania , Virginia and Florida ) , is currently examining how to introduce the change .	-3.1250
The concept is not a universal hit .	-1.2032
In Nevada , where 50 volunteers were equipped with the devices recently , drivers were sceptical about the idea that the government could pursue each of their movements .	-3.1624
“ Concerns about Big Brother and such things were a major problem , ” explains Alauddin Khan , Head of Strategy and Result Management in the Transport Ministry of Nevada .	-2.9241
People did not want it .	-1.1985
When the test raised , the ACLU warned of Nevada on its website : “ It would be relatively easy to transform the tachographs into adult surveillance equipment .  ”               .i            	-8.0277
There is no need to build a gigantic , bulky technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals    .	-6.7155
Nevada is part of a number of federal states that are now looking for affordable technology with which the state can capture the driven kilometres , but not exactly when and where .	-3.9481
That , Khan , would also be more reassured to the public .	-2.8442
Hunting after this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California .	-2.4547
The company has not originally arrived to help federal states tax drivers                      	-6.1019
Rather , it was its goal to foot in an emerging market for vehicle insurance , where drivers should pay on the basis of driven miles .	-3.7594
But the devices they tested are also interesting for road planners , because they do not work with GPS and deliver only limited information that is regularly uploaded by modem .	-3.3220
“ People are rather willing to participate in it if their speed and locations are not recorded , ” said Ryan Morrison , Managing Director of True Mileage .	-3.0061
Some of these public pilot programs have made major errors .	-2.2870
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement this .	-2.0913
In Oregon , the planners experiment in giving drivers a number of selection options .	-5.9641
You can choose a device with or without GPS .	-1.8135
Or they do not choose any device at all and instead pay a flat fee based on the average miles driven by all residents of the state .	-5.8427
Other places hope to sell the concept of a suspicious public by equipping the devices with more functions than with less .	-2.9977
In New York City , traffic officials want to develop a device for taxation that also pays parking fees , insurance must be paid only for driven kilometres and speed data from other vehicles in real time , thanks to which drivers can evade congestion .	-4.6433
“ Drivers would be motivated by the added value of the benefits that the system offers to participate , ” says it in a planning document of the city .	-3.3530
However , some transport planners wonder whether the whole talk about paying per mile is not just a huge distraction manoeuvre .	-2.8645
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the area of San Francisco Bay , officials declared that Congress can solve the problem of bankrupt Highway Trust Fund simply by increasing fuel tax .	-5.5014
An additional unique fee or an annual tax could be imposed on drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume little petrol , so that they also pay a fair share .	-3.4763
“ There is no reason for an operation when an aspirin is sufficient , ” explains Randy Rentschler , the head of legislation and public affairs of the Commission .	-2.9744
If we do that , hundreds of millions of drivers are carrying out their privacy and numerous other things .	-4.8780
Royal Field : Small Team Bea   W   W ! ! !	-7.3465
The voluntary fire brigade handled her autumn sample despite shortages of staff with Bravour .	-4.0569
Only eleven man took part in the exercise .	-1.6633
In his exercise assumption , Hans Kammerer selected the property Feder in the Burgberger Stra<unk>e .	-3.4124
There was a short circuit when sawing .	-3.5628
Two people were injured by the fire and smoking development , but one of them could send an emergency call .	-3.2901
After the first review of the situation by Hans Kammerer , two breath protection carriers made themselves prepared to enter the building .	-3.9170
After a short period of time , the first person was able to find the outdoors .	-5.4021
The second person had to be worn .	-1.3835
This was not so easy because a close staircase was also overcome .	-3.0595
The building , a workshop with integrated stabling for two horses , was not easy to safeguard .	-2.2203
It stored a lot of wood and also strawballs in it .	-2.4537
There were electrical machines for wood processing .	-5.0099
The first deletion attack took place via the tank in the vehicle .	-2.4583
Another management took place via an overflower hydrant at about 100 meters away .	-3.4491
Now three deletion attacks could be designed .	-2.1537
The building also used a hollow tube .	-3.1706
Hans Kammerer was also about showing what is to be done with little available staff .	-3.8460
In the serious case there is support for the Königsfeld daily application group .	-3.6090
The commander was satisfied with the exercise of the exercise .	-2.3836
Networking of universities and companies	-1.9536
On his visit to the Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald district , Landtagspräsident Guido Wolf also enlightened in Titisee Neustadt about where tomorrow ’ s workforce comes fro .                                 	-7.2674
In the Hochschwarzwald Forest Centre , he went together with the Managing Directors of Professional Schools and the Circle Gymnasium and the Chairman of Parents of this important question .	-5.9679
" Education is an important location factor " , underlined Claudia Stehle , Director of the Hans-Thoma-School , who presented the networked school project education centre Hochschwarzwald .	-3.2320
Wolf showed himself impressed about the model projects for training .	-3.0579
Since 2011 , there has been successful cooperation between the Förderzentrum , Kreisgymnasium and the Workschool Centre i     .                          	-9.4356
He also praised family friendliness in the countryside .	-2.4121
" It is important not only to have the family phase in mind , but also , because of demographic change , the phase of maintaining members ' care , Wolf explained .	-3.9635
He also stated that more and more employees were taking care of their families ' care and care                  	-6.0868
" Without the support of employers , the resulting burden of employees can lead to an end to the employment relationship , " said Wolf .	-3.3865
But nobody can afford to lose qualified workers , he said .	-2.1118
Another particularly important factor is the networking of universities and companies .	-2.1485
" For anyone who has met the benefits of the region during his studies remains with his acquired knowledge and skills often receiving the regional economy , which contributes to strengthening the region " , the President of the Landtag showed himself convinced .	-5.0218
Because only if sufficient training places were offered can be covered with the needs of the speciali  profess             	-6.4523
In his opinion , the location advantage of the country is its beneficial location in the southwest of Germany , near France and Switzerland .	-3.2372
He also experienced the efforts already made to develop public transport on his train ride from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg .	-3.3065
" Remain stubborn and ensure that public transport becomes better , " he explained to the address of local politicians present .	-3.4298
With Music Experienced an Entertaining Afternoon	-2.2391
For 15 years the Kaul family has been inviting the Dietinger seniors to coffee , cakes and afterwards to a vesper .	-3.4060
In the past , the older fellow citizens were assessed in the rest place .	-4.4144
This afternoon takes place in the care secret of St. Josef .	-2.9011
The residents were looking forward to the delicious cakes and cakes .	-2.5147
Later there was sausage .	-1.7139
With common melodies , Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich maintained .	-2.2330
The more than 100 years old natural stone wall than the front delimitation of the old school farm to the Kirchstra<unk>e should once again be placed on the renovation cost of the city of Bräunlingen .	-6.4007
In the days before the Kilbig , a small angle wall , the stabilization and static discharge of the natural stone wall with balustrade was integrated into the first works of renovation of the front school farm .	-4.6265
The further approach provides for Alexander Misok from the Bräunlinger Stadtbaumt to include the Memorial Office in the planning and create a restoration concept for the old wall .	-4.6441
After that , a cost calculation should be calculated by professionals who will then be put on the table to the Council of Ministers for the decision and definition of the further action .	-5.2420
A decision on this will probably be taken next year .	-2.3070
Following the reconstruction , pavement and tree planting of the old school inner courtyard within the two side wings of the 1912-built school , the following measure must be reconstructed and placed on new substructures , from                  restructurin   .	-7.8282
The historical , one hundred years old delimitation wall of the old school house to the Kirchstra<unk>e , is particularly needed by water and frost damage , since no drainage is available , and has an arch inclination f                  	-5.9681
Deep cracks in individual stones demonstrate weather damage , but the wall is not currently in danger of collapse .	-3.4345
A stand-secure wall is a prerequisite for a school farm used by students , which has been done by the current fortification work .	-4.0251
Originally , the school courtyard renovation was even planned in 2008 / 2009 , but high implant expenditure brought a shift .                                      	-10.0710
An important word in the historical school wall recovery , which has already been used for film recordings , will take part in the national monument office .	-4.2026
If specifications come from this page , the city of Bräunlingen hopes for grants from the monument protectors .	-3.4142
The students of the Bräunlinger Primary School , who are now returned to a well-renovated old school building with new Aula , can soon use the old school farm .	-5.5073

In the ongoing discussions about the future of the universities of music in Baden-Württemberg , Cem <unk>zdemir , the Green Chairman of the Greens , has now also b             	-5.3097
" I think it is wrong to give up holistic training at the Stuttgart Music Academy " , said <unk>zdemir the " Stuttgart News " .	-3.5524
Jazz and classic belong together at the jazz location Stuttgart .	-2.9788
Thus , <unk>zdemir , who is considered to be a favorite for a direct mandate in the Federal election on 22 September , is the Green Red Government .	-7.9619
This forces a reorganization of the five music colleges in Baden-Württemberg on the basis of an expert study .	-3.2022
After that , the course of Jazz and Pop should be shifted from the Stuttgart Music School to the Mannheim University of Music .	-4.8112
US Border : " Super-Tunnel " to Drug Smuggling	-2.0812
On the border between Mexico and the US , investigators discovered and decommissioned a " super tunnel " for drug smuggling .	-2.7664
As the US customs authorities said , the more than 500 metres long tubes between Tijuana and San Diego were equipped with electricity , railway tracks and a ventilation plant .	-5.2742
Three suspects were therefore arrested , eight tonnes of Marijuana and almost 150 kilograms of cocaine seized .	-2.6783
According to the data , the tunnel had not yet been used .	-2.4590
" These cartels are stupid if they think they could go through under the radar , " said the general prosecutor of the US district Southern California , Laura Duffy , at a press conference in front of a warehouse in San Diego , where an end of the tunnel was discovered .	-3.8981
Duffy applied to the drug gangs : " If you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them , we are determined to make this a huge waste of your dirty money .	-6.2122
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a permanent fight against the drug cartels .	-2.3690
Since 2006 , more than 77 000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug crime .	-2.0484
Constructed by Experts	-1.3758
Because of the expensive equipment of the tunnel , the investigators assume that he was constructed by architects and engineers and that the construction took place around a yea .	-5.2218
The track was equipped to use electrically operated cars .	-2.8520
On the Mexican side there is access in a building which is 80 meters away from the border .	-7.4842
According to the authorities , a head leads 20 meters into the depth to the actual tunnel entrance .	-3.1746
The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 meters altitude and 90 centimeter width .	-2.5103
It would also have been appropriate to promote illegal immigration towards the US .	-2.3613
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine fund .	-1.9970
The third , a Mexican , was taken because of the seized Marijuana .	-2.5531
All three are threatened as the maximum penalty of lifelong freedom     as official  sai  .          a       	-5.2162
Since 2006 , eight such tunnels have been discovered , it has continued at the press conference   in     S Di     .	-4.0630
But it is the first time that cocaine was found in such a tunnel building .	-2.6118
Usually cocaine is smuggled in smaller quantities and not through tunnels .	-2.3937
This shows the " desperation " of drug gangs , whose traditional routes have now been cut off , said Bill Sherman from the drug flag DEA in San Diego .	-3.5182
They would do everything to get into the US .	-4.5326
No details have been announced to those arrested , at least one of them was Mexicans .	-3.2763
You have to expect prison sentences up to ten years .	-2.6472
2014 Geisinger Festival	-4.0790
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen during the 1250 .	-4.6573
Return of the first documentary mention is becoming ever closer .	-3.1491
When the year comes to an end in good eight weeks , the year of the anniversary will come to place   .      	-5.2572
Singing and church houses were mentioned for the first time in 794 .	-2.5577
In churches a document was made in which both places are mentioned .	-4.5266
On March 15th there will be an official anniversary year , and as spirits currently have no hall , this event will take place in the place where both were mentioned 1250 years ago , in church houses .	-6.9562
Within the framework of the anniversary , several events are planned both in Geisingen and in church houses .	-3.2376
Church houses will be the 1250 in July at a festival weekend fro   1   to  2 J      .	-4.2669
Celebrate return .	-1.6070
On Friday with a festival , on Saturday and Sunday with a festival around the Kirchtalhalle .	-2.7542
The church festival is also the church festival on this weekend .	-4.0351
City Music Director Rudolf Barth wrote an order composition for the city on the occasion of the anniversary , whi is listed at three dates .	-3.6361
On June 21 , together with the sunwend celebration of the Black Forest Association , on July 12th in the Arena with fireworks and on December 13th as the first concert of city music in the new Festhalle .	-3.5759
This is completed and inaugurated in the anniversary year , the official date is last September , 27 and 28 September .	-3.1327
A new chronicle is also published on the occasion of the Geisinger City Anniversary .	-2.9370
" However , a chronicle should not only become singers themselves , but also a printed work on the spirit of today , which consists of spirits , church houses , shipping , aulfings and gutmadings " , says Mayor Walter Hengstler .	-5.2414
And today ’ s singing also celebrates in 2014 birthday , in 1974 today ’ s space was completed with the involvements                                	-9.2625
The new chronicle will then be presented in the new Festhalle in Geisingen on 21 or 22 November .	-2.7781
But 2014 is also a year with many anniversaries .	-2.3351
Strohglonki will begin on 8 February with a custom evening on the occasion of its 60th anniversary , the Gutmadingen harmony will be 90 years and has the fixed banquet on 29 March and then celebrates the district music festival from 1 to 4 May .	-5.0490
The Altenwerk Leipferdingen will be 40 years old , the Geisinger Schule has been at the new location for 50 years and celebrates this on 10 May , the music association Polyhymnia Leipferdingen will be 150 years old and celebrate this within the framework of the fountain festival from 4 to 7 July .	-4.2247
The city of Geisingen was mentioned for the first time in 764 in a gift certificate which is possessed by the St. Gallen monastery       .	-4.3828
The document was manufactured in churches ( houses ) , which was then court square .	-3.2080
Both communities are therefore mentioned in the same document .	-2.0179
Celebrating this 1250-year-old celebration in addition to the community reform is 40 years as well .	-3.9893
Council Takes Tracks Vi .	-5.7487
Should the railway transition be completely rebuilt to increase road safety ?	-3.4348
Yes , the local councils have decided .	-6.0938
Shiltach must take EUR 220 000 into hand for thi .	-3.0351
Deutsche Bahn wants to improve the Kinzigtal railway line next year .	-2.3290
It is particularly important to increase the safety of railway crossings - regularly there are collisions of trains with other vehicles across the globe .	-5.6836
If the communities agree with the reconstruction measures , they must participate with one-third of the costs , the rest share themselves with the railway and the         	-4.8887
Schiltach 's city building master Roland Grie<unk>haber explained to the Council of Municipalities the specific characteristics of the transition " Am Hirschen " .	-4.3064
There , the city plans to build an exhibition in the amount of the tunnel mouth west of the railway track .	-4.4650
There could also be larger vehicles , for example those transporting long-wood , without having to block the track .	-3.7549
Wholesalers therefore proposed to construct a necessary support wall in such a way that the city can spread the subsequent road at due time to ensure a smooth flow of transport .	-3.9224
This has been discussed controversially in the Council of Municipal Affairs because some Councils doubted the need for road spread : Thomas Kipp , with his statement , brought the mood of critics to the point : ' Do we have to take so much money because of so few vehicles ? '	-4.6835
Mayor Thomas Haas contradicted : The railway transition " Hirschen " is used regularly for long-wood transport .	-3.4449
Even wood from the " Kuhbach " area is partly transported over this route because the up to 20 metres long vehicles could not use the route at the Häberlesbrücke because they could not turn there into the main road .	-4.1166
Moreover , the route as a redirection for those vehicles which must not use the tunnel when the main road is blocked argued haas .	-3.8065
There must be no doubt that Kirchberg- und Schlossbergtunnel should be rebuilt and restored , as is currently the case in Wolfach , the railway transition " Am " Derschen " can also be important for a longer period of time .	-5.0740
The Councils agreed to investigate what costs would cause the dissemination of the road .	-3.0387
Notwithstanding this , the majority agreed to the reconstruction of the railway transition , with the indication that the necessary support wall is built in such a way that the city can expand the subsequent road towards " Railway Station Road " if necessary for encounter traffic to around 5.5 meters .	-5.6735
The reconstruction of the transition to the donor wine could , on the other hand , affect access to the highly increasing " Geroltzhäuser Weg " .	-4.5219
The administration had investigated the railway plans from the Breinlinger Engineering Office because it had doubts about whether the Geroltzhäuser Weg ’ s planned connection was still possible .	-6.9144
The investigation came to the result that it was not to be excluded that the road ’ s inclination conditions could lead to longer vehicles to sit .	-4.0968
The responsibility for this wears the city as a road-building l    .	-4.4261
The reconstruction can therefore draw liabilities .	-3.0744
Since both the wooden drive and the turning in the current state of expansion worked , you should not agree to the conversion of the railway transition , argue  Haas .             	-5.6135
At this point , too , the risk of a collision of train with a vehicle on the transition is significantly lower than on the other railway crossings , because there are directly next to the middle of the stop where there is a good visibility .	-5.4387
Even trains from the main railway station would have to be dismantled at this point to the extent that no collision is threat    .	-3.9475
Most of them were refused to reconstruct this railway transition because the city of Schiltach would have to bathe the problem with seated vehicles , so the Councils , since the railway can withdraw from the responsibility after the construction work has been completed .	-5.4904
The board considers unproblematic the reconstruction of the railway transitions " Before Heubach " and " Vor Kuhbach " , for which cross-conventional agreements have already been made by train .	-5.0620
Esa decides on large space missions : missions for billions	-1.9721
Furthermore , planets , waves of gravity or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects that they want to start in the coming years      . T i             	-5.6652
30 suggestions were selected , five are still in the race .	-3.9351
Far worlds .	-1.0303
More than 1000 planets at other stars have already found astronomers .	-2.0046
Whether there are at least some of them living , nobody knows .	-2.5632
The selection is difficult : should you look for gravitational waves ?	-2.7772
Or prefer to explore the origin of cosmos ?	-2.3956
Or after similar planets , perhaps discover outside life ?	-4.0793
These questions are precisely those responsible for the Esa European Space Agency .	-2.5605
For their " Cosmic Vision " programme , they are looking for ideas for two major space projects that are intended to make research crucial .	-5.8090
The budget for such " L missions " is about EUR 1 billion each .	-2.4454
The start will probably be 2028 and 2034 .	-1.6667
In early September , in Paris , the elite of European space research met to discuss proposals for such missions .	-2.4176
30 ideas have been debated , five of which have now come into the closer choice .	-2.8182
Numerous bodies examine the proposals , haoked by researchers .	-3.4769
In the next few days , a final decision should be taken by the Scientific Programme Committee .	-2.5812
A total of four major questions the Esa has chosen to find answers to the missions of the Cosmic Vision programme , initiated in 2007 .	-5.1580
What are the conditions for the emergence of planets and life ?	-1.7313
The exact processes in the emergence of stars from large gas clouds - and thus also the emergence of planets that circle these stars - are still in the proverbial dark .	-4.0720
A large infrared telescope in all could penetrate this dark .	-2.2367
And if a star has planet , in what circumstances can life emerge ?	-2.8689
In order to address this question , the space telescope " Cheops " will be launched in 2017 , with which 500 already known planetary systems are investigated more closely in our nearer environment .	-4.3039
But the possibilities are limited , cheops is a small mission with a budget of EUR 150 million .	-2.1809
With larger instruments , the astronomers could form similar planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres , seeking " biomarkers " : gases that are considered to be an indication of biological activ  .	-5.7995
How does the solar system work ?	-1.4238
This question should ultimately include what conditions there are for the emergence of life .	-3.7106
An important role is the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field as well as the particle radiation with the planetary system .  The magnetic activity of a star                	-5.8821
These processes can be examined exemplary in our solar system .	-2.5204
With the " Solar Orbiter " , the Esa has already approved a mission of the M class ( where the budget is about half a billion euros ) for this issue .	-3.5351
The probe should start in 2017 and observe the surface and activity of the sun clo .	-5.7990
Of great interest to researchers are also Jupiter and his moons .	-2.4063
They want to find out what role the giant planet played in the development of the solar system .	-2.6877
For this , the Esa provides for the first of the three L missions of the " Cosmic Vision " program .	-4.6855
The sond " Juice " ( Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer ) starts its journey expected to be 2022 .	-3.0884
Eight years later , it reaches Jupiter and should examine the atmosphere of the planet and the icy moon of Europe , Kallisto and Ganymed .	-3.0333
What are the basic physical laws of the universe ?	-1.4428
The World All offers many opportunities to study matter under extreme conditions and to examine whether the natural laws we know are still valid there .	-3.8695
Perhaps there are also deviations that could pave the way to a new theory to the physicists , under whose roof all known natural laws can be united .	-4.2077
How did the universe emerge and what is it ?	-2.6188
Our cosmos was created 13.7 billion years ago by the bi  ba             	-6.2937
In addition to the stars , planets and living creatures that we consist of , there are dark matters whose gravity cohesively holds galaxies and clusters , and Dark Energy , which accelerates the expansion of world all .	-4.8914
So far , researchers do not know which physical laws were valid in the first second fractions of the big bang , nor what dark matter and dark energy consist of .	-3.3747
With " Euclid " , the Esa has already approved a M mission here , whose start is planned for 2020 .	-3.7995
With a special telescope , the probe should examine the distribution of the matter in the universe for the first time in the entire sky , allowing for conclusions on the nature of dark matter and dark energy .	-4.2769
Those who could make the Rac	-4.9573
Of the 30 proposals , only two will remain at the end of the selection procedure .	-2.2699
The best opportunities for approval as an L mission , in the opinion of many experts " E-Lisa " , has a demanding concept for providing gravity waves .	-3.9016
Physicists understand changes in the structure of space time that Albert Einstein predicted almost 100 years ago .	-2.6781
They have still not been proven .	-2.3552
Elisa could create this , hope scientists behind the project .	-2.1229
The mission provides for a detector consisting of two or three probes , which is stationed in all .	-4.7215
Unlike installations on earth , he could also prove the waves of gravity that have been created with the big bang and thus provide new knowledge of the cosmos ’  emergen            	-6.7747
Four other proposals compete for the second L mission : a large X-ray telescope called Athena , which is to explore black holes , " Icy Planets " , another mission to the outer planet of the solar system , " Prism " , a mission to measure the cosmic background radiation , and the " Exoplanet Finder " , which should detect and examine the similar planet .	-4.7973
Among other things , proposals for the sample return transportation of Mars , the exploration of moon , venus and asteroids , as well as the sun physics .	-4.5204
Snowden ready to “ cooperate ” with Germany in relation to US monitoring .	-2.5017
Edward Snowden , the whistleblower of the US intelligence service , has explained that he is ready to travel to Berlin and state before the German Bundestag if the American National Security Agency and her director Keith Alexander do not give answers about their activities .	-3.7112
German MEP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden on Thursday in Russia , where this asylum has received to discuss the statement in Germany .	-2.8526
In a letter from Snowden , who was presented to the media in Berlin on Friday of Ströbele , this writes : “ Even though the result of my efforts was proven to be positive , my government continues to treat a different opinion as a flawbreak and tries to criminalise political expression with penalty threat , which does not allow defence . ”	-5.1675
Saying the truth is not a crime .	-1.9886
In the letter , Snowden writes that he is convinced that support from the international community can convince the American Government to let the charge against it .	-3.5396
The indictment charged by the US Ministry of Justice includes espionage and theft of state ownership .	-3.0774
German Home Affairs Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich said online about time : “ When Mr Snowden is prepared to talk to German representatives , we find ways to enable this . ”	-3.6097
Relations between the US and Germany are burdened by the claims that the NSA has belonged to Chancellor Angela Merkel 's mobile phone .	-2.8352
Thomas Oppermann , the Member who guides the parliamentary committee responsible for the intelligence service , declared that we should take the opportunity to listen to Snowden as a witness if this is possible , “ without jeopardizing it and ruining relations with the United States . ”	-4.2675
Ströbele , a member of the Greens , published an image of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed .	-2.2603
He has been accompanied by two German journalists when he visited Russia .	-5.0567
Ströbele explained that , according to the lawyer of the former NSA employee , Snowden could not return to Russia if he leaves the country .	-2.8924
If Snowden says in Germany , then he needs an assurance that he is “ safe ” there , the Member .	-3.4365
In his letter , Snowden explains that he would suspend a “ serious and continuing ” persecution campaign that driven him out of his homeland .	-3.3631
However , it touches from the global response to “ my act of political expression . ”	-2.5971
Citizens around the world and high-level politicians – including in the United States – have described revelations about an uncontrolled system of comprehensive monitoring as a merit of the general public .	-3.3182
In his letter , Snowden makes the German authorities an offer of cooperation “ if the difficulties around the humanitarian situation have been resolved . ”	-2.8372
Frontier Airlines C            B B                   	-8.3097
Frontier Airlines plans to demand up to $ 100 of passengers who want to stow hand baggage on their flight .	-2.8826
Frontier Airlines intends to calculate up to $ 100 for a piece of hand baggage and $ 2 for coffee or lemonade , even if the announcement was read on Wednesday that passengers should keep the whole can .	-3.3742
The new fee is valid for hand baggage in the luggage store over the seat , small bags under the seat are still free of charge .	-3.5046
Frontier explained that $ 25 is calculated when the fee is paid in advance , and $ 100 for travellers who only paid at the flight .	-3.9721
Frontier spokesman Kate O 'Malley said that the fee of $ 100 is aimed at moving travellers to take care of payment in advance .	-3.0849
“ We do not want to calculate this sum , ” she explained .	-2.1727
Airlines started in 2008 to ask for fees for the first and second piece of baggage .	-6.2662
Passengers who tried to circumvent them have therefore stuffed as much as possible into hand baggage , which means that the baggage stores are often overflown above the seat .	-4.4466
Fees are a way to move passengers to take less on board .	-2.3708
O 'Malley said that the new fee is not really about earning money .	-2.1263
It is about the loyalty customers of Frontier , who would have expressed clearly that it would become increasingly harder to find space in the space over the seat .	-4.1223
Passengers who buy your tickets on the website of the airline do not have to pa .	-2.3518
This means that a passenger may take a baggage free of charge at the Frontier climb , but the next person must pay $ 100 for a comparable baggage piece .	-3.8666
O 'Malley explained that the Frontier website and the check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers are informed about the fee before they come to the flight .	-3.3926
Frontier 's new hand baggage fee will only enter into force in the summer , and there is no exact date yet .	-4.8880
Passengers often shimp baggage surcharges and other fees , but airlines are happy to use them .	-3.4691
They argue that the transport of baggage costs money and passengers should pay this service if they wanted it .	-2.8068
Many on Wall Street view the new luggage fees as a sign that airlines take enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses .	-3.1781
However , most people have so far left the fingers of charges for hand baggage .	-4.8483
Spirit Airlines Inc. required three years ago as the first fee for hand baggage and later followed Allegiant Air , also a cheap flyer .	-2.9570
The only other airline company with such a fee was the Hungarian Wizz Air , declared the airline consultant Jay Sorensen , who carefully followed the additional fees .	-3.5175
He estimated in a report of December 2011 that the hand baggage fee Spirit introduced $ 50 million per year .	-3.1312
Sorensen , who previously holds a leading position at Midwest Airlines , has recently flew with Spirit and was curious , which would expect him at the airport if passengers were faced with the unusual hand baggage fee of the company .	-4.3594
“ The boarding process was one of the most smooth I experienced in my career in aviation , ” he said .	-2.4339
I expected to see teeth cones and handgraphic discussions at the aircraft .	-3.4384
“ The aircraft was full , ” he explained , “ and the boarding ran as lubricated . ”	-2.8482
Frontier also follows the 2 dollars required for coffee , tea , lemonade or juice .	-2.5776
The company explained that passengers who bought Limonade or Juice were allowed to keep the whole can and coffee free of charge .	-3.5222
Water remains free of charge .	-1.4539
In 2008 , US Airways tried to request money for refreshment beverages , but reversed this seven months later , after passengers had complained and no other large society was drawn .	-4.2084
Frontier ’ s step to charge fees for hand baggage if passengers do not buy directly at the airline is the recent initiative to direct customers to their own website .	-3.3266
Airlines pay online travel agencies like Orbitz 10 to $ 25 per ticket sold .	-9.2335
This provides all companies with an incentive to move passengers to direct purchase with them instead of an online travel agency .	-3.0642
However , Frontier has gone the broadest in this area .	-2.6764
In September , the company began to award only half so many frequent flyer miles when booking an online travel agency .	-3.1981
On Wednesday , the miles were reduced to 25 percent of the flight route .	-2.6928
A third-party flight trip with Frontier over 1000 miles will therefore bring customers only 250 miles .	-4.0580
Passengers can also book places exclusively when purchasing directly on the website of Frontier .	-2.9660
Frontier has a loyal customer base in Denver , but the business shrinks and the company loses money .	-3.0257
The proceeds went by 9 % and the flight capacity shrinked just 13 % in the first quarter , as is to be read in the financial report published on Wednesday by the parent group , Republic Airways Holdings Inc . .	-3.6555
Republic has tried to get the finances of Frontier under the sale of society .	-2.9176
Proverbs Come from the Bible	-2.0571
Well 40 women visited the last women 's breakfast this year in the evangelical church community Bisingen .	-2.7557
The subject of the day in the community house was " proverbs from the Bible " and " speeches from the Middle Ages " .	-3.1889
Zita Köhler , the chairman of the church council , went after breakfast in a talk on the biblical saying words .	-3.4885
" Saying words contain wisdom of life , rules or warnings " , she explained .	-2.5116
She compared several saying words with the appropriate biblical sites and explained the importance .	-3.3492
She called saying words like : wooden eyes are vigilant , as scales fall from the eyes , throw an eye on someone , the Lord in sleep , wash his hands in innocence .	-4.8299
Several times , the speaker also advised her listeners on what saying it was .	-2.9990
The speeches from the Middle Ages adopted the Church Community Christel Dehner : All good things are three , blue , something scared .	-3.8904
It explained the importance and origin of the speech that she called ' bridges into the past ' .	-2.9756
Finally , a tombola was lost .	-2.4036
The prizes were covered on a table and were rewritten humorously before they were passed to the winners .	-2.8083
Among the visitors of the breakfast round also mixed themselves with mayor candidate Roman Waizenegger .	-3.2854
Learning instead of unemployed : Pilot project for unskilled tourism	-2.5115
A pilot project for the tourism industry is starting at the Mecklenburgische Lakenplatte .	-5.2366
Under the leadership of the Federal Work Agency , 49 women and men who are already working as unskilled in the industry should be qualified for hotels and restaurants over three winters .	-3.9019
" New is that the six-month courses end with degrees " , said Carmen Wiechert from the Neubrandenburg Agency .	-3.0627
The benefits are diverse : the participants would not be unemployed , companies would get trained professionals who were missing increasingly in hotels and restaurants , and the agency does not need to finance unemployment .	-4.2797
The project also involves the Chamber of Industry and Commerce in Neubrandenburg and the Deutsche Hotel- und Gaststättenverband ( Dehoga ) Mecklenburg-Vorpomm        .            .  	-5.1308
NSA explains that an “ internal error ” and not hackers are th fau of the website	-3.6985
The shadowy National Security Agency explained late Friday , a bug had paralyzed its public website some hours and not hackers , as online was claimed .	-3.5883
“ NSA.gov was not achievable for a few hours this night , as an internal error occurred during a planned update , ” explained the Spionage Agency in an e-mail .	-3.7068
The problem will be fixed this evening .	-1.4167
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed Denial of Service Attack ( DDoS ) , was not true .	-2.6065
In the early hours of the evening , online server trackers noticed that the NSA website was at least six hours not accessible and this was not remaining for some users .	-3.8974
Previously , a NSA spokesman explained to ABC News that the authority ’ s sensitive internal network is “ not in any way ” compromised .	-2.9522
Secret information is not at risk , so the speaker .	-1.8496
At least one group of hacktivists used to have paralysed the NSA website with a DDoS attack .	-2.4713
In such attacks , the target website is flooded with page calls until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses .	-2.8660
Cyber tactics are relatively simple and the attacks do not serve to introduce the internal network of the target system .	-2.6763
The previously super-secret NSA , whose nickname was once No Search Agency ( No such authority ) , is now in the bright light of the public and sees itself sharp criticism after the revelations that have become known in recent months about their extensive monitoring programme at home and abroad – a result of the secret NSA data stolen and published by the disillusioned former NSA employee Edward Snowden .                            	-7.1866
The growing controversy around the secret service fired initial speculations about the incident today is the result of a targeted cyper operation .	-3.1764

Loss of profits at Bombardier after decline in delivery numbers and orders	-2.9660
The Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15-percent decline in the net profit on Thursday after he was under pressure through declining orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter as well as contractual problems in the railway section .	-4.3359
Bombardier , based in Montreal , also published no flight test data for his brand new CSeries aircraft and gave no new information about whether the aircraft could go into commercial use according to the ambitious timetable next September .	-3.8053
At the Jungfernflight of the test aircraft a month and a half ago only three other starts have followed , which makes it questionable whether the test phase is as planned .	-4.4491
The results remained behind the forecasts and led to a course fall of more than eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exc .                 	-4.8242
Cameron Doerksen , analyst at National Bank Financial , reduced his evaluation from “ outperform ” to “ sector perform ” on Thursday that the share has a limited course potential in the next one to two quarters .	-3.3587
“ Although weaker delivery numbers have been largely expected for aircraft , we are very clearly disappointed by margin development in the transport area , ” said Doerksen in a customer letter .	-3.9862
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries when the test program proceeds for the aircraft .	-3.0241
However , if no new orders are announced in the coming months , we expect the market to become more sceptical to the programme .	-2.8913
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft can catapult the company into the lower market segment currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus .	-5.9316
The first test aircraft was presented to the public in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delay .	-4.1828
But so far , binding orders for the CSeries with 177 are moderate , because potential buyers wait for the results of the flight tests and want to see whether the company 's claims are true in terms of fuel efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the new nozzle aircraft .	-4.2280
There are currently 403 orders and promises of 15 customers and companies .	-2.1560
CEO Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will achieve its goal of 300 binding orders at the beginning of the commercial use of the jet .	-2.9759
The corporate governance also insured on Thursday to analysts and media , the programme is in the timetable .	-3.9464
“ The test aircraft has no longer remained on the ground than expected , ” said Beaudoin at a telephone conference and added , while the standing time of the aircraft had been setting ground tests and software updates .	-7.8045
Each manufacturer plans differently .	-1.6743
We have decided to do a first flight and then append a revision period , which we have also done .	-2.5404
This is done throughout the flight programme .	-1.8142
The second of five test aircraft will expect to start in the next few weeks , the remaining shortly afterwards , it said from the company side .	-3.5298
Nevertheless , analysts remain skeptical whether twelve months after the Jungfernflug the first customer can operate an aircraft of the CSeries .	-3.2850
Bombardier explained that it checked the planning for commissioning ( EIS ) and will update them in the coming months .	-2.7736
“ The slow progress of the flight test – even though they obviously correspond to bombardiers of internal planning – strengthens our view that commissioning is moving to the first quarter of 2015 , ” said Doerksen .	-4.0789
In the third quarter , with the end of September 30 , Bombardier ’ s net profit fell to $ 147 million and $ 8 cents per share of $ 172 million or 9 cents per share previously .	-5.5262
The adapted profit per share is unchanged 9 cents .	-2.0637
Sales grew slightly from $ 4.2 billion to $ 4.1                     	-6.8478
Analysts had expected a profit of $ 10 per share and $ 4.56 billion , Thomson Reuters I / B / E / S.	-2.8474
The world ’ s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer states that he has delivered 45 aircraft in this quarter , a decline of 57 last year .	-2.7250
The net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26 .	-1.7528
The order book in the Aerospace Party was $ 32.9 billion on 30 September and was thus unchanged to 31 December .	-3.0376
“ In the aerospace sector , the results were under our requirements , but the low order intake and the market relationship as a whole were disappointing , ” said Beaudoin .	-3.5959
Sales in the Aerospace Party fell by 13 % to $ 2 billion .	-1.9803
Bombardier , the world ’ s largest railway manufacturer , announced that sales in this division have increased by almost eleven percent to $ 2.1 billion .	-2.8882
The order book in the transport part was $ 32.6 billion on 30 September and was thus easily increased to 31 December .	-3.1446
The profit margin in the field of transport has been affected by settlement problems in some major contracts .	-3.5179
According to corporate governance , there will be new requirements for the fourth quarter .	-2.5028
In the afternoon trade on Thursday , the Bombardier share graduated by 8.5 percent and was at 4.83 Canadian dollars after it was also announced that the Google Financial Board Patrick Pichette will change to the Management Board .	-4.3389
The Brazilian Embraer SA , the world ’ s third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and bombardier ’ s closest rival , reported a ten percent decline in quarterly profit on Thursday .	-2.9731

The Lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction could come to light	-2.7391
He was condemned by the Liverpool Crown Court to three years prison	-8.0218
A well-known criminal defender warning a drug baron against a great police investigation because he was afraid that his secret drug addiction could be revealed has been condemned to three years of prison .	-3.5632
Basharat Ditta , 42 , supplied underworld size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about investigations on his activities in drug trafficking after he was compromised by his own cocaine addiction .	-3.1503
The lawyer prisoned by criminalists as “ first-class ” with the nickname “ Bash ” was arrested in his house in 2011 after the Scarborough police , which he represented in an earlier drug procedure .	-4.0675
Officials observed how Scarborough ( 32 ) delivered three bags of cocaine at the house of the lawyer in Blackburn , Lancashire , while it was with colleagues at a meal of the Chamber of Lawyers .	-3.6614
The investigations proved that Ditta regularly consumed class A drugs after traces of cocaine had been found in his hair , wallet and credit cards .	-3.9101
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011 , he tried to obtain information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners .	-2.4619
All four suspects were monitored by the police in the context of a major investigation procedure on heroin and cocaine trading in Lancashire , Cumbria , Merseyside , Berkshire and West Yorkshire .	-4.8949
Together with 32 other people , they were later arrested after the police ensured cash in a number of house searches heroin and cocaine in the value of 1.5 million pounds and 200,000 pounds .	-3.4751
Ditta , 42 , gave information to the criminals continued because he feared that his drug addiction can become public .	-6.9233
Today , Ditta , who works for the Forbes Solicitors firm in Blackburn , was found and condemned to the Liverpooler Crown Court following a three-week procedure in two indictments because of the disability o   th j                      	-6.4351
He admitted the cocaine possession in an earlier survey .	-3.4432
The lawyer was transferred after the police found in their investigations against Scarborough that in February 2011 it had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta .	-3.6807
Two investigators followed the suspect and saw how he went to Ditta ’ s house and put drugs with a purity of 60 % in a black golf below the waste tonne of the lawyer .	-3.5243
Shortly after he had delivered the drugs , Scarborough telephoned regularly with Ditta , who was in Ewood Park at the dinner in the football stadium of the Blackburn Rovers           .	-5.7203
The lawyer returned home , the drugs and then nine messages were exchanged between the two .	-2.8852
Before the court , Ditta was known to be a “ regular consumer ” of cocaine after testing class A drugs had been discovered in his hair , wallet and credit card .	-6.6534
Ditta was later arrested , but depended on taking cocaine and said he spoke to the alleged dealer because it was his client , and claimed that her discussion was subject to the “ lawyer secret . ”	-3.8650
During his arrest , Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards , but they were ensured and a hair test was taken out of    h . T ' '     ' w  ' ,   ' Th              	-8.9011
In police interrogation , he stated that he would call an office and clients at home for legal affairs both under his private address and in the workpla                                	-7.0873
The Court was aware that he called for important players in drug trafficking , some of which he had represented before , significant arrests and informed what the investigators knew about them .	-4.1003
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said : “ A criminal lawyer should know better than anyone else that the law is not breached . ”	-2.8063
Ditta was charged with the abuse of his position as a criminal defender , because he had become too much involved with certain clients .	-4.1178
The relationship in question is not simply a drug trafficker , but a drug trafficker who supplies his lawyer with drugs .	-2.8525
Part of his communications was undoubtedly legitimate , because he was the lawyer of these people .	-2.4206
But that was far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between lawyers and clients .	-2.4117
He worked against police investigations as far as possible so that they could continue to follow their criminal activities .	-3.2669
Mr Ditta thus brought his profession into discard .	-3.2459
He was too close to certain clients , especially Scarborough , and he admitted that his independence was compromised .	-2.5058
Ditta had any misconduct and claimed : “ If I were a corrupt lawyer , which I am not , and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough , I would not wait 15 hours , but do so immediately . ”	-4.2008
But , after the hearing , Superintendent Lee Halstead said from the police in Lancashire : “ Mr Ditta has taken the step from a criminal defender to a criminal at the moment when he started to acquire drugs from organised criminals . ”	-6.9038
His cocaine dependency led to hopeless compromise and received him for the motives of leading members of organised crime , who commissioned him to obtain valuable information about police investigations .	-3.7625
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and provide public trust and confidence .	-2.1992
Ditta has passed this confidence and attempted to get behind the facade of his profession .	-4.0001
The Serious and Organised Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigations against Ditta , which also led to condemnation in three cases because of the possession of cocaine and judicial disability , which underlines our determination to bring criminals to justice .	-3.3356
This case should be a warning to criminals and show that none can escape the arm of the law .	-2.8610
We find you and bring you to court .	-2.1072
Scarborough himself was condemned to 14 years of prison after he had declared himself conspiracy to heroin , cocaine and cannabis trade .	-3.2792
Thirty-five other persons involved in drug trafficking were condemned to total penalties of 153 years for drug delicacies .	-3.4858
On his website , Ditta published an area with questions and answers about himself that his dream job was to represent as lawyer clients in the death cell in America , his ultimate guest at dinner was Mohammed Ali and inequality of opportunity is the motivation for his work .	-3.8951

On Saturday the bodies of Haslach , Hofstetten , Mühlenbach , Fischerbach , Steinach and Welschensteinach prepared themselves for the changes .	-3.1064
Because the fundamental decisions of the diocese are nothing more to be amended and it is up to the parish councils to implement them as satisfactory as possible .	-3.8507

From each parish , at least two elected members should be represented , in which six parishes are formed on the ground so-called local teams .	-3.9228
Your task will be to promote church life in the place in the future .	-2.5292
In the question of the finances of the individual parish community , there was a considerable need for discussions .	-3.6787
The innovations provide for accumulated credit to be preserved in the parish .	-3.4609
By contrast , the liabilities are transferred to the overall community .	-3.1615
There have been great concern , particularly with regard to the major investments that have been planned , whose commitment then makes a            	-5.1449
" Even in the past , only projects that could be managed by the individual parishes alone , " relativised Haslach 's chairman , Bruno Prinzbach , relative c .	-7.0613
Practical experience with a common body for five parishes described Barbar Knights , the chairman of the body in the Seelsorgeeniet Schutterwald-Neuried .	-3.3295
They had made themselves a task in 2006 , ' One will remain , five ' , and had to say that this is not so easy .	-6.2432
The bodies of the Haslacher Seelsorgeenheit then answered the questions relating to the future composition and size of the common council of parish and the practical work of the community team                  	-5.4215

In Pfullendorf , the Electricity	-1.8013
The citizens of Pfullendorf must adjust to higher electricity costs .      i       i    .	-7.8182
As the managing director of the city works , Jörg-Arne Bias , confirmed against the S<unk>DKURIER , a four-headed Pfullendorf family has 70 to 90 Euro additional costs per year .	-4.0734
The main reason for the forthcoming price increase is the increase in the so-called EEG survey from 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt hour .	-3.4033
This surrounding is reset every year in October by the four operators of the large electricity roads .	-3.2320
These indicate the additional costs they arise from the turn of energy , which they can collect through a surrounding of the    power p p       . T        ,	-6.6054
The city works Pfullendorf form the last link in this chain .	-4.5538
The Supervisory Board of the Energy Company even started in its forecasts from a higher surrounding , as Jörg-Arne Bias reports .	-3.6664
Now the concrete payments would have to be calculated before the city works could inform their customers about the exact price increase next week .	-3.3341
" We go from an increase of 1 cent plus x " , says Bias , where the number will be near the 2 cent .	-10.7029
Light on Durable Red : Respect Waiting              	-5.1376
Sometimes a light is simply not green .	-2.0165
The contact loop in the street does not react or the light sign is defective .	-4.4169
What should you do - with red ?	-3.1507
If a person affected long enough to wait for a red traffic light and the crossing is free , he can continue , the Stuttgart lawyer explains Ralf Becker in the magazine " Motorcycle " .	-3.6089
However , waiting time must be ' appropriate ' , which can be designed differently from case to case .	-3.1978
Becker advises to stop at least five minutes before going out of a functional disorder of the lights .	-3.4317
However , anyone who continues the journey despite red lights must be aware that it is fully blamed for an accident caused by it .	-4.1569
Those who tolerate less than five minutes may not wait long enough , warn Becker and refer to a decision by the Hamm Upper Land Court .	-3.3356
In the negotiated case , a driver had ignored the lights after about three minutes of permanent red and had to be responsible for a negligent violation o  re                  	-5.6520
In fact , the lights were not defective , but little later transferred to green .	-3.4889
A ban on driving remained saved because of the special situation - but the fine did not .	-3.0887
Local Council is pleased with sound budget	-5.7627
Whenever the budget is at local meetings , Mayor Ralph Gerster has laughed well .	-2.8219
The municipality in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and debt has no longer known the administration since 2005 .	-3.0502
The financial year 2012 can also be considered to be full success in this s .	-3.4771
This was clear in the idea of the 2012 annual accounts .	-2.7185
As Andrea Rothmund explained , the administrative budget with around EUR 7.6 million over EUR 1 million higher than planned .	-4.2228
The surplus of the administrative budget is also around EUR 1.8 million above the approach .	-2.7079
The surplus should be owed to higher tax revenues and the community share of income tax .	-3.3753
The asset budget was again clear about the planned values .	-2.9037
Instead of EUR 1.5 million last year , it was EUR 2.5 million .	-2.0945
" This is essentially the higher performance from the administrative budget " , says Rothmund .	-3.0278
Since less investment has been made than planned in the financial year 2012 , the reserve allocation has been higher .	-3.7163
Overall , the general reserve could be increased by around EUR 2.1 million to EUR 4.9 million now .	-2.8868
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for her good work .	-4.8972
" Such a work is not simply shaken from the sleeve , " Gerster praised with a view to the annual invoice .	-3.3197
He and the local councils were very pleased with the good numbers .	-2.5461
It may sound paradoxical , but these good figures could soon be expensive to citizens .	-2.6777
Through the good financial situation , the community in the past was able to renounce high levels .	-3.4233
But , according to Gerster , subsidies have often been cut by the country .	-3.5528
There are conditions for these subsidies from various compensation floors .	-2.9617
Among other things , the cities and communities requesting subsidies must provide certain lifting ra .      T        	-5.3569
" We need to look at the subject of lifting sentences , because investments are available in the coming years for which we would like to have subsidies , " Gerster announced in this context .	-4.5024

Mr Max Maier , please come to Gate 24 .	-1.2799
In future , there will be no longer be any transfer to Vienna Schwechat airport .	-4.1399

The newly designed opschlag shines with a new cafe .	-2.4808
One that invites you to linger and come back .	-2.6971
One that wants to make the name of the program .	-2.2244
According to Lexicon , Déjà Vu calls a psychological phenomenon , which expresses itself in the feeling that a new situation has already experienced or seen      s   .	-4.5209
In the event of visiting the same name café at the opschlag in the city of Kleve in view of the Rhine-Waal University , it does not have to remain with the pure Déjà Vu feeling .	-4.5694
After all , the café with the beautiful name has exactly the objective of making a real stay not only thankful , but always handfest to experience again .	-7.0231
Because it 's fun and simply beautiful .	-2.9702
A look into the inner life on the Opschlag 8 gives the viewer a good feeling at h right .	-3.8230
The state-of-the-art but not cool café ambience looks like a place for well-being .	-2.9874
Here the team with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the top spoils the guest with various coffee or cocktail versions .	-3.5769
There are delicious cakes or individually provided fresh baguettes for  t                .          	-9.6078
The owners , both 33 years old , have already made a name before the opening of the jewelry café at the Opschlag as a gastronomer : in Kranenburg they led the " Art Lounge " .	-3.8160
From the move to Kleve to the Opschlag , the sympathetic café lovers hope for more audiences .	-3.0759
Last but not least by the university .	-2.1851
" Where we do not have a certain target group " , Daniel Büttner emphasizes .	-2.7512
Rather , the two young students want to address the same way as seniors and all age classes in between .	-3.3526
Apropos Café lovers .	-1.5504
The sympathic owner pair is behind coffee pleasure .	-2.7774
Enjoy the fragrant hot brew in various variations themselves .	-2.6837
Expressofan	-0.6784
Daniel Büttner is rather the expresso fan and Mirjam van der Stelt the Cappuccino drinker .	-2.1762
" For this a baguette - this is my thing " , she teaches the NRC .	-3.7133
There were two events in the bright café .	-2.6124
Better says one thing .	-1.9163
Because the port festival took place outside - the Café Déjà Vu did not benefit from it .	-3.1775
But there was also the ring net evening .	-2.3045
" Beautiful , successful and funny " , the two 33-year-olds found .	-2.2815
But not everyone ’ s thing .	-2.1733
Perhaps Daniel Büttner is not an extremely pronounced fan of event evenings : " You cannot do all your rights " .	-4.5548
And with an event I always address only those who are also interested in the special even                      	-6.5137
That is why events will be the exception with us .	-2.2015
" We want to disturb the very normal operation as little as possible " .	-2.6260
In other words , Déjà Vu stands for reliability .	-2.1539
With regard to the quality of the products offered here , as well as the team and the beautiful surroundings at the Opschlag in Kleve .	-2.9899
The road that develops more and more into a gastronomic mile .                 	-5.7573

UN Announces New Goals in Combating Poverty	-2.6249
The United Nations is now beginning to develop a number of new objectives to replace the Millennium Development Goals announced 12 years ago to combat poverty .	-3.1530
In the run-up to the UN Sustainable Development Summit , which began in the evening in Rio de Janeiro , Australian diplomats played a key role in the promotion of “ sustainable development objectives , ” which will replace the Millennium Goals of 2015 .	-3.8702
They were included in the final draft document adopted by global leaders , including Mrs Gillard , at the summit .	-2.3195
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon stated at the evening that the time had come to “ think beyond national interests . ”	-2.7866
“ I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to tackle a process to agree universal , sustainable development goals , ” he said .	-2.7868
“ These objectives will be based on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and will form an integral part of the framework for development after 2015       .	-4.8429
I will shy no effort to implement this mandate granted to me by the Member States to achieve our vision of the sustainable development goals built on the success of the Millennium Goals . ”	-5.2903
Although the SG Achim / Baden has been without victory for four days , there is still good mood at the Handball Oberligisten .	-3.6207
There is no doubt about Trainer Tomasz Malmon .	-2.6335
Everyone continues to be fully motivated with the matter       .	-3.7634
However , I hope that we will finally win again .	-2.4103
" Because I don 't know anymore how such a victory tastes , " Malmon expects a success experience from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II .	-3.6148
Even though the third league reserve from Fredenbeck has not yet excluded trees , Malmon warns the finger in advance .	-3.7037
Many players have trained myself in the A youth .	-2.9212
They will certainly be particularly motivated against their ex-coach .	-2.7579
" In addition , we must wait to see whether there is still reinforcement from the first , " shows the SG coach .	-4.3250
In order to finally return to the track of success , the Malmon team must in any case increase compared to the past performances .	-3.3172
Above all , it happened enormously in the coverage work and in the shift game .	-3.8493
Recycling opportunities must also definitely become better .	-2.7461
I therefore hope that my players will finally get the head free during the short break .	-2.8869
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing in the face of clashes between influential figures .	-5.3300
Thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo under the vigilant eyes of the Samora Machel Statue , the founder of the State and first President of Mozambique to adopt peace calls in a rare public demonstration .	-3.7872
“ We want peace again , we want stability , ” said Vanessa de Sousa , Managing Director of an investment company .	-2.2056
For fear of the future of the country , it has exchanged its business clothing against a t-shirt with the “ We are calling for security ” in Portuguese and joined on Thursday the quantity in the capital ’ s independence place .	-4.4788
For two weeks nearly every day , there have been reports on clashes between government forces and Renamo , which have been one of the worst battles since the peace agreement over 20 years ago .	-3.3798
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement , supported initially by the White Rhodesia and later by the South African apartheid government in trying to destabilize the country ’ s independent government .	-3.5815
After the 1992 peace treaty , it became an opposition party .	-1.9842
Analysts consider it unlikely that the country falls back into a fallen conflict , but recent events have concerned foreign investors and locals .	-3.0449
The rapidly growing economy is at stake , because the discovery of huge gas deposits from the coast and coal bearings in the north-west could bring investments of more than $ 50 billion of companies such as Rio Tinto , Vale from Brazil , Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the US .	-4.2191
The ruling Frelimo party , since 1975 the dominant force , and Renamo has blamed each other for tensions .	-3.1099
Renamo claims that the government provoked recent clashes by attacking its members in the province of Sofala , a traditional Renamos castle on 17 October .	-3.0099
The attacks on the former rebels escalated when government forces attacked Renamo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama , the leader of the group , explained Renamo ’ s speakers to the Financial Times .	-3.2483
The government gives Renamo the blame for clashes and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers .	-7.3611
President Armando Guebuza has tried to play down concerns about instability .	-1.8329
Against AFP , the French news agency , he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama considered the “ loser ” that “ wants to use all its remaining forces to prove that it can impose its decisions on the government . ”	-3.6817
Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they want to avoid war .	-1.8335
But the concerns have increased since Mazanga quoted with the words that Renamo started the 1992 peace agreement .	-2.9538
He explained to the FT so that he said that Frelimo did not respect the agreement any more .	-3.2092
“ Our vision is to resume negotiations , seriously , ” said Mazanga .	-2.3719
Previous talks between the parties have contributed little to the settlement of tensions fired by a number of clashes this year .	-3.1465
“ We have two adult men ( Guebuza and Dhlakama ) that collapse the heads , ” says Joseph Hanlon , lecturer at the Open University and Mozambique experts .	-3.3852
None of them is well negotiated and none is prepared to make the necessary concessions .	-2.4552
Renamo , who presses for electoral reforms , has already stated that it will boycott the local elections in November .	-2.5792
Presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for next year .	-1.4740
Some commentators have interpreted the use of force as the attempt of a sicking movement to achieve concessions and financial benefits from the government .	-3.1011
Renamo ’ s electoral successes have shrinked since 1992 , while a newer party , founded by an earlier Renamo member , will probably improve in the elections .	-5.0616
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – whose resignation is concerned if its second term ends next year – wants to destroy the country ’ s democracy .	-2.6006
“ He does not want multiparty democracy , he does not want transparent elections , he does not want peace because he does not want to give up the presidency , ” said Mazanga .	-2.8465
It is unclear which capacity Renamo has , but it has taken disturbing attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important north-south connection .	-3.2916
Most battles took place in the province of Sofala , which is located a few hundred kilometres north of Maputo , but in which Beira is located , the port , the mining companies like Rio Tinto and Vale to export coal .	-4.0508
In June , Rio interrupted the use of the railways for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the route .	-2.7104
Mazanga responded back to whether Renamo would repeat this threat .	-2.3423
Renamo wanted to warn “ the international community that things are not good in Mozambique , ” said Mazanga .	-2.2614
Instability has increased the frustration of the government , says Fernando Lima , head of media coop , an independent media company , because many people have already concerned about corruption , slow progress in developing and a recent wave of abduction .	-5.9100
“ People think that the government and the President are responsible for the future of the country , and he should be the one who finds solutions to the problems , ” he says .	-3.0220
Omar Sultane , a demonstrator , said that the people simply wanted stability .	-3.8409
“ No interest Renamo and Frelimo , they just want to restore peace and usable roads , ” he explained .	-3.2191
Children should receive myths and legends as “ models for life , ” says an author .	-2.7441
The stories of Thor showed that “ brutal force has no chance against clever tricks , ” and the Artus legend demonstrated how important it is to have a dream .	-2.6954
But many of the myths are “ far too wild , too offensive , and in some cases too dirty to be taught at schools , ” so Crossley-Holland pleaded for a “ careful selection ” of age-right works .	-3.6675
“ I find it wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education , ” he said .	-2.3588
I have been proposing this as a plan for twenty years .	-1.8033
He added that , in authors and teachers who are “ excessively didactic ” , children would “ switch off ” completely , because in entertaining stories the messages would be “ undermined . ”	-4.1026
Crossley-Holland , who has translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon , and who is the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myth and the British Folk Valley , said : “ You can pursue certain intentions , but you should keep them in the background as possible . ”	-3.9928
Perhaps the greatest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an author writing for children is the need to give hope .	-2.7732
Not everything must be simplified or lead to the happy end , but there is an immanent sense of good and evil .	-2.5674
This must be underlying , revealed by history and not explained .	-2.6244
This is the old story of pointing instead of telling .	-2.2376
Hansjakob Returns to Freedom	-2.4980
100 years ago , Heinrich Hansjakob referred to his age residence in Haslach , on Sunday his last years were lived in the " Freihof " .	-3.4723

Between the individual game scenes , the Mühlenbach farmer chapel played suitably selected pieces of music and rounded off the performance .	-6.0226
Haslach 's mayor , Heinz Winkler , then gave himself the honor to award honorary citizens ' dignity , who , in representation of the official owner Hättich , together with a part of the city council , made his appearance .	-5.6670
Their expectations then made the three king singers that led Hansjakob to the exclamation : " Ach as beautiful , there are again youth memories of my own three kingdoms living " .	-5.2735
With their song " O Jesulein " they enjoyed the audience in the Freihof as well as the stork day children with their loud " Heraus , Heraus " .	-3.3318
His criticism of the Official Church expressed Hansjakob just as his concerns about the excesses in agriculture , the consequences of industrialization or the effects of the war .	-3.4333
In the home , behind his grave chapel on the fire at Hofstetten , he found his retirement .	-3.0163
" A troubled spirit had finally found his peace and had gone home forever , " said at the end of the scene game .	-5.3863

Coulson used telephone hacking	-6.4810

Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC explained to the court in the Old Bailey , News of the World in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with his “ attractive special adviser ” Hannah Pawlby .	-3.3164
The newspaper commissioned the private detective Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlby ’ s voicemails , and followed them , but Coulson also called them and left news as the court heard .	-5.8158
“ In the opinion of the public prosecutor , Coulson , who is now the publisher of NotW , is no one who stands before the apartment of people and hopes to stage them freshly , but a people who like to face a story to see their response , ” explained Edis                                	-7.3227

He denies this , but we say : “ And whether he knew of it . ”	-2.8699
Rumors about an affair of Clarkes were first taken up by the NotW feature editorial when a source that was sexually interested in Pawlby was said : “ Do not waste your time , it is together with Charles . ”	-3.5011
A band with voicemails of their telephone of at least three occasions was ensured in August 2006 in Mulcaire ’ s apartment .	-5.6693
The investigators also found entries on the computer of the detective , on which Pawlby and their sisters were stored as “ projects . ”	-2.8851
In the period when the researches ran , the grandparents of Pawlby received anonymous calls in which they were asked for information about them , Edis declared .	-5.4611

On 18 June 2005 , Coulson left her a voicemail with the following content : “ I have a story that we want to bring out tomorrow , which I would like to talk to Charles .   ”	-5.0410
Edis said that Coulson ’ s activities at this story followed the same pattern as other important personalities , such as the former Interior Minister David Blunkett .	-3.1151

Häusler made it clear that ' the ultimate decisions are the members of the Council of Municipalities ' .	-3.0893

" The protection of as many built plots as possible is the goal " , says Häusler .	-3.0892
Based on the planning of protection against a flood expected every 100 years , according to German weather service , the protection of the floods is stati     .	-5.8148

" There is no absolute protection , but we can achieve a relative improvement , " says Häussler .	-2.7613
In order to achieve the protection of HQ 100aKlima , around EUR 4 million must be invested in Gechingen , with the community expecting national subsidies to approximately 70 % .	-3.8721
However , householders pointed out that there is only promotion if a total concept is implemented .	-5.2414
The municipality would be dependent on the participation of the citizens  .          . ( FR )   	-7.4102

The problem is known in the administration and first measures have already been taken .	-2.4186
However , Häusler pointed out that the channel systems directives are different from flood protection and this must not be mixed .	-3.2946
The community shall be obliged to interpret the channel network in such a way that two to three years of rain events could be encouraged .	-3.6034

“ They believe that every logic is deprived of the laws of physics and common sense , ” Crump said .	-3.7642

“ Your son went to learn to school and came back in the body bag , ” he comments .	-2.9659
US prosecutor Michael Moore said on Thursday that there will be a formal investigation to death of Johnson , because a number of important issues are still unclear .	-3.1278
What was the cause of death ?	-1.0222
Is his death due to a crime ?	-1.6001
The Moore explained at a press conference on Thursday afternoon .	-2.0714
I follow the facts in which direction they also lead .	-1.9157
My goal is to find out the truth .	-1.6273
“ I believe that there is a sufficient basis for formal investigation , ” he said .	-2.1614
Moore explained to reporters that initial autopsy indicated that Johnson died in the consequences of a “ position-related stifling . ”	-3.2211
However , a second autopsy has resulted in a different cause of death , Moore .	-3.0945
“ There are a number of questions which must be answered or confirmed , ” he said .	-4.0391

CDC published allergy directives	-2.0870
On Wednesday , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) published a number of guidelines for the handling of food allergies of children in schools .	-2.8695
These are the first such directives that the US government has published , as the number of school-based children increases with food allergies .	-3.1185
One of 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy .	-1.8377
The spread of food allergies among children has increased by 18 % between 1997 and 2007 .	-2.4363
The guidelines contain information for schools , which are intended to raise awareness of food allergies and how to deal with children who show allergic reactions .	-3.9067
It is also recommended that schools have Epinephrin stock – the car injection of the EpiPen brand is most commonly used – to meet a potentially deadly sensitivity response .	-3.5736

Parents of intersexual children can choose “ Gender Undetermined ”	-2.2184
Germany is the first European nation in which a third sex is recognised for children born with unclear genitals .	-2.2855
Newborn is no longer assigned male or female .	-2.6600
According to the new law , parents no longer need to explain gender to such children , but can specify “ indefinitely ” or “ not defined ” on the birth certificate .                              	-7.1390
The aim of the law is to take parents ' pressure so that they do not need to make hasty decisions on operations for gender allocation to newborns , and to combat discrimination against intersexual people .	-3.7058
An intersexual person said according to BBC years later : “ I am neither man nor woman . ”	-4.0208
I remain mutilated and full of scars by doctors .	-2.1567
It is estimated that one of 2,000 children every year does not come to the world as a boy or as a girl .	-3.2852
They are among the intersexuals , a group that fall under the diagnosis of “ sexual disorder ” ( DSD ) , a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes , glands ( eggs or the tops ) or unusually developed genitals .	-3.8099
Wallis Simpson may be intersexual .	-5.1871
The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed , but most experts in the United States advise that the best available information on gender allocation should be used if a provision is not possible , and not waiting for the psychological and physical development of the child before , if anything , operation is chosen .	-4.5104
The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher , who specialized in the problem of gender identification , said that the new German law sounded “ sound after a good thing . ”	-3.1980
Intersexual children are an ethical dilemma .	-1.4551
“ Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgical intervention , but most children do not apply this , ” he said .	-2.8150
Gender allocation can be made without operation and then wait for the identity to develop .	-2.9102
Scientific data about how a child develops its gender identity at all are not very close .	-2.4146
Nobody knows why it is happening .	-3.6030
It is like the secret why people are homosexual .	-1.7802
A report to the European Commission from 2011 states that intersexual people are different from trans-sexual or transgender persons , because their status is not gender-based but rather conditioned by their biological constitution , which is neither exclusively male nor female , but typically both at the same time or not clearly defined as one of them                                                                                      	-11.8591
These properties showed themselves in subsequent sexual characteristics such as muscle mass , hairing , breasts and stature , priority sexual characteristics such as reproduction bodies and genitals or chromosome structures and hormones .	-3.7373
The report also provides an overview of discrimination , which is exposed to intersexual and transgender people in working life , as well as the extent of harassment , violence and prejudice crime .	-3.5649
Not gender boys have a special camp now .	-2.9217
It is now possible in Australia and Nepal for adults to specify official documents male , female or “ third sex . ”	-2.7104

In neighbouring France , gender topics are still controversial , so a news report to France 24 .	-2.7078
In 2011 , dozens of French members of the strictly Catholic country signed a petition that the “ gender theory ” should be removed from school books .	-2.5538
The US website Catholic Online has also spoken against the German law , with the explanatory statement : “ If the world is dismantled into a new state where gender is a decision , but does not turn sexual activity , we two other pillars of civilization . ”	-4.4764
The mother of a newborn from Maryland explained to Baby Zone , she found it better if babies are assigned to a gender at birth .	-3.2659
“ Parents are already stressful enough , even without further restrictions , especially if you do not know the sex of your own child , ” she said the parent website .	-4.0365
Children need stability and security .	-1.1755
Historically , children who were born with both male and female gender parts were called hermaphrodites , according to the attractive Greek God who had both s sexe .                          	-6.4265
Ten years ago , medicine considered the sex to be something that can be deleted and then rebuilt .	-2.9605
But now the ethical foundations of an operation are doubted after now known how complex the gender identity is , and that doctors can also be wrong , because they do not know how the child feels in growing with the gender they allocate .	-4.0883
“ In the middle of the 20th century , this was called a psychiatric emergency , ” said Drescher      .	-7.0285
If such a child was born , then you did not call the psychiatrist , but the surgeons .	-3.0369
The ruling theory on the treatment of children with unclear genitals goes back to Dr. John Money of the Johns Hopkins University , who believed that gender is formal .	-7.9813
He characterized the term “ gender identity ” and argued , social and environmental impetus – such as parents educate a child – interacted with the genes and hormones of a child and shaped whether a person considered male or female .	-3.9626
But in a case known as John / Joan , from 1966 , his theories were controversial .	-2.8964
He raised the parents of a boy whose penis had been separated from a committed cut , to castrate the child completely and to remove his troops and then to grandfather him as a girl .	-5.2921
“ Money presented this case as a successful example of conversion , which he was not , ” said Drescher .	-2.5582
When the boy was about 15 , he changed back to male sex and married a woman .	-2.2190
With 38 but he committed suicide .	-2.0482
According to Drescher , there are still doctors who would practice this model .	-2.2250
But , in the 1990 ’ s , with the Internet ’ s introduction , survivors of these gender operations have entered the public , “ not happy with the result . ”	-3.9285
For example , at Jim Bruce , a 36-year-old author from Montana , born with XY-male chromosomes , but ambiguous genitals .	-2.5064
The doctors were not clear about whether he had a great clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a “ satisfactory life ” a ma    .	-3.8049
So his external body and the thoughts were shortly after the birth of 1976 surgically removed and he was big as girls .	-3.9364
At the age of 12 he received female hormones .	-1.8816
“ I knew I am not a girl , ” he explained to ABCNews.com	-2.2576
I was unhappy , but it was really difficult to ask questions .	-1.6395
At the age of 18 he should receive a vaginal plastic .	-1.9429
But because he was depressive and knew that something was not true , he demanded his medical files .	-2.4447
What he found out was shocking .	-1.2668
I was sterilized in my birth – and none has ever told me that .	-2.8475
Bruce was born with a DSD where his body could not produce enough testosterone to develop the gen   .	-7.6421
After learning the truth , he changed again to the male identity , received testosterone injections and caused his breasts to remove .	-3.5314
It has become infertile by the operation .	-2.3942
Today , he is fighting for others in one organization called Interface Project that intersexual people are perceived as normal .         .	-7.7619
But Anne Tamar-Mattis , managing director of the legal group Advocates for Informed Choice resident in California , is concerned that the German law can encourage “ to stamp and stigmatize ” .	-3.2567
“ Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make fast decisions and encourage the child to assign them , not defined , ” she explained .	-3.9497
We fear that benefits interventions .	-1.7387
We think it would be better to allocate the male or female sex and then to wait for it                                 a	-8.1734
However , we do not yet know how the law will have an impact , so we can only speculate .	-2.4962
Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports the Australian law , because “ it allows adults to recognize as a third sex . ”	-2.8373
“ Adults should be able to make their own decisions on their legal sex , ” she explained .	-2.3438
The German law is about allocating birth .	-2.0635
This is not a battle at which small children should be forced at this time .	-2.7605
If they are adults , they can decide on their own bodies .	-2.2019
But Dr. Arlene Baratz , a breast radiologist from Pittsburg , who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group , says that the German law “ authorized ” both parents and children .	-3.4965
Katie , the daughter of Baratz , was born with male chromosomes , but has a DSD called complete androgen resistance .               	-4.4791
Female characteristics developed because of the receptor defect of the target cells for testosterone .	-2.6012
It has a vagina , but no uterus and no ovaries .	-2.2041
Today , Katie 29 is married and works at the University of Pennsylvania as an employee in child psychiatry .	-2.6746
Although it is infertile , it hopes to get a child by adopting or surrogacy .	-3.0755
“ The law gives parents space , which means that they do not have to make decisions , ” said Baratz .	-3.0922
It gives them the time to make different tests and clarify things and gives them time before they write “ male ” or “ female . ”	-5.2552
In this way everything is in order – the child is great and loves it .	-3.2475
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy parental happiness .	-2.2717
And we do not have to make an operation that can no longer be undone .	-3.1534
“ This includes children in the decision and eliminates the fear that parents are driving because they believe that they would not do the right thing , ” she explained .	-3.5176
Ultimately , the child decides on the gender that fits better to him – and that is wonderful .	-9.1291
This enables children to make the decision themselves .	-1.8800

Ries recommends all those who deal with the age-right rebuilding of their home or apartment to inform themselves thoroughly and not to commission the first best craftsmen .	-8.4359

This has made the former NSA employee sought by the United States clear in an unaddressed letter published by the Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and passed on to the Federal Government , the Bundestag and the General Prose Ad       .	-4.6343
The letter has the following text :	-6.3914
The Responsibilities	-1.6237
I was asked to write to you about your investigation into mass monitoring  .        . (        )   .      	-7.5813
I was called Edward Joseph Snowden and was once again contractual or direct employment as a technical expert at the National Security Agency ( NSA ) , the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) and the Defense Intelligence Agency ( DIA ) of the United States .	-3.2789
In the course of my employment in these institutions , I witnessed systematic infringements of my government , which led me to act morally .	-3.3249
As a result of the publication of these concerns , I saw myself as a serious and continuing hetze that forced me to leave my family and my homeland .	-3.3288
I am currently living in exile and enjoying temporary asylum that grants me the Russian Federation according to international law .	-2.6680
I am encouraged by response to my political action , both in the US and elsewhere .	-2.0678
Citizens throughout the world and also high officials - including the United States - have judged the revelations to a system of all-encompassing monitoring , which is not accountable to anyone as a service to the public .                     	-5.5119
These espionage revelations made many proposals on new laws and directives aimed at the formerly covered abuse of public confidence .	-3.2430
The benefits for society from these gained knowledge are becoming increasingly clearer ; at the same time , the risks taken in purchase have been visibly reduced .	-3.5497
Although the outcome of my efforts was demonstrably positive , my government continues to treat Dissens as a flawbreak and strives to criminalise and charge political expression .	-3.8155
However , the truth is not a crime .	-4.5520
I am confident that the United States Government , with the support of the international community , will put this detrimental attitude .	-3.1437
I hope that if the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are settled , I will be able to participate appropriately and legislatively in terms of the responsible information of the statements made in the media , particularly with regard to truth and authenticity of the reports .	-4.2114
I look forward to a discussion with you in your country as soon as the situation is clarified and thank you for your efforts to preserve international law , which protects us all .	-3.0031

There were EUR 100 000 in the budget .	-2.0153
Not yet clear how the new owner wants to use the former kindergarten .	-2.3353

Report : Obama campaign considered replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton	-2.0112
President Barack Obama ’ s closest advisers have secretly considered replacing Vice-President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton in the 2012 election campaign , saying the New York Times .	-3.1960
The revelation is the most notable surprise of the long-awaited work of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann on the 2012 election campaign , “ Double Down : Game Change 2012 ” .	-2.8824
The Times is a copy of the next book , and she reported on Thursday evening that the President ’ s top advisers had carried out “ extensive group sessions and surveys at the end of 2011 ” to find out whether it looks better for Obama ’ s disappearing hope for re-election if he lets Bids fall .	-4.8428
According to Jonathan Martin , the Times National Political Correspondent , the book thoroughly draws the history of the efforts of leading employees of the campaign and the White House , namely the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley , to measure what effect it has on survey values to exchange former Foreign Minister Clinton against the Vice-President .	-4.0176
The potential change was a strictly carried secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office .	-2.4701
Only half a dozen of the closest advisers of the President – including Daley , the former campaign leader of Obama , Jim Messina , and the former leader of the White House , David Axelrod , and David Plouffe – knew about the changed change .	-3.8207
Double Down claims that Daley has attempted to exchange Biden , despite its “ close , personal relationship , ” before deciding against such chess after the data showed that Clinton ’ s candidacy “ would not significantly improve Obama ’ s chances . ”	-11.3529
In an interview with Martin , Daley confirmed that the government has actually considered replacing Biden with Clinton .	-2.3210
“ I expressed a whole range of things that should be considered , and that was one of them , ” said Daley to the magazine .	-2.8857
We must remember that the President had terrible survey values at that time , so we thought : “ For God ’ s will , what do we do ? ”	-3.2209
While Daley called the investigations “ careful ” , Martin said to Anderson Cooper of CNN that , during the re-election campaign , significant effort had been made to find out whether such a train pays out with regard to the ballot boxes .	-4.8002
“ In campaigns , not so much money is spent on surveys and focus groups if you do not think seriously seriously about something , ” said Martin on AC360 .	-3.3382
However , it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team thought about an exchange .	-2.4900
Martin said to CNN that he asked Daley whether his then boss knew about the potential change .	-2.6585
Although Daley stated that he did not believe that the President was “ aware of the possible change , ” the former Head of Staff admitted that it was “ possible ” that Obama knew of it   .	-3.6430
Martin added that “ Double Down ” did not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether Obama ’ s political specifications had achieved a desk .	-3.2907
Cooper asked Martin whether he thinks seriously that Obama has known nothing about the investigations about whether or not to let Biden fall into the elections               	-4.6916
“ Possible , ” Martin replied .	-1.8880
What happens on the way with my email ?	-1.7612
E-mail actually means electronic letter .	-4.9471
Was the draft Internet service e-mail similar to the conventional mail technically implemented the letter secrecy ?	-3.6267
In conception of early Internet services , the focus was on making communication possible .	-2.8293
Therefore , in the fundamental technical protocols , we have not taken care to create a stable foundation for a more consultative letter cha .	-4.0972
Therefore , a conventional e-mail corresponds to an open postcard rather than a sealed letter .	-2.8340
When user " Anna " sends a mail to " Benni " , are the machines of the two directly connected ?	-3.0825
The email program or browser of Anna sends the mail to the mail server of their service provider in the first step .	-3.0009
If , for example , it has a GMail account , the Google would be .	-2.2000
This mail server sends the content to the provider who uses Benni .	-1.9690
On the route the mail can run via several other servers on the Internet .	-2.8525
Bennie can then call the content with his provider .	-2.1028
Will conventional emails be read on their way through the network ?	-2.3444
Most mails are read by software robots on the way .	-2.2307
The provider of the sender is usually checked whether the mail leads to a damage program as an attachment .	-3.6686
A virus check is also made on the recipient systems .	-2.0547
Furthermore , the providers check whether this is an annoying and unwanted spam mail , which is deleted equally or at least sorted into a spam folder .	-3.5118
Do the robots have another task ?	-1.7269
In systems like GMail , the robot also determines the information Google needs to place context advertising .	-2.5313
When Anna and Benni communicate via GMail via their upcoming holiday trip , Google can hide links to holiday offers .	-3.9521
Do you read unknown people with emails ?	-5.8145
The probability that unauthorized persons read a mail is extremely low .	-2.3828
Theoretically , however , this is possible .	-2.2503
In companies , administrators often have the opportunity to read electronic mail .	-2.2914
The law enforcement authorities and intelligence services also have legal opportunities to catch or take note of emails .	-2.8903
This includes possible illegal speech actions .	-3.2042
Is it possible to protect emails against reading ?	-1.8571
With an encryption after the OpenPGP standard , an e-mail can be effectively encrypted against middle reading  .	-5.2491
With high technical effort it is also possible to conceal the metadata of an email communication so that not even without any further detection of who communicated with whom .	-3.8820
How important are Yahoo and Google on the e-mail market in Germany ?	-1.7282
According to an investigation by Convios Consulting from August 2013 , Yahoo and Google play a subordinate role in the mainly privately used mailboxes .	-3.2853
While the shares of Yahoo mail were last fallen , GMail of Google could significantly demonstrate .	-3.9682
Mother in the Forest Sharpens and Pensions	-3.1222
When his mother died , a man from Wolfsburg forged a plan .	-1.9676
He begrub the dead in a forest - and continued to cash her pensions and maintenance .	-2.8421
In order to be able to cash further pensions and maintenance , a 67-year-old Wolfsburger has buried his dead mother after investigations of the police in the forest .              a  s	-6.2527
First of all , he covered the death of the 89-year-olds , then he has deleted money for more than a year and a half .	-6.2325
Now the 67-year-old must be responsible for fraud , as a speaker said on Friday .	-2.4097
So the man hidden the woman in a forest near Helmstedt .	-2.1234
The man was suspected in May : at that time , the mother was no longer needed for medicine     tha    need   for        .	-5.6878
The investigator told the pensioner that his mother was travelling to Spain .	-2.2625
Because the civil servants occurred , they continued to determine .	-3.3915
In this respect , the two had lived in a common apartment for more than 15 years and had last maintained it .	-3.7453
The 67-year-old finally granted the death of his mother .	-2.4301
According to the police , obduction did not give any indication of capital crime .	-3.6212
Does ice cream shine in the dark ?	-3.2621
A British entrepreneur has developed the first bright ice in the dark – with the help of so    . T          	-5.3577
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of the sea animals and created a shin of delicacies .	-5.5462
The idea came to him after having read a research on qualities and convincing Chinese scientists to produce the bright protein artificially .	-3.4573
The ice cream responds to consumption with tongue , raising the pH value in the protein and triggering the lighting .	-5.4505
Chris explains that the dining ice responds to the heat in the mouth and shines – the more you lick , the brighter it becomes .	-3.3981
Charlie , the founder of the ice cream company “ Lick Me I ’ m Delicious ” , says : “ The product is incredible , but still in a very early production phase , and so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds  .     ” .	-5.0912
The protein used in the ice cream responds with the tongue in a neutral pH value .	-2.3576
When the mouth warms the protein , the pH value and the ice shines .	-2.6123
We have tested it in recent months and it seemed ideal to bring it to Halloween onto the market because it has this wonderful light effect .	-3.1254
It is probably the most expensive ice cream I have ever made , because the source light is four times more expensive than gold .	-2.7400
Each ball costs me about 140 pounds .	-1.6290
But it tastes deliciously for      .	-7.0362
Charlies experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual tastes , including beer , cheese , beef and leaf gold .	-2.4678
But its latest creation is to become even more ambitious .	-2.2304
He says : “ I would like to develop an invisible ice cream . ”	-1.8699
This is impossible and impossible because of the breakdown of light caused by the ice crystals which consist of ice creams , but I suspect we find a way to create it .	-4.0627
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a source manufactured by Chinese scientists artificially .	-2.7186
The TSV Morsum is still without every point in the Handball Association League after six days .	-2.8904
The team of Ingo Ehlers now comes to the derby against the TSV Daverden , who celebrated his first victory last weekend .	-3.9878
This game starts the season new for us .	-2.1862
" I hope that we finally have the head free , " Ehlers behaves optimistically .	-3.0530
He finally has his complete cadre except the permanent injured Hendrik Blohme .	-3.4277
Daverden , too , is setting on speed games .	-3.5637
We must therefore keep our error rate low .	-2.0591
First and foremost , however , there must be increased coverage , which has left everything far from a safe      i                .   i           	-10.2527
Daverdens Coach Thomas Panitz is much more relaxed after the first season victory against North Horn .	-2.8661
The game was of course a house number .	-1.7583
But that is why we are still not the favorite , because in the derby everything can happen .	-3.0770
Nevertheless , Panitz now wants to start a series in Morsum .	-2.7581
Missing will be Jan-Malte Jodat .	-4.4175
For this purpose , the A-Youth Joost Windsus , which is active with double play law at the A-Youth League HC Bremen , celebrates his seasonal debut .	-4.4179
Those who are not hot in such a game should remain at home .      i    .	-5.9305
Halloween 2013 : In Numbers	-1.4777
When I was small , Halloween had something magical .	-1.6524
My sister and I was allowed to eat candles , stay late and dress us for neighbourhood .	-5.6350
Today I have become the Halloween muffle .	-2.3961
In the last two years I have not explained willingness to distribute from my home of candy , and I will not do so this year .	-4.0740
But , according to statistics , I am a black sheep as far as Halloween is concern           	-4.3348
The majority of Americans – $ 158 million to be precise – celebrate Halloween this year , spending a total of $ 6.9 billion on sweets , costumes , and decorations , the US Association of Retailers ( NRF ) .	-3.3982
One thing I look forward to every Halloween is the trend values .	-2.5980
The costumes will account for about $ 1.2 billion of the US $ 6.9 billion , the NRF .                 	-5.3222
This year , stimulating unlively items are the last cry .	-3.2021
Women no longer need to cover themselves in sexy clothing , they can now embody seductive food such as pizza , hamburger or carrots .	-3.5054
As far as men are concerned , I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead , and I bet the Daft-Punk space men will create it this year into the instagram fee               	-4.4815
According to Google , the most searched costumes of Zombies , Batman , Pirates and Witches are Z    . , a s . T   .	-7.3274
I suspect it is nothing to tradition .	-1.9848
We dressed our dogs last year and were not alone to my amazement .	-3.2964
Indeed , Americans spend $ 330 million this year on the costumes of their pets , the NRF .	-2.3936
These are a lot of hot dogs .	-6.5859
As far as candidates are concerned , we are not complete .	-5.0969
Americans will spend $ 1.9 billion this year , saying The Nielsen Company .	-1.9449
These are approximately 270 million kilograms of chocolate labels , loudscapes , bonbons and rubber ba             	-5.6792
So good news for the 41 million people , according to the US Trade Ministry , who draw the quarter with the saying of “ sweet or saures . ”	-4.2756
In fact , we will buy more than 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and – let us not do anything – we will eat .	-3.4184
The only thing we do not want to consume is the sugar sweet Candy Corn ; yet 15 million kilograms are sold around Halloween , the National Association of Sweet Manufacturers .	-3.3587
These are about nine billion maize grains .	-1.8203
It is a puzzle that I have not yet been able to s r   .	-4.6764
Nothing belongs to Halloween as houses in which it spucks .	-2.5238
They have great names like “ Terror Behind the Walls ” ( which is in a real prison ) , “ Howl-O-Scream ” and “ The House of Shock ” .	-3.0171
There are indeed 1,200 officially recognized spukhauses in the United States that reach $ 500 million proceeds , America Haunts , and this includes the wonderful photos on which you are pinkling into the trousers and then putting the friends on Facebook , where you don ’ t get rid of them again , and one of the types on which you leave a comment like “ nice face expression . ”	-5.8525
But let us finally come to the bites .	-3.0250
Charlie Brown familiarised us with the Great Basketball when we were children , and the cutting of a curbish latern is like the decoration of the Christmas tree – something that we did from small ones .	-4.1420
Fortunately , the “ baby in the Kürbis ” trend began only last year thanks to Pinterest , so most of us have grown up with tailoring the curb and not sitting in it .	-3.5720
This year , Americans will spend approximately $ 106 million on curbs , the US Census Bureau .	-2.7043
The basketballs , which are slowly rotten in the pregard , probably comes from Illinois , where 245 million kilograms have been harvested this year .	-4.1102
If you want to point correctly , call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa , California and call something beautiful from their 921 kilo severe curtain .	-4.0022
Apartment fire in Helmbrechts : Rescue forces mount coaled body	-6.2696
The fire brigade had to expire in Helmbrechts on late Thursday evening .	-2.9845
A three-family house in the district of Hof starts at night to Friday Fire .	-3.2442
The rescue forces have a coaled body from the house .	-3.1256
Rescue forces have found a cabbed body in a three-family house at a fire in Helmbrechts .	-3.2892
Whether it is a resident is still unclear , as a spokesman of the police in Bayreuth sa  .	-5.3307
On the late Thursday evening it was burned on the ground floor of the house .	-2.3475
When the fire brigade arrived , the flames already beat from a window .	-3.0039
The apartments went into the apartment and found the body in a room .	-3.0074
This and another room burned completely .	-2.6543
The entire ground floor was damaged .	-1.6231
All other inhabitants were not at home during the fire , the police speaker explained .	-2.6302
The building is no longer inhabitable .	-2.2982
The exact cause of the fire was not clear first .	-2.2574
Germany ’ s largest church has launched an offensive start to advertise the profession of the Pastor .	-4.5140
Background is a possible parish shortage : the Evangelical and Lutheran Church of Hannover expects the number of its currently around 1,800 pastors to halve until 2030 .	-4.2418
For young people of today the profession is very attractive and offers good future prospects , said Pastor Mathis Burfien ( 43 ) in conversation with the Evangelical Press Service .	-4.1822
It is attractive to determine the working and day process itself .	-2.5940
With Burfien , the church of the country has for the first time commissioned a pastor on a full place to enthuse young people for theology studies .	-4.1750
At present , less and less young people decide to study theology after the study .	-2.9973
Burfien leads this to the process of decoration : " God 's voice is quiet , the world is loud " .	-3.0209
It is the profession of great freedom and diversity .	-2.3823
I am my calendar of appointments and can set my priorities where it is important to me .	-3.4190
Pastors could be very close to people as a soul concern .	-3.1547
They deserved as much as teachers and could live well of it     .	-2.4448
Certainly the free economy will be more paid , but theologians would have a safe employer for         .	-4.0315
This comes against the young people of today , not just about careers , but about a sensible work .	-3.9808
According to the church of the country , which covers three quarters of Lower Saxony , around 60 pastors are currently going to retirement per year .	-5.8864
At the same time , about 40 graduates of a theology study begin their vicariate .	-2.3469
In thin populated regions such as the resin , the Emsland or the Wendland , it can become difficult to occupy jobs in the future .	-3.6060
Burfien wants to organize study days for young people and also invite prominents who have studied theology .	-3.3151
The theology studies offer a wide range of training .	-2.4868
This can even become a federal president .	-4.8818
Land Rover Rally Series	-1.4357

Drew Bowler , Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport , explains : “ The Rally customers coming to Bowler have changed . ”	-2.6788
They are not all experienced racers , but people who are looking for tension and adventure and after a reachable way to world-class events .	-3.1986
We are pleased to open this path in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format opens up new opportunities to experience the various rally disciplines in the UK and abroad and prepare newcomers for the strapaces and reality of Rally Raid .	-3.8797
We really had fun developing the Defender Challenge car – this will be an entertaining championship .	-2.9361

Fire brigade called for saving a dog which runs 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rocky lead in a quarry .	-7.9465
Cockerspaniel-Hündin Ruby was running after a smaller road accident	-3.3238
Three days later it was discovered by a walker in the quarry in its unforgettable location	-2.9884
Firefighters rushed to rock walls and saved the dog from safe death	-3.9455
The fire brigade succeeded in bringing a dog into safety , which was fixed on a 15-metre high lead in a rocky wall .	-4.8673
The nine months old Cockerspaniel-Hündin Ruby run from Sunday after a road accident and survived three days alone before it was saved on Wednesday f                          	-6.9596
Scott Alderson , 25 , and his girlfriend Becky Hall , 20 who belonged to the dog , came to the quarry of Flappit in Denholme , West Yorkshire , to receive Ruby and thank the firefighters of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service .	-3.6883
They had desperately sought for their missing bitch and published assistance in social networks when they run into the quarry after the small traffic accident .	-4.2823
About 14 : 15 on Wednesday , a walker who executed his dog was the stranded Ruby on the 15 metre high paragraph in the quarry .	-3.7920
The technical rescue team of the Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to save Ruby , which was then transported up in a dog box .	-3.6237
Andy Clayton , specialist of the technical rescue team , said : “ She was in a dangerous location .	-2.3979
It was located in the middle of the rocky wall – 15 meters from the top and the ground .	-3.1342
She did not move a muscle during her saving – she was like stiff frozen .	-4.6707
But now it goes well .	-2.3070
She then eaten a few dog cakes .	-2.2999
This was a rather unusual use .	-2.5358
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible .	-1.4371
Peter Lau , specialist of the technical rescue team , said : “ Ruby had a giant happiness . ”	-2.5500
There was a possibility that it was very difficult to injure or worse .               	-4.7349
Ruby was brought to an animal veterinary , but there was nothing to say about exhaustion and dehydration .	-3.8861
Becky Hall from Halifax , West Yorkshire , said : “ To see saving was frightening . ”	-2.9916
I could not believe that it was really there above .	-2.5723
It was wonderful to keep them in the poor .	-2.0035
The veterinary explained if exhaustion had become too big and collapsed , it would probably have crashed .	-3.0400
The firefighters have done great thing  .	-3.2827
It was really courageous what they did .	-1.6825
We are simply so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible .	-2.2814
Scott Alderson from Keighley added : “ We were afraid that she would fall down , but they remained up . ”	-2.9370
The fireplaces were great .	-5.8109
I can hardly believe where she was .	-1.6400
Mick Jagger explains that he never made Katy Perry when she was 18 .	-2.2233
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week the pop star said she worked as a background singer to Jagger ’ s song “ Old Habits Die Hard ” from 2004 .	-3.1716
Perry explained that she had eaten with the altrocker in the evening , and that “ he attacked me when I was 18 . ”	-3.5687
She added : “ That is long ago and he was very nice to me . ”	-2.4951
In a statement , a representative of Jaggers , 70 , on Thursday , said that he “ categorically negotiates that he has ever done approximation at Katy Perry . ”	-3.6440

A new day , a new horror story for independence .	-4.7524
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland is needed to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership .	-2.4232
This provides the keyword for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a barbed wire secured limit along the Hadrianswall .	-3.0311
Indeed , the strathclyde template referred to the possible economic benefits that would bring more freedom of travel in the rest of Europe , but that played no role in the headlines – expected .	-8.3885
Nobody has mentioned that EU member states often bend their strict rules when it is more favourable to them .	-3.0899
Since Scotland is not currently part of the Schengen area , the continued non-compliance with Brussels would be just a small concession in return for what is really wanted by the Scots              . T              	-6.6507
So no story in fact .	-5.9213
And one that has already come to the same fossil in the years : the first time I heard the “ independence means passport controls ” ducks at least 40 years ago .	-3.7052
There is an interesting point in constantly repeating this ancient history .	-5.6540
Why should we expect an independent Scotland to dance after European pipes ?	-2.3690
Why interchange London ’ s yoke against that of Brussels , especially now ?	-2.7722
These are the real European news : the great plan to unite Europe , which was taken after the war , has been stalled .	-3.9690
With the euro crisis , the European project has died officially .	-2.0128
Everywhere in the EU , parties will gain ground that are hostile to the EU or want to throw the euro as a single currency overboard .	-3.5683
Even in Germany , the Eurosceptic Party has been able to establish alternatives for Germany – only this year – for just five million votes in the Federal Election in September , effectively distributing the Free Democrats ( the equivalent to the British Liberal Democrats ) from the Federal Day .	-4.4954
There has always been domestic resistance to the plan to create a federalist Europe .	-2.0830
But the current economic crisis is a turning point .	-2.0965
Because of the strict austerity policy imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank in conjunction with the forced jacket in which the respective national economy is needed by keeping the single currency , many people believe that the European project has gone too far .	-3.6745
The euro ’ s crisis has little to do with national governments causing excessive budget deficits – only in Greece .	-2.1147
Instead , the Eurosystem has fixed its members on exchange rates that are beneficial for German exporters – and that is what German politicians want to leave                     	-4.9386
Without the possibility of devaluing the local currency , southern Europe will find itself again with a built-in productivity disadvantage towards G  .	-4.7737
The only way is to cut wages and public spending – spurred by Berlin .	-2.2259
Behind the current budgetary and currency problems , there is a deeper European productivity problem .	-2.3637
As a result of the “ green ” energy directives regulated by Brussels – a code for the subsidisation of French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – European industry , compared with the United States , pays the double for electricity and the four times for  g        .

This is a paralyzing cost disadvantage , as we have already seen in Grangemouth .	-2.3084
All world wage stipulations do not protect the European petrochemical industry from being pushed into the corner by cheap American shale gas .	-2.7606
As a result , a revolt emerges , especially in France , the former EU cheerleader .	-2.6424
After the war , France ’ s political elite saw the EU as a vehicle with which Germany was able to keep Germany in check and lift Paris to the eye of Washington .	-3.8192
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy and has put Europe on its own economic policy , thereby fighting the attacked French economy .	-3.4191
The result : Marine Le Pen ’ s right-wing , anti-EU front national has just gained a decisive selection and thus referred to three ruling socialists .	-3.9297
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24 % of the votes – a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a division in the right spectrum would automatically mean benefits for the left .	-3.3934
What does Le Pen do with its newly won popularity among the white French working classes ?	-2.6672
It wants to use the EU elections next year to forge an anti-EU , anti-common currency bloc in the European Parliament .	-2.3159
If the anti-EU parties cut well in these elections – and this is very well possible – then such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament for the first time .	-3.0546
This is the point I want to make : in the not too distant future , the growing resentment against the EU and the single currency will come together to abolish the euro .	-3.2576
The EU will not disappear , but it will become something like the “ Europe of ( sovereign ) nations ” that favored General de Gaulle . The EU will not disap   .             	-6.1471
Germany and some of its satellite economies may stick to the euro , but France and Southern Europe will return to their own currencies .	-2.3804
I expect Britain to dissociate itself from this project in the hope of flourishing with the United States .	-3.3200
But Washington ’ s growing interest in the Pacific region suggests that Britain will be in the Atlantic rain alone .	-2.5445
Where does Scotland remain with all this ?	-1.8755
We can decide to be a region of ( in the last consequence ) Small England .	-2.4361
Or we can defend our own economic interests – including telling Berlin and Brussels what they can do where they can .	-2.8104
I suspect that Scotland could go well in a looser European association if we retain our own currency .	-3.0424
Cooperation with other , similarly thinking countries is easier in an unfederated Europe of nations      .	-3.1215
Otherwise , we should consider equal to Norway and retain our economic independence .	-7.4298
The SNP administration in Scotland is – remarkably – the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe and has won a spectacular majority in 2011 because of the rejection of the proposed ( and made ) cuts that Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem coalition had to respond .	-3.8294
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to choose now for independence only to impose austerity on Berlin and Brussels .	-5.5394

Should a mother be concerned when their daughter already grows at the age of seven or eight years breasts and shame hair ?	-6.1708
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics Association in Orlando , Florida this week , the pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz declared that these early physical changes were relatively normal under American girls and a new standard .	-3.5196
“ I spend a lot of time to reassure parents – usually this is not a sign that the puberty is now taking place quickly , ” explained Kaplowitz .                                     	-8.3636
Obvious advertisements of development , such as growing breasts , shame and axle hairs , and body smell , are shown in girls earlier .	-3.7241
Nevertheless , there was only a slight shift at the age of menarchy ( appearance of the first rule bleeding ) in the last 40 years .	-3.6132
In the United States , the average age is 12.5 years , a little less than 12.75 in 1970 .	-2.3791
“ When the breasts ’ development begins , it takes at least two to three years to menarchy , ” said Kaplowitz , also author of the book “ Early puberty in girls : the essential advisor to deal with this frequently occurr                    . ”                       	-8.5028
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty progresses .	-2.4335
It is controversial what is actually the beginning of puberty , but when breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth boost ago eight years ago .	-3.8568
In most cases , the process or stagnates – something that a pediatrician can monitor closely .	-2.8717
In the event of faster progress , tests may be displayed by an endicronologist so that serious problems such as tumours or cysts can be excluded .	-3.5713
There are treatment methods for delaying an early menstruation and the defense of another consequence : the early aging of the bones , which can lead ultimately to growth impediment and thus small body growth in adults .	-4.1296
The recommendations for medication or hormonal therapy are oriented towards the age of the child , the speed of development , the growth rate and emotional mat                        	-6.0627
Psychosocial aspects are also important .	-1.1137
Kaplowitz is restraining with regard to medicines , but he acknowledges : “ The suppression of puberty can mitigate behavioral problems and the feelings of girls unlike their age confessions . ”	-4.5223
The other major problem is understandable : parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have the period .	-2.0102
“ They worry about the pregnancy risk or how they handle the hygienic side , ” said Kaplowitz .	-2.7150
“ It was a shock , ” remembers a woman whose daughter got her days with ten .	-2.7082
Even though there were first signs and we spoke about menstruation , it was emotionally not prepared .	-2.5848
She came frightened and excited from school home because she was the first in her friends circle .	-2.7451
There are many comprehensively published theories about the causes of early puberty .	-1.8485
But there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other foodstuffs , chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media would be caused .	-2.8449
Young people come into puberty similarly to girls .	-2.6748
Kaplowitz believes that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of obesity .	-1.7781
He supported the implementation of a study in 2001 on girls at the age of six to nine years , which produces a relationship between body fat and entry into puber                  	-5.7526
Other investigations support this conclusion , but there are many other factors that played a role .	-1.9185
In this country , African and Hispanic girls tend to achieve puberty rather than their white age senses .	-3.1116
There are different explanations for this .	-1.7337
Globally , early puberty seems to be influenced by all possible things , from economic conditions to climate to genes .	-2.6525
Another puzzle : Although boys grow facial and shame hair earlier , the trend towards a full previous puberty is not as strong as girls .	-4.1876
Other doctors at the AAP conference underlined the complexity of the subject .	-2.0098
The emergence of acne and shame hair is spread even with babies and infants .	-2.8375
“ We must be careful about how we identify the true start of puberty , ” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman , a pediatric endocrinologist at the Goryeb Children 's Hospital in Morristown , New Jersey . ”	-5.3443
Parents should not hesitate to be discussed by their doctor as they should speak with their child .	-2.9089
“ This can mean that you have to conduct a conversation earlier than expected , ” Kaplowitz ran .	-3.9220
If you remain quiet , the child usually responds well .	-2.4852
Girls who flourish early need the insurance that the process is a normal part of life , even if it enters earlier than thought .	-3.3642
Jumbo manufacturers argue about seat width	-2.4021
Between leading aircraft manufacturers , there has been a discussion about the width of seats in the tourist class at long-haul flights , which specifies the tone for a bitter collapse on the Dubai Airshow this month .	-4.2431
The dispute revolves around the seat width offered by passengers on long flights in the tourist class – not always those who are most efforting airlines , but this expelled space represents the key to the efficiency assertions of the latest aircraft in Airbus SAS and Boeing Co .	-4.8671
Airbus called for an industry standard this week , which requires a seat width of at least 46 cm ( 18 inches ) in the tourist class , but the US Erzrivale Boeing says that the airlines should decide .	-3.5907
The debate comes at a time when aircraft manufacturers compete to sell even larger versions of their two-engine long-haul flights , and expect record orders at the event from 17 to 21 November .	-4.1237
As the back part of the aircraft is designed – especially whether there are ranks with nine or ten seats – is crucial for the economic results that the new “ mini-jumbo ” design should deliver .	-6.8450
Boeing claims that his modernized “ 777X ” captures 406 people at seats in the tourist class , which are wide over 17 inches and allow ten per row .	-5.8127
Airbus explains that the competing version of the A350 carries 350 people in 18 inches of wide seats in the tourist class , with nine per seri      .	-7.5626
Aircraft giants often share technical details with advertising in the specialist            i        .i  .	-11.0698
Now Airbus is appealing directly to the public before the Dubai Airshow , where the 777X will probably make the race with over 100 orders .	-3.5062
Recently , the company presented an ad that could be the beginning of a new war of advertising and donors showed an image in which three people are squeezed in a restaurant , and the title : “ Would you accept that ? ”	-4.3768
“ Boeing proposes long-haul flights in seats that are closer than regional turbo props , ” says Airbus distributor John Leahy .	-2.8925
Faced with changed nutritional habits , people are thicker , but aircraft seats have not changed radically .	-2.8269

The scope of the male average American in the 21st century is 100.8 cm according to US health statistics .	-3.1696
Airbus says that his rivals comply with a seat concept from the 1950s when the average scope of the freshly baptized “ Jet Set ” was narrower .	-3.3727
Airbus , investigations , have been carried out that an additional customs ( 2.54 cm ) per seat increased sleep quality by 53 % .	-3.6545
Boeing denies the numbers of Airbus to the seats and says that it is not at the discretion of the manufacturers to decide how airlines make the balance between air tariffs and institutions  .                     	-5.6844
The company also explains , according to investigations , the experience in the aircraft depends on more than the seat width .	-2.9282
“ It really is up to give airlines flexibility to do what they think they need to be successful , ” explains the aircraft expert Kent Craver von Boeing .	-3.8481

Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 % more efficiency per seat in their latest two-engine long-haul designs than the market leader in this segment , the 365-seated Boeing 77-300ER .	-2.7558
The Boeings statements on the results are partly dependent on the fact that the 777X will be compared to its ten seats per series with the original design of nine seats in the 777 .	-4.6611
The increased costs per unit are still lower than in the currently used machines with ten seats per s                         	-5.8523
“ Boeing therefore squeezes more seats in his aircraft to make it more competitive to our products , ” says Kevin Keniston , head of passenger comfort at the European Airbus .	-2.9516
On the other hand , analysts , full cabins with ten seats per series at existing 777s suggested that many passengers choose the closer arrangement , which could be accompanied by cheaper air tariffs .	-3.5464
“ Eighteen customs seat width would be great for passengers , but the reality is : from an economic point of view , the Airbus offer is controlled by the threat of the 777 , ” says Mary Kirby , expert in cabin establishment , founder and publisher of Runway Girl Network .	-3.4561
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats , but a catalogue of suppliers from which the airlines can select .                                        	-9.6047
The world travelling jet sellers even contribute band levels to competition .	-4.0435
Even if they price comfort , all manufacturers also offer jets with highly comprehensive design for cheap airlines and regional flights .	-3.4219
Airbus offers an A350 with ten-seated rows , but has no sold according to its own statement .	-3.2070
Until recently , Airbus has stressed the importance of more cabin adaptability and offered wide seats for some jets .	-10.4714
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets , experts say that the reputation for a new industry standard will probably be tested , but could divert from the wave of 777X sales .	-3.3451
New anti-nicotine vaccine could make the Smoking Pleasure	-3.0372
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could spoil fun in smoking .	-2.2460
A single dose of vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for a lifetime .	-2.6896
Before human testing , further attempts are needed , which may take some years , but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said that the first results are good .	-3.6138
“ We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can help once millions of smokers who have tried to stop and tried all the methods available on the market , but had to experience that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches , ” said Cornell .	-3.8292
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been changed so that it contains genetic information to produce nicotine antibodies .	-2.8151
The virus selectively infects the liver cells that then produce a permanent electricity of antibodies .	-2.4068
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain , which makes a smoker no nicotine high .	-6.6429
In attempts , vaccinated mice , which Nicotine was administered , helped her normal level of activity .	-3.1359
By contrast , mice without vaccination would have taken a “ time ” , the researchers declared a sign that the nicotine had reached their brain .	-3.5192
The experiments are described in the specialist sheet Science Translation Me   .            	-4.5510
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies .	-1.8262
Vaccinations had to be given so often to maintain the antibody level so that they were expensive and impractical .	-2.9259
But the cost of the new vaccine is probably much lower , because it transforms liver cells into antibody factories .	-2.5107
As Professor Crystal said , a future vaccine for people would be able to administer children before they tried to try a cigarette and thus prevent nicotine addiction .	-3.3483
But it is more likely that smokers would use it to stop .	-2.0910
“ They know that if they begin to smoke again , they feel no longer pleasure because of the nicotine vaccine , and that helps them to remove the habit , ” he explains .	-4.1944
British scientists said that the results were interesting , but at the same time warned that further research was needed .	-2.4257

An investigation is initiated by government corruption supervision against the former minister of the laboratory party Joe Tripodi from New South Wales .	-3.4470
The former NSW minister denies changing the rules on maritime power at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid , who had hidden participations in three plots on state-controlled countries .	-4.1534
The Independent Commission Against Corruption ( ICAC-Independent Commission against Corruption ) extended its investigations on Friday on whether Obeid has influenced various State Ministers to extend leading contracts on Circular Quay , where the Obeids operate two restaurants and a café without tendering their expiry in August 2005 .	-4.4481
Now it is determined because of the accusation that Tripodi has known about Obeid ’ s covered interest in the plots after Tripodi ’ s former Deputy Staff Lynne Ashpole had said accordingly on        Th    .  T  .         1 :        1 : 3 3  	-9.6964

Tripodi , who was minister of port ministers from February 2006 to November 2009 , originally spoke out for public tenders .	-3.0248
But he contends to have made the changes to Obeid 's requests , which , as Tripodi confirmed , had pushed for a reform of the government 's regulations .	-4.3402

Foreign workers with 457 visas could be subjected to “ authenticity tests	-5.5025
The government is thinking about a “ authenticity test ” for foreign workers with 457 visas .	-2.9415
If the test is introduced , it would be used as a criterion to prevent the 457 from being used to occupy unqualified jobs or as a back door for the move of family and friends to Australia .	-3.4269

The proposal for a discussion outlines twelve measures that were once considered by former Minister for Immigration Chris Bowen .	-3.1339
Immigration Minister Brendan O 'Connor , who was talking about human smuggling in Sri Lanka yesterday , has implemented five of the recommended changes that others are still considered .	-3.4597

Baroness Kramer said , “ Our target for HS2 is a truly national network that brings together Britain and its cities closer together . ”	-2.9549
We go forward with HS2 because it brings enormous advantages .	-2.6060
Without it , we face a capacity crisis in our railway network .	-1.9966
However , it is also about the link between 18 British cities , including Glasgow and Edinburgh , which are improved thanks to HS2 .	-5.4092
The Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael commented : “ Today ’ s announcement is a good news for Scotland .        .   ”  .   T S     	-5.4149
On behalf of the Scottish Government , Keith Brown Carmichael called on “ unambiguous ” to integrate Scotland into the HS2 network .	-2.9521
Brown said , “ The high-speed railway connection is the potential of enormous economic benefits for Scotland , but at the same time Scotland ’ s economic power also provides an argument for rapid railway links throughout the United Kingdom . ”	-4.0713
We are therefore pleased to work as a partner for the British Government and to investigate the options for a high-speed railway link in Scotland , which creates benefits for all and complements the link between Glasgow-Edinburgh , which the Scottish Government is already planning .	-3.8854
I look forward to examining the inquiry report with British ministers next year and to decide together on the next steps .	-2.8294
Regulations on electronic equipment in aircraft remain in force in Australia	-5.9043
Australian passengers must continue to disable tablets and smartphones at startup and landing , despite efforts in the United States to relax the rules for such devices .	-3.3145
The US Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) allows US airlines to change their requirements so that passengers can read e-books , see videos or play on their devices during critical airphases if they are in “ flight mode . ”	-3.6834
During the majority of the flight , passengers are already allowed to do so , but many people find it annoying that they cannot read their e-books when launching and landing .	-3.4306
Australian societies are watching the decision to implement the US airlines to do a great deal of work , but there are no immediate plans to amend their rules .	-3.7402
The CASA air traffic authority also declared that the announcement would be looked at , but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic equipment at critical air phases in Australia still apply .	-4.3066
“ CASA currently has no specific regulations regarding the use of electronic devices in the aircraft , ” has been submitted .	-3.6790
The subject is subject to provisions which , according to the airlines , maintain safety at any time and follow passengers the safety instructions given by cabin staff .	-3.6696
Virgin has already talked to the CASA about extending its Wi-Fi entertainment system to flights and declared that it is open to changes , but they would have to be initiated by the legislator .	-3.7013
“ We would welcome a review of the authorisation of electronic equipment by CASA , because we are convinced that this would improve customer experience after we now ( wireless entertainment ) during the flight , ” said a speaker .	-3.5619
Qantas explained that the current rules will remain until further .	-3.3173
“ Our current directives stipulate that electronic equipment must not be used when starting and landing , and we have no plans to change that , ” explained the company .	-3.6507
The FAA rules apply to American airlines .	-1.9743
However , we are always interested in developments in regulations that can benefit passengers and will certainly look at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it .	-5.3407
The decision is different from American societies depending on the age of the  f    f   .                .               	-11.5600
They must prove that their aircraft can tolerate radio disorders by mobile devices , and change manuals , training materials , hand baggage programs and customer submission .                	-5.4015
“ After an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet , it can allow passengers to use portable , light electronic devices such as tablets , e-book readers and smartphones at every height , ” the FAA announced .	-3.5472
In rare cases in bad terms , the crew will instruct passengers while the landing will switch off the devices .	-4.9594
The group also recommended to stow heavier equipment at startup and landing safely under the seat or in the subjects over the seats .   i  .	-6.9678
Before the review derby against Schalke , travelled BVB trailers with light missiles had ensured ugly scenes in the Veltins Arena .	-3.9720
Borussia Dortmund then announced hard consequences .	-1.6363
Before the Friday game of the Federal Football League against the VfB Stuttgart , the ultras reacted with a silence - first .	-3.1122
It was an unusual , almost spensory acoustics that offered the viewer until shortly before the attack of the Federal League game between the German Vicemaster Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart in the Signal Iduna Park .	-4.1769
Hearing was predominantly the guest fans with their singing .	-3.2165
The South Grandstand , where the most faithful of the loyal - and loudest - BVB fans stand , first presented itself exceptionally quiet : no singing , no slaughter calls .	-4.2212
The podest of the Capo , which otherwise coordinates the common control , remained unoccupied .	-3.3392
And on the front of the grandstand a large flag blowed with title " Section Stadium Ban " .	-4.2436
Only when Goalhüter Roman Weidenfeller entered the place as always a first BVB player was branding short-term jubilee .	-6.3405
When his team colleagues followed , there were vocal singing and floating sounds - but not everywhere .	-3.5711
There was nothing in the central blocks 12 and 13 of the South Grandstand .	-2.5381
Also that stadium speaker Norbert Dickel once again listed the positive experiences of recent days - derby victory , victory over arsenal , extension of trainer Jürgen Klopp - did not provide celebration .	-3.7706
Only five minutes before the attack , the capo excluded his podest - and the tangible tension until then discharged in a loud cry , when thick as usual the atmosphere on the ranks in the stadium querie                  .          i  a s  a 	-8.2364
The last thing was the South Grandstand at the series - and finally here was the loudest place in the stadium here again as us .	-5.8897
And at the latest when the South Grandstand came to the vocal call " Derby Winner " , everything was again as always .	-4.7664
Silence previously was a response to the events of the past few days .	-2.4195
Immediately before Revierderby at FC Schalke 04 , some of the BVB supporters had fired light missiles into the spectator ranks and in the place - almost met by Torhüter Roman Weidenfeller .	-5.1470
The game was delayed because of the chaotic scenes .	-2.2237
BVB-Boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had received the tips of Dortmunder Ultras in his office - and believes Watzke 's words , this was a rather uncomfortable date for the fan representative                  	-5.2490
" There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra movement , " announced the BVB boss on Thursday evening on a podium discussion in Frankfurt .	-2.8021
As an immediate measure , Watzke prohibited the ultras from a choreography for the home game against VfB Stuttgart .	-4.4763
" I banned that , " he said .	-2.7546
We cannot give up the zero-tolerance policy on pyrotechnology .	-2.1315
Moreover , the ultras have been shown different possibilities of punishment - until Tuesday they have now time to c  decide .	-4.1276
Otherwise , Watzke , the BVB will set a sanction by the end of next week .	-2.2992
" This will be cutting " , insured Watzke .	-2.6292
We must look forward to hearing from the reactions on the South Grandstand .	-3.5814
Pandhouses boom in Singapore , because the crisis in the middle class	-2.7326
In a pan house in the Bendemeer shopping centre in Singapore , Janani Amirthalinga exchanges a golden army , a ring and a few earrings to pay the school fees of their daughters .	-3.6844
“ My husband and I just bought a house because my whole money is in it , ” says Amirthalinga .	-2.8717
Although she deserves 3,000 Singapore dollars every month ( approximately EUR 1,730 ) as an administrator and her husband also works , she does not explain the monthly family inco .	-3.6772
Indeed , demand in parts of South-East Asia – where household debt is increasing – is so great that ValueMax , where she has exchanged , was this week the third house listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange .	-3.6563
The pledge of jewelry is not only a fast way to get money – 1,300 Singapore dollars in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but almost as cheap as an unsafe bank loan .	-3.2286
Typically Pfandhäuser in Singapore requires an effective annual interest of 17 % , which is just above the 15.4 % required by the United Overseas Bank , a local lender with a branch in the same shopping centre .	-3.6471
However , pan houses offer the advantage that no review of creditworthiness or income proof is required here , which is why loans are more quickly possible than banks .	-3.9801
That is why millions of people in the region are turning to pandhouses after families feel pressure through rising living costs and increasing budgetary and consumer debt .	-3.8018
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans due to a loose fiscal policy in the developed economic areas , families with lower and middle-income pan-houses are seeking to compensate for the difference between stopping economies .	-4.4583
This week , the Standard & Poor Rating Agency described growing budgetary debt , mainly through rising mortgages , as a risk factor in Asian banks ’ creditworthiness .	-3.3265
Malaysia , Thailand and Singapore , according to the Agency 's assessment , have the highest budget debt in Asia relative to GDP .	-2.9899
Malaysia stands at the top of the list with 80 % of GDP , an increase of 60 % still in       y   2              	-5.5062
Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand , which has come out of a technical recession this week .	-3.0878
On Thursday , the data showed an existing weakness of exports and consumer demand .	-2.7172
“ In the end , this means that , given rising costs , people in the middle to lower segment ( the income scale ) will try to complement their incomes wherever possible , ” says Song Seng Wun , economist at CIMB , a Malaysian bank .	-3.5777
Historical maximum levels of gold prices over the past two years have strengthened the trend towards pledging personal items , as people use the opportunity to transform the jewelry of the family into cash          .	-4.4048
In Singapore , about 70 % of the pledged items are gold in the 200 houses of the city state .	-3.4236
People say : “ The gold price looks good , lets us pledge grandmother ’ s gold chain and return next month . ”	-3.0222
The largest Thai home operator , EasyMoney , has experienced a 20-percent customer growth in its branches in recent months .	-3.5437
The growth in personal business is so strong that ValueMax , operator of the branch in Bendemeer and 15 others in Singapore , wants to expand not only to the neighbouring Malaysia – where the company operates four houses – but also outside Asia , say Yeah Lee Ching , Managing Director of ValueMax .	-3.9518
The company finances this with 60 % of the 66 million Singapore dollars this week with the stock exchange in Singapore .	-3.2898
While some lenders have been into the crossfire because of high interest rates , Yeah declares that houses not only offer cheaper interest rates than other rentals , but also increased debt directly .	-4.8627
“ Customers rent items that they already have and the liquid personal value items do not increase household training , ” she explains .	-3.5136
The debt business is increasingly accepted as short-term , secure financing .	-3.2259
Nor are all people who use deposit borrowing in financial difficulti                	-6.2555
Rich people from Singapore also come to the ValueMax branches to pledge gold bars and rolex watches , for which they receive up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash .    Singapo             	-5.4620

Rescue package of more than $ 325 million for Tasmanian health care	-5.7234
The Australian Government insists on the hard conditions linked to the bailout package of more than $ 325 million for Tasman healthcare to ensure that the government of the state cannot waste the money .	-3.8169
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek announced that Commonwealth will take “ immediate measures ” to avert a crisis caused by an aging population of the island state , a higher quota of chronic diseases and system restrictions .	-3.0810
Funding for a period of four years has been decided after government discussions with the independent Tasmanian MEP Andrew Wilkie .	-3.1216
“ The government has launched an emergency rescue package , which , in our view , addresses the unique challenges that the state faces , ” said Plibersek today .	-3.7519
The $ 325 million package includes $ 31 million in emergency aid to electoral performance  .        T   .	-5.7883
Further 2600 operations , including orthopaedic interventions and treatments because of grey star , should be eliminated .	-3.2759
Moreover , there are money for daily hospitals in Hobart and Launceston , better care for stationary stays , specialist training , services in the field of mental health and the introduction of a system for electronic recording of health data in local hospitals .	-3.6715
“ These investments correspond to the ideas of which I have said that they are the best way of improving the Tasmanian health system , ” said Tanya Plibersek .	-9.4793
The Minister insisted on a strict reporting and accountability by the Tasmanian Government .	-2.3319
The federal state must retain the current level of funding to be able to receive money from the Commonwealth and report monthly on where the additional money has been spent .	-3.7067
A three-headed Commission will be established and it is intended to ensure that the federal state provides health services as efficiently and efficiently as possible            	-4.2668
As Wilkie said today , the $ 325 million would only benefit if “ they are not accompanied by real reforms that bring the public Tasmanian health system to a more sustainable course . ”	-3.3235
Nevertheless , he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent aid , which he first expressed to the Prime Minister in early May .	-2.9722
“ I am confident that federal aid will make a major contribution to taking the public health system of the state from the list of concerns , ” said Wilkie .	-3.0277
According to the government of the state , these electoral benefits will largely compete with recent cuts .	-2.8128
But the opposition ’ s health speaker at the federal level , Peter Dutton , believes that today ’ s announcement is just a “ pavement solution . ”	-2.9501
“ We are therefore in today ’ s situation because the Laboratory Government has deducted $ 430 million from the health system , ” he said to ABC TV .	-2.9771
It cannot be that a state government is trapping almost half a billion dollars from the system and that the Commonwealth is infecting 300 million and then doing that they are good news .	-4.3891
Dutton called on Plibersek to guarantee that not one dollar of the bailout package for additional bureaucracy is spent .	-2.6301

Syria has destroyed its opportunity to produce chemical weapons , so                  	-6.0645
Syria has destroyed important facilities for the production of chemical weapons and gas ammunition , declared the global surveillance group for chemical weapons on Thursday , while in the north of the country there was serious clashes near one of the locations where toxic substances were supposedly store                           	-6.5012
Also on Thursday , a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people have been killed soon since the beginning of the civil war .                            	-6.5323
The announcement of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons ( OPCW ) came one day before the      date .	-3.0652
1 November , which the Damascus organization based in The Hague had set to destroy all institutions for the production of chemical weapons or make “ inoperable ” , including all machines for mixing chemicals to poison gas and filling ammunition .	-4.0942
The conclusion of this process , which is essentially the first stage of destruction , is an important milestone of an ambitious timetable aimed at destroying all chemical weapons of Syria by mid-2014 .	-5.1507
The destruction of institutions means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons .	-2.1641
However , Damascus must start destroying existing weapons and supplies .	-2.4098
According to assumptions , there are about 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons in the country , including Senfgas and Nervengas Sarin .	-2.5741
The announcement came at a time when fighting in the city of Safira took place on Thursday , when experts say that there was a production facility for chemical weapons and storage facilities , as the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights Residence in the United Kingdom .	-4.5705
The activist group , which pursues the number of dead via a network of activists in Syria , declared on Thursday that 120,296 people died .	-3.1860
This is 61,067 civilians , including 6,365 children .	-1.6992
On the part of the government , 29,954 of them belonged to the army of President Bashar Assad , 18,678 were government-friendly fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militias .	-2.7247
Also among the dead are 2,202 deserted army soldiers and 5,375 fighters of the opposition , many of them foreigners .	-2.7350
On 25 July , the UN estimated the number of deaths in this conflict since March 2011 to 100,000 .	-2.2135
This figure has not been updated so far .	-1.7053
The conflict has forced about two million people to flee from the country .	-2.1037
Assad ’ s troops have been fighting in Safira for weeks against the rebels , many of which have connections to al-Qaeda groups .	-2.7421
The observatory said that there were losses on both sides on Thursday , but there were no details .	-2.5281
The fighting underlines the danger exposed to chemical weapons inspectors , because their mission to liberate Syria from its toxic arms arsenal is a race against time in the midst of a falling civil war .	-3.4621
According to the OPCW , which works closely with the United Nations , the team is “ now convinced that it has seen all the important production and mixing / filling institutions mentioned by Syria and has seen its destruction . ”	-4.0345
That is why “ no further inspection activities are currently being planned . ”	-2.5342
At the beginning of the week , the inspectors explained that they had completed the first round of reviews and visited 21 of 23 of the sites indicated by Damascus .	-3.1328
Due to security concerns , the visit of two institutions was not possible , the inspectors said .	-2.9378
On Thursday , the OPWC declared that the two locations were “ abandoned ” according to Syria ... and the objects of the chemical weapons programme there were shifted to other aforementioned institutions that were inspecte  .      1  .        1 .             .    	-7.7957
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two facilities that the OPCW inspectors could not visit .	-2.4514
Syria has presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons , which must be approved next month by the OPWC Executive Committee .	-2.5821

Anger about the Bali Bombing Caster	-6.6111
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who lived in Bali in 2002 responded angry to the judgment for the last of the instigators that was put before the court , as Umar Patek should be shot in their  opinion .	-7.5229
Patek , who was one of South-East Asia ’ s most sought-after escapes almost ten years , was condemned yesterday for his role in constructing explosive bodies for the bomb attack on a prison of 20 years .	-4.3460
It could be dismissed after 15 years .	-2.6189
The 45-year-old was guilty of the mass murder because of the attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta , where 202 people died , including 88 Australians , and many others were injured .	-3.3066
In addition , there were a number of terrorist-related indictments , including a wave of explosive attacks on churches in Indonesia in the Sacred Evening in  2            i    .	-7.1921
The public prosecutor had called for a lifelong prison sentence , even though it could have requested the death penalty for the man who , because of his reputation as a masterful bombing farmer .	-4.3345
The decision has awakened painful memories at June Corteen , a mother from Perth who lost her 39-year-old twin daughter Jane and Jenny in the devastation designed by Patek and his conspirators almost ten years ago .	-3.7610
With tears she said that Patek should have been condemned to death .	-2.6435
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the other guy .	-1.9960
“ One should put him in front of a shooting command , ” said Corteen to AAP .	-3.1266

He fell into the coma for a month and “ died ” three times after the attack , while he departed from a life conservation syste      .	-4.4790
Hughes said that Patek deserved the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cell Jemaah Islamiah – Amrozi , Mukhlas , and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the bloodbath and executed four years ago .	-2.7563
Really , this type should get the death penalty above all others .	-2.7290
Let him live – no , there is no reason to let him live .	-2.0386
Getting 20 years after killing 202 people and injuring many hundreds is not much .	-2.2773
Patek is the last of the Bali Bomber who was in court .	-2.6850
He withdrew almost a decade of arrest , but was finally taken up in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad in January 2011 , where US forces killed the former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden just four months later .	-3.5586
During the negotiation , an FBI agent said that intelligence reports had provided the indication that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of rebuilding the link between South-East Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda .	-3.4428
“ He did not face himself , ” said Corteen .	-2.4246
Until recently , he has not shown repentance of how much suffering he has added to other people .	-3.0498
The judgment took place before the ten-year anniversary of the attack this year committed to celebrations in Bali and Australia .	-2.9631
“ There will be many tears this year , ” said Corteen .	-1.6287
Patek can still appeal against his judgment .	-2.1608
FAA : Passengers can now use electronic devices in aircraft ( but do not lead mobile talks )	-2.3981
Air travellers can now listen to their electronic devices for reading , working , games , music and using the reputation of films , but not telephoning with the mobile phone , so the new directives published on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) in the USA .                                                   	-8.2289
But passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately .	-1.7389
How quickly they would be implemented , with the respective airline , FAA employee Michael Huerta declared at a press conference .	-3.3498
The airlines must prove to the FAA that aircraft meet the new directives and that they have updated the training manuals of the aircraft and the rules for the confidence of the equipment according to the new rules .	-4.0142
The FAA stated that it has already received plans from some airlines which want to expand the use of portable electronic equipment in aircraft .	-2.9877
Under these airlines , Delta and JetBlue were also .	-2.2735
“ Depending on the state of the plan , we could approve the extended use of electronic devices very soon , ” the FAA announced in a statement .	-5.4973
At present , passengers must switch off smartphones , tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed .	-4.5331
You may only start them again when the aircraft has reached a height of three kilometres and the captain gives the green light .	-3.4040
When entering the landing flight , passengers must switch off them again and must not restart them before the aircraft has landed .	-4.0475
According to the new directives , airlines whose aircraft are safeguarded against electronic disorders could allow their passengers to use the equipment also in the case of startup , landing and rolling , the FAA explained .	-4.0195
Most new transport aircraft and other aircraft converted into larger heights for the use of Wi-Fi should meet the criteria .	-3.0830
Laura Glading , President of the Professional Association of Professional Airlines , welcomed the changes .	-2.6441
“ If the new regulation is safely implemented – and we work closely with the airline in this respect – both sides will benefit from it , ” commented glading .	-2.8714
We are honestly sorry to have to feel like contacts on this issue .	-3.4953
Nevertheless , Internet connections remained forbidden to surf , exchange emails , text messages or download data under three kilometres , the authority explained .	-3.1584
Passengers are asked to enable smartphones , tablets and other devices in flight mode .	-2.6585
So still no “ Words With Friends ” , the scrabble similar online game that the actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when he had to leave a jet of American Airlines publicly , because he refused to switch off the device while the aircraft was parked at the aircraft                                  	-7.0295
And heavier equipment such as laptops must continue to be stouted because there is a threat to injury if they fly through the cabin                       	-6.1806
Mobile conversations during the flight also remain prohibited .	-2.7029
The Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) , not the FAA , is the regulatory competence for telephone calls .	-2.9122
FAA may remove bans for certain electronic devices at startup and landing	-5.5912
Last month , Mark Rosenker said that the National Transportation Safety Board transport authority said safety experts on national transport issues on CBS News , mobile phones would still be regarded as risk .	-3.8559
“ Mobile phones are really a problem , not only because they could potentially cause navigation devices , but because we know from the FCC that the transmission from the air can also disrupt sending masts , ” says Rosenker .	-3.8474
A consultancy committee created by the FAA on the investigation of this issue recommended last month that the government allowed broader use of personal electronic equipment .	-8.3367
In recent years , pressure on the FAA has increased to relax restrictions on use .	-2.4034
Critics such as the democratic senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri believe that there are no valid security reasons for the ban .       .	-5.3806
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of the equipment has become ubiquitous .	-3.1745
In some studies , there is talk of forgetting or ignoring up to one third of the passengers .	-3.1066
The FAA began to restrict the use of electronic equipment by air travellers in 1966 after reports on disruptions of navigation and communication equipment by passengers had been known to passengers who represented the latest technical trend at the time .	-4.4880
New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft , but they are also so designed and approved by the FAA that they do not make electronic interferences  .	-5.3057
Airlines have been offering passengers Wi-Fi for several years when the air height is reached .	-2.8560
The aircraft adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also insensitive to interferences .	-2.5260
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for more use of electronic equipment in accordance with the new directives , said Huerta .	-2.9720

Members of the FAA Consultancy Committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using devices .	-4.6570
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said that he believed that the disturbance by the devices is real , even if the risk is minimal .	-3.5572
Other Committee members said that there are only single reports of pilots talking about disrupting aircraft systems by the devices , and most of them are very old .	-3.3333
The committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to order the devices by passengers in instrument landing under poor visibility conditions .	-4.2865
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and called them a reasonable adjustment for travellers who would be equipped with technology today .	-3.7065

Released birds rescued by the North Sea Drill Island v  Air Service	-3.8244
An air rescue service to the coast of birds that had been found on a North Sea drilling island has been released into nature .	-4.1091
The water rall was flew last month with a helicopter to Aberdeen , where it was capped by the Scottish animal welfare organization SPCA in their rescue centre in Alloa .	-3.7643
Colin Seddon , head of the centre , said : “ This water rall was probably a winter bird from northern Europe which was stopped by the strong winds over the North Sea . ”	-3.4588
Apparently the exhausted bird seeked refuge on the drilling island .	-2.3419
He added : “ He could no longer fly forward why we were contacted with the request for help . ”	-2.8736
In their release , the water rall was again fit and heal               	-6.8504
Is Europe ’ s elite ready to do business with Britain ?	-2.2318
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy to a table and defining what those who want to change in our relations with the EU in the UK want to prosper and work .	-3.3421
To this end , we have commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey among British economic leaders and asked them what they think about Britain , the economy and the EU .	-2.8773
YouGov questioned more than 1,000 leaders from the economy that form the British corporate sizes , sectors and regions .	-3.6434
The results of the survey will be many surprised .	-1.9160
We have found that the overwhelming majority of companies are now exporting outside Europe and focusing on countries that modernise and grow while states in the EU stagnate .	-3.2922
They want government side to favour new trade links with countries such as China , India and Brazil , rather than stopping with the long and efforting process of reforming the obscure EU institutions .	-3.3377
Asked for their view on certain legally regulated issues – from cartel law to product legislation – the majority of the economic leaders believe that control over these key competences should be retrieved to Westminster .	-3.8934
There was general dissatisfaction about the internal market because , according to companies , the costs of Brussels would now overwhelm the benefits of being part of Europe ’ s trade area – even 40 % of the large companies agreed with the most traditionally Europe-friendly ones .	-6.3613
Finally , and probably the most , our survey of economic leaders said that a clear majority of Britain wanted a course towards changing the agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade , not on politics .	-3.6205
This recognition , which finds itself in companies of all sizes and leading corporations , shows that the economy is pressing for a “ meaningful change ” that brings the yeast of action back to Britain .	-4.1657
There is much – an amendment to the agreement and better conditions for Britain would result in a referendum at 16 % in favour of remaining in the EU .	-3.4826
The Prime Minister should have no doubt : this survey shows that the British economy is behind its plan for renegotiating British conditions for EU membership .	-2.8575
It also shows that companies expect a clear shift in power back to Britain from a renegotiation .	-2.9777
A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary after the eurozone is now moving towards a closer economic and fiscal union .	-2.5941
The priority must be jobs and growth in the United Kingdom , as the result of our survey shows , which means greater attention for companies to trade and fundamental change in the Brussels approach to rules .	-3.2306

The construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria represents the start of one of the largest European energy projects , declared the Gazprom Board .	-3.8812
“ Today ’ s event is a milestone : the construction work on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline , the largest and most important project in Europe , ” said the CEO of Gazprom , Alexei Miller , on Thursday in a statement .	-3.4493
The project is a key element in the energy security of the entire European continent .	-1.9920
South Stream should ensure more diversity in Russia ’ s export routes through Europe .	-2.4694
A contractual dispute between Gazprom and its counterpart in Ukraine , where the majority of Russian gas is stored for Europe , ensures an increased risk of conventional routes , as is heard from the official side .	-7.7841
Miller said that the direct link to Bulgaria , a member of the European Union , means that the geopolitical risks linked to transit countries are “ always ” eliminated .	-2.8650
Bulgarian consumers receive gas from South Stream at reasonable rates when the entire project is operating in 2015 .	-3.0295

Consultation before the Royal Commission : Two YMCA staff accused of accusations against Jonathan Lord of sexual delicacies	-6.7514
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales ( NSW ) were accused of because of sexual delicacies related to children before 2011 accusations of the child carer Jonathan Lord from Caringbah were charged , as the Royal Commission for Sexual Abuse of Children had informed .	-4.4258
But in the opening declaration before the Commission , the YMCA had stated that “ the organisation had never had to do with an incident of sexual child abuse . ”	-3.6528
Managing Director Phillip Hare was questioned about a case in which a YMCA employee was charged for crimes with child pornography , and another in which a sports teacher of the YMCA Caringbah Hall was condemned in 1991 because of the abuse of his entrusted children .	-6.6853
Hare said Gail Furness , a lawyer assisting the Commission , that he knew of the first case , but has not known the second .	-7.9884
He also acknowledged that the opening of the YMCA towards the Commission was also inaccurate in the claim that “ there have been external reviews of the YMCA in which the YMCA was recognised as the forefront of child safety . ”	-4.7131
Evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA has been informed that it has received the second lowest assessment of four possible in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities ( Ministry of Education ) in August .              .  (      ) . Thi  i   w   w w  w	-8.1801
Hare , which started with 21 at the YMCA , acknowledged that the management had “ from me to downwards ” failed in the attitude of Lord and did not ensure that employees had been aware of their commitments to report violations of child safety directives .	-4.7585
Lord was sentenced to the YMCA during his two-year activity during the beginning of the year because of sexual crimes .	-3.8634
He was condemned to at least six years of prison .	-1.9195
Hare disputes , however , that the YMCA would have a cultural problem that employees have held from reporting Lord ’ s infringements on the safety of children .	-3.7312
The employees said that they had observed infringements , including that Lord was alone with children , supported them privately as babysitters , sitting them on his shot , said to one thing that he loved it , and children playing with his mobile phone .	-4.5505
Danielle Ockwell , whose superior Lord was and who had asked for child protection training because she was concerned about his behaviour , said that the child service leader Jacqui Barnat , who was the superior Lords in the YMCA Caringbah , was “ very intimidating and most of them was very unclear . ”	-5.8914
The Managing Director stated that he would not accept statements by employees that they would not have trusted to report to their superior report .	-5.2879
Instead , he said that her friendship with Lord had affected her judgment , which is why they would not have reported .	-3.2451
Hare explained that he has informed the Board of Management of the YMCA NSW that the lesson that the organization has to draw from the “ Jonathan Lord incident ” concerns “ not reporting ” by staff , and the Management Board agreed to him .	-4.6530
Hare said that the decision to push employees to sign secrecy obligations shortly after the accusations occurred was made by the Managing Director of the YMCA , Liam Whitley .	-3.5079
He said that contamination of evidence should be prevented , but what has been “ overly ” and badly implemented .	-3.3515
The YMCA NSW was not a secure organisation for children when Jonathan Lord was employed there between 2009 and 2011 , Professor Stephen Smallbone of the Griffith University , expert in sexual child abuse , the Commission .	-3.5482
He explained that there have been “ serious problems ” in the attitude , review , education , training and supervision of employees .	-3.2154

Tony Blair stated that he would use the opportunity to return as British Prime Minister – but acknowledges that a comeback is unlikely .	-2.8398
In an interview this evening on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his letter from office , the 59-year-old announced his views on various domestic issues .	-3.2635
Since his resignation in June 2007 , after a decade of state leader , Blair has largely avoided expressing himself on British policy , and his comments have mostly been limited to foreign policy and his role as a messenger of the Quartet of Peacekeepers in the Middle East .	-4.4732
To the question of whether he would like to return to the office of the Prime Minister , Blair was quoted from the Evening Standard from London : “ Yes , sure , but it is unlikely that this happens , so ... ”	-3.6116
When horse show experts found themselves in shares in Cardiff to cut the horse of the year , they were aware that a hard competitive battle was imminent .	-4.1156
But no one was prepared for the three years old Fenton Kirkland .	-2.0513
The Knirps , who is not even in the kindergarten and only made his first steps just a few months ago , and his Shetland-Pony toffee drove easily through the three rounds and picked up the first price – with 30 adult opponents behind .	-4.6335
The inseparable couple , both large , were praised for their appearance , behavior and style in the annual competition organized by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff .	-3.7619
In his appearance in competition against men and women with elegant melons , he had set up his cap in a fresh angle and led the two years old toffee through the ring .	-3.8914
Fenton was prized by the jurors for his natural abilities to deal with the pony that were far above his age .	-6.2670
And toffee received bestnotes for his appearance and his personality .	-3.1321
Fenton got toffee last March as a gift to his third birthday and since then exercised the Shetland Pony every day .	-3.3722
His mother , Donna , 30 , said : “ Fenton and Toffee are a great tension . ”	-2.1894
They had to take action against the entire participant field and have gone from the square with gold pocal and rosette .	-3.7722
It was only the second time he participated in competition with tobacco , and we were all enthusiastic when he won .	-3.0902
Totally strangers in the arena held him so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him .	-3.1296
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale , South Wales , follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells , which has been showing horses for more than ten year                        	-6.1008
Howells told : “ The whole audience was like electricized , and everyone had fired and clacked it . ”	-3.6000
He ran on sand the entire length of the arena and , although he looked so tiny , he has done fantastic work .	-2.8715
Fenton is crazy according to animals – he loves horses , tractors and farms and has two chickens he takes care of .	-2.9548
As he started , it will not take long until he is on the “ horse of the year ” – and I am sure he will cut well .	-3.3546
A speaker of the annual horse view said : “ Fenton is only three , but he knows how to deal with his pony . ”	-2.8259
Together they are a great team .	-1.4753
The jurors assessed Fenton and Toffee how well they had beaten and presented in the demonstration .	-3.2382
They respect good cooperation between Pony and Guide – and there were Fenton and Toffee the best in the ring .	-2.8451
I am sure that Fenton ’ s sweet clothing has contributed its part to that , the really fitted really perfectly .	-3.6274
Chinese Newspaper Should be “ Reformed ”	-2.0878
A Chinese newspaper , which had called for the release of a reporter charged for defamation , should be reformed , explained a press regulator .	-3.2463
The New Express based in Guangzhou had printed a rare public call to release the journalist Chen Yongzhou .	-2.4153
But Chen admitted later on television that he adopted bribery money to counterfeit reports on a partial company .	-3.2436
Now the new express of “ comprehensive rectification , ” explained the regulatory authority .	-2.4843
The “ Rectification Order ” was carried out by the Authority for Press and Publications , Radio , Film and TV in Guangdong .	-3.1117
Preliminary investigations pointed out that the New Express , which belongs to the Yangcheng Evening News Group , had published several unacceptable reports on the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013    .	-3.4132
“ The editorial management of the New Express was disorderly , ” the regulatory authority announced in a statement .	-2.5767
She said that one had decided to “ impose an administrative punishment on Chen Yongzhou and escape his reporter license . ”	-3.2164
In addition , “ Yangcheng Evening News Group has depended on carrying out a full rectification of the New Express and recommended that the relevant leaders investigate in the New Express and review the New Express ’ leadership team immediately . ”	-4.4195
Chen had written several articles for the New Express in which he reported on alleged financial irregularities for a manufacturer of construction machines called Zoomlion .	-4.8022
After having been arrested , the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and faced his journalistic work .	-5.5874
But then Chen appeared on television and admitted that he had published false reports against payment .	-3.0394
“ In this case , I have damaged Zoomlion as well as the entire news industry and its ability to win the public ’ s confidence , ” he said about the state news station CCTV .	-3.8257
I have done it first and foremost because I was on mone  an glory             	-5.2704
I have been clear that I have acted wrongly .	-4.3852
Following Chen ’ s apology , the New Express published an excuse on the front page and explained that it failed to review the reports correctly .	-3.3411

Discovered drug tunnels between the US and Mexico	-2.4528
One of the most refined tunnels for drug smuggling between the US and Mexico , which was fully equipped with lighting , ventilation and electrical operation , has now been discovered .	-3.1044
The US authorities described the 120 times 90 centimetres measuring tunnel as one of the most sophisticated passages they ever found .	-2.7166
The tunnel that runs in the zigzag pattern over a length of almost six football fields connects warehouses near Tijuana , Mexico , and San Diego , USA .	-3.2753
In the area there are countless inseparable storage halls , which makes it easier to hide trucks loaded with drugs .	-3.0817
The tunnel was closed before drugs could be transported into them , the authorities explained .	-3.0593
When discovering the tunnel , eight and a half tonnes of Marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were ensured , the records of the court .	-3.2239
Three men who worked as drivers according to the statement of the authorities were charged because of the possession and the intended sale of Marijuana and Kokain .	-4.5161
They are threatening prison penalties between ten years and lifelong i                  	-5.8601
In Nogales , Arizona , smugglers place an extensive underground network of drainage channels .	-2.3799
The tunnel is the eighth large passage discovered since 2006 in San Diego .	-2.1167
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after the Marijuana harvest in Central Mexico in October , which puts the drug cartels in front of the challenge they can quickly bring their product to consumers .	-3.7078
In 2010 , authorities found a less than 640 meters long passage with railways that went from a kitchen in a residential house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego .	-3.7995

Actor Orlando Bloom has spoken to separate his wife , Topmodel Miranda Kerr                  	-5.9386
In an interview with US journalist Katie Couric , who should be broadcast on Friday ( local time ) , Bloom said , " the life sometimes does not run just as we plan or hope " .	-3.3867
Kerr and he himself loved himself , emphasized the 36-year-old .	-6.6778
" We will support each other and love ourselves as parents of Flynn " .	-2.2422
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010 , in 2011 her soncer Flynn was born .	-2.2893
Veganism , according to Lexica , is different from vegetarianism , but it is very different from        t               	-6.7378
Because while vegetarians allow the consumption of cream tortures , ice or a strong Edamer , these meadows are not on the menu of a vegan .	-4.3409
Milk , cheese , egg , alongside the renunciation of meat and fish , the vegan leaves from all consumption of animal products - also honey is negated .	-3.6977
What remains , one may wonder , but in closer consideration the vegan food world is characterised by a considerable richness of incapacity .	-4.2864
" Bread strokes are very popular " , explains Ute Henkelmann , the holder of the local reform house , who has a variety of special products for vegans .	-3.6269
Reuben Proctor is also pleased to visit the shop in the Domgasse .	-2.9355
For 13 years , the born New Zealand has been living vegan , in Lampertheim he finds ( almost ) everything he needs to live . " In 1997 , I died and became vegetarian " .	-4.7208
At the turn of the century the next step was taken and I became vegans .	-2.4754
" However , the conviction came not only because of nutrition , but because of the shoe choice , " says Proctor , who prefers artist leather normal leath           	-5.1033
He recognized that there are other daily concerns without animal products .	-2.9940
First of all , vegan is an ethics .	-5.6554
" I do not want animals to die for me " , Proctor expresses the maxims of vegans that extend to the whole consumer behaviour .	-3.3997
Instead of stopping castles , stirring or rubber bears , the vegan quickly discovered new products , enthusiasm increased .	-3.8845
" It is a double bonus " , says Proctor today , " in fact , vegan does not renounce any askes , but it is an enrichment " .    a  th           t as     ,         th  c  .                                                     .               	-19.9525
And precisely these conditions also failed some well-meaning attempts .	-3.7918
" The addiction factor is a very important factor that lets many quickly give up , similar to smoking , " Proctor puts a comparison .	-3.4053
And turn on : " Certain tastes are not to be determined by the animal " .	-3.6430
It is often the spices or the type of preparation that make the taste .	-2.6985
" You can also create the same effect in another way " , however , clarifies the vegan .	-3.2430
For example , Proctor brings aubergines , champignons and also a few vegan sausages .	-3.4963
It pays attention to a balanced , varied nutrition , where it should also taste considerably .	-4.3793
Of course , you want to have something between the teeth , that is legitimate      .	-3.1368
" It should taste , but that is not just to reduce animal food , " said Proctor .	-2.7346
Health damage to disorders , another widespread assumption , he did not suffer .	-2.5129
For me , the changeover had a positive aspect .	-2.1820
I do not take up any foreign cholesterol and have an increased vitamin share .	-2.4707
There are high-performance athletes who feed themselves exclusively vegan .	-2.5850
" My blood values are best , I let me check often " , tells Proctor .	-2.9289
Especially before the lack of vitamin B12 , many vegansimus critics warn .	-2.1304
" Since animals are nutritioned with feed rather than grazing in the pasture , it is questionable whether in the meat you buy in the cooling chest , the vitamin B12 share is high " , Proctor finds .	-3.9961
For vegans there is also the possibility to take the coenzyme in the form of tablets .	-2.5880
" My B12 values are in order " , he explains .	-1.9687
Proctor must not go far for food recruitment .	-2.8788
Finally , there are basic foods everywhere and every supermarket has soya milk and other products now .	-5.8512
I find everything I need on the ground .	-1.9783
Only from and on I buy something special .	-2.2707
" Many people overlook the fact that only the finished products are expensive , but so it behaves with " ordinary " finished products as well " .	-3.4879
In any case , the preparation of vegetable courts is far more favourable and less time-consuming than in common .	-3.5802
" In the house kitchen there is a lot to discover , with some small tunnels you can say good , if not partly better results , " says Proctor .	-4.0152
Margarine rather than butter , a little more baking powder and carbon acid instead of egg , with his vegan cheese cakes , Proctor could also bring his swing relatives to amaze .	-4.2708
Family festivals give the vegan a new spice .	-2.7664
This is dynamic if you cook together , it has a new importance .	-6.1870
" The situations that can emerge are as different as people themselves , " says Proctor .	-2.6260
Of course , he has already been sceptically accepted .	-3.4553
Do you not taste my food ?	-4.5622
" Should I feel bad now because I drink milk ? " - on such questions , you must act as a vegan with fingerpeak sense .	-4.2606
" I do not reject people , I am part of this society , " Proctor does not want to be an enclavenda  .	-5.3656
And , more precisely , the everyday world does not seem as vegan as suspected - and the vegan does not appear as limited in everyday life as the commonly assumed .	-4.8148
Fast Food is also allowed .	-1.3163
Pommes everywhere !	-4.5737
" Many Dönerläden offer Falafel , or just a vegetarian yufka , " says Proctor .	-2.3708
In a pizzeria it extends on pasta dishes , or orders a pizza without cheese , all a question of habit .	-5.2430
The restaurants are so slow to do this .	-3.5714
" When I started 13 years ago to feed me vegan , everything was even more difficult " , the New Zealand can find a development : " You have to talk to people , draw them attentively " .	-5.5807
" If enough demand comes , they may be inclined to complement the menu , " he hopes .	-2.8154
Vegan restaurants develop , such as the combustion in Mannheim or the café bird free .	-2.9342
Proctor has the desire that other restaurants at least have a vegan dish on the menu .	-2.7565
Basically , vegan dishes are here for all .	-2.4727
Everyone can eat them , so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive .          . i        	-5.1470
" Meat dishes are exclusive , in the truest sense of the word , because they exclude others " , Proctor finds .	-3.2869
" If you want to avoid food scandals , veganism is a safe way to make the very largest part of the outset impossible , " says Proctor .	-3.0643
But purchasing vegan products can be somewhat difficult at the beginning .	-2.4307
In particular , when you learn to understand that animal additives can also be contained in general nuts as colors , you seem to leave the courage quickly with following ethics in so many obstacles and traps .	-4.5164
Not only have Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen written a book : " Veganissimo - animal ingredients and their alternatives " explains the many ingredients , which are also contributed to food and cleaning .	-4.1387
" Gradually you develop a scanner view and know which characters and logos you have to respect " It is sometimes better small steps to do than stand or stumble " , knows Proctor .	-3.8952
Veganism , it is an important moral fingerpoint that proposes consciousne .                 	-5.7803
Perhaps it does not make it quite clear that its habits are deposited , but at least it can teach consumers to question his habits critically .	-4.3538

British police makes Assange an extradition decision .	-5.4697
The British police has today passed a delivery description to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange , who sought refuge and asylum in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London .	-3.4388
Scotland Yard explained that the 40-year-old Australian had delivered a “ call to face up ” to ask him to appear in a police guard , and added , if he did not comply with it , he threatened arrest .	-4.8548
Assange threatens the extradition to Sweden because of the charge in a sexual delicacy after his opportunities for British law have been exhausted since the Supreme Court has rejected his opposition to extradition earlier this month .	-3.9785
Because he fears that Stockholm will deliver him to the US , he sought refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on 19 June and asked the South American country for political asylum .	-3.2915

Tax for foreign real estate owners against London ’ s Speculation Bubble	-2.0929
The Ministry of Finance has provisionally calculated the CGT measure , but is still waiting for the final decision of Chancellor George Osborne , who had imposed a stamp tax of 7 % on housing in the 2012 budget , which costs more than two million pounds and annual fees for buyers who keep housing as a company and not as individuals .	-4.6699
Already , revenues from the stamp tax on residential property exceed 708 million pounds in the districts of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea , which took place in the tax year 2012 / 13 , combined with proceeds for Northern Ireland , Wales , Scotland , the north-east , North-West , Yorkshire and the Humber region .	-4.7800
Cook said , “ After the increase in the stamp tax on high-price housing and the introduction of the legislation associated with it , it is difficult to say that high-quality properties are too low taxed , regardless of the impact of the outdated community tax system . ”	-4.2610
“ But this step could make some foreign investors more restrained with regard to purchasing real estate in London or selling owners from it , ” he added .	-3.2552
First-class real estate – the top five to ten percent of the housing market after price – in the prosperous London southwest belt , which extends from Fulham to Wimbledon , has been expensive by 11.8 % last year .	-3.8371
The prices in Central London have represented an even annual growth of 5.6 % , but were overshadowed by an emerging “ domestic market ” on which the southwestern part of the city , the north ( 7.4 % ) and the east ( 6.5 % ) experienced an upward trend , such as an investigation of Savills .	-4.3167
Scientists could throw more light on what context the tail of a dog is with his mood .	-3.5969
Previous research had shown that happy dogs with the tail more to the right ( from the perspective of the dog ) , while it was the left with nervous dogs .                         	-6.3294
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive and respond to these subtle differences .	-2.2151
Professor Georgio Vallortigara , a neuroscientist of the University of Trento , said : “ In humans is well known that the left and right brain half differ from stimulus that cause positive or negative emotions . ”	-3.5275
Here we tried to look at this at other species .	-2.1530
He also noted that dogs are responsible for the movement of the left and vice versa and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the feelings .	-7.3293
To learn more about how dogs respond to the sidelines of their species , researchers monitored the animals while these films of other dogs looked at .	-3.6436
They measured the heart rate of four legs and analyzed the behavior .	-5.4427
We will probably soon understand why the tail moves in the one direction ,        .	-5.7761
Professor Vallortigara said : “ We have shown the dogs films with dogs – either a naturally faithful version or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects , and we could thus move the tail more to the left or right . ”	-3.6865
When the animals saw how an otherwise expressive dog has moved the tail to the right ( seen from the perspective of the noble dog ) , they remained completely relaxed .	-3.6346
However , was the tail mainly to the left ( again from the perspective of the dog that winds ) , their heart rate increased and they looked troubled .	-4.6684
According to Professor Vallortigara , the dogs do not intentionally communicate with each other through these movements .	-4.2468
It is convinced that the dogs would have learned from experience in which movements they should worry and when no  .	-5.5788
He said , “ If you have different encounters with other dogs and you are more linked to the tail in one direction with friendly behaviour and the right produces a less friendly behaviour , then you respond on the basis of these experiences . ”	-4.7848
The researchers say that the findings of dog owners , veterinarians and trainers could help to better understand the emotions of their animal  .	-4.7483
John Bradshaw , expert in dog behavior and guest scholarship at the Faculty of Animal Healing Customers of the University of Bristol , declared that this was not the first study to examine whether left and right is important for dogs .	-4.0034
Last year , a team of the University of Lincoln found that dogs rotate the head to the left when they look at an aggressive dog , and to the right when it comes to a satisfied dog .	-3.5295
In another research at the University of Victoria in Canada , the following was : “ Dogs go more to a robot dog when being tailored to the left and not to the right , rather than becoming unsettled – precisely different from that of the Italian study . ”	-5.0357
According to his statement , the differences could therefore stir up that the dogs in the various studies did not interpret the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs .	-3.6239
A study , as dogs respond to real dogs , could help , he explained .	-2.2737
“ While there are considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two brain half are used for different purposes , many of the details still need to be determined – and dogs are no exception , ” says Bradshaw .	-3.6134
Since their behavior can be recorded simply , it will probably not take long until we understand why the tail sometimes moves in one direction , sometimes in the other .	-3.7226

Pope Francis Appoints First Cardinals	-1.8571
Pope Francis will first call new cardinals of the Catholic Church on 22 February , as the Vatican announced on Thursday .	-2.7626
Cardinals are the highest clerics in the Catholic Church after the Pope and they are also choosing a Pope , so that Francis will appoint the first group of men who will ultimately participate in the choice of its successor .	-3.7648
There are currently 201 cardinals .	-1.2357
However , a cardinal that has reached an age of 80 can no longer participate in the Pope ’ s election – a group of 120 “ eligible cardinals                        	-5.5505
In a declaration where the message was announced , Father Federico Lombardi , a spokesman of the Vatican , said that a meeting of all cardinals will take place before the ceremony is held to appoint the new cardinals , which are also known as consistency .	-3.8520
“ Pope Francis decided to announce his decision to convene the Consistory in February in advance , so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from all over the world can be planned , ” said Lombardi .	-3.1941
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of eligible cardinals until February would probably have declined                   .	-5.2653
He declared that a Pope usually appointed as many cardinals as necessary so that the number of eligible cardinals is again 120 , and as many cardinals over 80 as he wi               	-5.0859
The Consistency next year is therefore important because it is the first since the election of Francis in March this year , Valero .	-2.9596
There is currently a certain overhang on the part of Europe , and especially Italy .	-3.9097
“ It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope cardinal will appoint from the rest of the world to restore the balance , ” he said .	-4.1987
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America , but they have only a tiny number of cardinals .	-2.0259
The cardinals will also be the first to find opportunities for reforming the church since the formation of the French Council of Cardinals , a group of eight cardinals from all over the world .	-3.4261
In the past , the Pope decided everything alone .	-1.7584
“ Now Francis has selected these eight cardinals to help him , ” said Valero .	-2.2981
He stated that it was “ good possible ” that Francis asked the cardinals for advice .	-3.0307
But so far we have not been in this situation – all this is quite new .	-2.9115
Valero typically said that the bishops from large places would be called to cardinals , but Francis “ full surprises – so we do not know whom he appoints . ”	-3.7065

General Motors returns almost 19,000 of its brand new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra Pickup trucks with construction year 2014 to fix a problem with the manually adjustable seat rest , such as a communication from the US regulatory authority for vehicle safety on Friday .	-3.9584
In some of the cars , there can be a defect in the mechanism for the setting of the front seat refusal .	-3.6848
That is why they do not fulfil the Federal Directives on Vehicle Safety on Head Restrictions .	-3.3142
“ If the vehicle is risen from the back , it is possible that the head restraints do not properly protect the occupations so that there is an increased risk of injury , ” was in the message to read on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ( NHTSA ) website . 	-5.4613
The returned models were manufactured between 1 August and 10 September .	-2.2033
The delivery of GM trucks began in June and represents the most important model start of the leading US car manufacturer since the insolvency-related restructuring of 2009 .	-3.4933
GM informed vehicle owners in the first October half about the defect .	-2.3511
NHTSA could not check the notification letter because of the 16-day government shutdown , which had a negative impact on car sales in October .	-3.3228
The sale of Silverado and Sierra trucks , which were redeveloped for the model year 2014 , has increased by 20 % in the first ten months of the year , declared GM on Friday .	-3.2816

It is a book which I believed that I would lift my medical studies during the second year and give me hope again .	-4.1552
It is called “ The Audacity to Win ” ( courage to win ) and describes Barack Obama ’ s memoirs as a presidential election in 2008 .	-3.1039

It is difficult to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague memory , a sad reminder of missed possibilities .	-4.9644
In the years since I gave my voice for the first time , something has changed .	-5.5653
But it is simply nothing I could have imagined .	-1.7285
I acknowledge the great and versatile things that Obama has achieved , from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for health insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq , the end of the forced concealment of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Lad  in Laden .	-5.1795
I too believe that the party political blockadetactics have tilted too many efforts to make our nation forward : immigration reform , a public option for health insurance and the closure of Guantanamo Bay , to mention just a few                             an    a                         	-9.8946
But having defended the Obama administration countless times to colleagues and acquaintances , I have ended with my statements .	-3.7696
I have achieved a point of political despair .	-1.5419
Republican blockade policy cannot be explained why it allows heads of foreign state to be listened or the killing of innocent children by drones in overseas .	-3.6253
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data about the private life of Americans and why Whistleblowers are punished that disclose government errors .	-3.2904
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki , an American citizen , was killed without procedures , still handles public financing and expenditure limits during the presidential elections .	-3.2960
It does not justify the results of a report which states that the White House ’ s efforts to calm the media are the most “ aggressive ... since the Nixon government . ”	-3.0290
And , recently , it cannot apologize for the inability to design a simple website in more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care A     .	-3.3702

And that disturbs me most .	-2.0954
I re-elected Obama in 2012 , not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy .	-2.2908
With Romney , a confusing and unbalanced alternative was that he seemed unable to define his direction and positions .	-3.1671
I had the impression that a second term of office for Obama , free of pressure from future elections , would meet the hope that we had heard from for so long                      .    . 	-6.5551
But , with the fall in the approval values for Obama to less than 45 % this week , the return to 2008 has become so harder by this book .	-3.2124

The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two dealers from its foreign exchange department , such as two people who are familiar with the situation ; this is another indication of the fact that global governmental investigation is rapidly including manipulations in the monetary market .	-4.4631
Some of the world ’ s largest banks , including UBS , Barclays , Deutsche Bank , and RBS , confirmed that they cooperate with the authorities in the investigations in the world ’ s largest financial market , where US $ 5.3 billion is changing the owner every day .	-3.6716
The two dealers would be the first RBS employees suspended in the extensive investigation that the scandal around the Libor Interbank business is drawing .	-4.0468
The Bank , which did not comment on suspension , confirmed this month that it had received information requests from authorities .	-2.6666
“ Our investigations on this issue continue and we fully cooperate with the FCA and other regulatory authorities , ” said the Bank two weeks ago .	-2.8081
Last month , the situation stated closest people that the RBS sent the records of emails and instant messages sent by and to an earlier dealer to the British Supervisory Authority , the Financial Conduct Authority .	-3.6286
This dealer , Richard Usher , had left the RBS 2010 and should now have been holidayed by his current position as European head of the Forex Spot Trade at JPMorgan .                          	-7.1085

The Instant Message Group of Usher included bankers at Barclays and the Citigroup , said the situation nearest people .	-3.0296
UBS announced this week that it had taken steps against some of its employees after the Swiss regulatory authority had declared Finma that it investigated a suspected manipulation of the foreign exchange market with a number of Swiss banks          .	-4.3241
At least six authorities worldwide – the European Commission , Finma , the Swiss Competition Authority Weko , the FCA , the US Ministry of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently dealing with accusations that bankers should have agreed on monetary transactions .	-3.5270
HSBC , Citigroup , JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also initiated internal investigations or received information requests from authorities , said with the situation familiar people .	-5.8628
Banks combine instant messages and emails from several years in search of cases of misconduct .	-2.8386
The news about these investigations has brought traders into turmoil in an area that has been one of the most profitable trading units of investment banks in recent years , but this year was under pressure because low volatility in currencies limits the opportunities for speculator  .	-7.2115
Some bankers have tried to play down the affair and said that it is almost impossible to manipulate the extended and highly liquid foreign exchange market , but leading traders believe that this is not necessarily true .	-3.1556
A leading trader noted that , despite the enormous daily volume in foreign exchange trading , the fragmentation of liquidity between the different trading platforms and the increasing use of own internal platforms by banks leads to “ influence the market with very low ticket prices . ”	-4.0815
The message came out on the same day when Credit Suisse announced that she terminated a dealer of her London Exchange Traded Funds office this week after he caused a loss of just $ 6 million at the end of last year .	-3.4237

Post Hardly Empty Sundays	-2.3072
" Many citizens will not yet have noticed that the red points for Sunday empty are still on various letter boxes of the core city and the districts , but read the small printed on the yellow containers of Post AG , you will find quickly that the empty on Sundays and holidays is no longer taking place " , the FDP will share .	-5.0193
A request from the FDP has confirmed that .	-2.1953
On Sundays and holidays , only before the postal building in Ernst-Ludwig-Stra<unk>e 36 and Jakob-Müller-Stra<unk>e 1 in Hüttenfeld are emptied .	-3.5721

With the hard and placed surcharges , Gönninger did extremely difficult .	-5.5234
Repeatedly , they missed the passports and attacks played by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz cleanly over the net center and were not at the block defense .	-3.7594
Two high first sentences expressed clearly the superiority of the cities of joy in all concerns .	-3.4530
In the face of this crushing and playing performance , the third sentence was won somewhat lax and lustless to the 3 : 0 end ( 25 : 13 , 25 : 14 , 25 : 22 ) .	-4.2303

This ecological aspect explained Friederike Tribukait from the Nature Protection Department of the Freiburg Government following the welcome by Tilman Bollacher , who had taken over the auspices and wanted the action to be a good success .	-4.3050
According to Tribukait , the tourist objective of the far-sightedness covers the goal of obtaining the highly grown old Allmendweidfeld with its specific protected habitat types by opening and connecting to the existing will .	-7.3719
Certain species such as rare butterflies and grass crops cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest areas .	-2.6197
You need these free connections to maintain art              	-5.3954
Tribukait said she did not want to fail to break a lance for the planned biosphere area .	-8.5322
In this planning , the current measure is not just seamless .	-2.7764
A biosphere area also provides the opportunity to sustainable economic and environmental development on the basis of internationally recognised Unesco status , thereby continuously complementing the future achievements with the life project and the previous care days .	-6.9424
After these different speeches , Christoph Wehle and Life Project Manager Cornelia Bischoff shared the helpers in groups .	-2.9004
The larger trees had already been beaten in advance , and the forestry trafficker may have been ready for access i ma .	-4.9281

Salem : Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical Call Forum	-1.9874
The next Ecumenical Conversation Forum on Monday , 21 October , in the New Museum of the Castle , is about the topic " Zur Hölle mit der Hölle - Theological considerations on today 's handling of the last things " .	-4.2064
Referentin is Professor Johanna Rahner .	-1.5216
The Ecumenical Conversation Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Evangelical Church Communities of Salem , the Salem Castle and the Cultural Office of Lake Constance .	-5.2071
Johanna Rahner wants to tackle the question in the forum of how today people classify the ' last things ' after death .	-5.2120
If the people in recent centuries had known too much about this , placing too much on the pictures of heaven and hell , " which still characterize our ideas " , the contemporary prophetic lesson is characterized by the hopes of completion rather than a certain obstacle or even linguisticity .	-5.4475
" The greater hope has been driven by religious critique by Christians , " says the speaker .	-2.8031
She has supplied us with so many questionmarks that the exclamation marks seem to have come down to us " .	-3.6237
Johanna Rahner continues to say : ' But the crucial challenge remains the anger of death ' .	-2.3881
This is the question of that longing ' which dreams that at the end everything may be good ' .	-3.6365
Johanna Rahner , born in Baden-Baden in 1962 , studied Catholic Theology and Biology at the Albert-Ludwigs-University of Freiburg from    19   to     1    1 y 1       1    	-6.2775

Among the participants , particularly on the short distance of more than 15 kilometres and 300 metres of altitude , also numerous everyone who wanted to exercise their hobby in a competitive atmosphere .	-4.4120
Two junior drivers of the German top class were also launched in this competition : Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came with the recommendation good placements at the German Championships .	-3.4307
These two could expect themselves from the field .	-3.0130
As in the previous year , Felix Bader could save a small time lead up to the target and defended his title as a total winner of the short distance .	-3.5562
Two were able to place Pascal Treubel again .	-3.1375
At the ladies it was Theresa Duelli from the team nightmare , which created it at the top of the winning staircases .	-3.7796
In place two and three came Anne Adel from Lake Illmensee and Leonie drivers of Owingen .	-5.2231
A pleasant development is the increasing number of drivers living or working in the community .	-2.4964
Not only with regard to performance was the whole range of athletes .	-2.7849
The age structure also ranged from ten years to the youngest up to 70 years with the oldest starters                      	-6.4045
In the main race this year more absolute top athletes were at start .	-3.1087
Four drivers were able to depart from the regional top riders .	-6.7132
Including Philipp Pangerl , a mountain bike semi-professional professional from the Black-Tusk Racing team .	-2.8443
Pangerl , together with a team colleague , was already two times the World Championship in the 12-hour driving r .	-3.9684
This year he became European Champions in this special discipline .	-2.2649

After 45 kilometres and 900 metres of altitude , there was a wimper stroke final in the destination before the three-lake hall .	-3.9294
Pangerl rasted as the first on the target line .	-2.1765

Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical assistance to remote villages	-6.0206

Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 of the CNN Heroes of 2013 .	-4.8594
You can vote for him or one of the other heroes in the top 10 to select him to the CNN Hero of the Year .	-2.8383
The winner receives $ 250,000 to continue his exceptional work .	-8.8112
For 21 years , George ’ s wave saw how his sick father always lost consciousness and traveled to hospitals that did not have the means to help him .	-3.6821
Jamef Bwelle was injured in 1981 at a car accident near Yaoundé , the capital of Cameroon .	-2.2657
First , he had only a broken arm , but then an inflammation that expanded to his brain and caused a hematoma there that should affect him for the rest of his life .	-3.8179
“ There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon , ” said George ’ s wave .	-2.5072
We would have put it out of Cameroon if we had had the money .	-2.1703
Instead , Bwelle spent years with accompanying his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer .	-7.1955
“ It is not simple , ” comments on Bwelle .	-4.9069
You can leave the house at five o 'clock in the morning and race to the hospital to be the first , and yet it is not the first .	-3.5602
There are many patients .	-1.1621
Some people even die because they have to wait .	-1.7819
The situation has hardly changed since Bwelle ’ s father died in 2002 .	-2.1258
In Cameroon there is only one doctor for 5,000 people , the World Health Organization .	-2.4923
In contrast , the relationship in the United States is a doctor for 413 people .	-2.7433
But even if there were a doctor for them , most Cameroons could not afford to visit .	-2.4694
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and almost three-quarters of health expenditure in the country are private .	-4.5770
“ The only problem they have is poverty , ” says Bwelle .	-1.5296
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life .	-1.2505
His father and so many of his compatriots suffered from seeing in Bwelle the decision to take something against                   	-5.0279
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team carried out 700 free operations last year .	-2.4500
He himself became a doctor and works as vascular surgeon in the Central Hospital in Yaoundé .	-3.9817
In addition , he founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME , which travels to rural areas at weekends and offers free medical c care      i                                  	-9.7324
Since 2008 , he and his volunteer group have helped almost 32,000 people .                 	-5.5148
Nearly every Friday he and up to 30 people force themselves into small buses and drive with the lacked medical equipment on the roof over unfortified terrain to the villages that need help .	-4.0737
Not always everything runs smoothly .	-4.6871
They already had to push the vehicles through rivers and sludges .	-5.9127
But when they arrive , they will receive like heroes : a festival , singing and dance and the best accommodation that the place has to offer .	-4.6152
In these villages , free medical care is really a reason for celebrating and bursting – with its wide smile and its limitless energy – is happy to be at the happy celebration .	-4.4280
The next morning the team begins with the investigation of hundreds of patients .	-2.3329
“ Per journey we treat 500 people ” , says Bwelle .	-2.5928
They come from a range of 60 kilometres around the village – and on foot .	-2.8316
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas .	-2.1105
Many people are treated because of malaria , tuberculosis , malnutrition , diabetes , parasites and sexually transmitted diseases              	-3.8438
Others receive crutches , donated glasses or free birth certificates – a document required for school but simply cannot afford many poor families .	-2.9587
In the evening , the team executes simple operations with local stunning .	-2.3402
The operations usually take place in a school , the town hall or an apartment ; after the intervention the patients are appearing and go into the recreational area to make space for the next .	-3.9877
The lighting for the OP and the disinfection equipment is fed from the generator of the group and so work the twave and its volunteers to the early hours of the morning on Sunday .	-4.0930
It is an exciting pensum , but village musicians usually help keep the team motivated .	-2.4966
“ They drum all night so that we can stay wake and continue our work , ” says Bwelle .	-3.0314
On Sunday the team then returns to the city , tired but proud of the work done .	-2.5884
The group – a mixture of Cameroon ’ s doctors and foreign medical students – has carried out 700 free operations last year and knows that , with its work , it has a huge difference for the peo        whom it helps .	-4.1519
A man explained that the free operation of a break he had received now enabled him to work again   .	-10.0636
“ This changes the future of my family , ” the man said .	-2.0944
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital , Bwelle works in private clinics in Yaoundé at night .	-3.1766
With this second job he finances 60 % of his non-profit activity , says Bwelle ; the rest comes from private donations .	-4.4326
“ I really do not know when he sleeps , ” says Katie O 'Malley , who studied at the Drexel University in Philadelphia Medicine in the second year and works voluntarily in Bwelles Group .	-3.3621
It is always either in the hospital or trying to organise money so that it can go to these campaigns .	-3.1895
For medical and health care students such as O 'Malley , who come from the United States and Europe , this is an opportunity to gain practical experience that they would never get at home .	-3.2643
“ We can be in operations where we help to decline blood or keep the instruments for Dr. Bwelle , ” explains O 'Malley .	-3.5725
That would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year .	-2.0300
The students usually pay their journey to Cameroon themselves and provide frequently donated sanitation material .	-3.1621
However , if they are in Yaoundé , Bwelle takes over accommodation , transport and guidance .	-3.2836
“ He is without doubt a hero , ” says O 'Malley .	-2.2686
He dedicates his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroon people knows no limits .	-2.5967
The almost continuous work is not a burden for the twelve .	-4.0201
Others to help a more happy life , thus fulfilling a promise that he has given his father , gives him great pleasure .	-4.0287
“ I am so happy when I do this work , ” says Bwelle .	-2.2806
And I think of my father .	-1.2051
I hope he sees what I do .	-1.2094
I do it to bring people back to laugh and to relieve pain .	-2.8312

Excellently Mastered the Battle	-2.4288
The role of the Santiago , the old man in Hemingway 's Novelle " The Old Man and the Sea " , is cut Horst Janson on the body .	-3.0026
Janson is himself an old hare in his metier , actress .	-2.5246
The old man Santiago cannot do anything when fishing .	-3.2899
So the two simply complement themselves great .	-2.5019
It is almost believed that the wrinkles can be seen in the neck of the old man , the fishing boy Manolo speaks .	-3.9778
If Santiago is tired of life bowed on the chair , that is real at Janson .	-3.0076
In addition , the role of the old fishermen is through and through a character role that Janson excellently masters .	-3.0141
Hemingway told the story of a fighter , a courageous man who does not give up and ultimately wins the fight against fish through his knowledge and also his will .	-3.4955
Janson is on the stage in wide routes as a single presenter      .	-4.4500
He manages to focus the attention of the audience so that his monologists are not boring a moment       .      Th   .	-9.2960
His efforts to finally draw fish to the surface of water are so real that the viewers forget that the sea consists of only blue-lit water bottles .	-3.2264
Director Jens Hasselmann lets the old man act in the boat in front of the fishing village .	-2.4900
In the course of the performance , he sets the active scene in each case : the cabin of Santiago , the bar of the singer Marie-Luise Gunst , who , with her songs and her magnificent voice , sings the feeling of Cuba '          .        T    '	-7.1720

Tourism : Descending to the Romans	-1.4393
At about 120 meters length , a wastewater channel from the Roman era is received below Cologne .	-3.8900
Those who visit Cologne do not come over at the Cathedral .	-3.3886
Approximately 157 meters the two towers raise the sky and make it the second highest church building in Europe .	-3.5444
But only a few visitors who are amazed by the two filigrant church towers realize that there is also a lot to discover under the Cathedral .	-4.0572
Rainer Schulze is an expert in Cologne underworld .	-2.1318
Meeting point for its guided tours is the service centre of Cologne tourism directly at the Cathedral .	-2.7340
The tour begins quite unspectacular : " We start in the underground garage " , says Schulze .	-2.7627
In the 1970s , the city fathers wanted an auto-right city , and therefore the remains of the old city walls remained only that which was not too big .	-3.9196
Most users of the parking house are therefore passing through the Roman remains today and only      pass thei     car .	-8.1101
But whoever looks more precisely discovers an archaeological site separated by metal grid in the D2 parking deck .	-4.2600
There are about five metres high ruins from trade large stones .	-3.6113
" They are the remains of the Roman city wall built in the second half of the first century to Christ " , tells Schulze .	-2.7998
Before returning to natural light , Schulze leaves the participants at the upper parking level a look at a dark , 15 meters deep chess .	-4.2756
This is the well of the old cathedral , which , unfortunately , is hardly perceived           	-4.1907
The next station of the tour is the Pretorium , and here the participants rise down down to the depth .	-3.2224
We are seeing the once most powerful man in the north of the Alps , the pretor of the CCAA .	-5.0919
What CCAA means wants to know a visitor .	-1.9998
" The abbreviation stands for " Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium " , which means in good German as much as " city of Roman law and city of Agrippinenser , founded under Emperor Claudius at the place of the Altar for the Imperial Cult " .	-3.8233
And the Pretorium is the former Stateholder Palace , the power centre of the Roman Empire on the Rhine .	-3.1614
From the exhibition there is a tunnel access to the Roman wastewater channel , which has been preserved here at about 120 meters .	-4.1440
" You can go along a piece along the so-called Cloaca Maxima if you want , " Schulze surprises the guests .	-3.7990
Schulze still has a surprise .	-1.6480
After bringing the key to the cash , it leads the group to a 16-meter deep , committable shaft .	-4.2800
" We are now in the mikwe , a ritual Jewish bath , " he explains .	-2.1448
The Jewish community built its bath deeply into the ground to come to the groundwater , which was essential for ritual washing .	-3.1019
To date , different levels of water have been readable in the lower end of the mikwe , whose origins go back to the eighth century .	-7.0584
The Mikwe will be part of an archaeological zone in the Town Hall Square for which the construction work shortly starts .	-3.2428
Until completion , however , some years will pass .	-3.1917
Leg almost hacked : Reconstruction of Rocker Proc .	-7.9822
A bloody attack in the Rockermilieu will be rolled up after more than four years      .    1            i	-7.1136
A process because of attempted death , dangerous body violation and damage to two 30 years has begun before the Frankfurt Court .	-6.9138
It is accompanied by strict security provisions .	-1.9049
The defendants silence themselves for the opening .	-4.1832
You should have been active in the rocker scene and heard about the bandidos then .	-3.1823
In June 2009 , the prosecutor argues that they should have stopped and taken three men in a car with unknown complices in Finowfurt .	-4.6168
All victims were difficult to injure , a man would have almost lost his leg .	-2.6127
The victims should have listened to the competing group of Hells Ange                  .	-6.9173
One should have been a high-level member of Berlin .	-2.0728
Apparently , there was a persecution hunt with several cars .	-2.9255
According to the charge , it was about review fights and a power demonstration .	-3.5222
The two defendants were freed in a first procedure in early 2012 .	-5.0524
A court speaker said at the time that it was not possible to prove that the men were actually involved in the bloody fead .	-3.4838
The perpetrators had worn masks and were not recognized .	-2.2568
The Federal Court of Justice raised the judgment for the revision of the public prosecutor and referred it to the Landgericht once again to th  n               n      e	-7.4050
One of the defendants is currently in open enforcement because of another delicacy .	-2.7683
It was above all about the reconstruction of the procedures in fact .	-3.5026
As a witness , the Commissioner identified at the time .	-8.3872
In the centre , mobile discussions of the defendants and other people who belonged to the police were in the centre .	-5.5004
It is difficult that Rocker is almost always complying with a law that is honorable to them - and not saying .	-8.3506
That also applies to the victims .	-1.5210
In the first process , only one of the victims packed out .	-3.7144
Prosecutor Stefan Golfier of the Public Prosecutor of Frankfurt ( Or ) said on demand that there have been new traces since the last procedure .	-3.4250
Eleven more days of negotiations are set for the process .	-5.0769
The Discharge Company	-2.8094
The night was long , the music loud and the mood well , but at some point it goes home .	-2.5441
Only : In the bells of people on the front-passenger and residence the hunger is noticeable .	-3.6023
Clearly , one cocktail or sect may be responsible for this .	-5.5372
What is closer than chilled to the next drive in order to get a small thing ?	-6.1320
I admit that I am happy to go to Fastfood Holes late night or early in the morning .	-3.7341
A few Pommes , a Cola , a castle - and then nix as from home and into bed !	-2.6866
But on the home path the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco courses are noticeable .	-3.0578
Because what has to be missed is that with constant regularity you throw your fast food bags from the car window ? !	-4.2168
The weekends in particular are thrown away paper bags on street edges and parking   .	-6.6357
" Why ? " , I wonder .	-1.4662
Are the people too doof to take the bags with home respective until the next garbage ?                 	-4.6505
It is not only the case that the paper product disguises the landscape .	-2.7990
Bags have also covered transport facilities such as guiding planks , triggering accidents .	-3.4217
However , about what is thinking of the " discharge company " , it probably does not even know what this word actually means .	-4.6206
When you are on the way to the evening , you know what a backbank can look like after celebrated nights : Klamotten , Bottles and other waste tower .	-5.2585
There would be some bags more or less nix , unlike the street , where nobody wants to trample on the meals of others .	-4.5428
I already see the day when the cities and communities are going to blood the room - and the fast food chains for their bags must require pan .	-4.7371
Obama ’ s Retreat in Health Policy	-1.7188
After heavy criticism , President Obama made a retreat yesterday in his frequently repeated , clear promise : “ If you like your health insurance , you can keep them .  ”                                          a  	-8.3462
After hundreds of thousands of their insurers have received a termination letter , the Republicans have received the president in recent days that he had deceived the American public .	-3.9356
Yesterday , Obama relativized his original promise .	-1.6947
“ The overwhelming majority of citizens who have working health insurance can keep them , ” he said in Boston .	-5.6970
In response to the numerous media reports on terminations , Obama called on Americans who have received such communications to look around on the free market following a new insurance  	-5.4206
Most citizens could receive better , more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or cheaper than predicted .	-2.8263
“ You come a better offer , ” he said .	-1.8925
The government described it as little surprising that the five percent of the population who have completed an insurance would have to look around after another rate , as their contract did not correspond to the new standards after the Affordable Care Act .	-4.2843
“ I would like to say quite directly to these Americans : they deserve better , ” said Sebelius at a hearing before the House of Representatives ’ Energy and Trade Committee in Washington .	-3.4298
Sebelius , who is responsible for implementing the Affordable Care Act , declared that the start of the online platform has been “ miserable ” since October .	-2.8282
“ I am as frustrated and angry as all others , ” she said .	-2.2204
I am determined to regain your trust .	-1.5152
This declaration of an appealed Sebelius to a behind her sitting adviser at yesterday 's hearing in the House of Representatives was included after a dispute with Republican Member Billy Long from Missouri , whether she should be obliged to participate in Obamacare .	-4.7953
After more than three hours of consultation , Long Sebelius repeatedly asked why the “ architect ” of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily renounce a state-funded insurance to complete a fare at HealthCare.gov , which she now wants to sell millions of Americans .	-4.0258
Government in Jerusalem does not confirm attack on Syria ’ s Air Force Base	-2.6671
An American government official who wanted to remain anonymous has claimed on Thursday to the American news transmitter CNN that Israeli fighters would have attacked an air force base in Syria ’ s Latakia one day earlier .	-3.7361
The objective was ' missiles and related equipment ' , the Israeli Government feared that they were for Lebanese Hezbollah , according to CNN .	-3.2131
Syrian and Lebanese media , as well as the Arab transmitter Al-Arabiya , had previously reported that the base in the port city of Latakia was shot on Thursday at the night of Wednesday , and the Israelis made responsible for it .	-4.2320
The Israeli television channel 2 showed satellite images of the Latakian base on which Russian defense missiles were seen from the type S-125 Newa and a battery of SA-3 missiles that Channel 2 had a range of 35 kilometres and can transport explosives up to 70 kilograms .	-4.3841
Uncertain the government in Jerusalem has officially not confirmed the attack .	-2.2690
However , the Reuters news agency quotes anonymous Israeli government officials in the words that it believes that Israel has carried out the attack , but it is not safe .	-3.8334
A spokesman of the Israeli Ministry of Defence said , at least , ' We do not comment on these reports ' .	-2.8649
The journalist Ron Ben-Yishai emphasized in the daily newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth that the Syrian regime already earlier , partly successful , tried to deliver ground air missiles to Hezbollah .	-3.3138
The Israeli Government had repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to provide Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons means the exceeding of a ' red line ' that would follow a military response .	-3.0139
John Kerry declares in an unprecedented acknowledgement that the US espionage was “ inappropriate ” .	-3.1057
John Kerry , with unexpected acknowledgement , suggested that the devastating attitude of the United States in relation to its monitoring programs by saying that spying was “ inappropriate ” in certain cases .	-4.6802
The Foreign Minister also admitted that he , together with Barack Obama , had the responsibility to switch to “ autopilot ” when the explosive revelations of the Whistleblower Edward Snowden were published on the NSA ’ s spy activities .	-4.1688
Through the information that has been signed , the US government has become a diplomatic storm of indignation from its allies .	-4.1371
At a speech transferred by video connection at the Open Government Conference in London , Kerry said : “ Without question , the President and I , as well as others in the government , have learned from some things that have expired by autopilot , simply because the ability to do what is still due to World War II and the difficult years of the Cold War and , of course , to 11 September . ”	-5.1641
Subsequently , he regarded as the first high-level member of the US Government that the US espionage had exceeded a border , but also emphasized that no rights had been abused       .	-4.2623
He said , “ In some cases this has gone too far . ”	-2.2730
The President is determined to clarify and therefore carries out a thorough investigation so that nobody has to feel that abuse is taking place here .	-3.2073
I assure you that the rights of innocent persons will not be affected in this process .	-2.0378
Kerry insisted , however , that the NSA was a force of good and many lives were saved by its monitoring processes .	-3.2053
He added : “ We are dealing with a new world in which people are willing to blow themselves into the air . ”	-2.7312
There is radical extremism in the world , which is seeking to kill people , blow into the air and attack governments .	-3.0251
So what if you were able to catch and stop it before it happens ?	-2.8781
We have actually prevented aircraft crashes , attacks on buildings and the murder of people because we have learned in advance of such plans .	-3.2415
Meanwhile , US legislators will travel to Europe to dispel concerns about the alleged American espionage and convince Europeans of the need to continue to work with the US in anti-terrorism efforts , as the Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs stated on Thursday .	-3.8462
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said that he spoke with representatives of the European Parliament and other people this week , and is concerned about their threats to no longer participate in anti-terrorist organisations because of the frustration of monitoring by the National Security Agency .	-3.8375
“ It is very important for the US ’ s national security interests that Europeans remain on board with regard to our joint efforts against terrorism , ” said Murphy , for the first time sitting in the Senate and as chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Relations and European Affairs , in an interview in Washington .	-4.0073
I also go to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism , regardless of their anger on the NSA programmes .	-5.8966
Media reports covering millions of telephone data in Europe have burdened relations with some US allies , although the head of the secret service this week declared that the reports were untrue and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by Nato allies and exchanged with the United States .	-3.9302
Other revelations quoted from documents passed on by Snowden that the NSA monitored the mobile phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of state worldwide .	-3.4180
The head of national intelligence services , James Clapper , defended the espionage of allies as necessary and declared that this was common on both sides .	-3.1102
In all the tumult , Murphy said that his authority prepared the journey of the Congress to take place this year , and hoped that the delegation will include members from both parties and chambe                  	-5.0051
The names of other participating Members should be published in the coming days .	-4.5224
He said that the exact route of travel is still being developed    .	-3.3169
While Murphy emphasized that the purpose of travelling was to improve relations , he also said that there would be some “ serious words .  ”                               	-6.9946
