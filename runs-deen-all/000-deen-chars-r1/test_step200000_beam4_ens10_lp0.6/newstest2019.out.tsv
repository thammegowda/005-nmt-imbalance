Online shopping and relocation to the daily purchase of small quantities of food in neighbourhood shops means that supermarkets must do more to move people to visit   .	-5.4693
Mike Coupe , the chief of Sainsbury 's , said that the sales outlets will look increasingly like commodities , as the supermarket chain tries to combat discounters such as Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food .	-6.0426
Sainsbury 's has placed Argos-Outlets in hundreds of businesses and has also introduced a number of habitats since both chains bought two years ago , which allegedly strengthened food sales and made acquisitions more profitable .	-3.4275
The former attempt by the supermarket to revise its beauty and pharmacy departments ended with a failure .	-2.2845
Sainsbury tested a joint venture with boats in the early 2000s , but it ended decisively , and revenues from the pharmacies could not be shared .	-3.1632
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury 's sold its 281 branch pharmacy business three years ago for 125 million pounds to Celesio , the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy Chain .	-2.8453

Rapper Kanye West changes his name in Ye .	-1.3443
He announced the change to Twitter on Saturday and wrote ' Officially known as Kanye West ' .	-2.4391
West , 41 , who has been the nickname Ye for some time , has chosen this name as a title for his eighth album , which was published in June .	-3.1078
The change comes before his appearance at Saturday Night Live , where he expected to present his new album Yandhi .	-2.9686
According to the organizer of the show , he occurs as a replacement for Ariana Grande , who has cancelled her performance for “ emotional reasons . ”	-3.4289
According to the West , this is not just an abbreviation of his current professional name , but he had previously stated that the word would be of religious importance to him .	-3.3978
“ Ye is probably the most frequently used word in the Bible and means You , ” West said early this year in an interview with the radio station Big Boy .	-2.5952

US Spending on Artificial Intelligence	-1.6360
While China is becoming more active for artificial intelligence , the US should double its research investment , says Kai-Fu Lee , Investor , and AI practitioners working for Google , Microsoft , and Apple .	-2.8131
These demands were created after US government relations made announcements to KI , even though the US lacks a formal KI strategy .	-3.2225
Meanwhile , China presented its plan last year : by 2030 it wants to be number 1 in the area of KI innovation .	-3.2459
“ Doubling expenditure on KI research would be a good start , given that all other countries are far behind the United States , and a breakthrough in KI research is brief , ” said Lee .	-4.0387
The doubling of financing could double the opportunities that the next achievement of artificial intelligence in the United States said Lee CNBC in an interview this week .	-5.0005
Lee , whose book “ AI Superpowers : China , Silicon Valley and the New World Order ( KI Superpowers : China , Silicon Valley and the New World Order ) ” was released this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt , CEO is invested by Sinovation Ventures , a company that has invested in one of the most famous Chinese companies , Face + + .	-3.4997
In the 1980s , he worked at the Carnegie Mellon University at an AI system that defeated the high-level American Othello player , later he was a leader at Microsoft Research and President of the Chinese subsidiary of Google .	-4.2514
Lee has recognized the former US government technology competitions , such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( US Defense Research Authority ) and asked when the next visionaries would take place .	-3.1385
“ Researchers in the US often have to work very hard to maintain government subsidies , ” said Lee .	-2.6252
“ Not China is responsible for the flow of high-level scientists , but companies , ” noticed Lee .  ”	-5.8330
Facebook , Google and other technology companies have set coryphaes of universities in recent years to work on KI .	-2.7390
Lee said that a changed immigration policy could also help the US strengthen its AI efforts .	-2.5208
“ I think Green Cards should be automatically offered doctoral doctorals in KI , ” he said .	-2.7352

Macedonia votes in a referendum about whether the name of the country should be changed .	-2.2724
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether their name should be changed in ' Republic of Northern Macedonia ' , a step that would solve a decades-long dispute with Greece , which had blocked its accession offers for the European Union and NATO  	-6.1427
Greece , which has a province called Macedonia , insists that the name of its northern neighbour is a territorial right to the Greek territory , and has inserted a veto against the entry of the country into NATO and the EU .	-3.3656
The two governments concluded an agreement based on the proposed new name , but nationalist opponents argued that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority population of Macedonia .	-2.9372
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he will not vote in the referendum , and , given a boycott campaign , there are doubts about whether the outcome will create the 50 % hurdle , which is a prerequisite for the validity of the referendum .	-5.9934
The question on the paper on the referendum was : ' Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with the adoption of the agreement with Greece ? '	-2.5598
Supporters of the name change , including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev , argue that it is worth the price to continue the inclusion in institutions such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia , one of the countries that will emerge from the collapse of Yugoslavia .	-3.6209
“ I have come today to vote on the future of the country , which is a decision for young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the roof of the European Union , because this means a life in more security for us all , ” said Olivera Georgijevska , 79 , in Skopje .	-3.6258
Although not legally binding , enough Members have said that they will abide by the outcome of the vote so that it will be crucial .	-3.1602
A two-thirds majority in Parliament is required for the name change .	-2.3237
The Landtagslausschuss said at 13 a.m. that there were no reports on irregularities .	-3.2960
But turnout was only 16 % – in the last 2016 parliamentary elections , the value was 34 % at the same time , and 66 % of the registered electorate voted .	-6.8177
“ I have gone because of my children – our place is in Europe , ” said Gjose Tanevski , 62 , a voter in the capital Skopje .  ”	-8.5454
Macedonia ’ s Prime Minister Zoran Zaev , his wife Zorica , and his son Dushko have voted for the referendum in Macedonia on the change to the country ’ s name , which would pave him the way for accession to NATO and the European Union in Strumica , Macedonia on 30 September 2018 .	-3.4043
Before Parliament in Skopje , Vladimir Kavardarkov , 54 , prepared a small stage and put chairs in front of the tents set by those who will boycott the referendum .	-3.0783
" We are in favour of NATO and the EU , but we want to participate with the heads upwards , not through the service door , " said Kavadarkov .	-2.8245
“ We live in a poor country , but we also have our dignity .	-1.6632
If you do not want to include us as Macedonia , we can turn others like China and Russia to join us in Euro-Asian integration . ”	-2.7481
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will bring urgently needed investment to Macedonia , a country with a unemployment rate of more than 20 % .	-2.4354
“ I believe that a large majority will vote in favour , because more than 80 % of our citizens are for the EU and NATO , ” explained Zaev following his vote ’ s     tax .	-3.6521
According to him , the result “ yes ” would be a “ strengthening our future . ”	-2.4148
Last Monday , the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research published the results of a survey : between 30 and 43 % of voters would therefore participate in the vote – less than necessary .	-2.8272
Another survey carried out by Macedonia ’ s Telma TV found that 57 % of the respondents will vote on Sunday .	-3.0147
Of those who wanted to participate , 70 % said that they were voting “ yes . ”	-3.3239
The referendum will only be accepted if the turnout is over 50 % .	-2.6180
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since its takeover in May last year .	-2.5649
View : Sergio Agüero of Manchester City overcomes the entire Brighton defense on the way to the gate .	-2.5877
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defended Brighton ’ s Manchester City-2-0 victory on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester , England .	-2.8524
Aguero let his hit in the 65th minute look incredibly easy                	-5.5903
At the beginning of the game sequence the Argentine stormer received a passport in the medium field .	-5.4675
He tricks three defenders of Brighton to play free .	-2.7378
Then Agüero was surrounded by three green shirts .	-2.3194
He defended a defender before he ran several players on the edge of the Brighton criminal space .	-3.2458
Then he made a passport to the left and gave to Sterling .	-2.8107
The English stormer used his first contact to return the ball to Agüero , who then shot with the right – past Brighton-Torwart Mathew Ryan into the right side of the gate          . T  '    A  '           'i '	-8.7679
“ Aguero has foot problems , ” said City Manager Pep Guardiola the reporters .	-2.2604
" We spoke about this ; he played 55 , 60 minutes .	-2.3263
That has happened .	-1.2717
Fortunately , he shot a gateway at the moment . ”	-2.1129
However , it was Sterling , who brought the Sky Blues to the Premier-League-Duell initially :	-3.3581

As the national players were excluded from the Playoff competition , there was not much reason to force another start .	-7.0296
But the hard combated joker hopes to climb the hill on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies , but only if there are still playoff implications for the rockies that have an edge of a game before the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West .	-3.8115
The rockies secured themselves with a 5 : 2 victory over the nationals on Friday evening at least one space , but the title profit in the first league is still not safe .	-3.7997
" Although we play for free , we can at least testify ourselves because we know that the atmosphere here in Denver with the people and the other team will probably be the best thing to offer this year .	-5.2239
Why should I not want to effort there ? '	-2.5953
The nationals have not yet announced a start for Sunday , but are allegedly inclined to throw Scherzer in such a situation .	-2.9899

In the communication for the East Labour in Nottingham meeting on Friday it says : ' We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive ' .	-2.7361
Most of my time in the eight years as a local Member of Labour were the GC meetings on Friday evening .	-4.6345
Unfortunately , today it is not the tone of many meetings , and the promise of a ' more friendly , gentler ' policy is long forgotten if it has ever begun .	-4.8493
It has become increasingly clear that different views in the Labour Party are not tolerated , and every opinion will be judged whether it is acceptable to the party leadership .	-3.2105
This began shortly after Jeremy ’ s takeover , because the colleagues with whom I had previously thought that I would have a similar political attitude expected me to take a turn and take positions with which I would never have agreed , whether with regard to national security or the internal market .	-4.7672
Whenever I am publicly expressing myself – and it does not matter what I say – a tirade of abuse in the social media that calls for selection denounces the centre ’ s policy and tells me that I should not be in the Labour Party .	-6.5209
This experience has not only been made .	-2.2388
I really know that more luck than some of my colleagues , because the comments that are aimed at me , tend to be political .	-4.8706
I appreciate the professionalism and determination of my colleagues , who are subjected to a tide of sexist or racist abuse every day , but never horrify .	-3.5514
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the scale of abuse has normalized .	-2.2044
Last week , Jeremy Corbyn claimed that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance .	-1.9706
The reality is that we are no longer the broad church and with any motion of censure or amendment of the selection rules the party will become smaller .	-3.0790
I have received a lot of advice over the last two years to collect my neck , not to be so vocal , and then I would be “ in order . ”	-3.5802
But for this reason I have not come into politics .	-2.1773
32 years ago I joined myself as a student , because of the neglect of the Thatcher Government , Labour , which had literally collapsed my classroom , and as a result I tried to use myself for better public services for those who need them most , no matter whether as a council or minister .	-4.8023
I have never hidden my political views , not even in the last choice .	-4.3927
With regard to my political positions , no one in Nottingham East should have been confused in any way , and the same applies to areas where I do not agree with the current leadership .	-3.0295

Ayr 38 - 17 Melroses : Ayr Unbeaten at the Top	-8.7620
Two late Tries may have distorted the final result , but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win in this wonderfully entertaining Tennent 's Premiership Match of the day .	-2.8701
They now cite the table as the only unbeaten of the ten teams .	-2.6209
In the end , it was defended by the host , but also by the fact that opportunities were better used .	-12.7842
" We were tested so far by our games and we are still unbeaten , so I must be happy " , he said .	-5.0721
Robyn Christie of Melrose said : “ Thanks to Ayr , they have better used their chances . ”	-2.2029
Grant Anderson ’ s attempt in the 14th minute , transformed by Frazier Climo , brought Ayr forward , but a yellow card for Scotland ’ s captain Rory Hughes , which was given for the game of Warriors , allowed melrose to speak numbers , and Jason Baggot to gather an untransformed attempt .	-3.9031
Climo stretched the leadership of Ayr with a punishment before he reached a match directly to the half-time and then made a solo test with which he got into the 17 : 5 break guided for Ayr .                                	-8.6895
Melrose began , however , the second half-time well and Patrick Anderson 's attempt , transformed by Baggot , reduced the backward to five points .	-4.4553
Then there was a longer interruption because of the serious injury of Ruaridh Knott , who left the playing field on a wear . After the restart , Ayr expanded the leadership when a Try was transformed by Stafford McDowall-von Climo .	-4.8220
Ayr 's current captain Blair Macpherson then got the yellow card , and again Melrose paid the additional man with an unconverted Bruce Colvine attempt to curse the violent pressure .	-3.5751
However , the home side came back , and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for a tackling without a ball of Climo from the penalty limit , MacPherson made a touchdown , the pretentious Ayr in the back .	-4.2680

Throughout the included Bolivia , the memory of a coast lost to Chile in a bloody conflict of resources in the 19th century is still alive - as well as the longing to return to the Pacific .	-4.1803
These hopes may be at their highest point for decades , as Bolivia has been waiting for a judgment of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of delibera             	-4.5760
" Bolivia has the dynamics , the spirit of unity and the serenity and , of course , expects the result with a positive view , " said Roberto Calzadilla , a Bolivian diplomat .	-3.1377

“ We are shortly facing access to the Pacific Ocean , ” he praised at the end of August .	-2.7451
However , some analysts consider it unlikely that the Court of Justice will decide in favour of Bolivia and believe that even a positive decision will not bring about any change   to B    .	-5.3490
The Dutch UN institution has no power to give Chilean territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks .	-2.8872
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice came into being only six months after hearing the final arguments shows that the case was ' not complicated ' , said Paz Zárate , a Chilean expert in international law .	-5.0119
And far from driving Bolivia ’ s cause , the last four years could have done so .	-3.1052

He called on the United States to respect the promises made during a summit of the two rival leaders in Singapore .	-2.7386
His statements come at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to resume the diplomatic discussions on nuclear disarmament three months after the meeting with the North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un in Singapor                                                    	-7.8989

Other over-dimensional accessories were water melons with jewelry , a magic record and even an anana , but they are not intended to keep the head warm .	-3.5914
Thom Browne showed a number of bizarre masks - and just in time for Halloween .	-2.0878
Many of the colourful masks had sewn lips and rather resembled Hannibal Lecter as Haute Couture .	-2.8241
A creation was similar to the diving equipment with snorkel and glasses , while another looked like a melted ice cup .	-2.7771
And if you have this incredible fashion trend , you have luck .	-2.0317
Stylish observers predict that the huge cabins could go their way to the main roads nearby .	-3.2369
The over-dimensional cabins have glued to the heels of " La Bomba " , the straw hat with a 60 cm wide edge that is seen at each Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski .	-4.5302
The cult label behind the highly unpractical hat sprayed over Social Media sent another great creation to the running pocket - a beach bag that was almost as large as the bathing model it carried .	-4.3507
The orange bastion pocket , occupied with Raffia-Saum and with a white leather grip , was the outstanding piece in Jacquemus ' La Riviera SS19 collection at the Paris Fashion Week .	-4.9458
The famous stylist Luke Armitage said FEMAIL : " I expect to see large huts and beach bags in the main streets next summer .	-23.6989
John Edward : Language knowledge that is essential for global citizens	-2.2832
Independent schools in Scotland have a record of success in academic top quality , which continued in 2018 with outstanding results of testing , and also individual and group successes in sport , art , music and other Community companies .	-4.7973
With over 30,000 students throughout Scotland , these schools , represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools ( SCIS ) , are seeking to offer their students and parents the best service level .	-3.0696
Independent schools are aimed at preparing students – for further training , including for universities , for their desired professional career and for their role as world citizens .	-3.4898
In the education sector , we have the opportunity to develop and implement a tailor-made school curriculum , and we note that modern languages in schools are still popular and desired .	-3.3860
Nelson Mandela once said this : “ If you speak to a person in the language he understands , you will reach his mind . ”	-2.9636
When you speak to him in his own language , he goes to heart . ”	-2.6833
This illustrates impressively that we cannot just rely on the English language if we want to build relations and confidence with people from other countries .	-2.8006
The audit results of this year show that languages at the top of the tables with the highest existing rates are in independent schools .	-2.9816
68 % of the students who have studied foreign languages have reached the so-called “ Higher grade A ” higher class A  .	-3.0966
The data collected by the 74 membership schools of the SCIS showed that 72 % of the students reached a “ Higher Grade A ” in Mandarin , while among the students who learned German , French and Spanish , 72 , 69 and 63 reached Note A .	-3.9991
This shows that independent schools in Scotland will promote foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future .	-3.8518
Language subjects have the same rank as MINT ( mathematics , information technology , science and technology ) in the curriculum of independent schools and elsewhere .	-3.1261
A survey from the British Commission for Employment and Qualifications from 2014 showed that 17 % of the reasons why employers had difficulties in occupying free jobs are attributable to a lack of language skills .	-3.4254
So language skills are becoming increasingly necessary to prepare young people for their professional future .	-4.6925
Faced with more prospective employment opportunities that require languages , these skills are essential in a globalised world .	-3.0269
Regardless of the career that someone chooses when he has learned a second language , he has a real advantage in the future with a lifelong ability like this .       i .	-5.4471
The possibility of communicating directly with people from abroad will automatically precede a multilingual person to competitors .	-3.0650
According to a YouGov survey with more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013 , 75 % were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to lead a discussion , and French is the only language spoken with a double-digit percentage , namely 15 % .	-3.4204
That is why current investment in language lessons is important for children today .	-2.6474
When children learn to speak several languages – especially those of developing countries – they have better opportunities later to find meaningful employment on the labour market .	-2.9314
Schools in Scotland are different in terms of their language supply .	-2.6657
Some schools focus on the classic modern languages , while other languages will be informed that are most important for Britain in terms of 2020 , such as Mandarin or Japanes .	-6.2132
Whatever your child interests , it will always be a series of languages in independent schools , with teachers specialized in this area .	-2.7005
Independent schools in Scotland want to provide a learning environment that prepares children well , and they should get the necessary benefit for their success , whatever the future may bring .	-3.9239
In the global business world of the present , languages remain indisputably important for the future of the country , and that must also be reflected in education .                	-4.6604
Indeed , modern languages should really be considered “ international communication capabilities . ”	-4.7976
Independent schools will continue to offer young people in Scotland this selection , diversity and top quality .	-2.1914

LeBron ’ s Debut Sunday in San Diego	-2.4967
Soon it 's so far and the fans can fire LeBron James at his first game for the Los Angeles Lakers .	-2.7723
Lakers-Trainer Luke Walton announced that James will play against Denver Nuggets in the opening game of the previous season on Sunday in San Diego .	-4.2865
But how many minutes it will spend on the place is not yet decided .	-2.5154
Walton said on the official website of the Lakers : " It will be more than one and less than 48 "     .	-2.7708
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell twittered that James will probably play limited minutes .	-1.9744
After the training at the beginning of this week , James was asked for his plans for the six pre-season games of the Lakers           	-4.6276

Trump ’ s Rally in West Virginia , YouTube Channel	-1.3592
President Donald Trump begins tonight in Wheeling , West Virginia , with a flood of election campaign events  .                             	-7.5620
It is the first of five planned election events next week , and on his tour Trump also visits the Republican-friendly states of Tennessee and Mississippi .	-3.3663
While the confirmation of his candidate for the vacant place in the Supreme Court is still out , Trump must mobilize its electorate for the forthcoming intermediate elections , otherwise it is feared that the Republicans will lose the majority in Congress when elected in November .	-4.2637
When is Trump ’ s West Virginia Rally this evening and how can I view it online ?	-2.6146
Trump 's Rallye in Wheeling , West Virginia , is planned for 19 o 'clock .	-2.4435
You can follow Trump ’ s West Virginia Rallye online via live stream on YouTube .	-2.4336
Trump will certainly respond to the hearings taking place this week on accusations of sexual abuse against its candidates for the Supreme Court , Brett Kavanaugh , whose confirmation in office must be carried out by the Senate was postponed by at least one week until the end of the FBI investigations .	-4.4332
However , the main objective of these electoral events is to mobilize the Republicans , who face a crucial election in November .	-2.9769
According to Reuters , the aim of Trump ’ s campaign is to mobilize volunteers and supporters with the five election events next week to defend and expand the majority of Republicans in the Senate and House of Representatives .	-3.0544
“ The majority in Congress is first and foremost on the agenda of the President , which is why he visited as many states as possible just before the start of the turbulent election campaign season , ” shared a spokesman of the Trump campaign , who would not like to be called , Reuters .	-4.8458
According to the West Virginia MetroNews radio network , the election event that will take place this evening in the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw the attention of the Pittsburgh media t t t         i               .    	-7.0600
On Saturday , Trump West Virgina , the state he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016 , will visit for the second time this month .	-2.6816
Trump is trying to help the candidate of the Republicans for the Senate of West Virginia , Patrick Morrisey , who lags behind in the sur  .	-5.1162

Ryder Cup 2018 : The USA team is ready to fight to maintain hope for Sunday singles	-3.0772
After three one-sided encounters , the four games were likely to be exactly what the Ryder Cup needed on Saturday afternoon .	-2.9998
The swinging pendulum is a freely invented sports concept that players have internalized , especially in competitions like this .	-3.0052
So where would they say the dynamism now ?	-2.1684
“ They had a six-point advance and now there are four , so that is probably a bit of momentum , ” said Jordan Spieth when he withdrew for the day . ”	-3.8921
Europe is , of course , advantageous with 4 points , twelve others are still to be played .	-4.9234
Americans , as Spieth says , feel something wind in their sails and there was a lot of encouraging for them , not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas , who played throughout the day and have three out of four points each day .	-3.4569
Spieth was superior from the beginning and progressed with a good example .	-2.9877
These characteristics were louder when his round continued , he sent a crucial putt to reach a decisive decision in game 4 after he and Thomas reserved 2 points after 2 games .	-4.9918
His joy about the putt on the 15th hole , with which she won the game , was so thought that he still believed in the victory of the Americans 	-4.6060
" You really have to concentrate strongly and only worry about your own game , " said Spieth .	-2.9661
This is also what each of these players still remains .	-9.5480
18 holes to leave impression .	-1.2780
In the last two days , this Ryder Cup was undeniably Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood the only player with more points than Spieth and Thomas .	-3.2324
Europe ’ s strange but admirable couple plays error and simply makes everything right .	-2.6572
" Moliwood " was the only couple that did not achieve a bogey on Saturday afternoon , but they also avoid them on Saturday morning , Friday afternoon and Friday morning the back nine .	-3.6183
This course and the way in which its energy appears to flow and from this amount of view , makes it the favorites on Sunday and when the sun goes under Le Golf National , there would be no more popular player who seals a possible European victory than Fleetwood or Molinari .	-4.7400
Probably both at the same time on different holes .	-2.1455
Talking about a European victory would be too premature .	-2.1827
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short process with Sergio Garcia , who was winning with his partner Alex Noren in the morning .	-2.5108
With a Bogey and two doubles on the first nine groub of the Spanish and Swede into a hole from which they never got out again .	-3.8407
On Sunday there is no one who helps you from your hole .	-2.5125
Because of the interactions between couples , the advice given , the non-given advice and the way in which a strategy can change in hand , it is very fascinating to observe the fourballs and foursomes from the next proximity .	-3.9739
Europe has been better playing as a team and taking a clear advantage in the last day , but this foursome session has also shown that the team has doubted the desire for the fight , which some , especially Stateside , have doubted .	-4.8236
Europe leads 10-6 on Ryder Cup Final Day	-2.0776
Europe will use a solid advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after it emerged from four and four games on Saturday with a 10-6 leadership over the United States .	-3.0291
The inspired Duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the group with two victories about a fighting Tiger Woods to bring its previous balance sheet to four points in the Le Golf National .	-3.3517
The European team of Thomas Bjorn , who appeared for the preservation of the trophy that she lost in Hazeltine two years ago , dominated an American team with suspenders in the morning fourballs , and won the series with 3-1 .	-4.3705
The US offered more resistance in the four and won two games , but they could not dilute the deficit .	-2.4876
The team of Jim Furyk needs eight points from the 12 individual games of Sunday to keep the trophy .	-2.5457
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points as a result , while he and Molinari , called " Molliwood " after a sensational weekend , are just the second couple that wins four points from their first four games in the history of the Ryder Cup .	-3.4693
After having broken Woods and Patrick Reed into the fourballs , it was considered that they would beat a sobered wood and the American rookie Bryson Dechambeau by an even clearer 5 & 4 .	-6.2790
Woods , which took place on Saturday through two parties , occasionally showed brilliant actions , but he has now lost 19 of his 29 parties in four balls and fourers and seven around .	-5.7925
Justin Rose , rested for the morning fourballs , returned to his partner Henrik Stenson in the Foursomes and switched in a 2 & 1 defeat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – place one and three in the world .	-3.1808
However , on a pleasant , airy day southwest of Paris , Europe did not have it in its own way .	-2.4543
The triple winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the scale for the Americans on Saturday with two points .	-2.9442
They won a bold 2 : 1 victory against the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-pack and later returned to beat poulters and Rory McIlroy 4 : 3 in the fourerpack after they lost the first two holes .	-3.6369
Only twice in the Ryder Cup story a team returns from a four-point deficit to the singles , even though Holder Furyk 's page needs only one decision to keep the trophy .	-3.5052

North Korea says that there will by no means be unilateral disarmament without trust .	-2.1050
North Korea ’ s Foreign Minister said to the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions would deepen its distrust with the United States , and that the country would under no circumstances give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally i .       .                	-5.5315
Ri Yong Ho said that the annual General Assembly of the World Body took significant goodwill measures last year , such as the attitude of nuclear and missile tests , the reduction of nuclear testing and the obligation not to disseminate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology .	-4.0503
" There is no answer from the US , however , " he said .	-2.4503
“ Without any confidence in the United States , there will be no confidence in our national security , and in such circumstances there is no way to disarm ourselves unilaterally . ”	-3.0632
While Ri revived the well-known North Korean complaints about Washington ’ s resistance to a “ gradual ” approach to denuclearization , where North Korea would be rewarded with gradual steps , his statement seemed important in that it did not completely reject unilateral denuclearization , as Pyongyang did in the past .	-9.3390
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a first summit between an incumbent US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June , when Kim committed to working towards ' denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula ' , while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea 's security .	-3.5707
North Korea sought a formal end to the Korean War in 1950-53 , but the United States said that Pyongyang must give up his nuclear weapons first .	-2.8755
Washington has also opposed the demands for easing hard international sanctions against North Korea .	-2.3641
The US consists of " denuclearization-first " ( first denuclearization ) and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its purpose in a compelling way , and even reject the " explanation of the war end " , said Ri .	-3.5482
" The perception that sanctions can force us into the knees is a dream of people who are ignorant to us .	-4.4752
But the problem is that continued sanctions will exacerbate our mistrust . ”	-2.3452
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump , which the US President highlighted earlier this week at the United Nations .	-2.7290
Instead , the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the last five months and added : ' If the party were in this matter of denuclearization of South Korea and not the United States , the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula would not be in such a deadlock ' .	-4.3633
Nevertheless , the tone of Ri 's speech was dramatically different from last year when he reported to the U.N. ; the General Assembly , which took the US mainland with North Korea ’ s missiles , was inevitable after “ Mr. Evil President ” called Trump Kim a “ missile man ” on a suicide mission .	-4.2337
This year at the United Nations , Trump , who threatened last year to “ completely destroy ” North Korea , praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm , but he also said that much work had to be done , and sanctions must remain until North Korea destroyed denuclearization .	-3.5182
On Wednesday , Trump said that he did not have a timeframe for this and said : ' It does not matter whether it takes two years , three years or five months ' .	-3.2482
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken .	-1.8608
However , in the United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo , the United Nations Security Council said on Thursday that ' the enforcement of the Security Council sanctions must be vigorously and without defects until we achieve full , final and verified denuclearization ' .	-4.1971
Since 2006 , the Security Council has unanimously increased the sanctions against North Korea to prevent the funding of Pyongyang 's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes .	-5.5796
Pompeo met Ri on the edge of the UN General Assembly and then said he will travel to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit .	-2.6315
Pompeo has already visited North Korea this year three times , but his last journey was not goo  .	-4.6017
He left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made , and that only a few hours afterwards condemned North Korea to have made him “ similar demands . ”	-4.0551
North Korea promised this month at a meeting with Moon to dismantle a missile location and a nuclear complex when the United States takes ' appropriate measures ' .	-3.0718
He said that Kim told him that the ' appropriate measures ' he sought were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore , and steps towards normalizing relations with Washington .	-3.2911
Harvard students take part in the course to find enough peace .	-2.2413
With a new course this year at Harvard University , all students will get more sleep to fight against the growing Macho culture of the study of the caffeine-discovered nights .	-4.1144
A scientist has noticed that students at a worldwide leading university are often unusual when it comes to helping themselves , even when it comes to very simple mechanisms .	-3.5227
Charles Czeisler , professor of sleep medicine at the Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women 's Hospital , designed the course , which in his opinion is the first of his kind in the US .	-3.3473
He was inspired to start the course after he had held a talk about the impact of sleep shortages on learning .	-2.9352
At the end of the day a girl came to me and said : " Why is that only now , in my final year , told me ?	-3.5659
She said that you have never told someone of the importance of sleeping – which surprised me , ” he said to the telegraph .	-3.3505
The course offered this year for the first time , explains to students how good sleeping habits promote academic and sporting performance and improve their general well-being .	-9.5553
Paul Barreira , Professor of Psychiatry at the Harvard Medical School and Managing Director of the University 's Health Service , said that the University had decided to introduce the course after she found that students had sleeped extremely little during the week .	-3.6449
The 1-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks .	-1.9070
In a section there is an image of a downhill in which students click on coffee cups , curtains , trainers and books to be informed about the impact of caffeine and light and about how sporting performance affects sleep shortages and the importance of a sleeping time routine .	-4.1764
Another section explains to participants how long-term sleeping can increase the risk of heart attack , stroke , depression and cancer .	-2.9731
A card of the campus with interactive symbols encourages participants to think about their daily lives .	-2.4854
We know that it will not change the behaviour of students immediately .	-2.0409
" But we believe that they have a right to it - just as you have a right to know the health impact of the decision to smoke cigarettes , " added Prof. Czeisler .	-2.8218
The culture of pride exists a “ night to go through ” , he said and added that modern technology and the increasing pressure on students and sleepers makes a growing problem .	-3.7448
Having sufficient sleep of good quality should be the " secret weapon " of a student to combat stress , exhaustion and fear , he said - even to increase , as sleeping train enables the brain to starve and makes it constantly hungry .	-4.3598
Raymond So , a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology , helped Professor Czeisler design the course after visiting one of his classes last year in his first year in Harvard .	-2.9484
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to push him on a campus-wide course .	-2.6855
The next step , he hopes , is to call on all docotoral organisations to complete a similar study programme before entering the Competition University .	-3.3746
Prof. Czeisler recommended students to set an alarm when they go into bed and when they should wake up , and to be aware of the harmful effects of the " blue light " that is broadcast by electronic screens and LED lighting , which can bring their circadian rhythm out of the cycle , which leads to problems when sleeping .	-4.4031
Livingston 1-0 Rangers : Mengas Goal Earth Gerrard ’ s Men	-2.2061
Further external problems of the Rangers : After a match by Dolly Menga , Livingston came to the 1-to-0 defeat for the disagreed team of Steven Gerrard .	-3.8849
The Ibrox team wanted to record its first victory since the 4 : 1 triumph in St. Johnstone in February , but the team of Gary Holt added Gerrard ’ s second defeat in 18 games as a trainer who left his team back at eight points behind the disappointed Ladbroke ’ s Premiership Chief Hearts .	-4.4775
Menga landed seven minutes before the mid-term a match and an uninspirational Rangers statement did not look like they can bring about a compen    .                              i     	-7.7405
While the Rangers fall back to the sixth place , Livingston climb on rank three and lie only because of the difference behind Hibernian .	-3.3121
New difficulties for the Rangers are distinguished because at the Calum Spence line judge , a head wound had to be supplied after hitting the subject of a line – apparently thrown from the sector of foreign fans .	-5.6521
Gerrard made eight changes to the page that passed to Ayr and broke directly into the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup .	-3.5797
On the other hand , the same Livi Elf , which declined a point last week 's Hearts , and he should have been enthusiastic about how his well-trained team left the opponents at no time space for actions                     	-6.7700
The Rangers dominated ball ownership , but Livingston had better implemented opportunities   .	-5.2093
You should have met after just two minutes when Menga ’ s first depositor Scott Pittman sent to Allan McGregors Gate , but the middle field player passed his great change on the gate .	-3.9624
Keaghan Jacobs went to Captain Craig Halkett , but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only shoot far towards behind posts .	-3.9329
Rangers took over control , but there seemed to be more hope than confidence in their own game , in the last third .	-2.8024
Alfredo Morelos believed that after the first quarter of an hour he deserved an eleven meter after colliding and Steven Lawless , but referee Steven Thomson did not appeal to the Colombian .	-10.4535
The Rangers are only two shots in the first half , but the former Ibrox gateway Liam Kelly was hardly to bring from Lassana Coulibaly ’ s head jump and the match of a unprecedented Ovie Ejaria .	-4.8199
Although Livi ’ s opening match might have been contrary to the game process in the 34th minute , no one can deny that they deserve it alone for their efforts .	-3.9058
Rangers failed to master a Jacobs standard situation .	-2.2877
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher Scott Robinson played the ball that preserved the peace and picked Menga out for a simple finish .	-3.0888
Gerrard acted during the break when he exchanged Coulibaly against Ryan Kent and the change immediately affected the game when the wing player played to Morelos , but the impressive Kelly ran from his line to block .	-3.6313
But Livingston repeatedly made guests play exactly the kind of game they like , with Lithgow and Halkett balls long .	-4.2468
Holt ’ s team could have expanded its leadership during the final stage , but McGregor was well up to refuse Jacobs before Lithgow headed from the corner .	-4.0109
The Rangers representative Glenn Middleton had another late entitlement to a punishment because he had prevented himself with Jacobs , but he once again saw Thomson .              	-5.9344

And now a page from our Almanach “ Sunday morning ” : 30 September 1882 , which was more than 136 years ago ... The day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm , called Hans , violin in Germany was born .	-3.4725
Violinists developed a method of detecting and trade fairs of radioactivity , an invention that eventually produced the device known as violini .	-3.5420
The violinist has also become a mainstay of science since then , as in the 1950s of the film " Bells of Coronado " , the seemingly unlikely cowpoke scientist Roy Rogers and Dale Evans culminated :	-3.6199
Man : ' What about everything in the world is that ? '	-2.1540

New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “ see ” malicious cells .	-1.7534
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to " see " malicious cells and kill .	-2.0367
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malicious cells as part of the treatment .	-2.1289
The procedure includes the extraction of immune cells from a patient , amendment of these in the labor            	-4.4725
You can then see a protein that is common to many kinds of cancer , and then inject again .	-2.7617
A study vaccine shows promising results in patients with a number of cancer types .	-2.4568
A woman who was treated with the vaccine , who teaches the immune system to recognize rogue cells , saw her ovary cancer for more than 18 months .	-3.1596
The method is to extract immune cells from a patient , to change them in the laboratory , so that a protein called HER2 becomes “ visible ” , which occurs in many cancers , and then inject the cells again .	-3.5621
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda , Maryland , said : ' Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine ' .	-2.2278
HER2 “ promotes the growth of different kinds of cancer , including breast , egg , lung and colour cancer , explained Prof. Berzofsky .	-3.1439
A similar approach to taking patients immune cells and teaching them how to attack cancer cells has worked in treating a kind of leukaemia .	-3.2086
After his appearance at Saturday Night Live , Kanye West clothed with MAGA caps , a pro-Trump tirade from the stack .	-3.1820
It was not good .	-2.2051
Kanye West was exercised in the studio during a Saturday Night Live shipment after an excessive speech in which he praised the United States , President Donald Trump , and said that he would take place in 2020 .	-4.5843
After listing his third song of the night , Ghost Town , while he beared a make America Great cap , he heated against the Democrats and reaffirmed his support for Trump .	-3.6556
" So often I speak with a white person and she says , " How can you like Trump , he is a racist ? "	-2.4520
Well , if I were concerned about racism , I would have been withdrawing from America a long time ago ' he said .	-2.9991
The Saturday Night Live show began with a sketch in which Hollywood Star Matt Damon accused Brett Kavanaugh ’ s statement of the Senate ’ s Judicial Committee on Christine Blasey Fords , Kavanaugh had sexually needed it .	-4.0988
Although it was not broadcast , the film material was shared by West ’ s comic Chris Rock in the social media .	-3.5041
It is unclear whether Rock has tried to spot West with the contribution .	-2.6275
West also complained about the audience that he had had difficulty behind the stage because of his head coverage .	-3.3746
" They harassed me behind the stage .	-1.4326

Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity through its very masculine characters       .	-3.1471
He continues : What is born and what is taught ?	-2.2246
What is taught on television and on the road gives the small boy the feeling that they must have this particular side of man ?	-3.2663

“ Lies , lies , and even more reluctant lies , ” Waters shared in an opinion on Twitter .	-3.2222
According to the published information , reports included the private addresses and telephone numbers of the US Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina , as well as the US Senators Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch , both of which come from Utah .	-3.6300
The information appeared online Thursday , posted by an unknown person on the capitol hill during a hearing of the Senate on the accusations of sexual misconduct to the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh .	-3.4367
The data of the three senators were released shortly after the Kavanaugh survey .	-5.4110
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of jobs has been connected to Waters ' office and reported the information of a Waters employee .	-3.3033
“ This unfounded accusation is completely wrong and an absolute lie , ” said Waters .	-2.4917
“ The employee among my employees – whose identity , personal information , personal data and security were affected as a result of these fraudulent and wrong claims – was in no way responsible for this information being leaked .	-3.2408

Review of " Johnny English – You live only three times " – poorly occupied parody with Rowan Atkinson	-2.6847
It is tradition to look for suggestions in every new film with British tendency to Brexit , and this seems to be applicable to this revival of the Johnny English Action-Comedy-Spoof-Franchise .	-4.1008
Is the ironic self-satire about the abyssing humanity the new export opportunity of the nation ?	-2.7739
In any case , the glotty , rubber-sighted and incompetent Johnny English for the second time has received the license to remassage things .	-3.8690
He is , of course , the stupid secret agent , which , despite his bizarre claims to Smoothie-Glamour , has received a little clouseau , an injector Mr. Bean and a clack of this guy , contributing a single note to the guiding melody of fire cars at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London .	-4.7747
It is also based on the traveller and international , mysterious Atkinson , who has once participated in the now forgotten Barclaycard television displays , always leaving chao    .	-5.7224
There are one or two beautiful moments in this newest Johnny English comedy .	-3.8570
I loved Johnny English , who approaches a helicopter in a medieval armor and the main rotor beats his helmet briefly .	-3.1225
Atkinson 's talent for body comedy is to be seen , but the humor feels rather weak and strange superfluous , especially since the " serious " film counters such as 007 and mission impossible self-confident comedy as an ingredient .	-7.0308
The humor feels as if he is more directed at children than adults , and for me the crazy missing skills of Johnny English are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson ’ s Mr. Bean-Stummfilme .	-4.1227
The everlasting premise is that Britain is in great difficulty .	-2.1602
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the highly secret British network of spies and revealed the identity of all British agents on the ground to horror the service agent – a regrettably small role for Kevin Eldon .	-3.5806
It is the final straw halm for a Prime Minister who is a pompous and competitive personality and already suffers a complete core meltdown of political unpopularity .	-9.1073
Their intelligence consultants inform them that , as every single active spie has been compromised , they have to get someone from retirement .	-3.7296
And this means that the great Johnny English himself , who is now employed as a school master in a noble institution , but gives unsurpassed lessons about how to operate as an undercover agent : some nice gags here , while English offers a School of Rock Academy over Spying .                       i i  .	-9.2765
English is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunified with its former Bough , who has been playing again by Ben Miller for a long time .	-9.4915
Bough is now a married man who meets a submarine commander , an overwhelming , burshikose role in which Vicki Pepperdine does not completely apply     .	-4.0505
So the Batman and Robin of the chaos at the secret service of their majesty are again in action and meet at Olga Kurylenkos beautiful Femme Fatale Ophelia Bulletova .	-4.4683
Meanwhile , the Prime Minister is dangerous in the ban of the charismatic tech billionaire , who claims to be able to solve the UK ’ s computer problems : the darker Jason Volta , played by Jake Lacy .	-3.3599
English and Bough begin their odyssey of colourful highjinks : as a waiter , they inflame a French flash restaurant ; they create chaos by smuggling on board Volta ’ s luxury yacht ; and English triggers pure anarchy when he tries to familiarize with a Virtual Reality Headset with the inside of Voltas House .	-9.6455
For this last sequence , all the registers have certainly been drawn , but so lovely and omitted they are , the whole reminds of children 's televisi .                         	-7.1177

The Trade Union Congress approved the conversion to a four-day week as a way for workers to use the changing economy .	-2.8976
A high-level source from the Labour Party said the Sunday Times : a review of the policy is expected to be announced before the end of the year .	-4.1378
A four-day week is an objective that agrees with the approach of the party to restore the economic balance in favour of workers and the general industrial strategy of the party , but this objective will not be realised overnight .	-3.7671
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea , as the Green Party promised a four-day working week during its 2017 election campaign .	-2.5514
However , this is not being supported by the entire Labour Party .	-5.7529

Due to an ongoing FBI study on accusations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh , the final vote on the appointment of the judge to the Supreme Court was postponed by at least one week , and the question raises whether the investigation results of the FBI could lead Republican senators to abandon their support for Kavanaugh .	-4.4641
In an interview transferred on Sunday , Scott Pelley , the correspondent of “ 60 minutes ” , consulted Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham on whether the FBI ’ s investigation results could move them to change their opinion .	-3.6713

But how successful has Global Citizen been with 12 remaining years to achieve its goal ?	-2.3724
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert , a real opportunity to convince people to call for action , or simply another case of so-called ' clicktivism ' - people who feel that by signing an online petition or online application or thereby sending a tweet as if they make a real difference ?	-4.0338
Global Citizen says that since 2011 , it has recorded more than 19 million “ actions ” from its supporters that pushed for a variety of different objectives .	-3.0934

Washington can “ use ” his navy to prevent Russian energy from achieving markets , including in the Middle East , US Home Affairs Minister Ryan Zinke is quoted by Washington Examiner .	-3.1490
Zinke indicated that Russia ’ s commitment to Syria – especially in activities to invite the legitimate government – was a pretext for exploring new energy markets .	-3.2135
“ I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is more the following : they want to negotiate energy , just as they do in Eastern Europe , the southern part of Europe , ” he said                             	-5.6168
And , according to the officials , there are means and ways to deal with this .	-2.7799

The opinions come while the Trump administration was on the mission to stimulate the export of its liquid natural gas to Europe and replace Russia , the much more favourable option for European consumers .	-3.0457
Members of the Trump administration – including US President Donald Trump himself – are therefore trying to move Germany to a stop of the “ inappropriate ” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project that , according to Trump , would make Berlin “ prisoner . ”	-3.5883
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion dollar pipeline Nord Stream 2 , which is doubling the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres , is a purely economic project .	-5.0966

US Ambassador raises China “ Mobbing ” with “ Propaganda Advertising	-2.6846
One week after an official Chinese newspaper put a four-sided display in an American daily newspaper on mutual benefits of US China trade , the US American Ambassador in China Beijing required using the American press to spread propaganda .	-4.0536
Last Wednesday , US President Donald Trump referred to the paid insertion of China Daily in the Des Moines Register - the state with the most sold newspaper of Iowa - after accusing China of interfering in the US Congressional elections of 6 November , which denies China .	-3.8112
US officials claim to Reuters that Trump ’ s accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the US elections was a new phase in an escalating Washington campaign to exert pressure on China .	-2.9773
It is normal that foreign states should show ads to promote trade , but Beijing and Washington are currently in an escalating trade war with several rounds of tariffs on imports .	-3.1958
At an early stage of the trade war , China ’ s retaliatory tariffs should meet Chinese and US experts in US states like Iowa , where many supporters of Trump ’ s Republican Party live .	-3.1539
Terry Branstad , US Ambassador to China , and former long-standing governor of Iowa , a significant exporter of agricultural products to China , said that Beijing had violated American workers , farmers and companies .	-3.2282
China , wrote Branstad in an opinion article in the Des Moines register on Sunday , “ now operates this mobbing with emphasis by means of propaganda ads in our own free press .	-3.1737
“ By spreading propaganda as a paid display in the Des Moines Register , China ’ s government is using the estimated American tradition of freedom of expression and freedom , ” wrote Branstad .	-3.1945
" By contrast , you will find only limited different voices at the newspaper state in the streets of Beijing , and will not see a real reproduction of different opinions that the Chinese people could have on China ’ s disturbing economic development , bearing in mind that the media are firmly under the control of the Chinese Communist Party , " he wrote .	-4.6372
He added that " one of China 's most prominent newspapers contradicted the offer to publication , " even though he did not say what newspaper .	-2.9900
The Republicans gray with the Kavanaugh debacle voters before the Midterm elections , warn analysts	-2.8897
Many of the Top Republicans defended Board Kavanaugh , a nominee that is the Supreme Court of Justice , even though he has been accused of sexual attacks , the analysts warn that they will see a counterfeit in the forthcoming elections , especially women .	-4.0933
The emotions were high , most Republicans have already said that they want to vote for him .	-2.2154
These things cannot be returned , said Grant Reeher , professor of political science at the Maxwell School of the Syracuse University , on Saturday in an article published by The Hill .	-2.5540
Reeher said he doubted that the support last minute by Jeff Flake ( Republican Member of the Federal State of Arizona ) was sufficient for investigations by the FBI to reconcile angry electora                   .                i     	-8.6845
“ Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow and not even in November , ” said Carine Jean-Pierre , Senior Consultant and National Spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday , as a Washington newspaper reported .	-3.3834
On Friday morning , the demonstrators sung : “ November comes ! ” , while demonstrating in the course of the Senate , when the Republicans who control the judicial committee decided to continue with Kavanaugh ’ s nomination despite the statement by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford , reports Mic .	-4.0489
“ Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be immeasurable , ” said Stu Rothenberg , an impartial political analyst , the journalists .	-2.0575
“ People say that it has already been quite advanced , that is true .	-3.1290
But the number could be higher , especially among the interchangeable electorates in the suburbs and younger voters , 18-29 year-olds , who do not like the president , but often do not elect . ”	-4.7213
Even before Ford ’ s public statement in which she carried out her accusations of sexual violence against the candidates for the Supreme Court , analysts noted that a counter-reaction could follow if Republicans pushed forward the candidacy .	-4.0068
“ This has become a wrong chaos for the GOP , ” said Michael Steele , former chairman of the Republican National Committee , according to NBC News last week .	-2.9646
“ It is not simply a question of the committee or the final choice or whether Kavanaugh is being placed on the replacement bank , rather , on how the Republicans have done this and how they have treated it , ” shared Guy Cecil , Director of the Priorities of the United States , a group that helps the Democrats elect to the news station .	-5.1939
However , the Americans are divided about the statements made by Ford and Kavanaugh .	-2.4627
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 % of Ford ’ s respondents definitely or probably believed while 35 % indicated that they definitely or probably believed Kavanaugh .	-3.3502
Moreover , 38 % said that they thought that Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his statement , while only 30 % said about Ford .	-2.7812
On the Flake initiative , the FBI is currently examining the accusations of Ford and at least one other prosecutor , Deborah Ramirez , The Guardian reported .	-3.1169
Last week before the Senate Judicial Committee , Ford said that Kavanaugh attacked them at the age of 17 .	-2.7094
Ramirez accuses the nominated for the highest judge office during her study time in Yale in the 1980s on a party to have removed his genitals from them .	-6.1937
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to challenge Google and Facebook	-2.1871
Tim Berners-Lee , the inventor of the Internet , founds a startup company to compete with Facebook , Amazon and Google .	-2.1576
The current project of the technology legend , Inrupt , is a company that builds on the open source platform “ Solid ” by Berners-Lee .	-2.5775
Solid allows users to determine where their data is stored and which persons may access to which information .	-3.2538
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company , Berners-Lee joked that the goal of Inrupt is to take over world rule .	-2.8797
“ We have to do it now , ” he said about the startup .	-1.9363
“ It is a historic moment . ”	-1.3821
The app uses the technology of solid that allows users to create personal online data storage or POD .	-5.6463
The data storage can contain contact lists , tasks , calendars , music libraries and other personal or professional tools .	-2.3861
It is like Google Drive , Microsoft Outlook , Slack and Spotify all available on a browser and all at the same time .	-1.9637
The personal online data memory is that it is completely left to the user which access to what kind of information is possible .	-3.2664
The company calls it “ persons empower by data . ”	-5.6241
According to the CEO of the company John Bruce , inrupt will provide resources , processes and appropriate know-how to make solid available to a broad user .	-2.9879
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee , Bruce , a security platform acquired by IBM , some employees involved in the project , and a community of voluntary programmers .	-2.6929
From this week , technology developers can create their own decentralized apps worldwide using the tools available on the inrupt website .	-2.9510
Berners-Lee said that neither his team nor himself will talk to Facebook and Google about the comprehensive changes that will put all previous business models overnight .	-3.0673
“ We will not ask them for permission . ”	-1.8553
In an article published on Saturday on medium , Berners-Lee wrote that Inrits " Mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on solid " .	-3.1273
In 1994 , Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .	-2.0884
Berners-Lee has strongly influenced the debate on net neutrality in recent months .	-2.2965
Also during the start of Inrupt , Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium , the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute .	-2.6557

The only priest of the Church of England , who received a Victoria Cross during World War I during the First World War , was celebrated 100 years later in his hometown .	-3.3117
The Oberstleutnant and Reverend Bernard Vann deserved the award on 29 September 1918 at the attack in Bellenglise and Lehaucourt .	-2.9526
But he was killed four days later by a rear protection and did not know that he won the highest British military award .	-2.9771
A memorial was revealed on Saturday at a parade in Rushden , Northamtonshire , by his two grandchildren .	-2.5276
One of his grandchildren , Michael Vann , said that it was “ incredibly symbolic ” that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after the hero of his grandfather .	-2.6802
According to the London Gazette , Oberstleutnant Vann led his batalion in September 1918 over the channel of Saint-Quentin “ at very dense fog and under heavy field protection and machine guns . ”	-4.0290
Later he stormed to the first line and led the line forward with the “ largest galantery ” before he moved a field pistol and pressed three times the deduction .	-4.4837
Commander Vann was killed by a German sharp protection on 4 October 1918 – just a month before the end of the war .	-3.3394
Michael Vann , 72 , said the actions of his grandfather were ' something I know that I could never do justice to this , something that influences a humility ' .	-3.1112
He and his brother Dr. James Vann put a crance after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band .	-2.7462
Michael Vann said he felt “ very honoured to participate in the parade ” and added : “ The braveness of a real hero reflects in the support he gets from many people . ”	-3.3933

American Phil Mickelson will play a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game , but he has to improve his form dramatically , so that it will not become a sad milestone .	-3.8630
Mickelson , who played for the 12th time at the event taking place every two years , was placed on the bank by Captain Jim Furyk for the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday .	-4.8339

I have always said that I firmly believe in the 12 players in our team , but we have to do it with a strong opponent , the best players in the world . ”	-2.7602
Enthusiastically , as his players played on a hard golf course , Björn added : " I would never be fast here .	-2.9903
Tomorrow is also a day .	-1.9241
Tomorrow there are personal appearances , and that is another thing .	-2.7372
It is great to be outside with a partner when things run well , but if you are outside there , then your own skills as a golf player will be tested all the time .	-4.4149
This is the message you have to convey to the players : tomorrow the best to get out of yourself .	-3.5064
Now you pass to your partner and he must bring full use just like you . ”	-3.5692
Unlike Björn , the opponent Jim Furyk will strive for his players to cut individually better than they do this than partners , except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas , who have taken three out of four points .	-3.9404

Once again shifting the timetable for Germany ’ s New Warship	-2.6524
The latest frigates of the German Navy should have been served in 2014 to replace warships from the Cold War in the years , but according to reports from local media , at least until next year , it will take at least to replace the cost of                           .       i  a               .	-9.9963
The commissioning of the “ Rhineland Palace ” , the guiding vessel of the brand new frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class , was now postponed to the first half of 2019 , such as the newspaper “ Time ” appointed a military speaker .	-4.2090
The Navy should have taken operation of the ships in 2014 , but serious problems after the first delivery have burdened the ambitious project .	-3.8229
The four frigates ordered by the Navy in 2007 of the Baden-Württemberg class will replace the older ships of the Bremen class .	-2.9854
It is assumed that they have a powerful cannon , a series of air defence and ship defence missiles , as well as some Stealth technologies , such as reduced radar , infrared and acoustic signatures .	-3.5314
Another important advantage is longer maintenance intervals : the latest frigates should be usable for up to two years without going to the home port .	-3.2904
However , the state-of-the-art warships that will enable Germany to project power in overseas will already be outdated by the permanent delays if they are finally served , as the weekly newspaper “ Time ” notes .	-4.3234
Last year , the unfortunate F125 frigates ensured headlines when the German navy officially refused to operate the ship and returned it to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg .	-3.4429
This was the first time the navy returned a ship to a shipping farmer after delivery .	-2.7811
There was little known about the reasons for the return of ships ; German media mentioned a number of critical “ software and hardware defects ” that would make the warship useless in combat operations .	-3.8664
Software defects were particularly important because the ships of the Baden-Württemberg class are operated by an occupation of around 120 seafarers - only half of the occupation on older frigates of the Bremen class .	-3.4603
It also turned out that the ship has a considerable overweight , restricting performance and making future upgrades more difficult for the naval .	-3.3705
It is assumed that the 7,000-tonne “ Rhineland-Palatinate ” is twice as hard as ships of the same class used by the Germans during World War II .                               i          	-8.2490
In addition to faulty hardware , the price sign of the entire project - including training of the crew - is also becoming the subject .	-3.5078
Instead of the original EUR 2.2 billion , the costs have now apparently reached the declining level of EUR 3.1 billion ( around $ 3.6 billion ) .	-3.5247
The problems with the latest frigates receive a particular significance in the light of the recent warnings that Germany ’ s maritime power declin .	-3.5710
At the beginning of this year , Hans-Peter Bartels , Chairman of the Defence Committee of the German Parliament , admitted that the war fleet actually “ go out of operational vessels . ”	-3.4302
The official said that the problem had grown avalanche over time , as old vessels were put out of service without replacing it .	-3.8971
He complained that none of the Baden-Württemberg frigates were served by the navy .	-2.6442

Rob Dewar , Nature Protection Consultant at the National Trust for Scotland ( NTS ) , hopes to find out which areas of habitat are most important for the battle mice and how they are used by the respective species .	-3.6007
This information will help to identify the benefits of habitat management , such as meadows and how best to maintain the forests of battery mice and other species associated with                      	-6.5469
There has been a strong decline in battle mouse populations in Scotland and the UK in the last hundred years .	-3.3977
They are threatened by construction works that have an impact on their sleeping places and loss of habitat .	-4.2922
Wind power stations and lighting can also be a risk , as well as flyer strips and some chemical treatments of construction materials .	-3.9194
Bats are actually not blind .	-2.3643
Adapted to their nightly hunting activities , the ears are more useful when catching them than the eyes .	-3.2973
They use a sophisticated echo location technology to locate errors and obstacles in their flight .	-2.8320
The NTS , which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historical buildings , 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country , takes the bats mice very seriously .	-3.0848
There are ten trained experts who regularly carry out surveys , inspect sleeping places and sometimes carry out rescues .	-3.2173
The organization has even established Scotland ’ s first and only dedicated battle mouse reserve in the thread property in Dumfries and Galloway , where eight of the ten Scottish battle mouses are home .	-3.9850
According to David Thompson , the property is an ideal habitat for them :	-2.0002
“ Here in Threave we have a great area for bats . ”	-2.1921

“ The United Kingdom would regret timelife if it were to lose its position as a world leading car manufacturer after Brexit , ” said Economic Minister Greg Clark .	-3.3169

Rosenstein rejected an opinion .	-1.1364

Trump said that he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein , but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a collision with the hearing of the Senate Justice Committee , in which Kavanaugh and one of the women , Dr Christine Blasey Ford , who accused him of sexual misconduct .	-3.7295

But we will see and I always keep the press up to date . '	-2.3059
Some reporters would challenge this claim : Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September .	-2.4192
The guest Chris Wallace asked why .	-1.2946
Sanders said that the lack of briefings does not rely on television reporters that behave like self-representatives , but she also said that ' I will not be against them '       .    '	-6.9656
She then proposed that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase .	-1.8724
" The President carries out more questions and answers than every President before him , " she said and added , without calling evidence : " We have seen these figures . "	-5.5883
Briefings will still take place , said Sanders , but should the press have the opportunity to directly ask questions to the President of the United States , if it is infinitely better than speaking with her .	-3.5476
We are trying to do a lot about this , and you have seen how we have done it in recent weeks , and it will replace a press discussion when you can talk to the President of the United States itself . ”	-3.5136

Dairy pump advertising where mothers are compared to cows led to controversial online discussions	-7.4920
A dairy pump company has caused controversial online discussions because of a display in which quiet mothers are compared with d             c .	-4.8742
On the occasion of the introduction of the allegedly " first noiseless and portable milk pump " , the consumer technology company Elvie published an ironic advertising inspired by music videos to show which freedoms mothers are offered with this new pump .	-5.6884
Four real mothers dance in a hypocrisy in the middle of cows to a number with the following song text : " Yes , I melk me , but you see no tail " and " If you did not notice that there are no euters , there are my breasts . "	-4.1959
The slogan continues : ' Pump down , pump , I feed the babies , pump , pump , pump , I milk my ladies ' .	-3.7618
However , the display published on the Facebook page of the company has provided controversy online .	-2.9469
With 77,000 calls and hundreds of comments , the video has received mixed reactions of viewers , many of whom say that it illuminates the " horrors " of the dairy industry .	-2.9769

Another commented : ' This is a funny advertising for mothers who feel abpumped ( often in their jobs or toilets ) and feel like ' cows ' .	-3.0922
That is not an advertising that praises or judges the dairy industry . '	-7.7443
At the end of the video , the group of women reveals that they have all danced with the decent pumps in their BHs .	-2.7482
The concept of the campaign is based on the recognition that many women who pump milk say that they feel like cows .	-2.5983
However , Elvie Pump is completely noisy , has no wires or hoses and fits into a still BH , which means women have the freedom to move , keep their babies and even go out of pumping .	-4.3073
Ana Balarin , Partner and ECD at Mother commented : " The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that has deserved a bold and provocative introduction of the market .	-2.9729

Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh hysterically and says that he is inappropriate for the service at the Supreme Cou      .	-3.5148
The Chairman of the Democratic Minority Group , Nancy Pelosi , called Brett Kavanaugh , the candidate for a seat on the Supreme Court of Justice “ hysterically , ” and said that he was inappropriate from the temperament to serve at the Supreme Court .	-3.8118
Pelosi made the comments at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin , Texas on an interview Saturday .	-4.1512
“ I could not have been able to think that if a woman had ever behaved so , they had called it “ hysterical , ” said Pelosi about her response to Kavanaugh ’ s statement before the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday .	-3.6868
Kavanaugh demonstrated the claims that he attacked Dr. sexually , Christine Blasey Ford when they were both young people .	-3.1055
During his opening speech , Kavanaugh was very emotional , sometimes he cried almost and fought with tears when he talked about his family and his high-school years .	-2.7925
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in committee and called the allegations against him a “ grotesque and coordinated reputation campaign ” organised by liberals who are angry about Clinton losing the 2016 presidential election .	-3.6597
Pelosi said that she believed that Kavanaugh ’ s statement demonstrated that he could not serve before the Supreme Court because he showed that he was against Democrats .	-3.2683
“ I believe that he is disqualified even by the Clintons and the Democrats , with such statements and the way he can influence himself . ”	-3.8191
When it was asked whether it would aim for an impediment procedure against Kavanaugh in the event of its confirmation and a democratic majority in the House of Representatives , Pelosi hesitated .	-3.4268
“ I want to say the following : if he says neither the Congress nor the FBI the truth , it is inappropriate not only for the Supreme Court service , but also for the service to the court where he is currently employed , ” said Pelosi .	-4.2027
Kavanaugh is currently district judge in D.C. Appeal Court .	-2.3833
Pelosi added that she was a democrat concerned about possible Kavanaugh judgments against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade , as he stands for conservative justice .	-3.0573
In his confirmation hearings , Kavanaugh has raised questions about whether he would tilt certain Supreme Court decisions .	-3.1661
“ It is not the time that a hysterical , biased person goes to the court and expects us to say , “ Is that not wonderful , ” Pelosi said .	-3.6340

" I do not think that this is unusual , or ?     ?    " .   .	-5.3324
She continued : “ I once helped me a woman in the executive that told me that she was also crying when she became angry , but she developed a technique where she became angry every time she became angry and crying , to the person with whom she spoke , said : “ You may think that I am sad because I wine                                     an           	-8.5124

And I thought that was brilliant . ”	-1.2780
Tears are allowed as a valve for anger because they are basically misunderstood .	-2.3499
One of my strongest memories of an early job in an office dominated by men , in which I once commanded indescribable anger , was that I was tackled by an older woman , a clever manager before whom I was always somewhat frightened - who turned me into a staircase .	-4.8712
" Let them never see you wine " , she told me .	-2.1549
" You do not know that you are angry .	-1.6355

“ Think that I get advanced laurels ? ” she wondered .	-3.3015
When she held her speech and announced that she would not start a formal campaign , she was so overwhelmed by emotions - gratitude for the people who supported them , frustration over the system that made it so difficult to collect money and address voters rather than delegates , and anger about sexism - that it was stifled .	-3.9057

China answers every US blow with a counterfeit , and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will give in the near future .	-6.0758
Bringing Washington to lead means giving up the demands , but publicly bowing to the United States would be far too blamable for Xi Jinping , the President of China .	-3.8432
However , if Beijing uses its opportunities rightly , the US trade war can have a positive effect on China in the long run by lowering the mutual dependencies of the two economies , experts say .	-3.4773
“ The fact that a fast political decision in Washington or Beijing can create the conditions for economic turmoil in one of the two countries is much more dangerous than observers took previously , ” said Abigail Grace , scientific employee at the Center for New American Security , a thinking tank with the focus of Asia .	-8.3813
