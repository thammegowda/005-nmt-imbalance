Good luck : More safety for pedestrians	-3.7948
They are not 100 metres from each other : on Tuesday the new B 33 pedestrian ramp in Gutach was put into operation at the village car park - within sight of the older town hall ramps .	-6.5004
Two plants so close to each other : intention or bullfight ?	-5.6714
Gutach ’ s mayor answered this question clearly yesterday .	-7.5841
" The town hall ramp was installed at the time because it secures the school path , " explained Eckert yesterday .	-4.7249
The Kluser-Ampell safe both cyclists and bus passengers and the mountain residents .	-5.3359
The facility officially opened yesterday was important for the Sulzbachweg / Kirchstra<unk>e intersection .	-3.4910
We have the museum , two churches , spa park , bus stop , doctor and bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area <unk> Grub <unk> .	-3.6710
" At the high traffic and pedestrian traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic traffic had to reach another traffic light " , says Eckert .	-7.4176
This is also confirmed by Peter Arnold of Landratei Offenburg .	-3.2937
" According to current measurements on the B 33 , about 12 000 vehicles pass through the municipality of Gutach every day , about 10 percent of which are heavy goods vehicles , " says Arnold .	-6.6566
Therefore , the construction of another traffic light is more than necessary : " Safety just goes ahead here , " says Arnold .	-5.6235
In total , four traffic shows were carried out , a roundabout was also thought up , but due to the closeness in the Sulzbachweg / Kirchstra<unk>e intersection again discarded .	-7.5552
According to Arnold , everything was tested out in the choice of traffic lights : " By means of an extra truck loaded with particularly long wooden trunks , we have tested whether these vehicles can leave the Sulzbachweg onto the B 33 without changing the traffic lights " .	-8.9192
Arnold explained that the traffic light system , which costs around € 15 000 , is the " most modern of what is currently available on the market " . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-11.3929
The system is equipped with colored LEDs that illuminate so much that the lights can be easily seen by the car drivers , for example , even in the low lying sun .	-8.5675
And it is also economical : the older lighting systems consume about 100 watts , the new one just eight watts .	-4.8624
There are three lighting systems per direction .	-2.6363
Arnold explained the technique of the new system : it is equipped with two radar sensors .	-2.8401
If the pedestrian pushes the traffic light button , the top radar sensor will test the traffic situation .	-4.2464
If the road is free , comes immediately green for the pedestrian , if not , it takes about 15 seconds .	-2.9078
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase for the pedestrian can be completed .	-3.7356
" If a group or disabled people go to the streets , the green phase will be extended , so everyone will be safe on the road , " said Arnold .	-6.0333
Of course , the driver has to think along as a partner and watch the road .	-5.6516
This was not the case yesterday : hardly did the traffic lights show green for pedestrians , a top-class vehicle smoked - in bright red .	-4.9856
Josef Winkler has been writing for more than 30 years the needs of his childhood and youth from the soul .	-3.5535
The Kärntner poet has often described the disasters of his Catholic village childhood - the speechlessness , the inclination to brute force and mute sexuality , the closeness and unhappiness .	-6.5226
The Büchner Prize winner is known primarily as a prose author , and theater are rare in his work .	-6.4199
Collage from Prosatexten Gerhard Fresacher composes a collage of prose texts for his performance " Wetterleuchten auf der Zungenspitze " , which can now be seen in Garage X on Petersplatz .	-5.2190
The theatre maker combines elements from the autobiographical novel " Der Leibeingene " ( 1987 ) with Prosaminiaturen aus " Leichnam , seiner Familie belüerend " ( 2003 ) .	-6.0166
On the largely empty stage - important props : a cracked sofa , on which it appears to be copied and masturbated - the eight-member ensemble is bound by the textual material .	-7.8306
Director Fresacher seems to have little confidence in the text .	-3.1644
The 70-minute performance surpasses the original with a plethora of tableware , known from the repertoire of post-dramatic forms of play .	-6.0527
Especially the actresses get involved in the sometimes somewhat dubious scenic implementations .	-5.8623
They are harshly touched , dipped under water with their heads , and stacked to the wall with their evening drops .	-7.1557
Impressed in cellophane or bodice , they stack on dangerously high sticks through the staging , either they monologize loudly or lie completely muted on the stage floor .	-6.4070
However , the text is hardly conveyed in this strenuous manner .	-4.5292
The best moments have the evening when it is sung - the bandwidth ranges from Deep Purple to popular song material .	-5.3931
Only towards the end is the overturned performance somewhat calming , and Winkler ’ s even more absurd humor shines .	-7.0991
A black box in the car ?	-1.6194
American road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the decaying highway system , and believe they have found the solution in a small black box that can be found in the dashboard of every car .	-5.8793
The devices that record every kilometre travelled and report the information to the authorities are at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and the state planning offices to revise the obsolete system of financing US roads .	-5.3725
The normally boring area of road planning has suddenly sparked intense debate with colourful alliances .	-3.8708
Libertarians have allied themselves with environmental groups and are in favour of the government using small boxes to record the kilometres that have been driven – and possibly where they have been driven – and then using the information to calculate tax certificates . are . .	-11.2346
The Tea Party is appalled .	-1.3111
The American Civil Rights Association ( ACLU ) is also deeply concerned and raises a number of data protection concerns .	-3.0253
But , while Congress cannot agree on action , several states are no longer waiting .	-3.2517
They are currently considering how to switch over the next ten years to a system where drivers pay per mile .	-4.2518
Thousands of car drivers have already tested the tachographs , some of which are equipped with GPS surveillance .	-7.9852
This is really a must for our country .	-2.1883
“ It ’ s nothing we ’ ll use only possibly , ” said Hasan Ikhrata , Managing Director of Southern California Assn. of Government , who plans to record the miles that have been taken by all Californian drivers in the state from 2025 .	-6.6108
The way we pay these taxes will change .	-1.4863
The technology is there .	-1.3991
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund , which is financed from taxes , is bankrupt for Americans at the cone .	-4.6347
But America is no longer fucking as much as it used to . .	-9.0580
Cars use less petrol .	-1.6209
The national oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon ( less than 4 cents per litre ) has not risen for 20 years .	-3.2036
Politicians do not dare to raise the tax even by one cent at high spray prices .	-4.1615
“ The gas tax is simply not future-proof , ” says Lee Munnich , an expert on transport legislation at the University of Minnesota .	-3.7161
His state recently equiped 500 cars with tachographs to test a mileage based payment system .	-3.3146
“ This is the most sensible long-term alternative , ” he said .	-2.9294
Bureaucrats call it a mile-based user fee .	-2.1838
Not surprisingly , the idea is popular with urban liberals , for example , because the tax could be used to influence driving behavior in such a way as to reduce congestion and climate-damaging exhaust emissions .	-5.0800
California planners rely on the system to develop strategies to achieve the state ’ s ambitious , legally anchored goals on climate change .	-4.6797
But Pennsylvania Republican Bill Shuster , Chairman of the House Transportation Committee , has also stated that he sees it as the most viable long-term alternative .	-3.4569
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are also fond of the idea of letting drivers pay after the race .	-6.7372
“ This is not a tax that disappears in a black hole , ” explains Adrian Moore , Vice President of Reason ’ s Guidelines .	-3.0254
People pay directly for what they get .	-1.3821
The movement is also supported by two former US transport ministers who , in a 2011 report , asked Congress to move toward mileage-based settlement .	-4.5351
Last year , the US Senate approved a $ 90 million pilot project that would have included 10,000 cars .	-2.9358
But the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the move , responding to the concerns of rural MEPs representing people who often have to travel many miles on their way to work or to the city in everyday life .	-5.8531
Several states and large cities are nonetheless moving in this direction on their own .	-4.0881
Most dedicated is Oregon , which currently recruits 5,000 drivers for the country ’ s largest experiment .	-8.3224
These drivers will soon pay the mileage fees to the state instead of the petroleum tax .	-4.1562
Nevada has already completed a pilot project .	-0.7984
New York City is also considering this .	-2.3588
Illinois is testing it to a limited extent with trucks .	-2.9373
And the I-95 coalition , which includes the transport ministries of 17 states on the east coast ( including Maryland , Pennsylvania , Virginia , and Florida ) , is currently examining how to introduce the change .	-8.6065
The concept is not a universal hit .	-0.8372
In Nevada , where 50 volunteers recently were equipped with the equipment , drivers were skeptical about the idea that the government could follow each of their movements .	-4.4782
“ Concerns against Big Brother and such things were a big problem , ” explains Alauddin Khan , Head of Strategy and Results Management at Nevada ’ s Transport Ministry .	-4.1206
People did not want it .	-1.5013
When the test started , Nevada ’ s ACLU warned on its website : “ It would be relatively easy to turn the tachographs into full-scale surveillance devices . ”	-4.2535
There is no need to build a gigantic , bulky technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data about the daily movements of individuals .	-3.5276
Nevada is one of a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology that allows the state to capture the kilometres that have been driven , but not exactly when and where .	-5.4533
That , Khan said , would also reassure the public .	-3.9029
Hunting for this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California .	-2.5552
Originally , the company did not intervene to help states tax drivers .	-5.5444
Instead , their aim was to establish a foothold in an emerging market for car insurance , in which drivers should pay on the basis of the miles they have travelled .	-6.5842
However , the devices it tests are also interesting for road planners , because they do not work with GPS and provide limited information that is regularly uploaded via modem .	-5.5227
“ People are more willing to participate if their speed and locations are not recorded , ” explained Ryan Morrison , CEO of True Mileage .	-3.4512
Major mistakes have been made in some of these public pilot programmes .	-2.5727
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement this .	-2.4474
In Oregon , the planners are experimenting with giving drivers a range of choices .	-3.1469
You can choose a device with or without GPS .	-1.9194
Or they choose no device at all and instead pay a flat rate on the basis of the miles travelled on average by all residents of the state .	-5.8616
Others hope to be able to sell the concept of a suspicious public by providing the devices with more functions than with less .	-4.6018
In New York City , traffic officials want to develop a tax device to pay for parking fees , pay insurance only for journeys , and collect speed data from other vehicles in real time , allowing drivers to avoid congestion .	-6.5668
“ Drivers would be motivated to participate by the added value of the benefits offered by the system , ” says a city planning document .	-3.8595
However , some transport planners are wondering whether all the talk about paying per mile is not just a huge distraction .	-5.3209
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay area , officials said that Congress could solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund simply by increasing fuel tax .	-4.6797
An additional one-off fee or annual levy could be imposed on drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume little petrol , so that they also pay a fair share .	-5.4295
“ There is no reason for an operation if an aspirin is sufficient , ” explains Randy Rendschler , the Commission ’ s Head of Legislation and Public Affairs .	-3.9134
If we do , hundreds of millions of car drivers worry about their privacy and many other things .	-2.6439
Kingsfeld : Small Team Wacker	-3.7831
The volunteer fire brigade handled their autumn test with flying colours despite lack of staff .	-6.1853
Only eleven people took part in the exercise .	-2.5874
In his acceptance of his practice , Deputy Commander Hans Kammerer chose the property Feder in Burgberger Stra<unk>e .	-5.7611
This is where a short circuit was created when sawing .	-5.4184
Two people were injured as a result of the fire and the smoke and one of them was able to send an emergency call .	-5.7108
After Hans Kammerer 's first examination of the situation , two air defenders of the Wehr prepared to enter the building .	-6.5240
After a short period of time , it was possible to find the first person and guide them to the outside .	-5.0297
The second person had to be worn .	-1.2532
This was not so easy as a narrow staircase was also to be overcome .	-4.5723
The building , a workshop with integrated stables for two horses , was not easy to secure .	-2.2362
It stored a lot of wood and also straw balls in it .	-3.9958
There were also electric machines for woodworking .	-2.7674
The first extinguishing handle was carried out via the tank in the vehicle .	-4.4518
Another line took place via a flood hydrant at about 100 meters .	-7.0996
Now three delete handles could be designed .	-3.4561
A hollow beam tube was also used in the building .	-2.4182
Hans Kammerer was also involved in the exercise to show what is to be done with little staff available .	-6.6132
In case of emergency , support is provided by the Königsfeld daily operations group .	-4.6408
The commander was satisfied with the course of the exercise .	-2.7031
Network of Hochschulen and Fir	-7.9098
During his visit to the district of Breisgau Hochschwarzwald , Landtag President Guido Wolf was also able to find out in Titisee-Neustadt where tomorrow ’ s workforce will come from .	-6.0827
In the Hochschwarzwald Förderzentrum , he , together with the business leaders of the vocational schools , as well as the district gymnasium and the parents Advisory Board , addressed this important issue .	-8.0105
" Education is an important location factor " , stressed Claudia Stelle , director of the Hans-Thoma School , who presented the networked school project " Hochschwarzwald Education Center " .	-5.4380
Wolf was impressed by the model projects for training .	-2.5175
Since 2011 there has been a successful cooperation in the Waldstadt between the Förderzentrum , Kreisgymnasium and the BerufschulzeCenter .	-4.8801
He also praised the family friendliness in the county .	-3.1651
" It is important not only to have a look at the family phase , but also , due to demographic change , the period of care for relatives , " Wolf explained .	-5.6012
He also suggested that more and more employees took care of the care and care of their families .	-4.1047
" Without the support of employers , the resulting burden on employees can lead to an end to the employment relationship , " Wolf said .	-3.6904
But no one can afford to lose skilled labor , he said .	-2.4934
Another particularly important factor is the networking of universities and companies .	-3.0665
" For anyone who has already experienced the benefits of the region during his studies , with his acquired knowledge and skills , often remains with the regional economy , which helps to strengthen the region , " the President of the country was convinced .	-8.2135
Only if sufficient training places were offered could the need for skilled workers be met .	-4.3593
In his opinion , the location advantage of the district is its favourable location in the south-west of Germany , close to France and Switzerland .	-4.4576
He also experienced the efforts already made to develop local public transport on his journey from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg .	-5.4817
'Keep stubbornly and make public transport better ' , he said to the local politicians present .	-5.6045
Experience an entertaining afternoon with music .	-3.1687
For 15 years , the Kaul family has been inviting the Dietinger senior citizens for coffee , cake and then for a vesper .	-5.8120
In the past , the elderly were hosted in the resting place .	-5.6938
Meanwhile this afternoon takes place in the nursing home of St. Josef .	-3.5554
Home residents were looking forward to the delicious cakes and cakes .	-4.4757
Later there was sausage .	-2.6831
Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich performed with popular melodies .	-4.8082
The more than 100 years old natural stone wall as the front boundary of the old school yard to the Kirchstra<unk>e , which is to be rebuilt , is to be reinserted into the city of Bräunlingen 's redevelopment plan .	-9.0135
In the days before the Kilbig , a small corner wall was built in the first works of the restoration of the front school , to stabilize and relieve static relief of the more than one hundred years old natural stone wall with balustrade .	-7.6849
According to Alexander Misok of the Bräunlinger Stadtbauamt , the regional memorial office is to be included in the planning and a redevelopment concept for the old wall .	-6.9379
After that , a cost calculation will be carried out by professionals , who will then be put on the table to the municipal council to decide and determine how to proceed .	-7.6038
A decision will probably be taken next year .	-2.8811
After the renovation , paving and planting of the old school inner courtyard within the two side wings of the school built in 1912 , it is necessary for the foreseeable future to be followed up by the restoration of the barrier wall in need of restoration and to put it on new foundations .	-10.5719
The historic , century-old demarcation wall of the old school building to the Kirchstra<unk>e , is particularly in need of renovation due to water and frost damage , as there is no drainage , and has a archery inclination to the front .	-12.0416
Deep cracks in individual stones bear witness to damage to the weather , but the wall is not currently in danger of collapse .	-5.2238
A stable wall is a prerequisite for one of students using a school yard , which has been done by the current fortifications .	-6.5977
Originally , school building was planned even in the years 2008 / 2009 , but high unplanned spending caused a shift .	-6.0994
An important word in the historical school wall restoration , which has even been used for film recordings , will be spoken by the National Monument Office .	-6.4978
If the guidelines come from this page , then the city of Bräunlingen hopes to receive grants from the monument protectors .	-7.1662
The students of the primary school in Bräunlingen , who are now taught again in a well-restored old school building with a new aura , will soon be able to use the old school courtyard .	-6.9301
<unk>zdemir ’ s Way to Jazz Education in Stuttgart	-7.7306
In the ongoing discussions about the future of the music academies in Baden-Württemberg , Cem <unk>zdemir , Federal President of the Greens , has now also joined .	-9.6410
" I think it is wrong to give up holistic education at the Stuttgart Musikhochschule " , said <unk>zdemir the " Stuttgarter Nachrichten " .	-4.1873
Jazz and classics belong together at the jazz location Stuttgart .	-3.7944
In this way , <unk>zdemir , who is regarded in Stuttgart as a favorite for a direct mandate in the federal election on 22 September , contradicts the Grün-Roten Landesregierung .	-5.7368
On the basis of an expert study , this will force a reorganization of the five music schools in Baden-Württemberg .	-4.6753
After that , among other things , the Jazz and Pop degree programme will be transferred from the Stuttgart Academy of Music to the Mannheim Academy of Music .	-6.0312
US border : ' Super Tunnel ' on drug smuggling discovered	-5.3261
On the border between Mexico and the US , investigators have discovered and shut down a ' super-tunnel ' to drug smuggling .	-3.6817
As the US customs authorities announced , the more than 500 meter long Tubes between Tijuana and San Diego were equipped with electricity , railway tracks , and a ventilation system .	-4.8024
Three suspects were arrested , eight tonnes of marijuana and almost 150 kilograms of cocaine were seized .	-2.5285
According to the data , the tunnel had not yet been used .	-2.9385
" These cartels are stupid when they think they could dig under the radar , " said the prosecutor General of the US District Southern California , Laura Duffy , at a press conference in front of a warehouse in San Diego , where one end of the tunnel had been discovered .	-5.5745
To the drug gangs , Duffy assured : " If you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them , we are determined to make it a huge waste of your dirty money " .	-5.0855
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a permanent battle against drug cartels .	-3.1068
Since 2006 , more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug crime .	-2.6550
Constructed by Experts	-0.8366
Due to the complex equipment of the tunnel , the investigators assume that it was constructed by architects and engineers and that the construction took about a year .	-5.0556
The track system was so equipped that electrically operated cars could be used there .	-3.1892
On the Mexican side , access is in a building 80 meters from the border .	-3.1804
According to the authorities , a ladder takes 20 meters to the depth of the tunnel .	-3.9661
The tunnel has a cross section of 1.20 meters height and 90 centimetres width .	-3.1511
He would also have been able to promote illegal immigration to the United States .	-3.8809
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine fund .	-1.7119
The third , a Mexican , was caught because of the seized marijuana .	-2.8286
All three are threatened with the maximum sentence of life imprisonment , as officials have said .	-4.3510
Eight such tunnels had been discovered since 2006 , and the press conference in San Diego continued .	-3.4458
But this is the first time that cocaine has been found in such a tunnel construction .	-3.0265
Normally cocaine is smuggled in smaller quantities and not through tunnels .	-2.7485
This shows the " despair " of drug gangs whose traditional routes have now been cut off , said Bill Sherman of the DEA drug addiction in San Diego .	-4.2193
They would do everything they can to get to the US .	-2.6643
No details have been disclosed to the detainees , at least one was Mexican , it was said .	-10.0603
They have to face prison sentences of up to ten years .	-3.1335
2014 Geisinger ’ s Festive Year	-4.5058
The city of Geisingen was celebrated in 1250 .	-4.8039
The return of the first reference is approaching .	-5.0351
When the year comes to an end in just over eight weeks , the anniversary year is approaching .	-4.6395
Geisingen und Kirchen-Hausen wurden 794 erstmals zurückzurück zu.	-7.3298
A certificate was produced in churches in which both places are mentioned .	-4.8558
On 15 March there will be an official start to the jubilee year , and since there is no hall at present , this opening ceremony takes place in the place where both were first mentioned 1250 years ago , in church houses .	-7.0012
As part of the anniversary , several events are planned both in violins and in church houses .	-5.6043
Kirchen-Hausen will be the 1250 in July at a festive weekend from 18 to 20 July .	-4.8786
Celebrate again .	-2.6862
On Friday with a festive event , on Saturday and Sunday with a festival around the church hall .	-4.4896
This festive weekend is also the Kirchen-Hausen Kirchenfest .	-4.2436
City Music Director Rudolf Barth has written a contract composition for the city on the occasion of the anniversary , which will be performed on three dates .	-5.6043
On June 21 together with the Sonnwendfest of the Schwarzwaldverein , on July 12 in the Arena with Feuerwerk and on December 13 as the first concert of the city music in the new Festhalle .	-4.6886
This will be completed and inaugurated in the jubilee year , the official date is the last weekend of September , 27 and 28 September .	-4.8293
On the occasion of the Geisinger city jubilee a new chronicle is also released .	-4.2619
" It is not just a chronicle of violinists themselves , but a printed work about the violinism of today , which is made up of violins , church houses , Leipzig , Aulfingen and Gutmadingen , " says Mayor Walter Hengstler .	-8.2175
Today ’ s violinism also celebrates 2014 ’ s birthday , and in 1974 today ’ s community-building was completed .	-7.1005
The new chronicle will be presented at the new Festhalle in Geisingen on 21 or 22 November .	-2.9243
But 2014 is another year with many anniversaries .	-3.4701
The Narrenzunft Strohglonki begins on 8 February with a traditional evening on the occasion of its 60th anniversary , the harmony of Gutmadingen becomes 90 years and has the festival banquet on 29 March and then celebrates the district music festival from 1 to 4 May .	-6.7492
The Altenwerk Leipzig becomes 40 years old , the Geisinger School has been at the new location for 50 years and celebrates this on 10 May , the Musikverein Polyhymnia Leipzig is 150 years old and celebrates this in the context of the Brunnenfest from 4 to 7 July .	-5.9203
The town of Geisingen was first mentioned in documents in 764 in the possession of the monastery of St. Gallen .	-4.3069
The document was made in churches ( Hausen ) , which was then a court .	-4.7798
Both communities are therefore mentioned in the same document .	-2.0488
The reason for celebrating this 1250-year-old in 2014 is also 40 years old .	-5.8650
The Council is targeting rail systems	-3.3787
Should the ' Am Hirschen ' railway crossing be reconstructed to increase road safety ?	-4.4093
Yes , the local councils have decided .	-2.7924
Schiltach has to take EUR 220 000 in the hand for this .	-4.3576
Deutsche Bahn wants to improve the Kinzigtal railway line next year .	-3.3236
In particular , safety at railway crossings is to be increased - there are regular collisions of trains with other vehicles throughout Germany .	-5.9167
If the municipalities agree to the reconstruction measures , they will have to pay one-third of the costs , while the rest share the railway and covenant .	-6.9469
Schiltach ’ s builder Roland Grie<unk>haber explained to the Municipal Council the special features of the “ Am Hirschen ” bath house .	-5.8670
There , the city plans to build a rebuilding at the height of the tunnel wall to the west of the railway tracks .	-6.7985
There , larger vehicles , such as those that transport long wood , could also stand in front of the road without having to block the tracks .	-7.7587
Grie<unk>haber therefore proposed to construct a necessary supporting wall in such a way that the city could widen the subsequent road in due course to ensure a smooth flow of traffic .	-5.6376
This was controversial in the municipal council , as some councils questioned the need for road propagation : Thomas Kipp put the critics ' sentiment to the point : ' Do we have to spend so much money on so few vehicles ? '	-7.1026
Mayor Thomas Haas contradicted : The railway crossing " Hirschen " is regularly used for long-wood transports .	-5.0809
Even wood from the " Kuhbach " area is transported partly over this route , because up to 20 meters long vehicles could not use the route at the Häberlesbrücke because they could not turn into the main road .	-6.3058
In addition , the route serves as a diversion for those vehicles that cannot use the tunnel when the main road is closed , Haas argued .	-4.3021
As it is clear that Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnels need to be reconstructed and redeveloped , as is currently the case in Wolffach , the railway crossing " Am " Hirschen " could also have an important significance for a longer period of time .	-6.9494
The Councils agreed to investigate the costs of the planned extension of the road .	-4.1960
Despite this , the majority of the rebuilding of the railway crossing was approved , with the requirement that the necessary supporting wall should be built in such a way that the city could extend the following road towards " Bahnhofstrasse " to about 5.5 metres if necessary for traffic .	-9.1243
On the other hand , the conversion of the railway crossing at the Trautwein tanning could lead to a quite different problem , which concerns access to the strongly rising " Geroltzhäuser Weg " .	-7.7755
The administration had had the railway 's plans examined by the engineering office of Breinlinger , since she had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhäuser Weg would then be possible without further ado .	-8.1485
The study concluded that it is not possible to exclude the fact that the conditions of inclination of the road could lead to longer vehicles being mounted .	-8.7234
The city , in turn , is responsible for this , as a road builder .	-5.5410
The restructuring could therefore lead to liability disputes .	-5.3663
Haas argued that , because both the wood drilling and the turning were working in the current state of construction , it would be advisable not to agree to the change in the railway crossing .	-9.5509
Also , at this point the risk of collision of the train with a vehicle standing on the transition is much lower than at the other railway crossings , because the center is right next to the stop , to which there is a good visibility connection .	-8.9752
Even trains from the main railway station would have to be braked to the point where there is no collision . .	-10.5140
The majority refused to accept the change of the railway crossing , as the city of Schiltach had to " deal " with the problem of stationary vehicles , according to the Councils , since the railway could withdraw from the responsibility after the construction work was completed .	-9.6615
The committee considers the conversions at the railway crossings " Vor Heubach " and " Vor Kuhbach " , for which intersection agreements have already been made by rail .	-7.3082
Esa Chooses Big Space Missions	-9.5697
Far away planets , gravitational waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects that they want to start in the coming years .	-4.4832
There were 30 proposals , five are still in the race .	-4.2299
Far worlds .	-1.1707
More than 1000 planets on other stars have already found astronomers .	-2.3561
No one knows whether there is life on at least some of them .	-3.5447
The choice is difficult : Should you search for gravitational waves ?	-3.7496
Or do you prefer to explore the origin of the cosmos ?	-2.5998
Or search for earthy planets and discover perhaps extraterrestrial life ?	-5.4293
These are the questions that are being asked by the European Space Agency Esa .	-4.7427
For their Cosmic Vision program , they are looking for ideas for two major space projects that are intended to drive research forward .	-5.3532
The budget for such " L missions " is about EUR 1 billion each .	-3.9512
The start is expected to be in 2028 and 2034 .	-2.1307
In early September , the elite of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions .	-1.9039
There were 30 ideas on the table , five of them coming into the narrower choice .	-5.9980
Numerous bodies review the proposals , check with the researchers .	-5.1914
In the next few days a final decision will be taken by the Scientific Programme Committee .	-3.3591
The Esa has selected four major questions to which the missions of the Cosmic Vision programme , initiated in 2007 , will find answers .	-4.7883
What are the conditions for the formation of planets and life ?	-2.0059
The exact events of the formation of stars from large clouds of gas - and thus the formation of planets surrounding these stars - are still in the proverbial darkness .	-5.2750
A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this darkness .	-2.3519
And if a star has planets , under what circumstances can life arise there ?	-3.2035
To address this question , the space telescope " Cheops " will be launched in 2017 , which will examine more closely the 500 already known planetary systems in our vicinity .	-6.0147
But the possibilities are limited , Cheops is a small mission with a budget of EUR 150 million .	-3.1920
With larger instruments , astronomers could map earthly planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres , searching for " biomarkers " : gases that are considered an indication of biological activity .	-5.0172
How does the solar system work ?	-1.1405
This question , too , should ultimately provide information on the conditions for the creation of life .	-5.2823
The magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field and the particle radiation emitted by it with the planetary system play an important role .	-4.2022
In our solar system , these processes can be examined exemplarily .	-3.7637
With the " Solar Orbiter " , Esa has already approved a M-class mission ( there the budget is about half a billion euros ) for this question .	-5.2334
The probe should start in 2017 and observe the surface and activity of the sun closely .	-4.2953
Jupiter and his moons are of great interest to the researchers .	-8.2740
They want to find out what role the giant planet played in the development of the solar system .	-3.3751
The Esa provides for the first of the three L missions of the Cosmic Vision program .	-3.8829
The probe " Juice " ( Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer ) is scheduled to start its journey in 2022 .	-3.6542
Eight years later , she reaches Jupiter to study the atmosphere of the planet and the icy moons of Europe , Kallisto and Ganymed .	-3.8730
What are the basic physical laws of the universe ?	-0.8933
The universe offers many possibilities to study matter under extreme conditions and to examine whether the laws of nature known to us are still valid there .	-4.7135
There may also be deviations that could guide the physicists toward a new theory , under which all known laws of nature can be combined .	-5.4073
How did the universe come about and what does it consist of ?	-2.7851
13.7 billion years ago , our cosmos arose through the Big Bang .	-5.7612
In addition to the common matter , the stars , planets , and living creatures like us , there are dark matter , whose gravity holds galaxies and clusters of galaxies together , and dark energy , through which the expansion of space accelerates .	-6.1920
So far , researchers do not know which physical laws were valid in the first fractions of the Big Bang , nor what dark matter and dark energy consist of .	-4.1405
With " Euclid " , Esa has already approved a M mission , which is scheduled to start in 2020 .	-4.6083
With a special telescope , the probe is intended to examine the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time in the whole sky , thus enabling conclusions on the nature of Dark Matter and Dark Energy .	-5.8824
Who could Race	-1.9974
Of the 30 proposals , only two will remain at the end of the selection process .	-2.2460
In the opinion of many experts , " E-Lisa " has the best chance of being granted an L mission , a sophisticated concept for detecting gravitational waves .	-5.9558
Physicists understand changes in the structure of space time that Albert Einstein predicted almost 100 years ago .	-3.6791
They have not been proven to date .	-3.1161
Elisa could do that , the scientists hope behind the project .	-2.6760
The mission provides a detector consisting of two or three probes , which is stationed in space .	-4.2436
In contrast to plants on Earth , it could also show gravitational waves created by the Big Bang , providing new insights into the evolution of the cosmos .	-6.6633
Four other proposals are still competing for the second L mission : a large X-ray telescope called " Athena " , which is to explore black holes , " Icy Planets " , another mission to the outer planets of the solar system , " Prism " , a mission to measure the cosmic background radiation , and the " Exoplanet Finder " , which is to detect and investigate earthly planets .	-5.4791
Proposals for the return of the Mars , for the study of the moon , Venus and Asteroids as well as solar physics have already been excluded .	-6.9963
Snowden ready to “ cooperate ” with Germany on US surveillance .	-2.7829
Edward Snowden , the whistleblower of the US Intelligence Service , has declared that he is willing to travel to Berlin and say before the German Bundestag if the American National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander do not provide answers about their activities .	-5.2112
German MEP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden in Russia on Thursday , where he received asylum to discuss with him the statement in Germany .	-3.5167
In a letter from Snowden , presented to the media in Berlin on Friday by Ströbele , he writes : “ Although the outcome of my efforts has been demonstrably positive , my government continues to treat a dissent as a breach of loyalty and seeks to criminalize political expression with a threat of criminal punishment , in which no defense is possible . ”	-6.6572
But telling the truth is not a crime .	-1.9215
In the letter Snowden writes that he believes that the support of the international community can convince the American government to drop the charge against him .	-4.3441
The prosecution issued by the US Department of Justice includes espionage and theft of state property .	-3.6765
German Minister of the Interior , Hans-Peter Friedrich , said to Time Online : ‘ If Mr Snowden is prepared to talk to German representatives , we will find ways to make that possible . ’	-4.9984
Relations between the US and Germany are burdened by claims that the NSA has intercepted Chancellor Angela Merkel ’ s cell phone .	-4.3747
Thomas Oppermann , the Member who heads the parliamentary committee responsible for the secret service , said that we should seize the opportunity to listen to Snowden as a witness when this is possible , ‘ without endangering him and completely ruining relations with the United States ’ .	-11.0442
Ströbele , a member of the Greens , published a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed .	-2.7160
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia .	-1.8079
Ströbele explained that , according to the lawyer of the former NSA employee , Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country .	-3.6539
When Snowden says in Germany , he needs an assurance that he is “ safe ” there , according to the honourable Member .	-3.9603
Snowden explains in his letter that he is facing a “ serious and ongoing ” campaign of persecution that has driven him out of his home country .	-4.1625
But it is touched by the global response to “ my act of political expression . ”	-2.8580
Citizens around the world , as well as senior politicians – including in the United States – have described the revelations about an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance as a credit to the general public .	-4.7488
In his letter Snowden gives the German authorities an offer of cooperation “ if the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation have been resolved ” .	-3.7004
Frontier Airlines charges for cabin baggage	-2.0002
Frontier Airlines plans to demand up to $ 100 from passengers who wish to store hand baggage on their flight .	-3.5267
Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to $ 100 for a piece of hand baggage and $ 2 for coffee or lemonade , even though the announcement on Wednesday read that passengers should keep the whole can .	-4.4962
The new charge applies to hand baggage in the baggage compartment above the seat , small bags under the seat are still free of charge .	-3.9256
Frontier explained that you will charge $ 25 if the fee is paid in advance , and $ 100 for travellers who paid only at the boarding gate .	-6.2250
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O 'Malley said that the fee of $ 100 is aimed at moving travelers to take care of the payment beforehand .	-4.8094
“ We don ’ t want to calculate this sum , ” she explained .	-2.7359
In 2008 , airlines started to charge for the first and second checked baggage .	-8.1394
Passengers trying to circumvent them have therefore stacked as much as possible into hand baggage , which means that the luggage compartments above the seat are often overfilled .	-5.4272
Fees are a way to encourage passengers to take less on board .	-3.3944
O 'Malley said that the new fee is not really about earning money .	-2.1729
It is about the most loyal customers of Frontier who have clearly stated that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find a place in the compartment above the seat .	-5.5781
Passengers who purchase your tickets on the airline ’ s website do not have to pay .	-2.6021
This means that a passenger on the Frontier platform may take one piece of baggage free of charge , but the next person may have to pay $ 100 for a comparable piece of baggage .	-4.9858
O 'Malley explained that the Frontier website and the check-in procedures were being changed so that passengers were informed of the fee before they came to the platform .	-5.4753
Frontier ’ s new cabin baggage fee will not enter into force until the summer ; there is no exact date yet .	-5.0794
Passengers often have luggage surcharges and other charges , but airlines like to resort to them .	-5.2652
They argue that the transport of luggage costs money and passengers should pay for this service if they wish .	-4.6481
Many on Wall Street see the new baggage charges as a sign that airlines are taking enough money to cover the costs of air travel after years of loss .	-4.2097
Most people , however , have so far left the finger of charges for hand baggage .	-5.0537
Spirit Airlines Inc. demanded three years ago the first charge for hand baggage and later Allegiant Air , also a low-cost airline .	-5.7534
The only other airline with such a charge is the Hungarian Wizz Air , said the airline advisor Jay Sorensen , who closely follows the additional charges .	-4.5893
In a December 2011 report , he estimated that the Spirit hand baggage fee is $ 50 million a year .	-4.5913
Sorensen , who previously held a leading position with Midwest Airlines , has recently flown to Spirit and was curious about what he would expect at the platform if passengers were confronted with the company ’ s unusual hand baggage charge .	-6.7845
“ The boarding process was one of the smoothest I experienced in my career in aviation , ” he said .	-8.9912
I expected to see tooth cracks and handy discussions at the platform . are .	-5.5210
“ The plane was full , ” he said , “ and boarding ran as lubricated . ”	-2.8474
Frontier also follows Spirit for the 2 dollars required for coffee , tea , lemonade or juice .	-3.3492
The company explained that passengers who bought lemonade or juice should keep the whole can and that coffee should be filled free of charge .	-5.2500
Water is still free .	-1.3622
In 2008 , US Airways briefly tried to demand money for soft drinks , but reversed it seven months later , after passengers complained and no other large company followed suit .	-6.4999
Frontier ’ s move to charge for hand baggage when passengers do not buy directly from the airline is the latest initiative to channel customers to their own website .	-5.2055
Airlines pay online travel agencies such as Orbitz 10 to 25 USD per ticket sold .	-3.1627
This gives all companies an incentive to encourage them to purchase directly from them rather than through an online travel agency .	-5.1121
Frontier , however , has gone the furthest in this area .	-3.3589
In September , the company began to award only half the number of frequent flyer miles when booking through an online travel agency .	-3.9477
On Wednesday , miles were reduced to 25 percent of the route .	-3.5804
For this reason , a flight booked with Frontier over 1000 miles with a third party provider will only bring 250 miles to customers . will . will . will . will . will or . will . or	-13.2344
Passengers can also reserve seats only when purchasing directly from the Frontier website .	-3.8865
Frontier has a loyal customer base at its headquarters in Denver , but the business is shrinking and the company is losing money .	-3.3172
Revenues fell by 9 % , and flight capacity shrunk by just 13 % in the first quarter , as the financial report published on Wednesday by the parent company , Republic Airways Holdings Inc .	-6.4398
Republic has tried to control Frontier ’ s finances as part of the company ’ s sales .	-5.1604
Speakers Coming from the Bible	-2.4472
About 40 women attended the last women 's breakfast this year in the Protestant parish of Bissingen .	-3.6613
The theme of the day at the Municipal House was " Speechwords from the Bible " and " Speech from the Middle Ages " .	-5.5453
Zita Köhler , the chairman of the parish council , gave a lecture on the biblical proverbs after breakfast .	-4.6217
" Speakers contain habits , regulations or warnings , " she explained .	-5.1653
It compared several proverbs with the corresponding Bible posts and explained the meaning .	-4.4173
She called proverbs like : Wooden eyes are vigilant , as scales fall from the eyes , throwing an eye on someone who gives His His there 's the Lord in sleep , wash his hands in innocence .	-6.8364
On several occasions , the speaker also told her audience what the saying was .	-4.8890
In the Middle Ages , the parish of Christel Dehner approached the saying : all good things are three , make a blue , skip something .	-8.5084
She explained the meaning and origin of the phrases she called " bridges to the past " .	-2.8290
At the end a raffle was raffled .	-2.9283
The prizes were concealed on a table and were worshipped humorously before they were handed over to the winners .	-9.2123
Among the visitors to the breakfast round , the mayor ’ s delegate Roman Waizenegger also mixed .	-6.0632
Learning rather than unemployed : pilot project for the Unskilled in Tourism	-4.1942
A pilot project for the tourism industry started at the Mecklenburgische Seenplatte .	-2.8128
Under the leadership of the Federal Employment Agency , 49 women and men , who are already working as unskilled workers in the industry , are to be qualified for hotels and restaurants over three winters .	-6.0378
" New is that the six-month courses end with degrees , " said Carmen Wiechert of the Neubrandenburg Labor Agency .	-4.7728
The benefits are manifold : participants would not be unemployed , firms would receive trained professionals who were increasingly lacking in hotels and restaurants , and the agency would not have to finance unemployment .	-5.7584
The project also includes the Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Neubrandenburg as well as the German Hotel and Restaurant Association ( Dehoga ) Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania .	-3.4847
NSA states that “ internal error ” and not hackers are to blame for the website ’ s crash .	-4.1641
The shadowy National Security Agency explained late Friday that a mistake had paralyzed its public website for a few hours , not hackers , as claimed online .	-4.8061
“ NSA.gov was unreachable this night for several hours because an internal error occurred during a planned update , ” explained the espionage agency in a message sent by email .	-11.2415
The problem will be fixed this evening .	-1.8746
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed denial of service attack ( DDoS ) is not true .	-2.2070
In the early hours of the evening , online server trackers noticed that the NSA website was unreachable for at least six hours , and this is still not available to some users .	-4.6839
Previously , a NSA spokesman told ABC News that the authority ’ s sensitive internal network was “ in no way ” compromised .	-2.9053
Secret information is not in danger , the speaker said .	-3.6297
At least one group of hacktivists claimed to have paralysed the NSA website with a DDoS attack .	-2.3452
In such attacks , the target website is flooded with page views until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses .	-4.6944
Cybertactics are relatively simple and the attacks do not serve to penetrate the internal network of the target system .	-3.4999
The former super-secret NSA , whose nickname was “ No Search Agency ” , is now in the spotlight of the public and is facing sharp criticism of its extensive domestic and international surveillance program , a result of the secret NSA data stolen and published by the disillusioned former NSA employee Edward .	-7.1267
The growing controversy over the secret service fueled initial speculation that the incident today was the result of targeted cyperoperation .	-3.9774
The number of people without jobs fell slightly in October by 22 to 1.307 .	-2.9098
Although the 3.1 % quota was better than last year and also better than in September , " we would have hoped for more , " says Monika Felder-Bauer , Deputy Director of the Employment Agency in Sonthofen .	-5.7449
Many companies have so far responded to their attitudes .	-5.4809
One reason for this , according to Felder-Bauer , is that " we have hardly any skilled workers in the craft , health care and care of the elderly " .	-5.8460
Since September , job opportunities for hotel and catering staff have been taking place again .	-7.0708

Bombardier ’ s loss of profit following a drop in delivery and order .	-5.8339
On Thursday , Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15 % decline in net profits after being put under pressure by declining orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter and contract problems in the rail sector .	-5.8216
Bombardier , based in Montreal , also did not publish flight test data for his brand new CSeries aircraft , and did not provide any new information on whether the aircraft could enter commercial use in accordance with the ambitious timetable next September .	-6.9754
The test aircraft ’ s maiden flight a month and a half followed only three more flights so far , which makes it doubtful whether the test phase is as planned .	-7.0463
The results fell short of the forecasts and resulted in a price drop of more than 8 % on the Toronto stock exchange .	-9.6497
Cameron Doerksen , an analyst at National Bank Financial , lowered his rating on Thursday from “ outperform ” to “ sector performance ” in view of the limited potential of the share in the next one to two quarters .	-6.3532
“ While weaker delivery figures for aircraft were widely expected , we are clearly disappointed with the development of margins in transport , ” said Doerksen in a customer letter .	-12.1947
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries as the aircraft test program progresses .	-4.3230
If , however , no new orders are announced in the coming months , we expect the market to become more sceptical about the program .	-4.2689
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries will be able to catapult the company into the lower market segment currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus .	-3.3330
The first test aircraft was presented to the public in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delays .	-3.5016
But , so far , binding orders for CSERies have been moderate at 177 , as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests and want to see if the company ’ s claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost savings potential of the new jet aircraft are true .	-7.0743
There are currently a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies .	-2.6925
The CEO Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will reach his goal of 300 binding orders at the beginning of the commercial use of the jet .	-4.6439
On Thursday , the management also assured analysts and the media that the programme was in the timetable .	-4.2761
“ The test aircraft was no longer on the ground than expected , ” Beaudoin said at a telephone conference and added that ground tests and software updates were scheduled during the aircraft ’ s lifetime .	-4.8567
Each manufacturer is planning differently .	-2.0573
We have decided to take a first flight and then add a review period , which we have also done .	-9.6497
This is done throughout the programme .	-3.0001
The second of five test aircraft is expected to start in the next few weeks , the rest shortly thereafter , it was said by the company .	-5.0092
However , analysts remain sceptical as to whether the first customer can launch a CSeries aircraft twelve months after the maiden flight .	-4.8209
Bombardier explained that it will review the commissioning planning ( EIS ) and update it in the coming months .	-4.4184
“ The slow progress of the flight test – even if it appears to be in line with bombardments of internal planning – reinforces our view that commissioning is moving to the first quarter of 2015 , ” Doerksen said .	-6.0491
In the third quarter , at the end of September 30 , Bombardier ’ s net gains fell to $ 147 million , or $ 8 cents per share of $ 172 million , or $ 9 cents per share a year earlier .	-4.1549
The adjusted earnings per share are unchanged at 9 cents .	-2.8727
Sales fell slightly , from 4.2 billion dollars to 4.1 billion dollars .	-3.0371
Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and a turnover of 4.56 billion dollars , according to Thomson Reuters I / B / E / S.	-3.1734
The world ’ s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer claims that he delivered 45 aircraft this quarter , a drop of 57 last year .	-3.3061
Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26 .	-1.0278
The order book in the aerospace sector was $ 32.9 billion on 30 September , unchanged from December 31 .	-4.3840
“ In the aerospace sector , the results were in line with our targets , but the low order intake and overall market conditions were disappointing , ” said Beaudoin .	-4.7750
Aerospace sales fell 13 % to $ 2 billion .	-2.6080
Bombardier , the world ’ s largest railway manufacturer , announced that sales in this sector increased by just under 11 % to $ 2.1 billion .	-3.1428
The order book in the transport sector was $ 32.6 billion on 30 September , slightly increasing from December 31 .	-4.4438
The profit margin in the transport sector has been affected by settlement problems in some major contracts .	-4.1866
According to the management , there will be new targets for the fourth quarter .	-3.0716
In the afternoons of Thursday ’ s trade , the Bombardier share fell by 8.5 % , reaching 4.83 Canadian dollars , after announcing that the Google Finance Board , Patrick Pichette , will join the Board of Directors .	-6.2595
Brazil ’ s Embraer SA , the world ’ s third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier ’ s closest rival , reported a 10 % fall in quarterly earnings on Thursday .	-7.9176

Cocaine lawyer who warned drug boss against police investigation must be imprisoned .	-4.5455
Basharat Ditta , 42 , passed information on Neil Scarborough , the underworld size .	-4.0582
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction could come to light .	-2.6213
He was sentenced to three years in prison by Liverpool 's Crown Court .	-6.9718
A well-known criminal defender who warned a drug baron of a major police investigation because he was afraid that his secret drug addiction could be discovered was sentenced to three years in prison .	-4.3252
Basharat Ditta , 42 , provided Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about his activities in drug trafficking after being compromised by his own cocaine addiction .	-2.9104
The criminalist “ first-class ” lawyer , nicknamed “ Bash , ” was arrested in his house in 2011 , after police surveillance of Scarborough , which he had represented in an earlier drug trial .	-6.0125
Officials observed how Scarborough ( 32 ) delivered three bags of cocaine at the house of the lawyer in Blackburn , Lancashire , while he was with colleagues at a dinner in the bar .	-5.3115
The investigation revealed that Ditta regularly consumed Class A drugs after tests found traces of cocaine in his hair , on his wallet , and on credit cards .	-4.0648
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011 , he tried unauthorized to obtain information on the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners .	-3.6431
All four suspects were then monitored by the police in a major investigation into the heroin and cocaine trade in Lancashire , Cumbria , Merseyside , Berkshire and West Yorkshire .	-3.0163
Together with 32 other people , they were later arrested after police secured heroin and cocaine worth <unk> 1.5 million and <unk> 200,000 in cash in a series of house searches .	-4.2043
Ditta , 42 , gave information to the criminals because he feared that his drug addiction could be publicized .	-3.5532
Today , Ditta , who works for Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn , was found guilty and sentenced at Liverpool Crown Court after a three-week trial on two charges for obstructing the judiciary .	-4.9660
In an earlier survey , he admitted the ownership of cocaine .	-3.9011
The lawyer was transferred after the police found out in their investigation against Scarborough that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011 .	-3.2431
Two investigators followed the suspect and saw him go to Ditta ’ s house and put the drugs under the lawyer ’ s garbage with a purity of 60 % in a black golf glove .	-4.8558
Shortly after he delivered the drugs , Scarborough regularly telephoned Ditta at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park .	-4.0009
The lawyer returned home , picked up the drugs , and then nine communications were exchanged between the two .	-3.1842
In court , it became known that Ditta was a “ regular consumption ” of cocaine after class A drugs were discovered in his hair , his wallet , and on his credit cards .	-4.8662
Ditta was later arrested , but refused to take cocaine and said that he spoke to the alleged dealer because he was his client , claiming that her discussion was subject to the “ lawyer ’ s secrecy . ”	-5.4376
During his arrest , Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards , but they were secured and he was taken from a hair sample .	-4.5705
During police interrogation , he stated that he would operate an office under his private address as well as in the workplace , and clients would call him at home for legal matters .	-6.7205
In court , it became known that he had called for important drug traffickers , some of whom he had previously represented , after significant arrests , and informed them of what the investigators knew about them .	-6.1167
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said , “ A criminal prosecutor should know better than anyone else that the law is not broken . ”	-3.6965
Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal defender because he has too much involvement with certain clients .	-4.2953
The relationship in question is not just that of a drug dealer , but a drug dealer who supplies his lawyer with drugs .	-3.7885
Some of his communications were undoubtedly legitimate , because he was the lawyer of those people .	-3.8783
But that went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between lawyer and client .	-3.0934
He acted as far as possible against police investigations , so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities .	-4.5304
Mr Ditta thus discredited his profession .	-2.9535
He was too close to certain clients , especially Scarborough , and allowed his independence to be compromised .	-2.5306
Ditta dismissed any misconduct and claimed , “ If I were a corrupt lawyer , which I am not , and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough , I would not wait 15 hours , but do so immediately . ”	-5.2094
But , after the hearing , Superintendent Lee Halstead of the police in Lancashire said , “ Mr Ditta took the step from a criminal defender to a criminal at the moment he began to buy drugs from organized criminals . ”	-4.7575
His cocaine dependence led to a hopeless compromise and made him susceptible to the motives of leading members of organized crime , who asked him to obtain valuable information on police investigations .	-4.6124
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure public confidence and confidence .	-2.4160
Ditta has lost this confidence and is trying to hide behind the fa<unk>ade of his profession .	-3.9851
The Serious and Organised Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigation against Ditta , which also led to a conviction in three cases of cocaine and obstruction of justice , which underlines our determination to bring criminals to justice .	-4.8632
This case should be a warning to criminals and show that no one can escape the arm of the law .	-2.8441
We will find you and bring you to court .	-1.8541
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after he declared himself guilty of conspiracy to the heroin , cocaine , and cannabis trade .	-3.2779
Thirty-five more people involved in drug trafficking have been sentenced to 153 years of total sentences for drug offences .	-4.8887
On his website , Ditta published an area of questions and answers about himself , stating that his dream job was to represent clients in the death row in America as a lawyer , his ultimate guest at dinner was Mohammed Ali and inequality of opportunity was the motivation for his work .	-5.2341
Revolutionary Work of Church Music	-2.2433
At the end of the festivities on the occasion of its 160-year existence , the Sonderkranz Dunningen will frame two services of worship with the " Deutsches Messe " by Franz Schubert .	-4.7886
After the great success of the musical " Rock my Life " , which excited the spectators in the spring of this year , at the end of the jubilee year , the song crane will enrich two services with the performance of the German Fair of Franz Schubert .	-7.2357
On Saturday , October 26th , this extraordinary exhibition will be held at the St. John Baptist Church in Lackendorf from 19 pm during the evening show at the St. Martinuskirche Dunningen and on Sunday , 27 October from 10 : 15 pm .	-7.9807
The so-called Deutsche Messe with the original title " Songs for the Celebration of the Sacred Sacrifice " , D 872 , is a work of spiritual music by the composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was almost revolutionary at the time of its birth .	-6.4933
The exhibition will be performed as part of the services of God , as the client Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind .	-5.4437
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider , the choir is accompanied by the brass group of the Musikverein Frohnung Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi at the organ .	-4.1357
Haslach : Skepticism Comes Enough	-3.7023
The 2015 parish council elections , for example , will change basic positions in the Haslach ( SE ) ministry .	-5.0358
There is only a common parish council for all six parishes .	-3.4670
In a joint meeting on Saturday , the bodies from Haslach , Hofstetten , Mühlenbach , Fischerbach , Steinach and Welschensteinach prepared for the changes .	-2.9636
The basic decisions of the diocese have nothing to change and it is up to the parish authorities to implement them as satisfactorily as possible .	-5.5173
During the day , it became particularly clear : skepticism about the new slowly but increasingly softens confidence .	-5.4300
From the ideas and expectations of the innovations in 2015 to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the parish council , the extremely constructive discussions between the six bodies with the heads of the ministry of the ministry were enough .	-7.2340
Regionaldean Georg Schmitt explained on the basis of a presentation the new guidelines for seals in the Archdiocese of Freiburg .	-5.5920
After that , the SE Haslach , as a parish , will in future form a body of public law that enters into the rights and obligations of the six individual church communities .	-7.0409
There will only be a common parish council and a board of foundations in which the parish priest is represented .	-4.1789
At least two elected members are to be represented from each parish ; in the six parishes , so-called community teams are formed on the ground .	-5.5937
Their task will be to promote church life in the village in the future .	-4.1180
The question of the finances of the individual parish parish was then very much in need of discussion .	-6.3922
The novelties provide that accumulated funds in the parish are kept for use .	-6.4458
The liabilities , on the other hand , are transferred to the entire . are and .	-8.1690
Particularly with regard to the large planned investments , the commitment of which will then be made by all the parishes , there were major concerns .	-6.9787
" In the past , too , there was only investment in projects that could be managed by the individual parishes alone " , relativized Haslach 's parish chairman Bruno Prinzbach .	-6.4088
Practical experience with a common body for five parishes described Barbar Ritter , the chair of the body in the Schutterwald-Neuried Seelsorgehm .	-5.6999
In 2006 , they set themselves the task of ' becoming one , staying five ' and found that this is not so easy .	-5.6052
The bodies of the Haslacher Seelsorgionen Unit then sought to answer questions on the future composition and size of the common parish council and the practical work of the community teams .	-6.7575
The work will be made concrete at further meetings and will be decided at another joint meeting of all six bodies next spring .	-9.8707
In the end , the parish council of Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the Seelsorge Unit , which was approved by a clear majority .	-4.5664
In Pfullendorf , electricity becomes more expensive .	-3.0439
The citizens of Pfullendorf must prepare for higher electricity costs .	-3.5736
As the managing director of the Stadtwerke , Jörg-Arne Bias , confirmed in front of the SUDKURIER , a four-member Pflullendorfer family will incur between 70 and 90 euros per year .	-6.0364
The main reason for the upcoming price increase is the rise in the so-called EEG levy from 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt-hour .	-4.0160
This levy is redefined every year in October by the four operators of the large electricity lines .	-4.7678
They estimate the additional costs arising from the energy transition that they can incur by levying a levy over the electricity price .	-6.8431
The Stadtwerke Pfullendorf is the last link in this chain .	-3.3665
In its forecasts , the Energy Company ’ s Supervisory Board even assumed a higher levy , as Jörg-Arne Bias reported .	-3.8335
The concrete figures would have to be calculated before the city works could inform their customers about the exact price increase next week .	-5.6761
" We are starting from an increase of 1 cent plus x " , says Bias , where the number will be closer to 2 cents .	-5.4600
Permanent traffic light : Look at waiting time .	-8.0074
Sometimes a traffic light is simply not green .	-3.1638
The contact loop in the street does not react , or the light sign is broken .	-2.7390
What can you do - drive on red ?	-5.1277
If a concerned person has waited long enough at a red light and the crossing is free , he can continue , the Stuttgart-based lawyer Ralf Becker explains in the magazine " Motorrad " .	-5.3143
The waiting period must , however , be ' appropriate ' , which can be interpreted differently on a case-by-case basis .	-4.1681
Becker advises you to stay for at least five minutes before starting to disturb the traffic lights .	-5.1841
However , anyone who continues to drive in spite of red light must be aware that he bears the full blame for an accident caused by it .	-6.8284
Those who tolerate less than five minutes may not wait long enough , warn Becker and refer to a decision by the Supreme Court of Hamm .	-4.2628
In the negotiated case , a driver had ignored the traffic lights after about three minutes and had to answer for a negligible red light breach .	-6.5391
After all , the traffic lights were not defective , but moved to green a little later .	-5.9983
He was spared a driving ban because of the particular situation - but the fine was not .	-4.5905
Town Council is pleased with a sound budget	-4.7063
Whenever municipal meetings are about the budget , mayor Ralph Gerster laughs well .	-8.6953
The municipal sack in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled , and the administration has been unaware of debt since 2005 . .	-9.0901
The 2012 financial year can also be seen as a full success in this respect .	-3.5450
This was evident in the presentation of the 2012 accounts .	-3.4285
As Andrea Rothmund pointed out , the administrative budget of around EUR 7.6 million was more than a million higher than planned .	-4.4271
The surplus of the administrative budget , at around EUR 1.8 million , was also around EUR 1 million above the approach .	-5.0511
The surplus was mainly due to higher commercial tax revenue and the municipal share of income tax .	-5.6813
The asset budget , too , was clearly above the planned values .	-4.8099
Instead of the EUR 1.5 million envisaged , it was EUR 2.5 million last year .	-2.4912
" This is essentially due to the higher budget allocation , " Rothmund says .	-5.4901
Since less investment was made in 2012 than planned , the return rate has also been higher .	-4.9754
Overall , the overall reserve was increased by around EUR 2.1 million to a total of EUR 4.9 million . were .	-4.1612
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for the good work .	-1.9596
" You don 't shake such a work out of your sleeve " , Gerster praised with a view to the accounts .	-5.2972
He and the local authorities were visibly pleased with the good figures .	-4.5120
It may sound paradoxical , but these very good figures could soon cost citizens dearly .	-3.9083
Due to the good financial situation , the municipality has in the past been able to avoid high levers .	-6.7926
In turn , according to Gerster , subsidies have often been cut from the country .	-4.9373
There are conditions for these subsidies from various compensatory instruments .	-5.3399
Amongst other things , cities and municipalities applying for grants must have certain levies .	-4.2302
" We have to look at the issue of hoisting , because in the coming years we will have to invest for which we would like to have subsidies , " Gerster announced in this context .	-6.7395
Nagold : Hugo Wermter in Choir for 60 years	-1.5752
With 60 years as a singer , Hubert Wermter ’ s story is almost twice as long as that of the autumn festival , in which he was solemnly honoured .	-6.0152
Hubert Wermter was on stage as usual in the colours of his men ’ s singing club .	-3.8535
Even after 60 years he still enjoys singing with the now probably more than beloved choir .	-4.9178
Wermter was also active in the association , including 28 years as a member of the committee .	-3.6147
He was awarded several awards for his commitment and charity : Jörg Kohr , a pastoral lecturer on behalf of the Cecilian Association Rottenburg-Stuttgart , presented him - since the choir is also a church choir - a certificate of the association and an honorary letter signed by Bishop Gebhard Fürst .	-7.0749
His singers presented him with the certificate of the German choir association and a engraved tin plate .	-5.1291
In addition to the award , the 31st Autumn Festival took place in the usual tracks : with the MGV Beu , the Sonderkranz Salzstetten , the singers ’ department Baisingen and the local music club , the vollmaringer had loaded a colourful mix of different choirs and vocal styles , which entertained around 400 visitors .	-9.2286
The MGV Vollmaringen opened with atmospheric songs like " Im Weinparadies " and " Lustig , her brothers " .	-3.5662
Their honorary chancellor Hubert Wermter , they prepared a small stand in honor - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart 's " Bundeslied " .	-6.2035
Men ’ s song association Beu also sang classical choral songs such as " Jägerwerben " by Julius Wengert , " Weit , far away " by Hubert Goisern as well as the folk song " When you go through the valley " .	-5.1661
The Sonderkranz Salzstetten , with his mixed choir and his group of women - the " Impulschor " - gave the festival the women 's quota .	-6.5515
The mixed choir , with the Neapolitan " Santa Lucia " and " Eviva Espana " by Antos Gus , abducted to foreign countries , while the " Impulschor " also used foreign languages : " Liberatio " and " Hey Jude " were part of their program .	-5.3984
The singers department of the Baisinger Sportverein returned to the local scene with " What isch der Schwab ? " by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Pappert 's " Beerlied " , where the Vollmaringer Musikverein offered the crowning musical conclusion .	-6.9916
For the children there was a small side-programme - " Grandma Hanne " alias Hannelore Stollsteimer gave up a Kaspersteater and read out a few stories that the children had a good time at midday .	-8.7723

Kenya ’ s Press Depends on Dispute Media Law	-4.3444
“ We are in a frightening situation and we should ask ourselves : what does Parliament stop doing away with judicial independence tomorrow ? ” was read in the newspaper , which considers the draft law to be unconstitutional .	-7.1176
“ The law is draconian and very punitive , and we reject it , ” said Cyrus Kamau , Managing Director of the Capital Group , including CapitalFM , one of Kenya ’ s most respected independent radio stations and news sites .	-3.9066
He said that the new media tribunal “ will always be biased , because it is an extended government arm , ” and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya ’ s position in the global economy .	-3.0083
“ I hope the President listens to us and we appeal to him to reject this draft law and send it back to Parliament , ” he said .	-3.2928
According to The Star newspaper , the government is using the new “ media effectively in a stranglehold , ” whereas The Standard , democracy , and freedom of speech in Kenya had “ suffered a heavy blow , ” and called the draft “ draconian . ”	-6.2339
The adoption of the law is part of a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security following the attacks by armed Islamists on the Westgate shopping centre in September .	-4.1726
The Kenyan media attracted the authorities ’ anger because they published shots of security cameras showing how the units sent to the scene supposedly robbed the luxury shopping center .	-6.6963
Police chief David Kimaiyo responded by ordering two journalists and a leading media representative to interrogate , even though the charge was withdrawn after an outcry from the media . were . were . were . were . were . were . were . , were .	-10.3612
According to the new law , media houses can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists with up to one million and the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation .	-4.8041
The tribunal also has the right to confiscate the possession of those affected if a penalty is not paid .	-3.4013
According to Daily Nation , “ a single penalty can push most radio stations into bankruptcy . ”	-2.7282
Moreover , the newspaper believes that these measures could have a devastating effect on what it describes as “ vibrant blogosphere ” in Kenya .	-4.1055
If they silence the media , politicians could do whatever they want with impunity .	-3.0344
“ No one will ever know it , ” wrote Mutuma Mathiu , a journalist in the nation who calls the Kenyan media a decisive factor in public life .	-5.1687
“ Leaving politicians to themselves , they lead the country into bankruptcy , and back to the time of hunters and collectors , ” he commented .	-4.4932
Kenyan legislators have been raising public anger in the past .	-3.9121
In May , they voted to reverse the cuts imposed by the National Compensation Commission and reintroduced their defunct salaries of about 532,000 schillings a month – one of the highest in the world .	-6.2494
Bad-Dürrheim : A Dream Turns True for the FC	-2.7166
The importance for the city and the football club had nothing to do with the official opening ceremony for the artificial grass sports ground , despite the cold weather and the rain .	-5.8618
I think that everyone wanted a more pleasant holiday last Saturday , but Peter did not want to play .	-6.5970
So all those who came without an umbrella or could not keep one for some reason had a loss .	-6.4831
This was done by the musicians who framed the festival , just like many speakers .	-6.1064
For this reason , Nass also became FC Chairman Albrecht Schlenker , who talked about fulfilling a dream .	-6.4480
His thanks were mainly due to the mayor Walter Klumpp , who has made a strong commitment to the implementation of the project , the municipal council , the participating companies and club members who contributed .	-7.2428
Especially Lothar Held , Paul Weizenegger , Heiner Gail and Peter Graf .	-1.9319
Armed pensioners laid 400 square metres of pavement for the new paths .	-4.5416
This remarkable volunteer commitment was also appreciated by the Landtag Member Karl Rombach .	-4.7491
Other greetings spoke for the municipal sports committee Hubert Baier , the district chairman of the South Baden football association , Kuno Kayan , and Friedrich Knorr of the planning office , who announced a donation to the youth department of the club .	-5.4297
Mayor Klumpp recalled that recurring weather-related influences in spring and autumn put the original lawn in such a way that it could not be played .	-6.7852
Already 15 years ago , there was the first consideration to resolve the problem when the construction of a third place at the football club or at the real school at the Salinensee was planned .	-7.6213
Both were rejected .	-2.6230
Six years ago , there were ideas about setting up an artificial turf field , which was generally regarded as the ultimate solution .	-5.6439
Concrete plans were introduced two years ago , when the FC took over the Schabelstube in Erblecht , promised a cost share of EUR 100 000 for the construction of the place , and the country approved subsidies of EUR 104 000 .	-6.3611
In October 2012 , the municipal council decided to take over the remaining EUR 356 000 at the total cost of EUR 560 000 , summed up Klumpp .	-4.0456
The construction of the 68 x 108 meter artificial turf course started on 4 June .	-5.1658
During the construction phase of over three months 3000 cubic meters of ground were taken off , half of which was used for the installation of a dirt bike route .	-6.1759

On the subject of transport , which is not on the agenda this Friday , the SPD underpinned its rejection of a car toll demanded by the CSU .	-4.4116
A vignette is a ' flatrate for a lot of driving and therefore environmentally counterproductive ' , said the SPD negotiator on transport , Florian Pronold , in a letter to his group .	-5.1406
Exit traffic on highways , which are already the main areas of accidents , threatened .	-7.1771
In addition , the introduction of a toll for all cars would only be a first step from the point of view of Pronold .	-4.0841
" There is a danger that the compensation for Germans will be cancelled later , " he said .	-3.8827

Vienna Airport Calls Passenger Calls	-3.5205
Mr Max Maier , please come to Gate 24 .	-1.2193
How this will stop at Vienna Schwechat Airport in the future .	-4.3637
A large part of the loudspeaker announcements are thus removed - the noise level is to be significantly reduced .	-6.2012
The aim of this innovation is to create a more relaxed atmosphere .	-2.4681
As Airport-Speaker Peter Kleemann announced to Radio Vienna , Vienna Airport is following an international trend with the cessation of announcements concerning individuals .	-4.9785
For example , the airports in Copenhagen , Frankfurt or Dubai are already giving up the noisy calls .	-4.2683
The absence of these announcements - an average of around 200 personal calls from the speakers in one day - will make it more peaceful in the future at the airport .	-8.4241
" It has also been shown in experience that these individual announcements have been perceived relatively little , but at the same time all other information about changed flights or departure times has been lost here a bit , " says Kleemann in conversation with the radio station .	-8.1824

50 grams of apple or a tablespoon of ground linseed plus three tablespoons of water are suitable for this .	-9.2025
Lockers become doughs instead of egg for example with a mixture of a teaspoon baking powder , a tablespoon of meal strength and three tablespoons of mineral water .	-3.9831
But also 50 grams of soya yoghurt or silk stofu can serve this purpose .	-4.6020
According to the Vebu , some 800 000 people in Germany are currently eating vegan , i.e. purely vegetable .	-4.5365
Sleep in New York	-2.4073
On the way to their host families in Weymouth , Massachusetts , students of the Black Forest Gymnasium met the American metropolis of New York .	-3.3541
After eight hours of flight we went straight to the Brooklyn Bridge , where the heart of Manhattan was reached on foot .	-4.7112
A fascinating view of the world-famous skyline was already offered here , which is a special attraction in the evening light .	-6.3662
By the time shift , the students were on their feet almost 24 hours , but according to the motto " The city doesn 't sleep " the day was decided on at Times Square .	-6.1868

The newly designed Opschlag shines with a new cafe .	-3.4420
One that invites you to stay and come back again .	-3.5045
One that wants to make the name a program .	-2.8294
According to Lexicon , Déjà Vu is a psychological phenomenon that manifests itself in the feeling of having experienced or seen a new situation .	-4.8692
In case of a visit to the Café of the same name at the Opschlag in the district town of Kleve in sight to the Rhine-Waal University , it does not have to stay with the pure Déjà Vu feeling .	-6.3696
After all , the Café with its beautiful name has precisely this aim : to make a real stay not only mentally but also hand in hand always possible .	-9.4124
Because it 's fun and simply beautiful .	-2.7063
A look into the inner life at Opschlag 8 gives the viewer a good feeling at first .	-4.6018
The ultra-modern but not cool café ambience looks like a place to feel good .	-4.5047
Here , the team , with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the top , spoils guests with a variety of coffee and cocktail options .	-5.0262
You can also enjoy delicious cakes or freshly prepared baguettes .	-5.2634
The owners , both 33 years old , had already made a name for themselves before the opening of the pretty cafés at the Opschlag as a gastronomy : in Kranenburg they led the " Art Lounge " .	-11.1357
From the move to Kleve to the Opschlag , the friendly café lovers hope for more audience .	-5.5551
Not least through the university .	-2.8388
" Where we do not have a particular target group " , Daniel Büttner points out .	-4.0354
Rather , the two here want to address young students in the same way as senior citizens and all age groups .	-4.7819
Speaking of cafe lovers .	-1.8284
The friendly owner couple stands behind the coffee enjoyment .	-3.8855
Enjoy the fragrant hot brew in a variety of variations .	-9.6443
Expressofan	-0.9510
Daniel Büttner is rather the Expresso fan and Mirjam van der Stelt the Cappuccino drinker .	-2.5987
" A baguette - that 's my thing " , she betrays the NRZ .	-4.6108
Two events took place in the bright café .	-3.4174
Better to say one .	-1.5489
After all , the Port Festival took place outside - Café Déjà Vu did not benefit from it .	-4.3406
But there was also the wrist night .	-3.4323
" Beautiful , successful and funny " , the two 33-year-olds found .	-3.8497
But not everyone 's cause .	-3.0430
Daniel Büttner may not be a fan of Event Events for that reason either : " You can 't make it right for everyone .	-7.5979
And with an event I always only address those who are interested in the special event .	-4.5503
Therefore events will be the exception .	-7.3082
" We want to disturb the normal operation as little as possible " .	-2.7273
In other words , Déjà Vu also stands for reliability .	-2.7708
With regard to the quality of the products offered here , as well as to the team and the beautiful surroundings at the Opschlag in Kleve .	-3.2745
The road that is increasingly becoming a gastronomic part .	-3.6991
To the delight of many adhesives , the guests from near and far and the students who discover the Gastro parts and thus also the Café Déjà Vu for themselves .	-6.3001

A Day of Thanking at the MGV in Dinker	-2.7002
It was the 165th Founding Festival to which the MGV " Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker " invited this year and 52 guests , active singers and their wives , were happy to come .	-4.5603
In the Vereinslokal of the restaurant " Witteborg " in Dinker , everyone enjoyed the harmonious co-existence in the spirit of music .	-6.9951
Traditionally , the Stiftungsfest is always the right festival for honors .	-4.2810
This time , writer Rolf Wagener was delighted by the special award " Singer of the Year " .	-4.7769

" New gentle voices are always welcome " , says Schlotmann .	-3.4012
UN proclaims New Deals on Poverty Reduction	-4.1701
The United Nations is starting to draw up a series of new objectives to replace the Millennium Development Goals on poverty reduction , announced twelve years ago .	-5.2117
In the run-up to the UN Sustainable Development Summit , which began in Rio de Janeiro on the evening , Australian diplomats played a key role in pushing for “ sustainable development goals ” to replace the Millennium Goals , which expire in 2015 .	-4.2784
They have been included in the final draft of the document which will be adopted by world leaders , including Mrs Gillard , at the summit .	-2.6197
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at the summit in the evening that the time had come to “ think beyond national interests . ”	-3.8765
“ I am pleased that member states have agreed to start a process to agree on universal , sustainable development goals , ” he said .	-3.7305
“ These goals will be based on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and will form an integral part of the post-2015 development framework .	-3.3915
I will spare no effort to implement this mandate given to me by the member states to achieve our vision of the Sustainable Development Goals , based on the success of the Millennium Goals . ”	-4.5770
Even though the SG Achim / Baden has been without victory for four days , the Handball Oberliga is still in a good mood .	-4.7838
Trainer Tomasz Malmon leaves no doubt about this at all .	-3.5612
All of them are still fully motivated in . . are . . are . . are . . are . .	-8.3801
Nevertheless , I hope that we will finally win again .	-3.1488
" Because I don 't know how such a victory tastes , " Malmon expects a success experience from his team at the VfL Fredenbeck II .	-4.7006
Although the third league reserve from Fredenbeck has not yet thrown out trees , Malmon warns the point finger in advance .	-5.9099
I have trained many players myself in the A youth .	-4.6918
Therefore , they will certainly be particularly motivated against their ex-coach .	-4.0955
" In addition , it is important to wait and see if there is any reinforcement from the first , " explains the SG-Coach .	-7.1045
In order to finally return to the track of success , the Malmon team must definitely increase compared to previous appearances .	-5.2563
Especially in the cover work and in the switch-over game , the last thing was quite awful .	-7.9167
Recovery of opportunities must definitely also be improved .	-4.1115
So I hope my players have finally got their heads free during the short break .	-4.3249
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing in the face of clashes between influential figures .	-2.2599
Thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo under the watchful eyes of the statue of Samora Machel , the founder of the state and the first President of Mozambique , to call for peace in a rare public demonstration .	-4.0637
“ We want peace again , we want stability , ” said Vanessa de Sousa , Managing Director of an investment company .	-2.3953
For fear of the country ’ s future , she has exchanged her business clothes against a T-shirt with the label “ We demand security ” in Portuguese and joined the crowd on Thursday in the capital ’ s Independence Square .	-6.8456
For almost two weeks , there have been reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo , which are among the worst fights since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago .	-3.9406
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement , initially supported by white-ruled Rhodesia and later by South Africa ’ s apartheid government in an effort to destabilize the country ’ s independent government .	-4.2363
After the 1992 peace treaty , it became an opposition party .	-1.9419
Analysts consider it unlikely that the country will return to a full-blown conflict , but recent events have worried foreign investors and locals .	-3.5222
There is much at stake for the fast-growing economy , because the discovery of vast offshore gas and northwest coal deposits could bring in more than $ 50 billion in investment from firms like Rio Tinto , Vale from Brazil , Eni from Italy , and Anadarko from the US in the coming years .	-6.6201
The ruling Frelimo party , the dominant force since 1975 , and Renamo blame each other for the tensions .	-2.4818
Renamo claims that the government provoked the recent clashes by attacking its members in the province of Sofala , a traditional renamos stronghold , on October 17 .	-3.7414
The attacks on the former rebels escalated when government forces attacked Renamo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama , the group ’ s leader , Renamo ’ s spokesman told the Financial Times .	-3.6764
The government blames Renamo for the clashes and accuses the organization of having attacked soldiers .	-2.4268
President Armando Guebuza has tried to downplay concerns about instability .	-1.8236
On Wednesday , he told AFP , the French news agency , that Dhlakama regards himself as a “ loser , ” who “ wants to use all his remaining forces to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government . ”	-4.5531
Both Frelimo and Renamo emphasize that they want to avoid war .	-2.2755
But concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted as saying that Renamo abandoned the 1992 peace agreement .	-3.1993
He explained to the FT that he meant that Frelimo no longer respects the agreement .	-4.3509
“ Our vision is to resume negotiations , and seriously , ” Mazanga said .	-3.5790
Previous discussions between the parties have contributed little to resolving the tensions fueled by a series of clashes this year .	-3.9199
“ We have here two adult men ( Guebuza and Dhlakama ) who come together the heads , ” says Joseph Hanlon , lecturer at Open University and Mozambique expert .	-3.7562
None of them is good at negotiating and none is prepared to make the necessary concessions .	-3.2775
Renamo , who is pushing for electoral reform , has already said that she will boycott the local elections in November .	-3.3045
Presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for next year .	-1.4585
Some commentators have interpreted the use of force as an attempt by an angry movement to obtain concessions and financial benefits from the government .	-3.1862
Renamo ’ s electoral success has shrunk since 1992 , while a newer party , the Movimento Democrático de Mo<unk>ambique ( MDM ) , founded by a former Renamo member , is likely to improve in the elections .	-4.1756
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – whose resignation is due when his second term ends next year – wants to destroy the country ’ s democracy .	-2.5996
“ He does not want multi-party democracy , he does not want transparent elections , he does not want peace because he does not want to give up the presidency , ” says Mazanga .	-3.2030
It is unclear what capacity Renamo has , but it has made restless attacks on police stations and vehicles on important North-South connections .	-4.7332
Most of the battles took place in the province of Sofala , which is a few hundred kilometres north of Maputo , where Beira is located , the port that mining companies like Rio Tinto and Vale use to export coal .	-5.3895
In June , Rio interrupted the use of the railway for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the route .	-3.6275
Mazanga responded cautiously to the question of whether Renamo will repeat this threat .	-3.4493
Renamo wanted to “ warn the international community that things are not good in Mozambique , ” Mazanga said .	-2.4427
Instability has increased frustration over the government , says Fernando Lima , head of Mediacoop , an independent media company , because many people have already worried about corruption , slow progress in development , and a recent wave of abduction .	-4.6035
“ People think that the government and the president are responsible for the country ’ s future , and he should be the one who finds solutions to the problems , ” he explains .	-3.3463
Omar Sultane , a demonstrator , said people simply wanted stability .	-1.6878
" No one is interested in Renamo and Frelimo , they just want peace and usable roads again , " he explained .	-3.9301
Children should be taught myths and legends as “ models for life , ” says an author .	-3.1879
Thor ’ s stories showed that “ brutal power has no chance against clever tricks , ” and the Artus legend demonstrates how important it is to have a dream .	-3.4435
But many of the myths are “ far too wild , too offensive , and in some cases too dirty to be taught in schools , ” which is why Crossley-Holland argued for a “ careful selection ” of age-appropriate works .	-4.9664
“ I find it wonderful that myths and folklore are already part of education in America , ” he said .	-2.6025
I have been proposing this as a plan for twenty years .	-6.1574
He added that authors and teachers who are “ excessively didactic ” would “ disable ” children completely , because in entertaining stories the messages would be “ entertaining . ”	-4.7130
Crossley-Holland , who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales , declared : “ You can pursue certain intentions , but you should keep them in the background as far as possible . ”	-4.3529
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an author writing for children is the need to convey hope .	-2.7455
Not everything must be simplified or lead to the happy end , but there is an inherent sense of good and evil .	-2.8664
It must be presented in a subliminal manner , revealed by history and not explained .	-6.1223
This is the old story of showing instead of telling .	-2.1785
Hansjakob Goes Again in Freihof	-2.5144
100 years ago Heinrich Hansjakob moved to Haslach , where his last years were lived in the " Freihof " on Sunday .	-4.7510
The many spectators were thrilled by the very short scene game .	-4.6818
From the arrival to the award of honorary citizenship to his death , the script writer and Hansjakob actor Alois Kraftzcyk had designed an entertaining piece that received much applause under the direction of Cornelia 's people .	-6.3192

He was a true , stylish-minded man with the twins and " Schwarzwälder Füchsen " by Erich Becherer from Mühlenbach .	-9.1706
He was received not only by the audience with much applause , but his sister Philippine also welcomed him .	-4.4183
Billy Sum-Hermann understood it incredibly well to take part in the role of her sister and gave her in mimics and gestures of immense life .	-6.1092
The Mühlenbacher Bauerkapelle played perfectly selected pieces between the various scenes and rounded off the performance .	-7.1022
Haslach ’ s mayor , Heinz Winkler , gave himself the honour to award honorary citizenship , who , in representation of the then incumbent Hättich , together with a part of the city council , made his appearance .	-8.5998
The three royal singers , who led Hansjakob to the exclamation , then made their awakening : " Oh how beautiful , there are again youth memories of my own three-royal age " .	-9.5262
With their song " O Jesulein " they enjoyed the public in the Freihof as well as the stork children with their loud " Ed , Ed " .	-6.3265
At that time , Hansjakob expressed his criticism of the Church , as did his concerns about the excesses in agriculture , the consequences of industrialization , or the effects of war .	-5.8703
In his homeland , behind his grave chapel on the Brand near Hofstetten , he found his retirement place .	-8.5799
" A restless mind had finally found its calm and had gone home forever " , it was said at the end of the scene game .	-5.6363
Much applause and many praiseworthy words were received from the audience for the performance .	-4.1641
Basketball : The Hope of the Neckar Giants Grows	-7.6121
The chances for the league rest of the sporty Ludwigsburg Bundesliga basketball team have increased .	-5.7030
If there is a wildcard procedure , there is now a competitor less for the Neckar Giants .	-4.2503
The Basketball project Hamburg Towers does not apply for a possible backyard .	-4.5044
" We will not participate in the wildcard process , " said former national player Pascal Roller , who has been setting up the concept for a professional club in the Hanseatic city since 2012 .	-4.1710
A first breath from Ludwigsburg was still not heard .	-5.2256
" We did not deal with the Wildcard procedure until it was established that Düsseldorf was not granted a license , " said Neckar Giant Boss Alexander Reil of our newspaper .	-5.2988
Until 23 May , Beginner Düsseldorf Baskets can submit documents to the Arbitration Court and prove his economic Bundesliga suitability .	-7.3264
So far , however , the licence has been refused twice to the Rhine countries .	-3.5576
The Arbitration Court is the last instance .	-6.2748

" The signals serve security and are legally required , " says Matthias Schrell , Managing Director of the Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven .	-3.4074

" This year we want to crack the 3-million-tonne brand in the envelope " , says Schrell .	-5.9840
In addition to the local Eon power plant , the import coal goes to power plants in the inland .	-5.0469
If the GDF-Suez power station goes on the net , a good 5 million tonnes of coal per year would be realistic .	-5.7542
The three ship chargers on the bridge and the second transport belt could create up to 10 million .	-3.6607
Bayern ’ s Basketballer ’ s First Defeat Optimistic	-4.5261
Even the first defeat in the Euroleague could not diminish the enormous optimism among the basketballers of the FC Bayern Munich .	-4.0390

Ben Greenman : Ten Years of New York Comedy Festival	-7.1346
One might say that New York City is the birthplace of Stand-up Comedy in America : nearly a hundred years ago , Frank Fay , who worked as a Conférencier at the Palace Theatre on Broadway , began to tell the crowd directly jokes in the form of a conversation .	-5.6694
Over the years , Fays Innovation has been expanded , as last time at the New York Comedy Festival .	-4.3681
Created and directed by Caroline Hirsch , the founder of the stand-up institution Carolines , this year the festival celebrates its ten-year anniversary with over sixty shows in small clubs and big theaters .	-4.6257
“ Most of these headliners began with Carolines and became more successful until they were too known to appear in a club , ” said Hirsch .	-6.2865
We have designed this festival so that we can continue to work with them .	-6.1908
This year ’ s event will include performances by Wanda Sykes , Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher , as well as “ Stand Up for Heroes ” , an annual music and comedy benefit event for army veterans at Madison Square Garden , where Bruce Springsteen , Jon Stewart , Roger Waters and Bill Cosby perform .	-4.7508

Jenny Slate was part of the cast in both Saturday Night Live and Parks and Recreation , although she is best known for her viral video series “ Marcel the Shell with Shoes On ” .	-4.1327
Both Kroll and Slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices ( the surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik , the ironic , racial W. Kaumau Bell ) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy .	-3.6953
One of the biggest visitors to the festival is an interview : David Steinberg talks to Larry David .	-3.2490
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian , but has become a respected television and film director and an unofficial comedy historian .	-3.3924
From 2005 to 2007 he hosted a TV show entitled Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg on TV Land .	-3.2767

Uruguay ’ s Drama : Young Killing Gamblers with Machete	-4.7065
Two children admitted the murder of a 11-year-old in Uruguay .	-2.1243
The two 14 and 12 year old boys invited their victims to go on bird hunting with them .	-3.8751
Armed with machetes and knives , they resurrected the 11-year-old on Tuesday and threw the corpse into a well , the newspaper " El País " reported on Thursday .	-3.9965
They would then have played football in front of their homes in a working-class quarter .	-3.1902
The corpse was found on the following night in Cerro Pelado , 15 kilometres north of the exclusive beach resort of Punta del Este .	-3.5764
As an alibi , a five-year half-sister of the younger , who had taken her with her , should say that she had been sexually attacked by the boy .	-5.1946
But when the girl described the incident in front of the police without mentioning an attack against them , the two boys admitted the deliberate killing of the 11-year-old .	-4.8802
As a reason , the elderly called , among other things , a rivalry in the football game .	-5.0069
He was provisionally admitted to a psychiatric youth institution .	-3.7253
Conductors Must Jail	-5.4313
Due to exploitative trafficking in human beings , pimping , threat , insult and dangerous bodily injury , the District Court of Konstanz has sentenced a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen to three and a half years ' imprisonment .	-4.7882

He used to break with violence and threats .	-2.6463
He retained the revenues of women , some of whom had been acquired for years .	-5.4789
By confiscating mobile phones and SIM cards , he helped women contact the outside world .	-4.0218
Together with a colleague who mediated the women , he brought them to various brothels in the southwest .	-3.5610
There , he partly supervised them in order to control their revenue .	-5.0894
In court , the defendant initially claimed that he suffered a severe trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan killed him in an explosion .	-5.0443
After a psychiatric expert implied great doubts about the mental restriction and thus limited guilt , the 33-year-old made a comprehensive confession .	-7.1677
The court no longer had to hear any of the injured women .	-3.2440
As a Kripo official reported , at least four more cases of exploitative trafficking could be identified after a first notification by telephone surveillance .	-5.9065
The intercepted talks were highly aggressive .	-2.5812
In subsequent interrogations , the injured parties would have confirmed their martyrdom .	-3.0585
Another witness , in which one of the women had discovered blue spots throughout the body , has not yet made any statement .	-5.3939

" He had dissolved himself from these circles and wanted to lead a quite normal life after arrest , " he said .	-5.4827
Oil Price Returns Up to USD 96 per Barrel	-3.8637
The price of oil continued to fall on Friday , after concerns about a high supply overshadowed a report that China ’ s energy-hungry manufacturing sector is growing .	-3.5488
In December , the reference crusher for deliveries fell by 14 cents to $ 96.24 per barrel in electronic commerce in Europe in the late morning .	-7.3970
The contract fell by 39 cents on Thursday , which meant a 5.8 % fall in October .	-3.3436
The large supply of crude oil has burdened prices in recent weeks .	-4.2680
On Wednesday , the US Department of Energy declared that the US supply increased by 4.1 million barrels last week .	-2.7104
Over the course of five weeks , the supply had increased by 25 million barrels .	-3.0967
But on Friday , there was evidence of increased demand through two reports of increased activity in Chinese manufacturing .	-3.3625
This suggests a continued recovery in China ’ s economy , which grew to 7.8 % in the third quarter , after reaching the lowest level in the previous quarter in two decades .	-4.9797
Crude oil from Brent , a reference value for international crude oil , also used by US refineries , fell by 26 cents at the ICE Exchange in London to USD 108.58 per barrel .	-4.4490
Trial Blocks NYPD Stop and Risk Directive	-3.4262
On Thursday , a federal court in the US blocked the order of a judge who called for changes to the New York Police Department ’ s Stop and Risk Program ( “ Stop and Browse ” ) , and removed the judge from the case .	-5.7861
The 2nd US Court of Appeal declared that Judge Shira Scheindlin ’ s decisions would be suspended until a decision has been taken to appeal the city .	-4.9722
The judge had ruled in August that the city contravened the constitution with the way in which the program for the holding and questioning of persons was implemented .	-5.8433
The city appealed against its assessment and the prescribed remedies , including the decision to set up a monitoring body to assist the police in amending their directive and the corresponding training programme .	-5.8723
On Tuesday , the Court of Appeal heard the arguments for the requested suspension .	-3.8100
The appeal report stated that the judge had to be released from the case because she violated the Code of Conduct for US judges by stipulating that a judge should avoid the appearance of partiality ; this was partly justified by a series of media interviews and public statements in which she publicly responded to the Court ’ s criticism .	-6.3330
The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people because they unfairly targeted black and Latin American men with the Stop and Bridge programme .	-5.3358
It appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of major changes , including reforms in directives , training , and service supervision , and ordered a pilot program with cameras on the body in quarters where most controls were carried out .	-6.1017
In August , the city of New York agreed to end the practice of storing names and addresses of people who were dismissed after police control .	-3.6339
An oral trial for the city 's appeal is planned after March 14 , 2014 .	-4.6690
The stop-and-risk tactic has been criticised by a number of civil rights advocates .	-4.3164
Such controls have been in various forms for decades , but the number of checks recorded during the term of office of the non-partisan mayor Michael Bloomberg has risen to an all-time high of 684,330 in 2011 , most of them black and Latin American men .	-4.5830
In 2004 , four men belonging to all minorities lodged a complaint which became a collective action .	-5.6364
Proponents of changes to the NYPD ’ s stop-and-risk program say that changes will end unfair practices , create a more trustworthy and effective police force , and influence the way other police presidencies use it .	-4.6563
Opponents believe that the changes would dampen police morality , but not crime ; money would also be wasted and the broader problem of a police force that has been under pressure since thousands of posts disappeared in the last decade .	-6.2339
The judge pointed out that she did not end the stop-and-risk practice , which is constitutional , but merely reform the way NYPD implements controls .	-5.0746

Happiness is an Oasis to Achieve Only Dreaming Camels	-3.6442
With this knowledge of Bedouin , the first chairman Wolfgang Henne described the history and fascination of the association " Helping Hands " .	-4.1006
On Saturday afternoon the tenth birthday of the association was celebrated , which can already have considerable success .	-4.5107
The first chairman Henne reported in detail about the work of the association .	-3.3107
He himself was the first time in Mauritania in 2004 at the Cheijk-Zajed hospital in Nouakchott .	-3.1535
As a result , further cooperation developed , and the gynaecologist Henne carried out numerous operations on site on several journeys .	-5.6047
During the speeches , pictures of the missions on a large screen were shown so that the guests of the anniversary event could take a picture of the actions mentioned .	-5.7158
The desert vehicle of the association was also shown .	-2.7534
It is a former federal border protection vehicle .	-2.6277
Rainer Prewo , the former OB of Nagold , had made the proposal to equip this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and is now planning to work in a consultative role , according to Henne .	-5.4871
In 2008 , the Zimmerei Schleeh from Baiersbronn created the hospital in Socogim , an area of misery on the outskirts of the capital - volunteer .	-6.1967
Henne also mentioned a new Mother Child hospital in Nouakchott .	-2.0215
Especially interesting in times when the birth clinic is to be rationalized away in Nagold .	-3.9005
One learns a lot in Africa as a medical doctor , Henne said , for example , deceleration against burn-out .	-4.3031
Due to the political unrest in the country , it was not possible to make as many journeys as planned , but many medical professionals came to Germany to hospitate in various areas .	-6.8895
In addition , containers with material are regularly sent to Africa , including medical equipment , medication , association material , hospital beds and glasses in March this year .	-5.3258
Mitinitiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself provided plenty of local colour by telling Mauritania of Mercedes cars converted into mobile goat ’ s stables and describing the experiences of the regular musicians who traditionally support the club during their Mauritanian trip .	-7.4017
As his personal motives , he called his work in the field of auditing as a young Member of .	-4.6296
When he realized how much money was lost on the way , he decided to help Africans control their budgets .	-3.4231
Fuchtel also stressed that the global economy also demands global love of human beings .	-4.9887
Nor should we forget that Africa is closer than some think .	-2.1190
From Gran Canaria it is not far to Africa .	-2.1868
Coulson used telephone hacking to check tips	-2.1808
Former news of the Word editor Andy Coulson allegedly used “ telephone hacking , surveillance , and confrontation ” to try to confirm a false tip about an affair of then-interior minister Charles Clarke .	-4.9059
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the court in Old Bailey that News of the World heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with his “ attractive special advisor ” Hannah Pawlby .	-3.9485
The newspaper instructed the private detective Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlby ’ s voicemails , and persecuted them , but Coulson also called them and left messages as the court learned .	-4.2549
“ In the opinion of the Public Prosecutor , Coulson , who is now the editor of the NotW , is no one who stands in front of the home of people and hopes to invent them for fresh action , but one who likes to face people with a story to see their reaction , ” Edis explained .	-6.4112
He said NotW use three methods to investigate stories investigatively : phone hacking , surveillance , and confrontation .	-13.6620
The publisher is personally involved in the third method .	-1.4543
Obviously he knows about the second , the monitoring , otherwise it can not be .	-3.4231
What about the first ?	-1.4020
Does he know about telephone hacking ?	-1.7688
He denies that , but we say , “ And whether he knew about it . ”	-7.3673
Rumours about a Clarke affair were first taken up by NotW ’ s feature editor , when a source that was sexually interested in Pawlby was said , “ Don ’ t waste your time , it ’ s with Charles . ”	-4.8043
A band with voicemails from her phone of at least three occasions was secured in August 2006 in Mulcaires apartment .	-3.5975
The investigators also found entries on the detective computer where Pawlby and her sister were stored as “ projects . ”	-3.5284
In the time the research went , Pawlby ’ s grandparents received anonymous calls asking them for information about them , Edis explained .	-4.6710
Meanwhile , former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw Pawlby ’ s movements .	-2.4665
On 18 June 2005 , Coulson left her a voicemail with the following content : “ I have a story that we want to release tomorrow , which I would like to talk about with Charles . ”	-3.8266
Edis explained that Coulson ’ s activities in this story followed the same pattern as other important personalities , such as former Home Secretary David Blunkett .	-3.7807
On Thursday , the jurors heard that Coulson Blunkett faced a married woman for an affair when he himself had lied with the co-accused Rebekah Brooks , who had been married at the time .	-5.3555
Coulson and Brooks dispute to have conspired with others to hack phones between October 3 , 2000 and August 9 , 2006 .	-7.9821
Mulcaire , Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted telephone hacking .	-2.2031
In protest against the planned Reichensteuer tax , French football will indeed take the first strike since 1972 .	-4.2331
A conciliation meeting comes to an end without any . is . . are . . are . are . are . . are . .	-9.5212
In the dispute over the Reichensteuer tax , the government and professional football in France have turned into a dead end after a failed conciliation meeting .	-5.2741
President Fran<unk>ois Hollande received the club and association representatives on Thursday in the Paris <unk>lysée Palace and listened to their complaints .	-5.0887
But he refused to spare the football from the planned 75 % levy on income of more than a million euros a year , which all the country ’ s firms will pay for two years from 2014 .	-5.4118
The other side was also tough .	-5.6533
The strike , announced at the end of November , is now going to be carried out , with Jean-Pierre Louvel , the head of the Association of Professional Clubs ( UCPF ) . , , , . , , , . , , , ,	-11.8116
The Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 days scheduled between 29 November and 2 December are therefore out of date .	-5.6717
Failure to provide absolute protection	-4.0581
" We want to involve the inhabitants in planning early on " , Mayor Jens Häusler opened the mayor information event for the flood protection concept in Gechingen .	-5.7175
Around 80 participants had come to the community hall to explain the planned measures , to ask questions , to express concerns and to introduce ideas .	-6.0281
Häu<unk>ler made it clear : " The final decisions are taken by the members of the municipal council " .	-3.7956
The floods that struck Gechingen on 15 May 2009 , unprepared , were a major event that raised the question of protection measures for the future , said Häusler .	-5.5477
A river area investigation was commissioned with the neighbouring village of Aidlingen , which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen .	-3.9022
" The protection of as many cultivated land as possible is the goal " , says Häu<unk>ler .	-4.2368
The planning of the protection against a flood , according to the German weather service , is statistically planned every 100 years .	-7.4336
Climate change is taken into account by a 15 % surcharge .	-2.9839
In specialist circles this is called " HQ 100aKlima " .	-3.1032
The water masses that caused considerable damage in Gechingen in 2009 were equivalent to a 1000-year flood .	-5.1231
" There is no absolute protection , but a relative improvement we can achieve " , says Häu<unk>ler .	-3.1444
In order to achieve the protection HQ 100aKlima , around four million euros will have to be invested in Gechingen , with the local community receiving approximately 70 percent of state aid .	-6.9278
But Häu<unk>ler pointed out that there would be support only if an overall concept was implemented .	-4.2455
To this end , the community needs the participation of its citizens .	-4.7268
A complex planning and approval procedure must be completed .	-3.2820
In the best case , implementation could begin in 2016 .	-2.8109
Among other things , the protection concept , which was already presented in the municipal council last week ( we reported ) provides for local measures in the influx of the Irm river from the valley of the family home .	-6.3561
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept , participants took the opportunity to present their concerns .	-3.0642
Amongst other things , it has been questioned why more dams and reservoirs are not planned to protect the place .	-5.4331
Gregor Kühn , expert planner of the commissioned engineering firm Wald and Corbe from Hügelsheim , who presented the concept , stressed that it required the interaction of all the measures presented in order to achieve the desired goal in the sum .	-12.3444
In addition , one must find the most economical solution , according to Joachim Wald von Wald and Corbe .	-7.3294
There was resentment among the old town ’ s residents , who , even in the case of normal thunderstorms , continue to suffer from congestion in the Channel network .	-8.1914
The problem is well known in the administration and first measures have already been taken .	-4.1476
Häu<unk>ler pointed out , however , that the guidelines for channel systems are different from those for flood protection and that this should not be mixed up .	-9.5533
The municipality is obliged to interpret the channel network in such a way that two to three years of rainfall could be managed .	-5.4845
Dimensioning sewerage channels would devour millions .	-4.5087
Heavy injured after Conflict	-5.1004
In the early Friday afternoon two drivers were seriously injured in a frontal collision on the provincial road 44 near Revensdorf .	-4.5275
The police immediately closed the road completely , but could say little about the accident .	-4.3954
However , there are several testimonies that should be evaluated first .	-3.6289
What is certain is that the 19-year-old Lenker of a VW Golf went to Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf met her with his Hyundai .	-4.9227
Both vehicles crawled together , with the woman being so severely trapped that the fire brigade took less than half an hour to get them out of the vehicle wreck .	-7.5512
The actual cause of the accident initially remained unresolved .	-3.8313
Both of those who were injured came to nearby hospitals .	-5.1001
The track remained closed for about two hours .	-2.8020
One could call it the US Dostoevsky .	-3.3292

Amazing the exterior of the family : the stinging eyes , the beard , the high forehead .	-4.8895
And just as Fjodor M. Dostoyewski with his massive oeuvre as the founder and apologist of the Russian soul can be understood , one reads Philip K. Dick as an American prophet , who is true at home .	-6.0030
Some titles have been published by Heyne Verlag , the Haffmans cassette with the 118 narratives sells two thousand points .	-5.4958
Dick explains America - the realm of breathtaking technological progress , coupled with paranoia , insecure security , and the belief of being chosen .	-5.0468
Dick had religious experiences , his late books read like a mixture of John ’ s revelation and a computer manual .	-3.4994
Perhaps he was crazy , drugs had added to his brain .	-3.2869
He has noticed , early on , that the computers are diversities .	-6.1843
He wrote a theology of the computer and asked what distinguishes a man from a machine , the creator from his creature .	-3.3531

The " Minority Report " dates back to 1956 , it sweeps away the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy tribunals .	-5.3057
The principle of " pre-crime " is being developed here , " pre-Crime " , that is , what is now more or less official doctrine of the White .	-4.9376
In Dick 's world , which is frightening to us , mutants look to the future - and the police are taking action .	-4.7022
" We collect individuals who have not violated any law , " says the head of the authority .	-3.5901
" We grab them before they can commit a violent crime " .	-2.2329
And : ' There are no serious criminals in our society , we have a penal camp full of pesudo criminals , ' you read time flows .	-6.0611
They assume that something is going wrong and prevent the criminal idea from being put into practice .	-4.5111
Dick ’ s narrative looks like the blueprint for the anti-terror laws and the NSA ’ s tapping rush .	-4.2909
Anticipation of the attack : that is how Obama ’ s drone philosophy and practice works .	-3.0844
But Dicks story is not over yet .	-4.3864
The police chief complains that there is no longer a separation of powers , the military controls everyday life - and what is left of the state .	-3.6070

Speaker about Merkel in Russia	-2.2048
Former US intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum in the US spawning affair about German Chancellor Angela Merkel .	-4.5515
Representatives of the German Federal Lawyers could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old in Russia personally , the agency Interfax reported .	-4.7268
Previously , the Green MEP Hans-Christian Ströbele was the first German politician to meet Snowden in Moscow yesterday to talk to him about the affair .	-3.9469
NSA revelations reinforce corporate paranoia for state surveillance .	-8.9955
On a mild day at the end of August , a German police helicopter flew deep across the US consulate in Frankfurt am Main , Germany ’ s financial capital .	-3.5681
At the request of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection and Counter-Terrorism ( BVT ) , the German Interior Intelligence Service , he should photograph the roof of the US outpost , located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank .	-8.2663
According to the German media , the BVT wanted to prove the presence of surveillance devices and the action resulted in a change of words between the US and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin .	-5.7286
James Clapper , America ’ s Director of National Intelligence , insisted again in September that the US did not use foreign espionage capabilities to “ steal the business secrets of foreign companies on behalf of US firms , so that they could expand their international competitiveness or profits . . ”	-5.0988
But , since Edward Snowden , the former whistleblower , began publishing his pledge to US surveillance secrets , European governments and business leaders are no longer sure whether they can take the director at their word .	-5.8994
Reports that the American National Security Agency has spied Petrobas , Brazil ’ s oil company , and obtained data from American cloud providers , including Google and Yahoo , have brought the paranoia to a new peak for state surveillance .	-5.9591
The barrel of overflow may have been the revelation that German Chancellor Angela Merkel ’ s phone was raging for ten years .	-6.4380
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted , corporate leaders are certainly potential targets .	-4.6554
Snowden has made intensive cooperation between US intelligence services and companies transparent .	-2.3826
I believe that it is conceivable that these data should be used for mutual benefit .	-8.1206
“ Germany must wake up , ” explains Oliver Grün , President of BITWed , who represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany .	-2.9896
German companies believe that the US is now almost as risky as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft , a survey published in July by the EY consultant .	-4.8343
In Snowden ’ s leaked documents , however , there has been no evidence that the US has passed on the business secrets of foreign companies to its own companies .	-4.9883
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU should lack certain IT and Internet opportunities and reduce its dependence on the US .	-3.0295
Companies are sceptical about this .	-1.5104

Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta in the US state of Georgia was found on January 11 in an upright mat , which stood behind the grandstand in the school hall .	-9.7801
The sheriff ’ s investigators at Lowndes County concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident , but that the 17-year-old family is doubtful .	-5.0032
" They are convinced that their son was murdered , " explained Benjamin Crump , the lawyer of Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson , to FoxNews.com.	-2.8195
They would never have believed that he died as the Sheriff concluded .	-3.4723
“ They believe that there is no logic whatsoever that contravenes the laws of physics and common sense , ” says Crump .	-9.7230
Rather , they are convinced that the truth is hidden in order to protect the person or person responsible for the death of their son .	-3.5470
“ Her son went to school and returned to the body sack , ” he commented .	-4.5309
US Public Prosecutor Michael Moore said on Thursday that there will be a formal investigation into the death of Johnson , because a number of important issues remain unresolved .	-3.7193
What was the cause of death ?	-0.9084
Is his death due to a crime ?	-1.2448
Moore explained this at a press conference on Thursday afternoon .	-2.8370
I follow the facts in which direction they lead .	-2.4609
My aim is to find out the truth .	-1.7294
“ I believe there is a sufficient basis for a formal investigation , ” he said .	-2.7641
Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy suggests that Johnson died from the consequences of a “ position-related suffocation . ”	-4.0724
A second autopsy , however , caused another cause of death , Moore said .	-3.6795
“ There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed , ” he said .	-2.2068

CDC Publish Education Allergy Directive	-3.1544
On Wednesday , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) published a series of guidelines for dealing with children ’ s food allergies in schools .	-2.9198
These are the first such guidelines that the US government has issued , as the number of schooled children with food allergies increases .	-4.5895
One in 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy .	-1.7313
According to the CDC , the spread of food allergies among children increased by 18 % between 1997 and 2007 .	-2.2095
The guidelines contain information for schools to raise awareness of food allergies and how to deal with children who are allergic to allergic reactions .	-5.1340
It is also recommended that schools have epinephrin in stock – the EpiPen brand ’ s auto-injection is most commonly used – to respond to a potentially lethal hypersensitivity response .	-5.0960
The legislators in the states have recently changed the rules so that schools can keep Epinephrin more easily in stock .	-9.1544
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms mentioned by children with allergic reactions .	-2.8679

Parents of intersexual children can choose “ Gender Unequal ”	-3.9913
Germany is the first European nation to recognize a third gender for children born with non-clear genitals .	-3.0299
Newborn babies are no longer given rigid male or female .	-4.6180
According to the new law , parents no longer have to declare sex for such children , but can indicate “ indefinite ” or “ not fixed ” on the certificate of birth .	-5.3281
The aim of the law is to take the pressure from parents so that they do not have to make hasty decisions on sexual assignment operations in newborns , and to combat discrimination against intersexuals .	-6.2839
An intersexual person , according to the BBC , said years later : “ I am neither man nor woman . ”	-3.2742
I remain the patchwork created by doctors mutilated and full of scars .	-2.0659
It is estimated that one in 2,000 children each year does not appear as boys or girls .	-4.6410
They are among the intersexuals , a group that falls under the diagnosis of “ sexual differentiation disorder ” ( DSD ) , a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes , germ glands ( ovaries or testicles ) or unusually developed genitals .	-5.9079
Wallis Simpson was perhaps intersexual .	-1.7342
Understanding gender identification is still not very well developed , but most US experts suggest that you use the best available information on gender allocation if a provision is not possible and do not wait for the child ’ s psychological and physical development before deciding – if any – for an operation .	-6.2181
The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher , who specializes in the issue of gender identification , said that the new German law “ sounds like a good thing . ”	-3.3172
Intersexual children are an ethical dilemma .	-1.4030
“ Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgery , but most children do not . ” he said .	-3.2819
You can allocate sex without surgery and then wait for identity to develop .	-4.6749
The scientific data on how a child develops its gender identity is not very accurate .	-3.0879
No one knows why it is happening .	-1.7037
It is like the secret why people are homosexual .	-1.8349
A report to the European Commission in 2011 states that intersexuals are differentiated from transsexuals or transgenders , because their status is not gender-based , but due to their biological constitution , which is neither exclusively male nor female , but typically both at the same time or not clearly defined as one of them . is , , or .	-9.6604
These characteristics have been shown in subordinate sexual characteristics such as muscle mass , hair , breasts and stature , priority sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals , or chromosomal structures and hormones .	-11.8449
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination suffered by intersexual and transgender persons in professional life , as well as the extent of harassment , violence and discrimination .	-4.5186
Young people who do not match the gender picture now have a special camp .	-4.5681
In Australia and Nepal , it is now possible for adults to provide male , female or “ third gender ” on official documents .	-4.2763
In June , Australia ’ s Norrie May-Welby ( 52 ) was recognized as the world ’ s first “ genderless ” person after a court had granted lifelong retention of a “ unspecified ” gender status .	-4.3296
In addition to M and W , German cards will have a third assignment , X for intersexual , according to the Ministry of the Interior .	-4.7574
In neighboring France , gender issues are still controversial , according to a news report on France 24 .	-3.5882
In 2011 , dozens of French MPs from the strictly Catholic country signed a petition that “ gender theory ” should be removed from school books .	-3.6145
The US website Catholic Online has also spoken out against German law , on the grounds that , “ If the world is dumped into a new state , where gender is a decision , but sexual activity is not , then we are twisting two more pillars of civilisation . ”	-7.1357
The mother of a newborn Maryland told the baby zone that it would be better if babies were given a gender at birth .	-4.8220
“ Parenthood is already stressful enough without any further restrictions , especially if you don ’ t know the sex of your own child , ” she said to the parents ’ website .	-5.4657
Children need stability and security .	-0.8144
Historically , children born with both male and female genders were called hermaphroids , according to the attractive Greek god , who had both sexes .	-3.8140
Ten years ago , medicine regarded sex as something that can be wiped out and then rebuilt .	-4.3070
But the ethical foundations of an operation are now being questioned , as it is now known how complex gender identity is , and that doctors can also be wrong because they do not know how the child feels when growing up with the sex they assign .	-6.6243
“ In the middle of the 20th century , it was called a psychiatric emergency , ” said Drescher .	-4.0789
When such a child was born , one called not the psychiatrist , but the surgeon .	-3.0869
The prevailing theory of treating children with non-clear genitals dates back to Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University , who believed that gender was formable .	-4.9277
He coined the term “ gender identity , ” arguing that social and environmental impulses – how parents educate a child – interacted with a child ’ s genes and hormones , thus shaping whether a person considers himself male or female .	-5.3122
But in a 1966 case known as John / Joan , his theories became controversial .	-2.5367
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been separated from the child in a fierce circumcision , to cast the child completely and also to remove his / her testicles and then to raise him as a girl .	-8.2062
“ Money presented this case as a successful example of a conversion , which he was not , ” says Drescher .	-3.4320
When the boy was about 15 , he switched back to the male sex and married a woman .	-2.6707
At 38 But he did commit suicide .	-2.8868
According to Drescher , there are still doctors who would practice this model .	-2.0879
But in the 1990 ’ s , with the advent of the Internet , survivors of these gender-operations became public , “ unhappy with the outcome . ”	-3.8460
For example , Jim Bruce , a 36-year-old Montana author born with XY-male chromosomes , but ambiguous genitals .	-2.7348
Doctors were not clear whether he had a big clitoris or a small penis , and were convinced that he could never lead a “ satisfactory life ” as a man .	-4.3607
So his external organ and the testicles were surgically removed shortly after birth in 1976 , and he was raised as a girl .	-3.9872
At the age of 12 he received female hormones .	-2.0235
“ I knew I am not a girl , ” he said to ABCNews.com .	-2.1601
I was unfortunate , but it was really difficult to ask questions .	-2.0520
At the age of 18 he should be given a vaginal plasticity .	-3.8918
But , because he was depressive and knew that something was wrong , he demanded his medical acts .	-3.2139
What he found out was shocking .	-0.8241
I was sterilized at my birth – and no one ever told me .	-2.7825
Bruce was born with a DSD through which his body could not produce enough testosterone to develop genitals .	-2.9811
After learning the truth , he switched back to the male identity , received Testosteron injections and let his breasts be removed .	-5.0168
Through the operation it has become infertile .	-3.2751
Today , he is fighting for others in an organization called Interface Project to see intersexual people as normal .	-3.9579
But Anne Tamar-Mattis , Managing Director of California ’ s Advocates for Informed Choice , is worried that German law can “ encourage stamping and stigmatizing . ”	-3.9435
“ Many activists are worried that Germany ’ s decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and not to assign <unk> to the child , ” she said .	-5.4343
We fear that this will encourage intervention .	-2.8044
We think it would be better to allocate the male or female sex and then wait for it to . are . . are . are . . are . . are	-8.1981
But we do not yet know how the law will affect , so we can only speculate .	-3.1529
Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports Australian law , because “ it allows adults to be recognized as the third sex . ”	-4.0063
“ Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal sex , ” she explained .	-3.0080
German law is about assignment at birth .	-3.0338
This is not a fight to force small children at this time .	-3.8296
When they are grown up , they can decide their own body .	-4.0854
But Dr. Arlene Baratz , a Pittsburg brothel , who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group , says that German law “ empowers ” both parents and children .	-15.3989
Katie , the daughter of Baratz , was born with male chromosomes , but has a DSD called complete androgen resistance .	-2.8962
Because of the receptor defect of the target cells for testosterone , Katie developed female characteristics .	-3.3540
She has a vagina , but no uterus and no ovaries .	-1.8662
She is married to Katie 29 ; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as a child psychiatrist .	-4.7584
Although she is infertile , she hopes to be able to have a child through adoption or a surrogate mother .	-5.2603
“ The law gives parents space , so that they do not have to make hasty decisions , ” Baratz said .	-4.4022
It gives them time to do various tests and clarify things and gives them time before they write “ male ” or “ female . ”	-3.7807
In this way everything is fine – you pull the child big and you love it .	-4.9701
One has a wonderful baby and enjoys parental happiness .	-2.5916
And you do not need to hasten an operation that can no longer be undone .	-3.8836
“ This includes children in the decision and removes the fear that drives parents because they believe they are not doing the right thing , ” she explained .	-4.6865
Ultimately , the child decides on the sex that suits him better – and that is wonderful .	-3.7578
This will enable children to make the decision themselves .	-2.5970
Unknown Violate Girls by Auto Shot	-4.1270
Unknown people have injured a 12-year-old in Saxony-Anhalt in shots from a car .	-4.7868
The perpetrators had probably fired on a group of children with an air force on Thursday evening in Ghent .	-4.5695
This was reported by the police in Burg .	-3.5505
The girl was easily injured on the left wade .	-3.1535
Rescue forces brought the girl to hospital .	-2.2882
The shot came from a small car that had passed a group of six children and had suddenly stopped .	-3.2953
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car .	-1.4195
The perpetrators also shot at a bus stop .	-2.4867
A disc broke .	-2.2260
Afterwards they drove off . .	-5.6878
Determine the crime police , it was said on Friday .	-4.0260
Until now , the police inspectorate Kempten can look back on a quiet Halloween night .	-4.5814
Officials were only called twice to enlist children who threw them against facades .	-6.4701
As homeowners recognized this in good time and immediately removed the remains , no material damage should have arisen .	-6.6701
In addition , some New Year 's Eve boilers may have been ignited in the city area , but no material damage has been caused .	-8.6166
A resident in the Bishop ’ s Friend ’ s Way reported that his car was wrapped with cloth paper and his wheel zippers were stolen .	-7.2313
However , until the arrival of the police , the man found his wheel zippers in the immediate vicinity , so the police did not need to continue working .	-8.5626
Living with Future Perspective	-3.3962
Waltraud Ries lives in a dreamlike way .	-3.8659
Your house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with lots of green , an old tree stock , nice neighbours and not too much traffic .	-3.6424
The city is only a few minutes away by public transport .	-3.1716
" Hopefully you are not afraid of spiders ? " asks Waltraud Ries and points to a fat spider on the door frame .	-3.7322
I have been looking for a new apartment for my husband and myself for some time .	-2.6851
But you know how difficult this is in Stuttgart .	-2.2325
The reason , however , is not a phobia of the spider , but the concern that the many stairs to the house and the apartment can no longer be overcome at age , she explains .	-7.2655
In addition , since a menismus operation , the midfiftieth woman has had to know what it means to move from floor to floor with a handicap .	-6.1216
She recently published a book entitled ' Happily live in old age - Which type of living is the best for me ? ' .	-5.1724
'Our apartment is the best example of what is not possible in old age ' she begins to tell .	-4.5834
When she moved with her husband to the maisonette apartment more than 20 years ago , it was simply a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green .	-4.5321
Today , with the middle of fifty , Waltraud Ries thinks differently .	-3.4972
She also knows , however , that she is one of the few people who are actually dealing with the issue of ' living in old age ' .	-5.1451
Most people crowd it out as long as possible .	-3.8957
Always get only the others ' , she says dirty .	-4.5063
Only when the pressure of suffering is really great do you worry .	-4.7071
'Then it can be too late ' , says Ries .	-3.9671
In her book , the interior designer presents 17 living models for self-determined living at age .	-4.2574
" What type of housing you choose is always an individual decision " , she explains .	-4.9044
D i e solution does not exist for age .	-1.8895
Even those who can afford the retirement home in Tuscany or Brittany should always consider that he can become ill .	-4.8596
And : ' Without a good knowledge of the national language , the Dolce Vita also unites , ' says the author of the specialist book to consider alienation requests .	-9.0405
Among their models are classic care models , alternative housing forms or the often cited pensioner WG .	-5.0363
At age , everyone ’ s Ticks and Macks	-4.1308
" For me , such a community would be nothing , " she says with an eye .	-5.9601
Not as in a student WG with a shared bathroom and kitchen .	-4.1141
" At age you just need your withdrawal rooms , " says Ries .	-5.6550
However , the author does not want to rule out the fact that a senior resident community can still function .	-4.9605
But that would have to be different than in the classic Studenten-WG . . , , , , . , , , , , ,	-8.7478
And sometimes you just want its rest , ' she believes .	-4.2398
It is not alone in this opinion , at least in the capital .	-4.5465
'Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own home for as long as possible ' is also the experience of Theresa Rütten , the director of civil service life at the age of the state capital .	-4.5720
Your service advises people around the topic of ' becoming older ' .	-4.7528
For this reason , it is precisely the older people who would often accept inconveniences and restrictions in order to remain in their familiar environment that is also the experience of the Warentest Foundation .	-7.0715
Today there are many ways to make the house or apartment accessible .	-4.3221
Ries recommends that anyone concerned with the age-appropriate renovation of their house or apartment should first get informed and not hire the first craftsman .	-7.9236
Today , there are also specialists for age-appropriate reconstruction .	-4.3882
Even in the apartment , one or two things can be realized , and if it is only the toilet seat increase , the interior architect will clarify .	-7.6422
But it is not always possible to change the existing apartment according to the age and thus without barriers , even if it is still so beautiful .	-5.9272
Waltraud Ries had to make this experience .	-6.7509
It is possible to install a stairlift inside the apartment , but the path paved with stairs to the door would be a much bigger obstacle .	-8.8995
She will continue until she has found the ideal object for herself and her husband .	-3.0307
Before moving you gray more than in front of the spider at your door .	-5.4744
The US Want to continue to prosecute Sn	-3.5549
The US has not changed its stance on former US intelligence worker Edward Snowden .	-2.5997
He is also accused of having passed on unauthorized secret information .	-5.0934
As a result , he had to face criminal proceedings in the US , said US Secretary of State Jennifer Psaki , in Washington .	-4.1558
Nor would Snowden ’ s recent statements change this .	-3.6692
Previously , after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow , German Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele appealed to the US to stop threatening him with punishment .	-3.8622
Psaki stressed that what was being said was that of a parliamentarian , not that of a German member of the government .	-9.2445
Edward Snowden , an intelligence agency , is always ready to talk to German authorities .	-5.1842
First of all , however , he wants to clarify his situation .	-3.6520
The former NSA employee sought by the US made this clear in an unaddressed letter published by the Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and passed on to the Federal Government , the Bundestag , and the Advocate General .	-6.0717
The letter has the following wording :	-3.5264
The Responsible	-3.1875
I have been asked to write to you about your inquiry on mass surveillance .	-2.7579
I am Edward Joseph Snowden , who was previously contracted or employed as a technical expert at the National Security Agency ( NSA ) , the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) and the United States Defense Intelligence Agency ( DIA ) .	-4.0708
As I worked in these institutions , I witnessed systematic violations of the law of my government , which led me to act out of moral duty .	-5.8552
As a result of the publication of these concerns , I saw myself exposed to a serious and persistent harassment that forced me to leave my family and home .	-5.0436
I am currently living in exile and enjoy temporary asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation under international law .	-3.1166
I am encouraged by the response to my political action , both in the US and elsewhere .	-2.4265
Citizens around the world , and also senior officials - including the United States - have judged the revelations as a public service to a system of all-encompassing surveillance that no one is accountable .	-5.4173
These spy revelations brought forward many proposals for new laws and policies aimed at the previously covert abuse of public trust .	-5.2928
The benefits to society from these findings are becoming increasingly clear ; at the same time , the risks acquired have been visibly reduced .	-4.9239
Although the outcome of my efforts has been demonstrably positive , my government continues to treat dissent as a breach of loyalty and seeks to criminalise and indict political expression .	-3.9223
But to tell the truth is not a crime .	-3.2378
I am confident that the United States Government , with the support of the international community , will adopt this damaging stance .	-3.8004
I hope that , when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved , I will be able to participate appropriately and lawfully in the responsible clarification of the facts concerning the statements made in the media , in particular with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports .	-5.3192
I look forward to talking to you in your country as soon as the situation is resolved and thank you for your efforts to uphold international law , which protects us all .	-4.1282

The building changed its owner for a " reasonable " price .	-2.4141
" The community is satisfied , " says Maier .	-2.5002
EUR 100 000 was set aside in the budget .	-2.9157
It is not yet clear how the new owner intends to use the former kindergarten .	-2.9596
The mayor is right that Winterlingen handed over the responsibility for the building to someone else before the winter and thus no longer has to pay for the entertainment of the house , how to heat , look after the garden and leave the walk .	-6.7849
" This effort is now gone " , Maier is pleased .	-3.1402
Platform Concert at High Summer Temperatures	-4.3637
The Musikverein Hammereisenbach gives a performance concert on the terrace of the Inn Hammer .	-3.3388
As conductor Bianca Willmann raises the clock at 7.30 p.m. , the thermometer still shows 25 degrees .	-3.7115
Approximately 50 listeners enjoy the sounds of Hammricher musicians .	-6.9258
The chairman Manuela Honeck explains the music .	-3.4241
In this context , Honeck thanked everyone who had helped to manage the first music hock successfully .	-6.0695
Report : Obama campaign considered replacing bids with Hillary Clinton	-2.1974
President Barack Obama ’ s closest advisers have secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton in the 2012 election campaign , according to the New York Times .	-3.2348
The revelation is the most notable surprise of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann ’ s long-awaited work on the 2012 campaign , “ Double Down : Game Change 2012 . ”	-2.9352
The Times is a copy of the forthcoming book , and it reported on Thursday evening that the president ’ s top advisers had “ held extensive group meetings and polls at the end of 2011 ” to find out whether Obama ’ s waning hope of re-election would look better if he dropped bids .	-5.9745
According to Jonathan Martin , a national political correspondent of the Times , the book thoroughly records the history of the efforts of leading campaign and White House officials , notably the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley , to measure the impact of the polls on the exchange of former Secretary of State Clinton with the vice president .	-12.7610
The potential shift was a strictly guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office .	-3.1920
Only half a dozen of the president ’ s closest advisers – including Daley , Obama ’ s former campaign leader , Jim Messina , and the former White House chief adviser , David Axelrod , and David Plouffe – knew about the planned change .	-3.6394
In “ Double Down , ” Daley is said to have been at the forefront of efforts to exchange bids , despite their “ close , personal relationship , ” before finally deciding to make such a move , after the data showed that Clinton ’ s candidacy would “ not significantly improve Obama ’ s chances . ”	-6.8552
In an interview with Martin , Daley confirmed that the government had actually considered replacing Biden with Clinton .	-2.7617
“ I said a whole series of things to consider , and that was one of them , ” Daley told the magazine .	-3.8857
It must be remembered that the president had terrible poll values at the time , so we thought : “ For God ’ s sake , what are we doing ? ”	-5.2509
While Daley described the investigation as “ due care , ” Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN that during the re-election campaign , considerable effort had been made to determine whether such a move would pay off with regard to the ballot boxes .	-5.5462
“ In campaigns , not so much money is spent on surveys and focus groups if you don ’ t think seriously about something , ” Martin said on AC360 .	-5.0083
But it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team was thinking about an exchange .	-2.8481
Martin said to CNN that he asked Daley if his boss had known about the potential change .	-2.8984
While Daley declared that he did not believe that the president of possible change was “ aware , ” the former chief of staff admitted that it was “ possible ” that Obama knew about it .	-3.7890
Martin added that “ double down ” does not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether Obama ’ s political explorations had reached his desk .	-3.4488
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought that Obama did not know about the investigation of whether to drop bids in the elections .	-4.6927
“ Possible , ” Martin replied .	-2.2744
What happens to my email ?	-2.2445
E-mail is actually an electronic letter .	-2.9738
Did the design of the Internet service E-Mail have been technically implemented in the same way as the traditional mail ?	-7.7913
In the conception of early Internet services , the focus was on making communication possible .	-4.3163
As a result , the basic technical protocols have failed to provide a stable basis for sound correspondence .	-5.5887
Therefore , a conventional email is more like an open postcard than a sealed letter .	-3.7069
If user " Anna " sends a mail to " Benni " , are the computers of the two connected ?	-4.2615
Anna 's e-mail program or browser sends the mail to the mail server of its service provider in the first step .	-4.5053
For example , if it has a GMail account , Google would be .	-2.4389
This mail server sends the content to the provider Benni uses .	-2.1198
On the route the mail can run via several other servers on the Internet .	-4.5535
Bennie can then call the content from his provider .	-2.4782
Are conventional e-mails read on their way through the net ?	-4.2715
Most mails are read several times by software robots on the go .	-3.2326
As a rule , the sender 's provider checks whether the mail carries a malicious program as an attachment .	-5.0845
A virus check is also carried out on the receiver systems .	-3.0178
Providers also check whether it is an annoying and unwanted spam mail that is deleted or at least sorted away into a spam folder .	-5.4856
Do the robots have another task ?	-2.0096
For systems such as GMail , the robot also determines the information Google needs to place context advertising .	-3.0017
When Anna and Benni communicate via GMail on their upcoming holiday , Google can provide links to holiday offers .	-5.0596
Do unknown people also read the emails ?	-4.2783
The likelihood of unauthorized persons reading a mail is very low .	-3.9741
In theory , however , this is possible .	-2.4127
In companies , administrators often have the opportunity to read e-mails .	-3.7072
The law enforcement authorities and secret services also have legal means to intercept or take note of e-mails .	-4.1351
In addition , there are possible illegal external actions .	-4.8450
Is it possible to protect e-mails against reading ?	-3.1565
With OpenPGP encryption , an email can be effectively encrypted to read .	-4.8724
With great technical effort it is also possible to hide the metadata of email communication so that it is not even easy to recognize who has communicated to whom .	-9.2563
How important are Yahoo and Google on the email market in Germany ?	-2.0511
According to a study by Convios Consulting from August 2013 , Yahoo and Google play only a minor role in the mainly privately used mailboxes .	-4.7092
While the shares of Yahoo Mail last fell , GMail from Google was able to increase significantly .	-5.1406
Mother in the Forest Secreted and Penny	-6.1055
When his prayed mother died , a Wolfsburg man forged a plan .	-3.2369
He buried the dead in a forest - and continued to collect their pension and care allowances .	-5.1161
A 67-year-old Wolfsburger has buried his dead mother in the forest after police investigations .	-5.6416
First of all , he covered up the death of the 89-year-old , then he borrowed the money for more than a year and a half .	-5.0278
Now the 67-year-old has to answer for fraud , as a speaker said on Friday .	-3.2951
So the man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt .	-2.6234
The man was suspected as early as May : at that time , it was noticed that no medication was needed for the mother in need of care .	-5.4299
The pensioner told them that his mother went to Spain .	-3.1107
Because officials found this strange , they continued to investigate .	-4.4693
It was discovered that the two had lived in a common apartment for more than 15 years and that he had cared for them last .	-6.4985
The 67-year-old finally admitted the death of his mother .	-3.0972
According to the police , an obsession did not reveal any evidence of a capital crime .	-4.7569
Feel like ice cream that shines in the dark ?	-2.9962
A British entrepreneur has developed the first ice in the dark – using jellies .	-4.2885
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of marine animals and created a luminous delicacy .	-4.8367
The idea came to him after reading a research on jellies and convincing Chinese scientists to artificially produce the shining protein .	-4.8408
The ice cream reacts when consumed with the tongue , increasing the pH value in the protein and triggering the luminaire .	-3.9125
Chris explains that the ice reacts to the heat in the mouth and shines – the more you lick , the brighter it becomes .	-4.7070
Charlie , founder of the ice cream company “ Lick Me I 'm Delicious , ” says , “ The product is incredible , but still in a very early stage of production , and you get two grams of it for <unk> 200 . ”	-4.4588
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH value .	-2.0523
When the mouth warms up the protein , the pH value rises and the ice shines .	-2.8586
We have tested it in recent months and it seemed ideal for us to launch it on Halloween because it has this wonderful light effect .	-4.9205
It is probably the most expensive ice cream I have ever produced , because the jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold .	-3.9484
Each ball costs me about 140 pounds .	-1.9005
But for that it tastes delicious .	-2.7765
Charlies experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual flavours , including beer , cheese , beef and leaf gold .	-3.1066
But his latest creation should become even more ambitious .	-6.9300
He says : “ I would like to develop an invisible ice cream . ”	-4.6795
This is , in itself , impossible because of the disruption of light caused by the ice crystals that make up ice cream ; but I suspect that we can create it .	-5.7225
The Ice Cream uses the fluorescent properties of a jelly artificially produced by Chinese scientists .	-3.3186
After six days of playing , TSV Morsum is still without any point in the Handball Association League .	-4.1449
For the team of Ingo Ehlers tomorrow , it will be the derby against TSV Daverden , who celebrated his first victory last weekend .	-6.4182
With this game the season starts again for us .	-2.8805
" I hope that we finally have our head free " , Ehlers is behaving optimistic .	-5.6194
With the exception of the permanently wounded Hendrik Blohme , he finally has his complete cadre at his disposal .	-5.4915
Daverden , like us , is also betting on tempo games .	-6.3891
We must therefore keep our error rate low .	-2.4009
First and foremost , however , we need to increase the coverage , which in the past has left nothing but a certain impression .	-6.4456
Daverden ’ s coach Thomas Panitz is much more relaxed after the first season victory against Nordhorn .	-5.1069
The game was of course a house number .	-1.5776
But that ’ s why we ’ re far from being the favourite , because everything can always happen in the Derby .	-6.0396
However , Panitz now wants to go to Morsum to start a series .	-4.3086
Lack becomes Jan-Malte Jodat .	-2.3573
The A-Jugend Joost Wind<unk>u<unk> , who is active with double rights at the A-Jugend Bundesliga HC Bremen , celebrates his season debut .	-6.3411
Those who are not hot in such a game should stay at home .	-3.1435
Halloween 2013 : In ,	-7.6661
When I was small , Halloween had something magic .	-2.2505
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets , stay late and dress up for the neighbourhood .	-2.9283
Today I have become more like a Halloween Muffel .	-4.2745
In the last two years I have not agreed to distribute sweets from my home , and I am sure I will not do so this year either .	-5.3911
But , according to statistics , I am a black sheep in Halloween .	-2.8570
The majority of Americans – 158 million to be precise – celebrate Halloween this year , spending a total of $ 6.9 billion on sweets , costumes , and decorations , according to the US Retailers ’ Association ( NRF ) .	-3.5170
One thing that I am looking forward to every halloween is the trend values . is . is . is . is . is . . is . .	-9.8743
The costumes will amount to about 1.2 billion of the $ 6.9 billion spent , according to the NRF .	-2.5123
This year , exciting unlived items are the last cry .	-3.9439
Women no longer have to wrap themselves in sexy clothes , they can now embody seductive food such as pizza , hamburgers or carrots .	-4.2889
As far as men are concerned , I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead , and I bet that the Daft-Punk space singers will make it into the Instagram feeds this year .	-4.7286
According to Google are the most sought-after costumes Zombies , Batman , pirates and witches .	-2.6858
I suspect there is nothing wrong with tradition .	-2.2043
We dressed our dogs last year and , to my surprise , we were not alone . .	-9.3216
Indeed , Americans spend $ 330 million this year on costumes of their pets , according to the NRF .	-2.4676
These are a lot of hot dogs .	-2.4290
As far as sweets are concerned , we are not timid .	-3.8617
Americans will spend $ 1.9 billion this year , says The Nielsen Company .	-1.9822
That is about 270 million kilograms of chocolate gels , suckers , sweets and rubber bears .	-5.0810
So good news for the 41 million people , according to the US Department of Commerce , who are pulling through the districts by saying “ sweet or sour . ”	-5.2244
Indeed , we will buy more than 40 million kilograms of chocolate for halloween and – let us not deceive ourselves – eat .	-2.9112
The only thing we do not want to consume is the sugar-sweet Candy Corn ; yet 15 million kilograms are sold around halloween , according to the National Association of confectioners .	-4.2851
That is about nine billion maize .	-3.5014
It is a mystery that I have not yet been able to solve .	-2.8547
Nothing belongs more to halloween than houses where it pumps .	-4.3020
They have great names such as “ Terror Behind the Walls ” ( which , incidentally , is in a real prison ) , “ Howl-O-Scream ” and “ The House of Shock . ”	-3.7522
In fact , there are 1,200 officially recognized Spukhäuser in the United States , earning $ 500 million in revenue , according to America Haunts , and that includes the wonderful photos on which you are poking into your pants and then putting your friends on Facebook , where you don ’ t get rid of them again , and then leave a comment on the type on which you stand as “ nice facial expression . ”	-9.6181
But let us finally get to the pumpkins .	-2.4969
Charlie Brown familiarized us with the Great pumpkin when we were children , and the carving of a pumpkin lamp is like the decorating of the Christmas tree – something that we made from small .	-5.9367
Fortunately , the “ baby in the pumpkin ” trend only began last year thanks to Pinterest , so most of us grew up with cutting the pumpkin rather than sitting in it .	-4.7341
This year , Americans will spend about $ 106 million on pumpkin , according to the US Census Bureau .	-2.1176
The pumpkin lamp , which is slowly rotting in the front garden , probably comes from Illinois , where this year 245 million kilograms of pumpkin were harvested .	-4.5718
If you want to score right , call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa , California and cut a bit of pumpkin from their 921 kilo .	-4.9075
Living Fire in Helmbright : Rescue Body	-6.0469
The fire brigade had to leave on late Thursday evening in Helmbrecht .	-3.5255
A three-family house in the Hof district catches fire at night .	-3.2234
The rescue forces have a chargeable corpse from the house .	-5.5633
Rescue forces found a barred corpse in a three-family house during a fire in Helmbrecht .	-4.8609
Whether it is a resident is still unclear , as a police spokesman in Bayreuth said .	-3.6128
On late Thursday evening it had burnt on the ground floor of the house .	-2.8857
When the fire brigade arrived , the flames were already beating out of a window .	-4.8092
The forces went into the apartment and found the corpse in a room .	-3.3709
This and another room burnt out completely .	-3.1228
The whole ground floor has been damaged .	-1.9862
All other residents were not at home during the fire , the police spokesman continued to explain .	-4.1689
The building could not be inhabited for now .	-3.6390
The exact cause of the fire was not clear at first .	-2.3501
Germany ’ s largest state church has an offensive party to promote the pastor ’ s profession .	-3.8353
The background is a possible lack of a parish : the Evangelical-Lutheran state church in Hanover expects the number of its currently 1,800 pastors to halve by 2030 .	-6.5787
For today ’ s young people , the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects , said Pastor Mathis Burfien ( 43 ) in conversation with the Evangelical Press Service .	-8.7058
It is attractive to be able to determine the working and daily routine .	-5.0642
For the first time , the Landeskirche has commissioned a pastor to inspire young people to study theology .	-5.5729
At the moment , fewer and fewer young people choose to study theology after the .	-4.1622
Burfien brings this back to the process of deception : " God 's voice is quiet , the world is loud " .	-5.0768
The profession was characterised by great freedom and diversity .	-2.8212
I am the master of my calendar of dates and can set my priorities where I think it is important .	-7.6816
Pastors could be very close to people as souls .	-7.7939
They earned as much as teachers and could live well .	-2.5045
To be sure , more is paid in the free economy , but theologians would have a safe employer .	-3.6298
This is what is happening to today ’ s young people , who are concerned not only with their careers , but also with meaningful work .	-6.5259
According to the Landeskirche , which covers three quarters of Lower Saxony , around 60 pastors are retired each year .	-4.1150
At the same time , about 40 graduates of a theology study start their vicariat .	-4.2845
In sparsely populated peripheral areas such as resin , Emsland or Wendland , it will be difficult to fill jobs in the future .	-4.9409
Burfien wants to organise study days for young people and to invite celebrities who have studied theology .	-11.2042
Theology studies offer a wide range of training .	-3.5853
You can even become a Federal President .	-3.3227
Land Rover Rally Series announced	-0.6980
The interior features race seats and six-point belts as well as a hands-free system .	-4.3606
The options range from reinforced brakes , a service package with support for Bowler work mechanics and logistical support to vehicle placement between events .	-5.0463
Drew Bowler , Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport , says : “ Rally customers who come to Bowler have changed . ”	-3.2942
They are not all experienced racers , but people who are looking for excitement and adventure as well as an accessible way to world-class events .	-4.8373
We are pleased to open this path in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format opens up new opportunities to experience the various rally disciplines in the UK and abroad and prepare newcomers for the strains and reality of Rally Raid .	-5.6072
We really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge car – it will be an entertaining championship .	-3.5566
In addition , the Defender Challenge will have a training and test day in February , as well as the option to participate in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East .	-4.2868
Fire brigade called to save a bitch that was stuck 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rock jump in a quarry .	-5.9890
Cockerspanile Ruby Dog Out after a minor traffic accident	-5.1013
Three days later , it was discovered by a walker in the quarry in its unfortunate location .	-3.9757
Fire fighters seized on the rock wall and saved the dog from the safe death .	-5.5571
The fire brigade managed to secure a bitch that was stuck on a 15 meter high edge in a rock wall .	-6.2409
The nine months old Cockerspanile bitch Ruby ran away after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before being saved from a quarry on Wednesday .	-4.6869
Scott Alderson , 25 , and his girlfriend Becky Hall , 20 of whom the dog belongs , came to the Flappit quarry in Denholm , West Yorkshire to welcome Ruby again and thank the fire brigades of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service .	-8.7842
They desperately searched for their missing bitch and published calls for help in social networks when they escaped into the quarry after the small traffic accident .	-5.7037
Around 14 : 15 on Wednesday , a walker who carried out his dog saw the stranded Ruby on the 15m high paragraph in the quarry .	-5.4830
The Cleckheaton Fire station 's technical rescue team was there to rescue Ruby , who was then transported up in a dog box .	-6.2424
Andy Clayton , specialist in the technical rescue team , said , “ She was in a dangerous situation .	-3.0351
It was in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and the ground .	-3.6749
She did not move any muscles during her rescue – she was frozen like stiff .	-3.7149
But now she is doing well .	-2.8911
She then eaten a few dog cakes .	-3.2320
That was a rather unusual effort .	-3.0292
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible .	-1.9289
Peter Lau , specialist in the technical rescue team , said : “ Ruby had a giant leaf . ”	-3.1861
It was possible that she was seriously injured or worse .	-2.9573
Ruby was brought to the test as a veterinarian , but he did not notice anything except exhaustion and dehydration .	-5.4712
Becky Hall from Halifax , West Yorkshire , said , “ watching the rescue was frightening . ”	-2.9802
I could not believe she was really up there .	-3.3576
It was wonderful to keep them back in the arms .	-2.4345
The veterinarian explained that if exhaustion had become too large and it had collapsed , it would probably have crashed .	-4.1364
The firefighters have done a great job .	-2.7034
It was truly courageous what they did .	-2.8615
We are simply so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible .	-2.7693
Scott Alderson of Keighley added , “ We were afraid that it would fall , but it remained up . ”	-3.1634
The firefighters were great .	-1.9421
I can hardly believe where she was .	-1.8552
Mick Jagger says he never watched Katy Perry when she was 18 .	-2.9529
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week , the pop star said she had been working as a background singer for Jagger ’ s song “ Old Habits The Hard ” from 2004 .	-5.0232
Perry explained that she had eaten with the altarpiece in the evening , and that “ he took me when I was 18 . ”	-6.1460
She added , “ It ’ s been a long time ago and he was very nice to me . ”	-3.7358
In a statement , a representative of Jaggers , 70 , said on Thursday that he “ categorically denied that he had ever tried to approach Katy Perry . ”	-4.5061
The representative added : “ Perhaps she confused him with someone else . ”	-2.5848
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest appearance on the Rolling Stones tour this year .	-3.6028
Her new album " Prism " was ranked first this week .	-4.5682
George Kerevan : European Unbundling Gives the Scots the Election	-3.2804
A new day , a new terror story about independence .	-2.4697
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland is needed to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership .	-2.6932
This is the keyword for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a barbed wire secured border along the Hadrian Wall .	-3.6519
Indeed , the Strathclyde proposal highlighted the potential economic benefits that would bring more freedom of travel in the rest of Europe , but , as expected , this did not matter in the headlines .	-6.3000
Nor has anyone mentioned that EU member states often bend their strict rules if it is more favorable to them .	-4.1406
As Scotland is not currently part of the Schengen area , continuing disregard for Brussels would be a small concession in exchange for what one really wants from the Scots .	-4.1815
So no story .	-3.0511
And one that has already come in such a way that it already resembles a fossil : the first time I heard the “ independence means passport controls ” duck at least 40 years ago .	-4.8537
An interesting point is lost in the constant repetition of this ancient history .	-3.5751
Why expect an independent Scotland to dance according to the European pipe ?	-2.4981
Why swap the London yoke for that of Brussels , especially now ? ? ? ? ? . . . are . . . .	-7.8806
These are the real European news : the great post-war plan for the unification of Europe has stalled .	-3.3611
With the euro crisis , the European project has officially died .	-2.1384
Across the EU , parties that are hostile to the EU or want to throw the euro out as a single currency are gaining ground .	-4.1529
Even in Germany , the Euroskeptic Alternative für Deutschland ( Alternative für Deutschland ) party – founded only this year – won almost five million votes in the September federal election and effectively expelled the Free Democrats ( the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats ) from the Bundestag .	-5.3637
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe .	-1.9466
The current economic crisis , however , turns out to be a turning point .	-1.5836
Because of the strict austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank in connection with the straitjacket to which the national economy is forced by adherence to the single currency , many people believe that the European project has gone too far .	-4.8307
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments running excessive budget deficits – only in Greece .	-3.1793
Instead , the Eurosystem has put its members on exchange rates that are beneficial to German exporters – and German politicians like to leave that in the same way .	-5.4937
Without the possibility of devaluing the local currency , southern Europe will find itself with a built-in productivity disadvantage vis-à-vis Germany .	-4.5424
The only way is to cut wages and public spending – driven by Berlin .	-2.7372
Behind the current budget and currency problems lies a deeper European productivity problem .	-2.3707
As a result of the “ green ” energy guidelines imposed by Brussels – a code for subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – European industry pays twice for electricity and four times for gas compared to the United States .	-3.9879
This is a crippling cost disadvantage , as we saw at Grangemouth .	-3.1842
All of the world ’ s wage writings do not protect the European petrochemical industry from being pushed into the corner by cheap American shale gas .	-4.2421
As a result , a revolt is rising , especially in France , the former EU cheerleader .	-3.7279
After the war , France ’ s political elite saw the EU as a vehicle to keep Germany in check and raise Paris on an equal footing with Washington .	-2.9343
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy , and has pushed Europe into its own economic policy , with which the French economy is struggling .	-10.1081
The result : Marine Le Pen ’ s right-wing , anti-EU National Front has just won a decisive re-election , with the ruling Socialists ranked third .	-4.6541
The National Front is now the most popular party in France , with 24 % of the vote – a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that right-wing divisions would automatically benefit the left .	-4.2168
What makes Le Pen so popular among the white French of the working class ?	-3.7126
It wants to use the EU elections next year to forge an anti-EU , anti-currency bloc in the European Parliament .	-2.7465
If the anti-EU parties do well in these elections – and that is quite possible – then for the first time such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament .	-4.6587
This is the point I want to make : in the not too distant future , the growing resentment of the EU and the single currency will come together to abolish the euro .	-3.6190
The EU will not disappear , but it will be more like the “ Europe of ( sovereign ) nations ” that General de Gaulle favored .	-2.9333
Germany and a few of its satellite economies may stick to the euro , but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies .	-2.6480
I expect Britain to distance itself from this project in the hope of flattering itself with the US .	-2.9924
But Washington ’ s growing interest in the Pacific region suggests that Britain will be alone in Atlantic rain .	-2.6207
Where does Scotland stand by all this ?	-2.7698
We can decide to be a region of ( ultimately ) small England .	-2.9176
Or we can defend our own economic interests – including , say , Berlin and Brussels , what they can find where they are .	-5.1597
I suspect that Scotland could do well in a more relaxed European union if we retain our own currency .	-4.8335
Cooperation with other similar countries is easier in an unfederated Europe of nations .	-2.7552
Otherwise , we should consider doing the same for Norway and maintaining our economic independence .	-3.8697
The SNP government in Scotland is , remarkably , the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe , and won a spectacular majority in 2011 , owing to the rejection of the proposed ( and implemented ) cuts that Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem coalition .	-4.2402
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to opt for independence now , only to get austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels .	-4.2229
Early Puberty : Growing up faster	-10.4844
African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white counterparts , as research shows .	-2.7438
Body Changes are Not Immediately Puberty	-3.5168
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible .	-1.4508

The Early Puberty Trend is Less Young	-3.4860
The former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in children 's health and family issues .	-7.3298
Should a mother be worried when her daughter grows breasts and shamhairs at the age of seven or eight ?	-4.1230
At the annual American Academy of Pediatrics conference this week in Orlando , Florida , the pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and were a new standard .	-3.7864
“ I spend a lot of time reassuring parents – usually this is no sign that puberty is coming quickly , ” explained Kaplowitz .	-5.2177
Obvious signs of development , such as growing breasts , shawls , and underarms , as well as body odor , are common in girls earlier .	-7.2429
However , there was only a slight shift in the age of the menarches ( occurrence of the first rule bleeding ) in the last 40 years .	-4.9303
In the United States , the average age is 12.5 years , slightly less than 12.75 in 1970 .	-1.7808
“ When the development of the breasts begins , it will take at least two or three years to reach the menarchy , ” said Kaplowitz , author of the book “ Early puberty in girls : The essential guide to dealing with this common problem . ”	-6.1231
Time is the most accurate test of puberty .	-2.1106
It is controversial , which is indeed the beginning of puberty , but it is “ premature ” when breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth boost before eight years of age .	-5.9485
In most cases , the process slows or stagnates – something that a pediatrician can closely monitor .	-2.7120
With faster progress , tests by an endikronologist may be displayed to prevent serious problems such as tumours or cysts .	-6.1120
There are treatment methods to delay an early menstruation and prevent another consequence : the premature ageing of the bones , which can ultimately lead to an inhibition of growth and therefore small body growth in adults .	-7.0328
The recommendations for medication or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child , the speed of development , the rate of growth and emotional maturity .	-3.5815
Psychosocial aspects are also important .	-1.1440
Kaplowitz is reticent about drugs , but he admits : “ The suppression of puberty can alleviate behavioral problems and girls ’ feelings of being different from their counterparts . ”	-4.9457
The other big problem is understandable : parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have the period .	-1.9044
" They worry about the risk of pregnancy or how they handle the hygienic side , " said Kaplowitz .	-3.2059
“ It was a shock , ” a woman remembers , whose daughter got her days with ten .	-3.3805
Although there were initial signs and we had spoken about menstruation , it was emotionally unprepared .	-3.3752
She came home frightened and excited from school because she was the first in her circle of friends .	-8.2065
There are many widely published theories about the causes of early puberty .	-1.9167
But there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other foods , chemicals in the environment , or sexual messages in the media are causal .	-3.2995
Boys are puberty similar to girls .	-4.8439
Kaplowitz believes that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of obesity .	-1.7788
He supported the conduct of a study in 2001 on girls aged six to nine who make a connection between body fat and entry into puberty .	-4.8116
Other studies support this conclusion , but there are many other factors that played a role .	-2.5434
In that country , African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white counterparts .	-2.7846
There are different explanations .	-1.8648
Global , early puberty seems to be influenced by all sorts of things , from economic conditions to climate to genes .	-3.7188
Another puzzle : although boys are already growing their face and shame , the trend toward full-scale earlier puberty is not as pronounced as girls .	-6.7529
Other doctors at the AAP conference underlined the complexity of the issue .	-2.5560
The appearance of acne and shame hair is common even for babies and infants .	-3.9031
“ We must be careful how we identify the true beginning of puberty , ” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman , a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children 's Hospital in Morristown , New Jersey .	-2.8729
Parents should not hesitate to ask their pediatrician how to talk to their child .	-2.9946
“ This can mean you have to talk earlier than expected , ” says Kaplowitz .	-4.1762
If you remain calm , the child usually reacts well .	-3.1204
Girls who bloom early need the insurance that the process is a normal part of life , even if it occurs earlier than intended .	-4.3314
Jumbo manufacturers are arguing in the face of large seating orders .	-3.8886
There has been a dispute between leading aircraft manufacturers about the breadth of long-haul seats in the tourist class , which is the tone for a bitter clash at the Dubai Airshow this month .	-4.9705
The dispute is about the size of seats offered to passengers on long flights in the tourist class – not always those that airlines make the most effort , but this designated space is the key to the efficiency claims of the latest Airbus SAS and Boeing Co .	-14.2603
This week , Airbus called for an industry standard that requires a minimum of 46 cm ( 18 inches ) seat in the tourist class , but the US rivalry Boeing says that airlines should decide .	-6.3266
The dispute comes at a time when aircraft builders are competing to sell even larger versions of their long-range twin-engine aircraft and expect record orders at the event from 17 to 21 November .	-5.0913
How the rear part of the aircraft is designed – especially whether there are nine or ten seats – is crucial to the economic results indicated by the new “ mini-jumbo ” design .	-5.3073
Boeing claims that its modernized “ 777X ” handles 406 people in tourist class seats that are more than 17 inches wide , allowing ten per row .	-5.2634
Airbus declares that the competing version of the A350 will carry 350 people in 18 inches in the tourist class , with nine per row .	-5.4326
Aircraft giants often share technical details with advertising in the specialist press .	-5.0811
Now Airbus is appealing directly to the public before the Dubai Airshow , where the 777X is expected to race with more than 100 orders .	-4.1985
Recently , the company presented an advertisement that could be the beginning of a new advertising war , showing donors a picture of three people squeezed together in a restaurant , and the title : “ Would you accept that ? ”	-5.9199
“ Boeing proposes long-haul flights in seats that are closer than regional turbo props , ” says Airbus Sales Director John Leahy .	-4.0228
People become thicker in the face of changes in eating habits , but aircraft seats have not changed radically .	-4.8484
Between the early 1970 ’ s , when the Boeing 747 defined modern long-distance travel , and by the end of the century , the male average American ’ s weight increased by 10 % between 40 and 49 years , according to the US Department of Health .	-4.6988
The size of the male average American waist in the 21st century is 100.8 cm , according to US health statistics .	-4.0426
Airbus says that its rival adheres to a seating concept from the 1950s , when the average body size of the newly launched “ Jet Set ” was narrower .	-5.2262
Investigations have been carried out , according to Airbus , showing that an additional tariff ( 2.54 cm ) per seat increases sleep quality by 53 % .	-5.7459
Boeing denies Airbus ’ figures on the size of the seat and says that it is not at manufacturers ’ discretion to decide how airlines balance air fares and facilities .	-6.7905
The company also explains that , according to research , the experience in the aircraft depends on more than the seat width .	-4.7300
“ It really amounts to giving airlines flexibility to do what they think they need to succeed , ” said Boeing ’ s Kent Craver .	-4.6532
They do not want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable .	-1.0535
They know their business better than anyone else .	-1.2454
Passengers are concerned with more elbow freedom , but for manufacturers it is increasingly becoming an issue that can affect sales .	-5.1196
Behind the debate is a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least $ 700 billion at list prices in the coming decades , which could have a lasting impact on the US or Europe ’ s export balance .	-5.1159
As Reuters first reported in July , the seat layout is the driving force behind the dispute over the new jets .	-3.2173
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 % more efficiency per seat with their latest twin-engine long-range designs than the market leader in this segment , the 365-seater Boeing 77-300ER .	-3.1857
The statements made by Boeing on the results depend in part on the 777X being compared to the original design of nine seats in the 777 with its ten seats per row .	-4.7946
The increased cost per unit is still lower than in the case of currently used machines with ten seats per row .	-4.9996
“ Boeing is squeezing more seats into its aircraft to make it more competitive with our products , ” says Kevin Keniston , Head of passenger comfort at European Airbus .	-4.1819
On the other hand , analysts say that full cabins with ten seats per row , with 777s available , suggest that many passengers chose the tighter arrangement , which could be accompanied by cheaper air fares .	-6.2023
“ Eighteen inch seat width would be great for passengers , but the reality is : from an economic point of view , the Airbus offer is driven by the threat posed by the 777 , ” says Mary Kirby , an expert in cabin configuration , founder and editor of Runway Girl Network .	-5.4060
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats , but a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose .	-3.0725
The world ’ s travelling jet sellers even carry a bandwidth to measure the equipment in the competition .	-6.6131
Even if they promote comfort , all manufacturers also offer high-density jets for low-cost airlines and regional flights .	-4.9716
Airbus offers a ten-seater A350 but has not yet sold it .	-8.9620
Until recently , Airbus underlined the importance of greater adaptability of the cabins and offered wide gears for some jets .	-5.5426
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets , experts say that the call for a new industry standard is likely to be fueled , but could distract from the wave of 777X sales .	-4.6828
New Anti-Nicotine Vaccine could Kill Smoking Fun	-4.9569
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could spoil the fun of smoking .	-1.9533
A single dose of the vaccine has been able to protect mice from nicotine addiction for a lifetime .	-2.9657
Prior to human testing , further trials are needed , which may take a few years , but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said that the first results were good .	-5.1482
“ We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to stop trying out all the methods available on the market , but have seen that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches , ” Cornell said .	-5.2841
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to contain genetic information to manufacture nicotine antibodies .	-2.6891
The virus selectively infects the liver cells , which then produce a permanent stream of antibodies .	-2.2363
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain , so a smoker does not experience nicotine high .	-4.0954
In trials , vaccinated mice administered to nicotine kept their normal level of activity .	-3.1780
By contrast , mice without vaccination would have taken a “ time-out , ” researchers declared , a sign that the nicotine had reached its brain .	-5.0078
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine .	-2.2614
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies .	-1.5417
Vaccines had to be given so often to maintain the antibody level that they were expensive and impractical .	-2.9381
But the cost of the new vaccine is probably much lower , because it transforms liver cells into antibody factories .	-2.8209
As Professor Crystal said , a future vaccine for people , if he is quite sure , could be administered to children before they get tempted to try a cigarette , thereby preventing nicotine addiction .	-5.1993
More likely , smokers would use it to stop it .	-7.3468
“ They then know that when they start smoking again , they no longer feel a pleasure because of the nicotine vaccine , and that helps them to leave the habit , ” he explains .	-5.8473
British scientists said that the results were interesting , but at the same time warned that further research was needed .	-2.9175
Tripodi denied having been influenced by Obeid .	-3.0889
A investigation is initiated against former Labour Minister Joe Tripodi of New South Wales by the State Corruption Supervisor .	-10.5244
The former NSW minister denies having changed the rules on marital leasing at the request of his political mentor , Eddie Obeid , who had hidden holdings in three plots of land on state-controlled land .	-6.6069
On Friday , the Independent Commission Against Corruption ( ICAC <unk> Independent Commission against Corruption ) extended its investigation into whether Obeid has influenced various state ministers to extend lease contracts at the Circular Quay , where the Obeids operated two restaurants and a café without tendering after their expiry in August 2005 .	-6.8748
It is now being investigated that Tripodi knew of Obeids ’ hidden interest in the land after Tripodi ’ s former deputy chief of staff , Lynne Ashpole , declared it accordingly on Thursday .	-6.9845
In years of talks that began in 2005 , the government had pressed for public tenders for leased contracts .	-4.0724
They were opposed to it and wanted longer terms .	-5.8385
In 2009 , the lease contracts for the Circular Quay companies , which contributed $ 2.5 million annually to the Obeids , were extended without a public tender .	-4.9708
Tripodi , who was port minister from February 2006 to November 2009 , had originally declared himself in favour of public tenders .	-3.7448
But he refuses to make the changes at the request of Obeid , who , as Tripodi confirmed , had pressed for a reorganization of the government ’ s lease arrangements .	-4.8549
One of ICAC ’ s telephone correspondence showed talks from August and September 2007 between Obeid , Tripodi and Steve Dunn , a senior official who had moved to the port ministry after working under the leadership of the Fisheries Authority .	-6.6562
‘ Was the subject discussed in these telephone conversations the elaboration of commercial leasing rules ? ’ , the Deputy Commissioner , Anthony Whealy Tripodi , asked .	-5.2194
“ No , ” Tripodi replied .	-2.0552
I cannot remember what was discussed , but it was definitely not .	-2.3707
Definitely not between me and Mr Obeid .	-2.1571
Israeli fighter aircraft attack Syria ’ s Target , Official Sources	-7.8728
Israeli fighter aircraft had attacked a target in the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday night , a senior government official confirmed to Fox News .	-5.0861
The official did not explain what the goal was , but said it was at least one .	-2.8717
According to Associated Press , the target was Russian SA-12 missiles .	-2.2951
At least twice this year , Israel has already carried out airstrikes on missile deliveries in Syria .	-3.2508
Foreign workers with 457 visas could be subjected to “ COA test . ”	-4.5348
The government is considering a “ test of authenticity ” for foreign workers with a 457-visa as part of expanded measures .	-5.8622
If the test was introduced , it would be used via a criterion to prevent the 457 from being used to fill unqualified jobs or as a backdoor for the migration of family and friends to Australia .	-5.5961
Today , a government discussion proposal was published after the former Labour Party MPs , Maxine McKew , condemned the government ’ s comments on foreign workers , because they could be perceived as insult by Australia ’ s neighbors .	-5.9800
“ Loud statements like foreigners are supposed to backfire — and , Australians first stop — are a very unpleasant setback in times when trade unions demanded a protected labor market , ” she said today to the Australia India Institute .	-7.6018
Historically , it meant that white workers should be protected – and if some in the region hear an echo of this historic artifact , I would not be surprised .	-4.5748
The proposal for discussion outlines twelve measures that were once thought up by former immigration minister Chris Bowen .	-4.4304
Immigration Minister Brendan O 'Connor , who was in Sri Lanka yesterday for talks on human smuggling , has implemented five of the proposed changes , the others are still being considered .	-5.4103
If the “ COA ” criterion is taken over , someone applying for a visa could be checked to see if “ the application is genuine in cases where the applicant is related to the owner or relevant person of the supporting company or is personally connected . ”	-6.5987
Businesses could also be obliged to account for the number of 457 visa holders after , in the past , hundreds of companies that initially wanted to support only a small number of workers have ended up hiring .	-5.7306
Meanwhile , a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker probably died from a heart attack after arriving this week with a refugee boat on Christmas Island .	-4.5232
The injured nine-year-old son of the man who came to Australia with him has been cared for by an adult cousin since his father died on Wednesday .	-4.8646
Australian authorities brought the man to the Christmas Island Hospital , where he died .	-1.3846
The British Government has announced a study to increase the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland .	-2.7605
The work of HS2 Ltd proposes to establish high-speed links between Scotland and the north of England at the beginning of phase 1 in 2026 .	-4.8021
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said that the project “ will bring Britain closer together . ”	-2.6263
The Scottish Transport Minister , Keith Brown , said that he was very pleased to work with the British Government on this plan .	-2.8628
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail link between London and the West Midlands .	-2.5993
After completion of Phase 2 , there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds .	-2.7628
In June , the government corrected the estimated cost of building the high-speed line between London and North England from <unk> 32.7 billion to <unk> 42.6 billion .	-3.1855
The UK Government , which is in talks with Transport Scotland , has asked HS2 Ltd to seek further route capacity and travel time improvements for Northern England and Scotland .	-4.5145
This includes the possibility of a travel time of three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London .	-3.5805
Baroness Kramer said , “ Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network that brings Britain and its cities closer together . ”	-2.8756
We are making progress with HS2 because it brings enormous benefits .	-3.4034
Without it , we are facing a capacity crisis in our rail network .	-3.0266
But it is also about the link between 18 British cities , including Glasgow and Edinburgh , which is improved thanks to HS2 .	-3.1667
The Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael commented : “ Today ’ s announcement is good news for Scotland . ”	-2.3029
On behalf of the Scottish government , Keith Brown Carmichael called for “ unequivocal ” efforts to be made to integrate Scotland into the HS2 network .	-4.5275
Brown said , “ high-speed rail links have the potential of enormous economic benefits for Scotland , but at the same time Scotland ’ s economic strength also provides an argument for rapid rail links across the UK . ”	-6.0572
We are therefore pleased to work as a partner of the British Government and to examine the options for a high-speed rail link in Scotland , which creates benefits for all and complements the Glasgow-Edinburgh link , which the Scottish Government is already planning .	-5.4590
I look forward to examining the investigation report with the British ministers next year and jointly adopting the next steps .	-3.8473
Regulations on electronic equipment in aircraft remain in force in Australia for the time being .	-2.8168
Australian air passengers must continue to disable tablets and smartphones on startup and landing , despite efforts in the US to loosen regulations for such devices .	-4.3994
The US Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) allows US airlines to change their requirements so that passengers can read , watch , or play e-books on their equipment during critical flight phases , provided they are in “ flight mode . ”	-4.8742
During most of the flight , passengers are already allowed to do so , but many people find it annoying that they are not allowed to read their e-books when they start and land .	-5.3621
Australian companies are watching the decision to implement which US airlines have to do a huge amount of work , but they have no immediate plans to change their rules .	-5.5542
CASA also declared that it would look at the announcement , but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic equipment in critical flight phases in Australia still apply .	-5.1234
“ CASA currently has no specific regulations regarding the use of electronic equipment in the aircraft ” , was announced .	-4.9079
This subject is subject to provisions requiring airlines to maintain safety at all times and to comply with the safety instructions given by cabin crew .	-9.7924
Virgin has already held talks with CASA about extending its Wi-Fi entertainment system on flights and declares that it is open to change , but it must be initiated by the legislator .	-6.0609
“ We would welcome a review of CASA ’ s approval of electronic devices , because we are convinced that this would improve the customer ’ s experience after we now offer ( wireless entertainment ) during the flight , ” said a speaker .	-5.4052
Qantas said that the current rules will remain in place until further notice .	-4.5418
“ Our current policy stipulates that electronic devices must not be used at startup and landing , and we currently have no plans to change that , ” said the company .	-5.0863
The FAA rules apply to US airlines .	-1.8568
However , we are always interested in developments in regulations that can benefit passengers and will certainly look closely at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it .	-4.1163
The decision has different effects on US companies depending on the age of the fleet .	-4.5954
They have to prove that their aircraft can tolerate wireless disturbances through mobile devices , and modify manuals , training materials , hand baggage programs , and customer instruction .	-6.0764
“ After an airline has confirmed its fleet ’ s tolerance , it can allow passengers to use portable , light electronic devices such as tablets , e-book readers , and smartphones at any height , ” the FAA announced .	-5.0066
In rare cases , in poor visibility , the crew will instruct the passengers to disable the equipment during the landing .	-5.3061
The group also recommended storing heavier equipment safely under the seat or in the compartments over the seats at startup and landing .	-4.7577
In front of the Revierderby against Schalke , the accompanying BVB trailers with light missiles provided ugly scenes in the Veltins Arena .	-5.9595
Borussia Dortmund then announced severe consequences .	-1.9436
Before the Friday match of the soccer Bundesliga against the VfB Stuttgart the Ultras reacted with a silence - first .	-9.6849
It was an unusual , almost ghostly acoustic that offered to the spectator until just before the start of the Bundesliga game between German vice-champion Borussia Dortmund and VfB Stuttgart in the signal Iduna Park .	-5.8974
Most of them were guest fans with their singing .	-4.2549
By contrast , the South Grandstand , where the most loyal of the loyal - and loudest - BVB fans stand , initially presented themselves exceptionally quiet : no songs , no slaughter calls .	-7.7961
The podium of the Capo , which otherwise coordinates the joint firing , remained unfilled .	-5.1531
And at the front of the grandstand there was a big banner with inscription " section prohibition of stadium " .	-6.8778
Only as the goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller , as always , was the first BVB player to take the place , burned up short-term cheers .	-7.3322
When his team colleagues followed , there were loud vocals and sweeping scarves - but not everywhere .	-5.1049
In the central blocks 12 and 13 of the southern grandstand nothing excited .	-5.0917
Also that stadium precher Norbert Dickel recounted the positive experiences of the last few days - Derbysieg , victory over Arsenal , contract extension by coach Jürgen Klopp - did not cause celebration .	-6.0874
Only five minutes before the start of the game , the capo knocked his podium - and the until then almost palpable tension escaped in a loud cry , when thickle asked the mood on the stadium ’ s ranks as usual .	-11.3396
As always , the South Grandstand was the last one - and finally , as usual , it was the loudest place in the stadium .	-7.4728
And at the latest when the loud call " Derbysieger stands on " came with a whisper from the South Grande , everything was again as usual .	-8.4621
The silence previously was probably a reaction to the events of the past few days .	-8.8743
Immediately before Revierderby at the FC Schalke 04 , some of the accompanying BVB followers had fired light missiles into the auditoriums and into the square - almost goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller .	-7.4512
The game was delayed due to the chaotic scenes .	-2.5455
BVB-Boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had received the heads of Dortmunder Ultras in his office - and one believes Watzke 's words , this was a rather tiring appointment for the fan representatives .	-6.5875
" There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra-movement , " the BVB boss announced on Thursday evening at a panel discussion in Frankfurt .	-3.6687
As an immediate measure , Watzke forbidden the Ultras a choreography for the home game against the VfB Stuttgart .	-3.8591
" I have banned that , " he said .	-2.9790
We cannot give up the zero tolerance policy on pyrotechnics .	-2.6520
In addition , the Ultras have been shown various possibilities of punishment - until Tuesday they have time to choose one .	-6.1877
Otherwise , Watzke said , the BVB will impose a sanction by the end of next week .	-3.0599
" This is going to be drastic , " said Watzke .	-3.9285
We should be curious to see what the reactions in the South Grande are .	-6.7450
Pfandhouses Boom in Singapore , as the Middle-Class Crisis Comes	-4.5880
In a Pfandhaus in the Bendemeer Shopping Centre in Singapore , Janani Amirthalinga swaps a golden arm , a ring and a pair of earrings to pay the school fees of her daughters .	-4.2745
“ My husband and I have just bought a house , there is all my money in it , ” says Amirthalinga .	-3.8493
Although she earns 3,000 Singapore dollars a month ( about 1,730 euros ) as an administrative assistant and her husband also works , the monthly family income does not suffice , she explains .	-5.5655
Indeed , demand in parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt is growing – is so great that ValueMax , where it has exchanged , became the third Pfandhouse listed on the Singapurian stock exchange this week .	-12.1790
The pledge of jewellery is not only a quick way to get money – $ 1,300 in Singapore in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also almost as cheap as an unsafe bank loan .	-4.7460
Typically , Pfandhouses in Singapore demand an effective annual interest rate of 17 % , just above the 15.4 % required by the United Overseas Bank , a local creditor with a branch in the same shopping mall .	-4.5154
Pfandhäuser , however , offers the advantage that no verification of creditworthiness or proof of income is required here , which is why loans are possible more quickly than with banks .	-6.1113
As a result , millions of people in the region are turning to Pfandhäuser , as families feel the pressure from rising living costs and increasing household and consumer debt .	-5.1106
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis , and cheap credit due to loose fiscal policies in developed economies , low- and middle-income families are looking for Pfandhäuser to compensate for the difference in staggering economies .	-6.5360
This week , the rating agency Standard & Poor 's growing household debt , mainly through rising mortgages , described as a risk factor for Asian banks ’ creditworthiness .	-4.4658
Malaysia , Thailand , and Singapore , according to the Agency , have the highest budget debt in Asia relative to GDP .	-3.8977
Malaysia is at the top of the list , with 80 % of GDP , a 60 % increase in 2008 .	-3.1843
Economists are also worried about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand , which has just emerged from a technical recession this week .	-4.0224
On Thursday , the data showed a continuing weakness in exports and a decline in consumer demand .	-3.2568

The largest Thai Pfandhouse operator , EasyMoney , has experienced a 20 % increase in its branches in recent months .	-3.9067
The growth in the deposit business is so strong that ValueMax , operator of the Bendemeer branch , and 15 more in Singapore , wants to expand not only to neighboring Malaysia – where the company operates four houses – but also outside Asia , according to Yeah Lee Ching , Managing Director of ValueMax .	-5.0054
The company finances this with 60 % of the 66 million Singapore dollars it received this week with the Singapore Stock Exchange .	-4.5279
While some lenders have been caught in the crossfire because of high interest rates , Yeah explains that Pfandhouses not only offered cheaper interest rates than other lenders , but also did not directly increase debt .	-6.2579
“ Customers allocate items they already own , and liquefying personal valuables does not increase household debt , ” she explains .	-4.5018
The mortgage lending business is increasingly accepted as short-term , secured financing .	-3.4266
Nor are all people using the Pfandleihe in financial difficulties .	-4.9476
Rich people from Singapore also come to ValueMax ’ s stores to pledge gold bars and Rolex watches , for which they receive up to 60 % of the purchase price in cash .	-4.1765

Following the presentation of the Green MEP Hans-Christian Ströbele , his surprising meeting with Snowden in Russia was about the conditions under which the ex-intelligence staff would report to a German prosecutor or to a committee of inquiry .	-5.5869

Tasmanian Health Rescue Package of $ 325 million	-4.6558
The Australian government insists on the harsh conditions associated with the rescue package of more than $ 325 million in Australian health care to ensure that the state government cannot waste the money .	-4.2279
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take “ immediate action ” to avert a crisis caused by an aging population of the island state , a higher rate of chronic diseases , and system restrictions .	-4.0255
The funding for a four-year period was decided after government consultations with independent Tasmanian MEP Andrew Wilkie .	-4.0785
“ The government has put together an emergency rescue package that , in our view , addresses the unique challenges facing the state , ” said Plibersek today .	-3.6752
The $ 325 million dollar package includes $ 31 million in emergency support for election services .	-4.1685
A further 2600 operations , including orthopaedic interventions and treatments based on grey star , are aimed at eliminating residues .	-5.6665
In addition , there is money for day clinics in Hobart and Launceston , better aftercare for stationary stays , the exchange of specialist medicine , mental health services , and the introduction of a system for the electronic recording of health data in local hospitals .	-6.4572
“ These investments are in line with the ideas that the clinic workers concerned have told me that they are the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system , ” said Tanya Plibersek .	-5.8728
The Minister insisted on strict reporting and accountability of the Tasmanian Government .	-2.8052
The state must maintain the current level of funding to receive money from the Commonwealth and report monthly where the additional funds were spent .	-4.0417
A three-member Commission will be set up to ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible .	-3.0294
As Wilkie said today , the $ 325 million would be of little use if “ they were not accompanied by real reforms that put the public Tasmanian health system on a more sustainable course . ”	-4.9636
Nevertheless , he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent assistance , which he first expressed to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May .	-3.6310
“ I am confident that federal aid will make a major contribution to removing the state ’ s public health system from the custody list , ” Wilkie said .	-3.7978
According to the state ’ s government , these electoral performance will largely offset recent cuts .	-4.6856
But the opposition ’ s health-policy spokesman , Peter Dutton , believes that today ’ s announcement is only a “ pavement solution . ”	-3.5605
“ We are in today ’ s situation because the Labor government has withdrawn $ 430 million from the health system , ” he said to ABC TV .	-4.3142
It is not acceptable for a government to pull nearly half a billion dollars out of the system , and for the Commonwealth to inject 300 million and then pretend to be good news .	-6.2408
Dutton called on Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the bailout will be spent on additional bureaucracy .	-3.8949

Syria Destroyed its Chemical Weapons Facility , a Monitoring Group	-4.5017
Syria destroyed important chemical weapons and toxic gas munitions , the global chemical weapons monitoring group declared on Thursday , while serious clashes occurred in the north of the country near one of the sites where toxic substances are suspected .	-6.1123
On Thursday , too , a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the beginning of the civil war , soon three years ago . were . were , , , , , , , , , , , and .	-8.7131
The announcement of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons ( OPCW ) came one day before the date at the meeting .	-3.8394
1 November , which the Hague based organisation Damascus had set up to destroy or “ inoperable ” all chemical weapons manufacturing facilities , including all chemical mixing machines , into toxic gas and filling ammunition .	-5.5258
The conclusion of this process , which is essentially the first stage of destruction , is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable aimed at destroying all Syria ’ s chemical weapons by mid-2014 .	-3.5896
Destructing the facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons .	-2.6023
Damascus , however , still has to start destroying existing weapons and stocks .	-3.7728
According to estimates , there are about 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons in the country , including Senfgas and Sarin ’ s nervous gas .	-3.6975
The announcement came at a time when battles took place in the city of Safira on Thursday , when experts say that there was a production facility for chemical weapons and storage facilities , as the British Syrian Human Rights Observatory reported .	-5.5562
The activist group , which is pursuing the number of deaths through a network of activists in Syria , declared on Thursday that 120.296 people died .	-4.6679
Of these , 61,067 civilians , including 6,365 children .	-1.8505
On the government side , 29,954 of them belonged to the army of President Bashar Assad , 18,678 were pro-government fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militias .	-3.1710
Also among the dead are 2,202 deserted army soldiers and 5,375 opposition fighters , many of them foreigners .	-2.9755
On 25 July , the UN estimated the number of deaths in this conflict since March 2011 to 100,000 .	-2.3414
This number has not been updated .	-1.9277
The conflict has forced some two million people to flee the country .	-2.1016
Assad ’ s troops have been fighting the rebels in Safira for weeks , many of which have links to al-Qaeda groups .	-7.3296
The observatory said that there had been losses on both sides on Thursday , but did not mention details .	-3.4074
The fighting underlines the danger faced by the chemical weapons inspectors , because their mission to liberate Syria from its toxic arsenal of weapons is a race against time in the midst of a raging civil war .	-4.6697
According to the OPCW , which works closely with the United Nations , the team “ is now convinced that it has seen and experienced the destruction of all Syria ’ s major production and mixing / filling facilities . ”	-4.4980
As a result , “ no further inspection activities are currently planned . ”	-3.5443
Earlier this week , the inspectors stated that they had completed the first round of checks and visited 21 out of 23 sites indicated by Damascus .	-3.3187
The inspectors said that it was impossible to visit two institutions because of safety concerns .	-4.4842
On Thursday , the OPWC declared that the two sites were “ abandoned , ” according to the Syrian statement , and the existing objects of the chemical weapons program had been relocated to other named facilities that were inspected . ”	-6.8881
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two facilities that the OPCW inspectors could not visit .	-2.8274
Syria has presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons , which must be approved by the OPWC Executive Committee next month .	-3.3103
“ I prefer the bravery and courage that you have all shown in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever carried out by this organisation , ” said Ahmed Uzumcu , the Director General of the monitoring organisation , in a commentary published by OPCW .	-5.5429
For three years now , the mostly Sunni Muslim rebels have been fighting Assad ’ s government and security forces , including many Alawites , to secede Shia Islam in this civil war .	-3.7555
With regard to further developments , Rami Abdurrahman , head of the Observatory , said that on Wednesday there was a strong explosion in an air defence facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latavia .	-5.3165
The cause of the explosion was not known , he explained .	-1.9124
Rare of the Bali Bomber Judgment	-4.8450
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who died in the Bali bombing in 2002 reacted angrily to the verdict for the last of the instigators who was brought to justice , because they believed that Umar Patek should be shot dead in legal terms .	-7.5394
Patek , who was fleeing just under ten years as one of Southeast Asia ’ s most sought after people , was sentenced to 20 years in prison yesterday for his role in building explosives for the bombing .	-4.9399
He could be released after 15 years with a penalty .	-3.9266
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder because of the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta , where 202 people died , including 88 Australians , and many others were injured .	-3.6273
A condemnation was also made in a number of terrorist charges , including a wave of explosives on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000 .	-4.1998
The Public Prosecutor had called for a life sentence , even though it could have applied for the death penalty for the man who , because of his reputation as a master bomber maker , is also called the “ demolition man . ”	-6.7782
The decision aroused painful memories from June Corteen , a Perth mother who lost her 39 year old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the devastation caused by Patek and his co-conspirators almost ten years ago .	-4.0477
In fighting with tears she said that Patek should have been sentenced to death .	-3.3356
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys .	-2.2475
“ He should be put before a shooting squad , ” Corteen said to AAP .	-4.4344
I have to live every day with no more grandchildren and I will never see my daughters .	-3.8379
The Sari Club was destroyed when , on 12 October 2002 , a massive bomb exploded in a small truck parked in front of the nightclub .	-5.5939
Peter Hughes was in Paddy 's Bar , where only 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber had a backpack filled with explosives exploded .	-7.7672
He fell into coma for a month after the attack , and “ died ” three times as he depended on a life preservation system .	-5.0619
Hughes said Patek deserves the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cell Jemaah Islamiah – Amrozi , Mukhlas , and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the bloodbath and executed four years ago .	-2.4340
In fact , this type should be subject to the death penalty above all others .	-4.3296
To keep him alive – no , there is no reason to keep him alive .	-3.1556
Getting 20 years after he killed 202 people and injured many hundreds is not much .	-3.0595
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers to be tried .	-2.9357
He withdrew almost a decade of arrest , but was eventually taken up in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad , where US forces killed former al-Qaeda boss Osama bin Laden almost four months later .	-3.9697
During the trial , an FBI agent said that intelligence reports indicated that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of rebuilding the link between South East Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda .	-3.8579
“ He did not stand up , ” Corteen said .	-2.9103
Until recently , he has shown no repentance for how much suffering he has inflicted on other people .	-3.6637
The verdict came before the ten-year anniversary of the attack this year , which is celebrated with commemorative ceremonies in Bali and Australia .	-4.1948
“ There will be many tears this year , ” Corteen said .	-1.8213
Patek may appeal against his judgment .	-2.2417
FAA : Passengers can now use electronic equipment in aircraft ( but do not make mobile calls )	-3.1662
Flight passengers can now listen to their electronic devices for reading , working , playing , and listening to music from the departure to landing , and use the image of films , but not by phone , according to the new guidelines issued by the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) in the USA on Thursday .	-8.1397
But passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately .	-1.4691
How quickly they would be implemented depends on the respective airline , said FAA employee Michael Huerta at a press conference .	-4.4852
The airlines must prove to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new directives and that they have updated the training manuals of the flight crew and the arrangements for storing the equipment in accordance with the new regulations .	-6.0612
The FAA stated that it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic equipment in aircraft .	-3.9280
Among these airlines were also Delta and JetBlue .	-2.4510
“ Depending on the state of the plan , we could approve the extended use of electronic devices very soon , ” the FAA announced in a statement .	-4.4728
At the moment , passengers must switch off smartphones , tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed .	-3.3932
You may not restart them until the aircraft reaches a height of three kilometres and the captain gives the green light .	-4.6096
When entering the landing , passengers must switch them off again and must not restart them before the plane has landed .	-6.1056
According to the new directives , airlines whose aircraft are protected against electronic interference could allow their passengers to use the equipment even at the start , landing and on the field , the FAA declared .	-5.7971
Most new commercial aircraft and other aircraft converted to larger heights for use of Wi-Fi should meet the criteria .	-4.7188
Laura Glading , president of the professional cabin crew association , welcomed the changes .	-3.5991
“ If the new regulation is implemented safely – and we work closely with the airline in this regard – both sides will benefit , ” Glading commented .	-4.3424
To be honest , we are sorry to have to feel like a watchdog on this subject .	-9.5376
Nevertheless , Internet connections for surfing , exchanging e-mails , text messages or downloading data under three kilometres remained prohibited , the authority explained .	-4.6548
Passengers are asked to introduce smartphones , tablets , and other devices into flight mode .	-3.8549
So there is still no “ Words With Friends ” , the Scrabble like online game that the actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 , when he had to leave a jet from American Airlines publicly because he refused to switch off the aircraft while the plane was parked on the plane .	-6.4804
And heavier devices such as laptops must continue to be stowed , as there is a risk of injury if they fly through the cabin .	-4.8497
Mobile calls during the flight are also prohibited .	-3.4338
The regulatory competence for telephone calls lies with the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) , not with the FAA .	-2.4750
FAA may lift the ban on certain electronic devices on startup and landing .	-3.0399
Last month , Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board said that safety experts on national transport issues on CBS News were still regarded as a risk .	-4.5135
“ Mobile phones are really a problem , not only because they could potentially cause disruption to navigation devices , but because we know from the FCC that the transmission from the air can also disrupt transmitters , ” says Rosenker .	-5.7249
A industry advisory committee , set up by the FAA to investigate this issue , recommended last month that the government allow a broader use of personal electronic equipment .	-4.9028
In recent years , pressure on the FAA has increased to ease restrictions on use .	-3.0841
Critics like the Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri believe that there are no valid safety reasons for the ban .	-2.9867
The restrictions are also becoming increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of the equipment has become ubiquitous .	-4.3745
Some studies mention the fact that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore the switch off of the device .	-4.9746
In 1966 , the FAA began to restrict the use of electronic equipment by air passengers after reports of disturbances in navigation and communications equipment had become known by UKW radios carried by passengers , which at the time represented the latest technology trend .	-7.4811
New aircraft are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft , but they are also designed and approved by the FAA that they do not have electronic interference .	-4.9794
Airlines have been providing Wi-Fi to passengers for a number of years when the altitude is reached .	-4.8319
Flyers adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also more insensitive to interferences .	-4.1957
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for greater use of electronic equipment under the new guidelines , Huerta said .	-4.1210
Today ’ s electronic devices generally emit much less radio radiation than previous generations .	-10.2023
E-readers , for example , only emit minimal radiation when you turn over .	-4.5608
However , when downloading or sending data , the transmission values are stronger .	-3.4733
Amazon.com. is one of the advocates of easing restrictions on the use of equipment by passengers .	-4.6721
In 2011 , company employees invited a passenger aircraft full of Kindle E-Reader and made a test flight to identify problems , but could not detect them .	-5.4734
Members of the FAA advisory committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using equipment .	-3.1870
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said that the disruption of the equipment was real , even if the risk was minimal .	-3.8128
Other committee members have said that there are only a few reports from pilots who talk about disrupting aircraft systems through the equipment , and most of them are very old .	-5.2270
The committee , however , recommended that the FAA allow pilots to arrange for passengers to switch off the equipment in case of instrument landing in poor visibility .	-6.9928
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and described them as a sensible adjustment for travellers who would today be equipped with technology .	-5.9261
“ We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience does not conflict with safety , ” said Roger Dow , CEO of the U.S. Travel Association .	-2.9279
Redeemed Bird by the North Sea Bob Rescue Service	-7.0641
A bird flown to the coast by air rescue service , found exhausted on a North Sea vessel , was released again into nature .	-5.0505
The water rally was flown to Aberdeen last month with a helicopter , where it was piled up by the Scottish animal welfare organisation SPCA in their rescue centre in Alloa .	-5.1158
Colin Seddon , head of the center , said : “ This waterfall was probably a wintry tractor from northern Europe , which was stopped by the strong winds over the North Sea . ”	-6.1555
Apparently , the exhausted bird sought refuge on the drilling island .	-2.6274
He added , “ He could no longer fly , so we were contacted with a request for help . ”	-3.6904
When she was released , the water rally was back in shape and healthy .	-4.6439
Is Europe ’ s elite prepared to do business with Britain ?	-1.7376
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy together and defining what those who are creating wealth and work in Britain want to change in our relations with the EU .	-4.5831
To this end , we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey among British economic leaders , asking them what they think about Britain , the economy , and the EU .	-3.5104
YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 business executives , representing roughly the UK ’ s size , sectors , and regions .	-4.5552
The results of the survey will surprise many .	-1.7355
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now exporting outside Europe , focusing on countries that modernise and grow while the states in the EU are stagnant .	-4.3993
They want government leaders to favor new trade links with countries like China , India , and Brazil , rather than embarking on the long and strenuous process of reforming the obscure EU institutions .	-4.3966
In their view , the majority of business leaders believe that control of these key competences should be reclaimed to Westminster on certain legal issues – from antitrust to product legislation .	-5.8812
There was widespread discontent about the internal market , because , according to companies , the costs of Brussels ’ rules would now outweigh the benefits of being part of Europe ’ s trade zone – even 40 % of large companies agreed that they were traditionally most pro-European .	-6.1322
Finally , and this probably says the most , our survey of economic leaders showed that a significant majority of the UK wants a course to change the agreement , and that a relationship with the EU based on trade is not politics .	-11.6058
This insight , found by companies of all sizes and leading corporations , shows that the economy is pushing for a “ meaningful change , ” which brings the shift of action back to Britain .	-5.3559
There is a lot at stake – a change in the agreement and better conditions for Britain would lead to a change of opinion in favour of remaining in the EU in a referendum at 16 % .	-6.3451
The Prime Minister should have no doubt : this poll shows that the British economy is behind his plan to renegotiate British conditions for EU membership .	-3.4922
It also shows that companies expect a significant shift in power relations back to Britain from renegotiation .	-2.9972
A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary now that the eurozone is moving towards a closer economic and fiscal union .	-2.8372
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK , as the result of our survey shows , which means more attention to trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels regulatory approach .	-4.5591
Gazprom ’ s Alexei Miller calls the start of a new gas era in Bulgaria .	-2.9314
The construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria is the start of one of the largest European energy projects , the Gazprom Executive Board explained .	-4.1443
“ Today ’ s event is a milestone : construction work on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline , the largest and most important project in Europe , has begun , ” said Gazprom ’ s CEO , Alexei Miller , in a statement on Thursday .	-10.8785
The project is a key element in the energy security of the entire European continent .	-2.2350
South Stream is supposed to ensure more diversity in Russia ’ s export routes through Europe .	-3.7554
A contract dispute between Gazprom and its counterpart in Ukraine , where most of Russia ’ s gas is stored for Europe , raises the risk of conventional routes , as is officially heard .	-5.6547
Miller said that the direct link to Bulgaria , a member of the European Union , meant that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries were “ forever ” eliminated .	-2.9809
Bulgarian consumers receive South Stream gas at discounted rates when the entire project comes into operation in 2015 .	-3.2384
According to Gazprom , construction works in other subordinate countries will begin on the planned route at the end of the year .	-4.1302
The pipeline has an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic metres of natural gas .	-2.1048
For national and international investors , there is no way past Germany ’ s real estate site .	-3.7370

This was the tenor of the 9th real estate day of the stock exchange newspaper .	-2.5415
German real estate markets benefit from economic strength and the favourable economic conditions in the country compared to Europe .	-4.5828
Christian Ulbrich , CEO of Europe , Middle East and Africa by Jones Lang LaSalle , pointed this out on the 9th real estate day of the stock exchange newspaper .	-3.6938
Ulbrich explains how to search for German commercial properties .	-4.9846
In the first three quarters of this year , it increased by 31 % compared to the previous year .	-3.4602
In the UK , the increase was only 6 % , and in France it was 19 % .	-3.9560
" Real estate investments offer an attractive interest rate , " Ulbrich said .	-2.4784
The yield gap between real estate and federal bonds is historically high .	-3.0413

Hearing before the Royal Commission : Two YMCA staff accused Jonathan Lord of sexual crimes	-3.4129
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales ( NSW ) have been charged with sexual crimes related to children before charges were raised against the nursery Jonathan Lord of Caringbah in 2011 , as the Royal Commission for the Sex of Children learned .	-6.7808
However , in the opening statement to the Commission , the YMCA stated that “ in the organization they never had to deal with a sexual abuse incident . ”	-6.2505
Managing Director Phillip Hare was asked about a case in which a YMCA employee was accused of crimes against child pornography , and another where a YMCA Caringbah Hall sports teacher was sentenced in 1991 for abuse of children entrusted to him .	-5.4134
Hare said Gail Furness , one of the Commission 's assisting lawyers , that he knew of the first case but did not know the second .	-4.3629
He admitted that the YMCA ’ s opening declaration to the Commission was also inaccurate in the assertion that “ there have been external YMCA checks , in which the YMCA was recognized as the frontline in child safety . ”	-5.8925
On the contrary , evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA was informed that it received the second lowest assessment of four possible in a Quality Audit of the Department of Education and Communities ( Ministry of Education ) in August of the year .	-5.1999
Hare , who started at the YMCA at 21 , admitted that the management failed “ from me to the bottom ” in hiring Lord and did not ensure that employees had been aware of their obligations to report violations of the guidelines on child safety .	-6.7533
Lord was sentenced at the beginning of the year for sexual offences against twelve boys during his two-year activity for the YMCA .	-4.5877
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison .	-1.4506
Hare disagrees , however , that the YMCA would have a cultural problem that prevented employees from reporting Lord ’ s breaches of children ’ s safety .	-4.8601
The staff said that they had observed violations , including that Lord was alone with children , they looked after them privately as babysitters , they were sitting on his lap , saying that he loved it , and that children had to play with his mobile phone .	-7.5440
Danielle Ockwell , whose superior Lord was asking for a child protection training because she was concerned about his behavior , said that the child service manager Jacqui Barnat , who was the Lords superior in YMCA Caringbah , was “ very intimidating and for most of the time very unapproachable . ”	-7.8838
The managing director explained that he would not accept statements by employees that they would not have dared to report back to their superiors .	-5.1582
Instead , he said , their friendship with Lord has affected their judgment , which is why they have not reported him .	-5.6178
Hare explained that he had informed the Board of YMCA NSW that the lesson to be learned from the Jonathan Lord incident was “ not about reporting ” by employees , and the Board agreed .	-6.3277
Hare said that the decision to force employees to sign secrecy obligations shortly after the accusations occurred was made by YMCA ’ s Chief Executive Officer , Liam Whitley .	-5.1881
He said that this should prevent the evidence from being contaminated , but that has been “ overzealous ” and badly implemented .	-4.3546
The YMCA NSW was not a safe organization for children during the period when Jonathan Lord was there between 2009 and 2011 , explained Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University , an expert on sexual abuse of children , to the Commission .	-4.6767
He explained that there were “ serious problems ” in hiring , checking , processing , training , and supervising employees .	-4.2205
The hearing was postponed until 20 December .	-0.8611
Tony Blair declared that he would seize the opportunity to return as British Prime Minister – but admits that a comeback is unlikely .	-3.1403
In an interview tonight on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his resignation , the 59-year-old announced his views on various domestic issues .	-3.2442
Since his resignation in June 2007 , after a decade as Head of State , Blair has largely avoided pronouncing on British policy , and his comments have mostly been limited to foreign policy and his role as envoy of the Quartet of peacemakers in the Middle East .	-5.4946
When asked whether he would like to return to the post of Prime Minister , Blair was quoted by the Evening Standard in London as saying , “ Yes , safe , but it is unlikely that this will happen , so ... ”	-5.6157
When the horse-show experts arrived in Cardiff in Scharen to pick the horse of the year , they knew that a tough competition was imminent .	-7.3137
But no one was prepared for the three-year old Fenton Kirkland .	-2.8351
The Knirps , who is not even in the kindergarten and only a few months ago took his first steps , and his Shetland Pony Toffee loosely traversed the three rounds and won the first prize , leaving 30 adult opponents behind .	-12.3485
The inseparable couple , both equal , were praised for their performance , behavior , and style in the annual competition organized by Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry , near Cardiff .	-5.1539
In his performance in competition against men and women with elegant melons , he had set his plate cap in a cheeky angle and led the two-year-old toffee through the ring .	-6.7500
Fenton was praised by the judges for his natural skills in dealing with the pony , which was far above his age .	-4.6354
And Toffee received the best marks for his appearance and personality .	-4.3156
Fenton had received Toffee last March as a gift for his third birthday and since then practised every day with the Shetland Pony .	-4.5879
His mother , Donna , 30 , said , “ Fenton and Toffee are a great pan . ”	-2.9115
They had to compete against the whole field of the competition and went off with Goldpokal and Rosette .	-6.2875
It was only the second time he had participated in a competition with toffee , and we were all enthusiastic when he won .	-4.3471
Fully strangers in the arena thought him to be so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him .	-4.1670
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale , South Wales , follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howell , who has been showing horses for over ten years .	-3.9722
Howell said , “ The whole audience was like electrified , and everyone fired and flattened him . ”	-6.1761
He ran on sand all the length of the arena and although he looked so tiny , he did fantastic work .	-4.3870
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses , tractors and farms and has two chickens to care for .	-3.2389
As he started , it will not take long for him to be on the “ Horse of the Year ” show – and I am sure he will do well .	-4.0804
One spokesman for the annual horse show said , “ Fenton is only three , but he knows how to deal with his pony . ”	-3.0143
Together they are a great team .	-1.3854
The judges judged Fenton and Toffee how well they had beaten and presented in the demonstration ring .	-3.9620
They care about good cooperation between Pony and guide – and Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring .	-4.5124
I am sure Fenton ’ s sweet clothes did their part to make it a perfect occasion .	-5.5947
The Chinese Newspaper should be “ reformed ” after appeal .	-4.5115
A Chinese newspaper that called on the front page for the release of a reporter accused of defamation should be reformed , declared a press regulator .	-4.0237
The Guangzhou based New Express had issued a rare public call to release the journalist Chen Yongzhou .	-7.6794
But Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to falsify reports of a party-state company .	-3.4603
Now , the New Express is being “ extensively rectified , ” the regulatory authority declared .	-4.8728
The Rectification Order was issued by the Press and Publications Authority , Radio , Film and Television in Guangdong .	-3.9429
Preliminary investigations have shown that the New Express , which is part of the Yangcheng Evening News Group , had published several inaccurate reports on the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013 .	-4.8271
“ The editorial management of the New Express was disordered , ” the regulatory authority announced in a statement .	-3.6072
She said that she decided “ to impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou and to withdraw his reporter license . ”	-4.7234
In addition , “ the Yangcheng Evening News Group has been instructed to complete the rectification of the New Express and recommended identifying the relevant officials at the New Express and immediately checking the New Express leadership team . ”	-6.0851
Chen had written several articles for the New Express in which he reported alleged financial irregularities with a manufacturer of construction machinery called Zoomlion .	-3.8639
After being arrested , the newspaper published two appeals for his release on the front page and stood behind his journalistic work .	-3.7026
But then Chen appeared on state television and admitted that he had published false reports for payment .	-4.3837
“ In this case , I damaged Zoomlion , as did the entire news industry and its ability to win public confidence , ” he explained to the state news channel CCTV .	-5.0899
I did it primarily because I was looking for money and glory .	-3.1498
I understand that I have acted wrongly .	-3.4078
Following Chen ’ s apology , the New Express issued an apology on the front page , saying that it failed to check the reports correctly .	-4.4692
Various well-known suspects have recently made confessions on television .	-3.3223
Experts say that confessions are still routinely imposed , despite a legislative amendment earlier this year , in which the authorities were banned from forcing someone to blame themselves .	-3.8305
Discovering Drug Tunnel with Own Railways between the US and Mexico	-5.7091
One of the most sophisticated tunnels for drug smuggling between the US and Mexico , which was completely equipped with lighting , ventilation and electric railway , has now been discovered .	-4.4030
The US authorities described the 120 times 90 centimetre tunnel as one of the most sophisticated passages ever found .	-3.1034
The tunnel , which runs through the zigzag pattern over a length of just under six football fields , connects warehouses near Tijuana , Mexico , and San Diego , USA .	-10.7701
In the area there are countless inconspicuous warehouses , making it easier to hide drug-loaded lorries .	-4.6943
The tunnel was closed before drugs could be transported unknowingly in it , the authorities declared .	-4.2913
During the discovery of the tunnel , eight and a half tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were secured , according to the court records .	-4.0954
Three men working as drivers , according to the authorities , were charged with the possession and intended sale of marijuana and cocaine .	-3.6386
They are threatened with prison sentences between ten years and for life in a sentence of guilt .	-5.3592
In Nogales , Arizona , smugglers rely on an extensive underground network of drainage channels .	-2.4140
The tunnel is the eighth large passage discovered in San Diego since 2006 .	-2.7145
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered in October following the Marihuana harvest in central Mexico , which poses a challenge for drug cartels to bring their product quickly to consumers .	-5.0876
In 2010 , authorities found a 640-metre-long passage of rails that ran from a kitchen in a house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego .	-5.3029
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr Still Love	-1.2849
Actors Orlando Bloom and model Miranda Kerr want to go separate ways in the future .	-2.5071
In an interview Bloom said , however , that he and Kerr still love themselves .	-7.2321
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents of the two-year Flynn .	-1.8135
Actor Orlando Bloom has spoken about the separation from his wife , top model Miranda Kerr .	-3.1187
In an interview with US journalist Katie Couric , who was supposed to be broadcast on Friday ( local time ) , Bloom said , " life sometimes does not go exactly as we plan or hope . "	-5.0560
Kerr and he still loved himself , stressed the 36-year-old .	-3.2152
" We will support each other and love Flynn 's parents " .	-3.0281
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010 , in 2011 their son Flynn was born .	-2.8387
According to Lexika , veganism is subordinate to vegetarianism , but it is quite different from that .	-5.2555
For while vegetarians allow themselves to consume cream , ice or a powerful Edam , these slimmers are not on the menu of a vegan .	-5.8481
Milk , cheese , egg , in addition to the abandonment of meat and fish , the vegan leaves all consumption of animal products - also honey is denied .	-5.4883
What remains , one might wonder , but on closer inspection , the vegan food world is characterised by a considerable ingenuity .	-5.6520
" Bread spreads are very popular " , explains Ute Henkelmann , the owner of the local Reformed House , which provides a variety of special products for vegans .	-5.3128
Reuben Proctor also likes to visit the shop in the Domgasse .	-3.0968
For 13 years the native New Zealand vegan lives , in Lampertheim he finds ( almost ) everything he needs to live . " In 1997 I my diet and became " .	-5.3566
At the turn of the century the next step was taken and I became a vegan .	-3.1495
" The conviction came not only because of the diet , but because of the choice of shoes , " says Proctor , who prefers normal leather .	-4.9948
He realized that there are other everyday concerns without animal products .	-4.4387
First and foremost , vegan is an ethics .	-2.3937
" I don 't want animals to die for me , " Proctor says the maxim of vegans that covers all consumption behavior .	-4.7721
Instead of burgers , stirrers or rubber bears , the vegan quickly discovered new products , and the enthusiasm grew .	-5.7140
" It is a double bonus , " said Proctor today , " In fact , vegan does not represent a renunciation , it is an enrichment . " The assumption that you the choice of food options is more to the power of habit.	-8.9675
And it is precisely these conditionality that led to the failure of some well-intentioned attempts .	-6.0741
" The addiction factor is a very important factor , which quickly abandons many , similar to smoking , " Proctor makes a comparison .	-5.7084
And say : " Certain flavours cannot be fixed on the animal " .	-5.6365
Often it is the spices or the type of preparation that make up the taste .	-3.4600
" You can also create the same effect in other ways , " the vegan illustrates .	-4.4294
Proctor brings aubergines , mushrooms and a few vegan sausages to a barbecue .	-4.5911
It takes care of a balanced , varied diet , in which it should taste quite gently .	-7.1728
Of course you want to have something between your teeth , that is legitimate .	-3.6929
" It should taste , but this is not only to reduce animal food , " said Proctor .	-3.6840
He has not suffered any health damage , including eating disorders , another widespread assumption .	-5.8814
For me the conversion had a positive aspect .	-3.0471
I do not take up a foreign cholesterol and have an increased vitamin content .	-4.0958
There are high-performance athletes who only eat vegan .	-3.3822
" My blood values are excellent , I am often checked , " says Proctor .	-4.4765
In particular , many veganism critics warn against the lack of vitamin B12 .	-3.2407
" Since animals are fed with feedingstuffs rather than grazing on the pasture , it is doubtful whether in the meat you buy in the refrigerator the vitamin B12 portion is high " , Proctor finds .	-6.1798
Vegans can also take the coenzyme in the form of tablets .	-3.3727
" My B12 values are fine , " he explains .	-1.7920
Proctor does not have to go a long way to raise food .	-4.8578
After all , basic food is everywhere , and every supermarket now has soya milk and other products .	-3.7607
I find everything I need on the spot .	-8.3285
Only from time to time I buy something special .	-3.0659
" Many people overlook the fact that only the finished products are expensive , but that is what we all know about " ordinary " finished products " .	-5.6607
In any case , the preparation of vegan dishes is much cheaper and less time-consuming than is generally assumed .	-4.1570
" There is a lot to discover in the house kitchen , with a few small tricks you can achieve good , if not partially better results , " says Proctor .	-5.2002
Margarine instead of butter , a bit more baking powder and carbonic acid instead of egg , with his vegan cheese cakes Proctor could also amaze his parents .	-5.2740
Family festivities give the vegan a a new spice .	-4.0435
This has a new meaning when you cook together .	-4.6879
" The situations that can arise are as different as the people themselves " , says Proctor .	-3.7076
Of course , he has already been sceptical .	-7.2247
Do you no longer taste my food ?	-2.8893
" Should I feel bad now because I drink milk ? " - in such cases , you have to act as a vegan with a finger .	-6.6683
" I do not reject people , I am part of this society , " Proctor does not want to be enclave .	-5.1005
And , more precisely , the everyday world does not seem as vegan as expected - and the vegan does not seem as constrained as usually assumed in everyday life .	-7.5916
Fast food is also allowed .	-1.3947
Pommes are everywhere !	-3.6418
" Many döner shops offer Falafel , or even a vegetarian yufka , " says Proctor .	-3.0502
In a pizzeria , he deviates on pasta dishes , or orders a pizza without cheese , all a matter of habit .	-4.6008
The restaurants are getting up to it so slowly .	-5.4005
" When I started eating vegan 13 years ago , everything was much more difficult " , the New Zealand can find a development : " You have to talk to people and draw them to the attention " .	-6.1009
" If there are enough requests , they may be inclined to add to the menu , " he hopes .	-4.0974
Vegan restaurants develop , such as the Mannheim combustion shop or the Vogelfrei café .	-4.8383
Proctor wants other restaurants to have at least a vegan dish on the menu .	-3.3785
Basically , vegan dishes are available to all .	-3.0183
Everyone can eat it , so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive .	-2.9024
" Flat dishes are exclusive , in the truest sense of the word , because they exclude others , " states Proctor .	-4.1721
" If you want to avoid food scandals , veganism is a safe way to make the vast majority of them impossible " , says Proctor .	-4.2145
However , buying vegan products could be a little difficult at the beginning .	-4.2310
In particular , if one learns to understand that animal additives can also be included in peanuts as colourers , it seems that adherence to ethics in so many hurdles and traps quickly leaves the courage .	-7.5622
It is not only for this reason that Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen have written a book : " Vegatissimo - Animal ingredients and their alternatives " explains the many ingredients that are used , both food and cleaning products .	-5.9108
" Gradually , one develops a scanner view and knows which signs and logos one has to pay attention to " It 's sometimes better to take small steps than to stop or stumble " , says Proctor .	-6.7033
Veganism , it is an important moral finger that raises awareness .	-3.9690
Perhaps he does not quite manage to abandon his habits , but at least he can teach consumers to critically question his habits .	-5.1596
The exchange operator Nasdaq OMX keeps its customers in touch .	-3.4755
Trading at the Nasdaq Options Market was suspended on Friday afternoon of German time .	-3.5278
In a communication the operator caused technical problems .	-2.3788
The other eleven US option markets , including two of Nasdaq OMX , continued their business unhindered .	-2.4700
The recent incident continues a whole series of smaller and larger failures with the stock exchange operator .	-5.6635
Only on Tuesday , the Nasdaq indices were not calculated for one hour due to errors in data transport .	-4.3015
In August of this year , there had been two failures in one week alone .	-4.5562
At first , the US investment bank Goldman Sachs had sent massive faulty purchasing orders to the option markets for technical problems .	-5.1042
As a result , the stock exchange operators needed almost a whole day to look through and cancel the orders .	-5.2511
Two days later , half of the total US stock trade came to a standstill for several hours due to a computer pan at the Nasdaq exchange .	-4.8600
In addition , last year ’ s Facebook IPO caused a stir .	-5.8509
The Nasdaq systems had not been able to cope with the flood of purchase and sale orders , later found the SEC stock exchange supervisor and gave the company a record $ 10 million .	-7.1025
Konstanz : Cycling 63-year-olds	-3.3950
The accident occurred , according to the police , when a 26-year-old man on Thursday evening , around 10pm , was on the left walking route from the railway station to the marketplace .	-7.6662
When a 63-year-old man suddenly stepped on a walk from a restaurant , the cyclist was unable to brake in time , according to the police .	-8.5383
In the following collision , the pedestrian was pressed against the wall of the house , then went down to the ground and a 15-centimetre long curvature turned on the head .	-9.3159
A rescue truck team brought the injured to the clinic for medical treatment .	-3.8267
British police issue Assange with an extradition document	-4.2951
The British police have today handed over a delivery document to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange , who sought refuge and asylum at the Ecuadorian embassy in London .	-4.6658
Scotland Yard declared that the 40-year-old Australian had been given a “ call to stand up ” to ask him to appear in a police station , and added that if he did not comply , he could be arrested .	-6.9401
Assange is threatening to extradite to Sweden for charges in a sexual offence , after his ability under British law has been exhausted since the Supreme Court rejected his objection to extradition at the beginning of the month .	-6.2253
As he feared that Stockholm would extradite him to the US , he sought refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on 19 June and asked the South American country for political asylum .	-4.4241
Scotland Yard “ asked a 40-year-old man to stand in a police station at a time we chose , ” a speaker said .	-6.0011
He continues to violate the conditions of his release on bail .	-2.2313
The message did not comment on the delivery of the police call .	-2.9955
Assange fears that he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States and charged for possible spy charges after publishing more than 250,000 diplomatic messages on WikiLeaks ’ revelation website .	-5.1116
Drivers caught between their legs with 210 km / h and hot drinks receive $ 1,000 penalty .	-4.6797
A driver 's penalty of $ 1,000 was imposed on him because he was driving between his legs with up to 210 km / h and a hot drink .	-5.1310
Andrew Howie , 35 , from Tiptree , Essex , was stopped with his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree on May 27 .	-2.8219
After the police stopped him , they discovered the beverage cup between his legs .	-3.0094
Howie was guilty before the District Court of Colchester without the necessary care and attention .	-4.8346
He received seven points and a six-month driving ban .	-2.1276
Howie was also convicted of paying 90 <unk> and 100 <unk> of a victim charge .	-5.4743
Tax on Foreign Property Owners Against London ’ s Speculative Bubble	-3.5101
The Treasury provisionally calculated the CGT measure , but is still waiting for the final decision by Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne , who imposed a 7 % tax on housing in the 2012 budget , costing more than <unk> 2 million , and annual fees for buyers who hold homes as a company and not as individuals .	-6.9502
Already , income from the Stamp Tax for Housing Property in Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea , which stood at <unk> 708 million in tax year 2012 / 13 , exceeds the proceeds collected for Northern Ireland , Wales , Scotland , the northeast , northwest , Yorkshire , and the Humber region .	-11.9800
Cook said : “ After the increases in the stamp tax on high-price housing and the introduction of the related legislation to prevent it , it is difficult to claim that high quality real estate is too low taxed , regardless of the effects of the outdated municipal tax system . ”	-8.4993
“ But this move could make some foreign investors more cautious about buying property in London , or discourage owners from selling it , ” he added .	-4.4058
First-class real estate – the top five to ten percent of the price housing market – in London ’ s prosperous south-west belt , which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon , has increased by 11.8 % last year .	-5.4105
The prices in Central London showed a steady annual growth of 5.6 % , but were overshadowed by an emerging “ domestic market , ” in which the southwestern part of the city , the north ( 7.4 % ) , and the east ( 6.5 % ) experienced an upward trend , according to a survey by Savills .	-5.7747
Scientists have been able to shed more light on the context in which a dog 's tail is associated with its mood .	-5.0913
Previous research had shown that happy dogs with the tail woven more to the right ( from the point of view of the dog ) , while it was the left side for nervous dogs .	-6.2281
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive and react to these subtle differences .	-2.4026
Professor Georgio Vallortigara , a neuroscientist at the University of Trento , said : “ People are well aware that the left and right half of the brain react differently to stimuli that cause positive or negative emotions . ”	-3.8313
Here we tried to look at this in other species .	-3.0093
He also noted that in dogs , just like in humans , the right half of the brain is responsible for the left side movement and vice versa , and that the two hemispheres played different roles in feelings .	-5.3863
To learn more about how dogs react to the side of the tail of their pets , researchers watched the animals while watching the films of other dogs .	-5.6659
They measured the heart rate of the four-legged legs and analyzed the behavior .	-3.2664
We will probably soon understand why the tail moves in one direction or another .	-3.8557
Professor Vallortigara said : “ We have shown dogs movies with dogs – either a natural version or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects , and we have been able to control the movement of the tail more left or right . ”	-5.8416
When the animals saw an otherwise expressive dog moving the tail to the right ( seen from the perspective of the weary dog ) , they remained completely relaxed .	-5.1277
However , when the tail inclination was mainly left ( again from the perspective of the dog that hurts ) , their heart rate rose and they looked restless .	-5.7336
Professor Vallortigara believes that dogs do not deliberately communicate with each other through these movements .	-3.1549
He is convinced that the dogs had learned from experience what movements they should worry about and when not .	-5.0409
He said : “ If you have different encounters with other dogs , and the wedge is more linked to the tail in one direction , and the right is more likely to produce a less friendly behavior , you are reacting on the basis of these experiences . ”	-7.5606
Researchers say that the findings could help dog owners , veterinarians , and coaches to understand their animal ’ s emotions better .	-4.1596
John Bradshaw , an expert on dog behaviour and guest scholarship at the Faculty of Animal Medicine at the University of Bristol , explained that this was not the first study to examine whether left and right were important for dogs .	-11.9086
Last year , a team at the University of Lincoln found out that dogs turn their heads to the left when they look at an aggressive dog , and to the right when it is a satisfied dog .	-4.6301
In another research at the University of Victoria in Canada , “ Dogs are more likely to go to a robot dog if their tail is <unk> left and not right , rather than being restless – exactly the other way round than in the Italian study . ”	-7.1230
According to his statement , the differences could be that the dogs in the various studies did not interpret the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs .	-5.0934
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could help , he explained .	-2.1358
“ While there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two brain halves are used for various purposes , many of the details still need to be determined – and dogs are no exception , ” says Bradshaw .	-4.0628
However , since their behaviour can be recorded simply , it will probably not take long for us to understand why the tail sometimes moves in one direction , sometimes in the other direction .	-10.4710
Arctic Monkeys ’ postponement in Glasgow for Alex Turner ’ s Disease	-4.3882
The rock band Arctic Monkeys has moved a performance in Glasgow after their lead singer has been ill with throwhead inflammation .	-5.8776
The band from Sheffield should play in the hydro on Friday .	-2.9522
Due to the illness of the lead singer Alex Turner , the concert must now be moved .	-3.8351
The band 's announcement came after she had to postpone a performance at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday .	-4.0233
In a statement on their official website , the Arctic Monkeys said : “ After the decision to cancel the show in the LG Arena in Birmingham this evening and at medical advice , the Arctic Monkeys must also cancel the show at the Hydro in Glasgow on Friday , November 1 . ”	-4.9749
“ Alex Turner diagnosed a throat head inflammation , which is why he cannot occur . ”	-5.4075

Pope Francis appoints first Cardinals in February	-7.4876
On 22 February , Pope Francis will first appoint new cardinals of the Catholic Church , as the Vatican announced on Thursday .	-3.7623
Cardinals are the highest clerics in the Catholic Church after the Pope , and they are also the ones who elect a Pope , so that Francis will appoint the first group of men who will ultimately participate in the election of his successor .	-4.9078
There are currently 201 cardinals .	-1.0837
However , a cardinal that has reached an age of 80 can no longer participate in the election of the Pope – that is to say a group of 120 “ eligible cardinals . ”	-5.4335
In a statement announcing the news , Father Federico Lombardi , a Vatican spokesman , said that there will be a meeting of all the cardinals before the ceremony for the appointment of the new cardinals , also known as the Consistery .	-4.9114
“ Pope Francis has decided to announce in advance his decision to convene the Consistency in February , so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from around the world can be planned , ” said Lombardi .	-4.4806
Catholic Voices Jack Valero said that the number of eligible cardinals will probably have fallen by February .	-3.1083
He said that a Pope would normally appoint as many cardinals as necessary , so that the number of cardinals entitled to vote would be 120 , and as many cardinals as 80 as he would like .	-5.0712
Next year ’ s Consistery is important because it is the first since the Franciscan election in March this year , according to Valero .	-5.7492
There is currently a certain overhang on the part of Europe , and Italy in particular .	-2.9342
“ It will be interesting to see if the new Pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance , ” he said .	-2.4626
Forty per cent of Catholics live in South America , but they have only a tiny number of cardinals .	-1.9043
The Cardinals will also be the first to be appointed since the formation of the Cardinals Council , founded by Francis , a group of eight cardinals from all over the world who have the task of finding ways of reforming the Church .	-4.4639
In the past , the Pope decided everything alone .	-2.1913
“ Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him , ” Valero said .	-2.3596
He said that it was “ possible ” for Francis to ask the Cardinals for advice .	-3.9969
But so far we have not been in this situation – that is all new .	-4.2081
Valero said that bishops from large places would typically be called cardinals , but Francis is “ full of surprises – so we do not know who he appoints . ”	-5.2705
GM Calls New Pickup Trucks in the US to Repair the Sitting Leaf	-4.3627
General Motors is calling back just under 19,000 of its brand-new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra-Pickup trucks built in 2014 to address a problem with the manually adjustable seat backrest , according to a Friday US automotive safety regulator .	-5.7205
On some of the cars there may be a defect in the mechanism for retaining the front seat backrest .	-4.9115
For this reason , they do not comply with the federal guidelines for vehicle safety in the case of head restraints .	-4.3027
“ If you drive up the vehicle from the back , it is possible that the head restraint does not properly protect the occupants so that there is an increased risk of injury , ” said the news on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ( NHTSA ) website .	-6.7791
The repaired models were produced between August 1st and September 10th .	-3.6341
The delivery of GM prints began in June and represents the most important model start of the leading American car manufacturer since the insolvency restructuring in 2009 .	-4.7009
GM informed the car owners of the defect in the first half of October .	-2.6847
NHTSA could not check the notification letter because of the 16-day government shutdown , which had a negative impact on car sales in October .	-4.0518
The sale of Silverado and Sierra prints , which were newly developed for the 2014 model year , increased by 20 % in the first ten months of the year , GM explained on Friday .	-5.3076
In October GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra-Pickup trucks .	-2.3384
GM shares on the New York Stock Exchange rose by 1.4 % to $ 37.47 on Friday afternoon .	-2.8866
An Obama electorate ’ s Despair	-5.3742
I have elected President Obama twice in the hope that change is possible .	-2.2231
He says that Obama has made commendable efforts that have been thwarted by the Republicans ’ blockade tactics .	-3.3387
Blocking Politics Don ’ t Forgive Obamacare ’ s Site Problems , Drone Attacks	-10.5469
Obama ’ s memoirs about the 2008 election campaign are a sad reminder of what might have been possible .	-2.4169
Nathaniel P. Morris is a student at Harvard Medical School in the second year .	-2.0904
I am reading a terribly sad book .	-7.5296
It is a book that I believed would brighten me up during the dull second year of my medical studies and give me hope .	-6.2002
It is called “ The Audacity to Win ” and describes Obama ’ s memoirs for the 2008 presidential election .	-3.0299
When I finish with my patient ’ s writings in the evening and go to bed , the book brings me back to a time when politics inspired millions and could take away the breath of a speech .	-7.1113
The election became a landslide victory , and news spokesmen held to reflect the historic significance of this hour .	-4.6639
My classmates were crying with joy , and my parents collected all the newspapers they could find .	-5.5604
A young team of visionaries was on the way to the White House and the nation was ready for change .	-1.9940
When Obama took office in 2008 , he had an agreement of 82 % .	-3.2177
And then I close the book .	-1.1275
Turning back to the present is a bad awakening as if one is torn out of a dream .	-3.3438
It is hard to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague memory , a sad reminder of missed opportunities .	-2.5191
In the years since I first voted , something has actually changed .	-3.4859
But it is simply nothing I could have imagined .	-2.2366
I acknowledge the great and versatile things Obama has achieved , from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act on Health Insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq , the end of the forced concealment of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden .	-3.8981
I , too , believe that the blocking tactics of party politics have overstepped our nation ’ s efforts to move forward : immigration reform , a public health insurance option and closing Guantanamo Bay , to name but a few .	-6.8958
But , having defended the Obama administration countless times to colleagues and acquaintances , I have come to the end of my attempts to explain .	-4.5794
I have reached a point of political despair .	-1.2610
Republican blockade policy cannot explain why it allows foreign leaders to intercept or the killing of innocent children by drones overseas .	-4.1042
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data on Americans ’ private lives , and why whistleblowers are being punished for exposing state wrongdoing .	-9.6919
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki , an American citizen , was murdered without trial , nor why public funding and spending limits were circumvented during the presidential election .	-3.3167
It does not justify the results of a report stating that the White House ’ s efforts to retire the media are the “ most aggressive ... since the Nixon government . ”	-8.6738
And most recently , it can not excuse the inability to design a simple website in the more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act .	-2.5835
I do not know if it is what I should have expected .	-1.8210
Whether I should have understood at 18 that government work could have contradicted the political campaigns that preceded it .	-4.3829
Obviously , the Members ’ Office is not a predictable course of action , as an opposition party and random events such as the Newtown massacre are shaping public debate .	-5.9569
But if I look at the examples above , they seem to be largely elected by the government itself .	-3.6330
And that bothers me most .	-1.8661
I re-elected Obama in 2012 , not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy .	-1.8299
Mitt Romney was a confusing and unsophisticated alternative , and he seemed unable to determine his direction and positions .	-4.4893
I had the impression that a second term for Obama , free of pressure from future elections , would fulfil the hope that we had heard for so long .	-3.9178
But , with Obama ’ s approval ratings down to less than 45 % this week , the return to 2008 has become all the harder as a result of .	-4.8493
It awakens in me the longing for the many promises that have dissolved into air .	-4.3784
This week , I read a section in the book that describes how Obama had to endure a serious loss against Clinton in the Pennsylvania primaries .	-4.3597
In a meeting with the electoral assistants after the decision , he told his staff that they had to get back on track and follow the purpose of their cause .	-5.8418
“ I want us to find our magic , ” he said .	-2.1023
We must remember who we are .	-1.0594
It is five years later , Mr President , and I could not agree more with you .	-2.6119

Clive Palmer claims that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in parental leave	-2.4036
The billionaire and MEP Clive Palmer says that Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in conflict of interest in his parental leave plans , because his daughters are pregnant and could therefore benefit from them .	-4.0521
The mining tycoon , in a court dispute over the payment of $ 6 million in carbon tax , made the claim when he wanted to sweep questions from the table as to whether he was in conflict .	-6.8511
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate , which are important for deciding whether CO2 and mining taxes will be cut or cut .	-4.1225
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest , and the daughters of Abbott would personally benefit from the laws .	-2.9980
“ He is in a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave , because when one of his daughters becomes pregnant , he has a direct interest in whether or not she is going to get a holiday , ” said Palmer .	-5.6993
Two months after the election , the Palmer electoral commission officially declared the winner of the Sunshine-Coast-sitting of Fairfax with 53 votes in advance .	-6.0347
Palmer called for a review of the voting counting process so that it can be done more quickly .	-4.4333
Tony Abbott 's daughters Frances and Bridget .	-1.3103
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of the vote ?	-2.2003
“ We need a better system , ” he said .	-0.8801
Why should we not have a system where you march in , enter data into a computer , select immediately and then have the result at 6 : 30 in the evening ?	-5.6698
Palmer also criticized the use of pencils when marking ballots .	-2.3242
Is it used because you can wipe out the results if you do not like them ?	-4.3863
Counting with pencils today is incredible .	-4.2341
The Electoral Commission examined the options for an electronic election and recently published a joint legislative proposal with New Zealand .	-2.9721
Palmer , 59 , explained that his policy included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast , and that he would take his new office “ very seriously . ”	-3.1788
A public office is about serving the public .	-2.2053
“ We are not striving for any reward other than that of history , namely that we can serve in a critical time of this community , ” he said .	-4.4838
RBS Suspends Two Forex Dealers	-1.8861
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange department , two people who are familiar with the situation ; this is yet another indication that the worldwide official investigation into the alleged manipulation of the currency market is on the move .	-7.0842
Some of the world ’ s largest banks , including UBS , Barclays , Deutsche Bank , and RBS , have confirmed that they are cooperating with the authorities in investigating the world ’ s largest financial market , where $ 5.3 trillion of ownership is changed every day .	-4.6936
The two traders would be the first RBS staff to be suspended in the expanding investigation that led to the Libor interbank scandal .	-4.2652
The bank , which did not comment on the suspensions , confirmed this month that it had received requests for information from authorities .	-9.8082
“ Our investigation on this issue continues and we are cooperating fully with the FCA and other regulators , ” said the Bank two weeks ago .	-4.0053
Last month , people close to the situation reported that the RBS forwarded the records of e-mails and instant messages sent by and to a former trader to the UK ’ s Financial Conduct Authority .	-5.1567
This trader , Richard Usher , had left RBS 2010 and is now to have been approved by his current position as European leader of Forex Spot trading at JPMorgan .	-5.5815
Rohan Ramchandani , head of the European Spot Trading at Citi , was awarded this week and Matt Gardiner , former senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS , was suspended at Standard Chartered this week .	-3.8719
None of these traders were accused of any misconduct .	-2.9768
The Instant Message Group of Usher included bankers at Barclays and Citigroup , said people close to the situation .	-4.2839
UBS announced this week that she took steps against some of her staff after the Swiss regulatory authority Finma declared that she was investigating alleged manipulation of the currency market in a number of Swiss banks .	-4.3830
At least six authorities around the world – the European Commission , Finma , the Swiss competition authority Weko , the FCA , the US Department of Justice , and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently engaged in allegations that bankers should have agreed on transactions in the currency market .	-4.9014
HSBC , Citigroup , JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also initiated internal investigations or received requests for information from authorities , said people familiar with the situation .	-3.3007
Banks use instant messages and e-mails from several years in search of cases of malpractice .	-4.7946
The news about these investigations has stirred traders into an area that has been one of the most profitable trading units of investment banks in recent years , but this year has been under pressure because low currency volatility limits speculators ’ chances .	-5.6781
Some bankers have tried to downplay the affair , saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast and highly liquid foreign-exchange market , but leading traders believe that this is not necessarily true .	-4.1333
A leading trader noted that , despite the enormous daily volume of foreign exchange trading , fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use of banks ’ own internal platforms mean that “ you can influence the market even at very low ticket prices . ”	-6.1296
The news came out the same day , when Credit Suisse announced that she had terminated a London Exchange Traded Fund broker this week after causing a loss of nearly $ 6 million at the end of last year .	-4.6182
The Bank promptly informed the competent authorities and cooperates with them .	-2.2386
“ We are sure that the trader acted alone and that the matter is contained , ” said Credit Suisse .	-3.7239
Painting the Building Fence on the Bechtle Land	-3.8689
A group of citizens ' initiative " Schweizer Wiese " has embellished the fence on the Bechtle plot on the spa promenade in Bad Herrenalb .	-4.8008
In addition , it cleaned and widened the footpath , it says in a press release .	-4.7931
The planned cover of the decaying house in the rear part of the plot was not allowed for safety reasons , as the terrain is in danger of slipping .	-5.9932
Alfred Abel , who currently manages the property , had agreed to the embellishment action with his colleague Reinhard Domke of the BI .	-8.4260
Before the BI 's action , a banner was attached with the message " We are in favour " .	-4.8398
But that did not bother the approximately 20 members of the citizens ' initiative much in their action .	-3.9471
Her motto on the big poster was " We are against building ruins " .	-3.6922
In doing so , she wanted to point out the danger of even larger ruins on the Swiss meadow - if one day the giant project fails .	-5.7414
In conversation with many passers-by in front of the construction site , it became clear that some citizens believe that the implementation of the city 's project will be better for many , although not a few have the same questions about the dimension of the presented project as the BI .	-6.2065
But they are starting to resign because the city is delaying these responses , it is said by the BI .	-4.2316
As was heard , the mayor ’ s public statements also have an impact .	-4.6510
May said at the municipal meeting that he feared the end of the thermal bath if the population were to vote against the plans for a spa and wellness complex on the Swiss meadow during the citizens ’ decision .	-7.8954
Some people therefore appear to be frightened , others feel that they are " plummeting blackmail " on the population , as the BI press release says .	-8.6901
The BI thanked the donors for the color and all the helpers .	-2.5827
Shiris Rangnick : Mane No Swallow King	-3.6100
As satisfied as Ralf Rangnick is with the current high form of Bundesliga table leader Red Bull Salzburg , the sports director of the " bulls " was disappointed by the referees .	-5.4459
" There is currently a dangerous tendency for Mane and Alan to be pushed into the category of Swallow King , " he protected the two offensive wipers at a press conference in Salzburg on Thursday .	-4.8573
The most recent reason for Rangnick 's criticism was Yellow for Mane at the 3 : 0 against Grödig last Sunday , when Senegalese became the victim of an alleged acting act - which , however , was not , as the TV pictures showed .	-7.8523
" A gross misdecision , " Rangnick said , who called Harkam arbitrator " completely overstretched " .	-5.6782
Harkamm would also have contributed " his part " to the escalation between Salzburg-Coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig-Trainer Adi Hütter after the match .	-2.9006
He decisively defended his German compatriot : " I would have behaved like Roger Schmidt in every single situation .	-8.4512
Schmidt himself does not want to have any contact with his colleague after the skirmish .	-5.4381
I do not know why .	-0.8471
" For I am the one who was insulted , " the 46-year-old stressed .	-2.8392
In view of the success , Rangnick agreed to a hymn of praise .	-4.4244
" There are only two words for this : right good , " he noted .	-4.0139
There is not much to suspend .	-2.9317
Especially the way the team plays is impressive .	-2.5128
That should continue .	-4.1094
Changes in cadre during the winter transfer period will hardly be possible .	-7.8376
There are no great reasons to change anything .	-1.7413
" Except for a player , Rangnick made it clear that he wants to leave the club .	-4.3060
Supreme Court confirms Obama ’ s Health Act	-2.6583
It is a great victory for the Obama administration : the US Supreme Court today ruled that the tightly linked health-care law is constitutional .	-4.0731
With five to four votes , the judges ruled that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ’ s individual mandate – forcing US citizens to take out health insurance or pay a penalty by 2014 – is constitutional within the state ’ s tax authority .	-5.2191
The Supreme Judge John Roberts proposed to side with the four more liberal members of the Chamber , while the judges Scalia , Thomas , Alito , and Kennedy decided against it .	-4.5672
The Court also confirmed the remainder of the 2700 pages of the law and also argued that the provision of the health law that states would either have to extend access conditions for Medicaid or otherwise remove all state Medicaid subsidies was not unconstitutional .	-8.3572
The lawsuit against the law was initiated by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business .	-2.9793
The law had been decisively rejected by all leading Republican presidential candidates , including the ultimate challenger , Mitt Romney , in the 2012 pre-election campaign .	-3.3121
Norway ’ s Great Spike Lights	-5.5399
With huge mirrors , the inhabitants of a Norwegian village have brought light to their dark valley .	-3.4270
Due to the low level of sunlight , the Rjukan , located in the Vestfjord valley , usually sinks in the shadow of the surrounding mountains from autumn to spring .	-5.0469
With three gigantic reflectors at an altitude of 45 metres , a century space became true on Wednesday .	-5.9034
" Finally ! " , mayor Steinar Bergsland swarmed at the start ceremony at TV2 .	-4.4939
Some of the inhabitants of the valley used sun chairs , while others used sunglasses for safety .	-10.2087
So far , sun-hungry people had to go to a nearby peak with a cable car in winter .	-4.8309
Ten years ago , local artist Martin Andersen presented the proposal to channel the rays into the valley with mirrors .	-3.3925
This idea has existed since 1913 .	-3.5783
After several years of debate , the City Council finally approved the project , which costs around EUR 615 000 .	-5.6796
A similar construction has provided winter sunshine to the Italian Alpine resort of Viganella for several years .	-4.6073
Post Less Sundays	-4.9487
" Many citizens will not have noticed it yet , the red points for Sunday emptying are still in various mailboxes of the city centre and the districts , but reading the small print on the yellow container of Post AG , you will soon find out that the emptying is no longer taking place on Sundays and public holidays , " says the FDP .	-8.5116
A request from the FDP confirmed that .	-7.5214
On Sundays and public holidays only in front of the post office building in Ernst-Ludwig-Stra<unk>e 36 and in Jakob Müller-Stra<unk>e 1 in Hüttenfeld are emptied .	-4.1137
Whether in Hofheim and Rosengarten will be emptied on Sunday will not be answered in response to the FDP ’ s request .	-5.4822
The FDP ’ s social and youth policy spokesman , Fritz Röhrenbeck , wants to hack here .	-4.8350
Sunday empty is an important postal service especially in the case of postal mail .	-6.8424
" This undertaking , despite the increase in the price of letters on January 2013 , is radically and unreasonable " .	-4.5168
Thomas Bittner , the leader of the Liberal Group and the city association , supports his group colleagues : ' What annoys me is the fact that the time of rest is being changed or even deleted ' .	-9.3011
The Post Office is miles away from its proximity to the people .	-7.7816
" At least the post boxes in the Neuschlo<unk> and Rosengarten districts must be emptied again on Sundays " , says Bittner and Röhrenbeck unisono .	-4.1428
Also valid for the city centre , especially non-mobile citizens , would have to be able to reach a letter box with Sunday empty on foot .	-6.9043
Röhrenbeck asked in the city parliament whether the city administration is planning talks with the post office on this matter .	-5.8429
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the post did not communicate with Lampertheim .	-1.6036
But Hofheim also has a Sunday emptying in his knowledge .	-4.5310
Your party has called for privatisation .	-3.1782
" Then decisions are taken elsewhere , " Maier said .	-2.3124
Frankfurt ’ s parking fees should rise sharply .	-3.8214
Parking in Frankfurt could soon become more expensive .	-2.5534
This morning , the city ’ s magistrate advises on a presentation of a traffic decker Stefan Majer ( Green ) .	-6.5136
This means that parking fees should be increased by 50 percent .	-7.6363
For this purpose , however , we should not increase prices , but reduce the time interval between parking clocks and automatic parking machines from 30 to 20 minutes .	-12.7586
In December , the city council will have to decide .	-5.0978
The retail committee of the IHK Frankfurt considers this ' not a good idea ' .	-3.9924
The parking facility right in front of the shop was " an undisputed advantage for smaller retailers " .	-6.5996
The German Transport Club believes that an increase after two decades is ' quite appropriate and actually long overdue ' .	-3.6841
Public transport is also becoming more expensive .	-1.9511
Freudenstadt : Quick Action Overthrowing Hosts	-5.3020
With a narrow cadre , Mr. I of the TSV Freudenstadt had to compete against the TG Gönningen from the Swabian Alb in the Schiller-Schullturnhalle in Reutlingen .	-5.8395
The elders stood with an experienced team on the other net side .	-3.7742
Soon , however , it became apparent that they were not able to keep up with the fast actions of the Freudenstadt , .	-6.8481
With the hard and buried attacks , the patrons were extremely hard .	-5.8197
Repeatedly they missed the passports and attacks that Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz had entrusted to the network centre and were not there for block defense .	-6.9135
Two high first wins in the sentence clearly expressed the superiority of the Freudenstadt in all matters .	-7.4200
In the face of this crushing and play-determining performance , the third set was then won a little lax and amusing at the 3 : 0 final level ( 25 : 13 , 25 : 14 , 25 : 22 ) .	-7.4930
On 2 November , the TV Baiersbronn , which was able to assert itself clearly in Nagold , will be a much more powerful opponent in the field .	-6.1066
TSV Freudenstadt I : Dominik Bäuerle , Yannik Büchle , Sebastian Dölker , Felix Pälchen , Stefan Räller , Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz .	-1.3956
In the B-Class the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt stood in the Murg Valley Hall in Baiersbronn .	-4.1617
They delivered a hard-fought two-hour match .	-2.0114
Nervousness on both sides caused errors and points , especially when taking the ball ; even in the passports , precision was sometimes scarce and in some critical game scenes , the overzeal prevented the view for possible score gains .	-10.5560
In this very well-balanced meeting , Marcus Blasutto ’ s TSV team consistently agreed with the great physical commitment and a happy commitment of both teams .	-6.8224
Maintenance Day at the Small English Hut	-4.0412
On the fifth day of care in the succession of the Natura 2000 project above Hotzenwald , a group of dedicated participants met at the small English hut in Ibach .	-4.8444
Due to suggestions from the population , this day in the area of the hut the view into the valley should be cleared , said mayor Helmut Kaiser .	-5.1176
Many hikers , according to Kaiser , described this area as the splendour of the Schluchtenstein , where the landscape provides the ideal setting for magnificent views .	-6.3411
He thanked those present for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the day of care was an appropriate instrument to strengthen the link between man and nature .	-5.4010
It offers every citizen the opportunity to set the standards themselves in nature .	-5.6589
At the same time , with the tourist aspect , ecological considerations can also be taken into account .	-4.2911
This ecological aspect was explained by Friederike Tribukait of the Department of Nature Conservation of the Government of Freiburg following the welcome of the Councillor Tilman Bollacher , who had taken over the patronage and wanted the action to be successful .	-6.8102
According to Tribukait , the tourist goal of the far-sighted is to preserve the now heavily grown old Allmendweidfeld with its specific protected habitat types by opening and connecting to the existing pastures .	-7.9182
Certain species such as rare butterflies and grasshoppers cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest areas .	-2.7647
You need these free links to conservation .	-3.0468
Tribukait said that she did not want to miss out on breaking a lance for the planned biosphere .	-4.6833
The current measure is not only seamless in this planning .	-3.9976
A biosphere area also offers the opportunity for sustainable economic and ecological development based on the internationally recognized Unesco status and thus a continuous addition to the life project and the previous careers days for the future .	-6.7781
Following these different versions , Revier-Leader Christoph Wehle and Life-Project Manager Cornelia Bischoff divided the helpers into groups .	-4.8809
The larger trees had already been beaten in advance , and the forestry tractor could be called up .	-5.0807
A group of helpers should take care of the release of juniper bushes and the maintenance of a dry stone bar .	-4.0718
The goal was the free view at the viewpoint .	-3.6878
Löffingen : Leaders Still Only Can	-3.2033
Information on the Internet : Although the Baar town of Löffingen with its 7514 inhabitants , an intact infrastructure , a future-oriented school , children 's , youth and senior citizens ' policy , as well as its own townworks , can be described as an attractive city , no second mayor ’ s cabinet has yet registered itself .	-7.0857
Norbert Brugger is the only candidate to succeed the mayor of Löffingen who is no longer standing for reasons of age .	-13.1403
The application period expires on Monday , November 11 , at 6 p.m.	-8.7762
Google , Samsung , Huawei sued for Nortel patents	-1.7932
The group , which owns thousands of former Nortel patents , tightened an avalanche of patent infringement lawsuits against mobile manufacturers on Thursday , including Google , the company that Nortel overbid in the bankruptcy auction .	-5.6241
Rockstar , the consortium that had purchased Nortel patents for $ 4.5 billion , sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd , HTC Corp , Huawei , and four other companies for patent infringement before the US District Court in Texas .	-3.2604
Rockstar is owned by Apple , Microsoft , BlackBerry , Ericsson and Sony .	-1.7206
Google is accused in seven cases of patent infringement .	-1.6017
The patents affect technology that matches search terms on the Internet with relevant advertising , so the lawsuit that hits the core of Google 's search engine business .	-5.5607
Representatives of Samsung , Huawei , HTC and Rockstar were not directly accessible .	-2.3711
Samsung , Huawei and HTC produce mobile phones that work with Google ’ s Android operating system , which is in sharp competition with Apple and Microsoft ’ s mobile products .	-3.6573
In 2011 , Google placed an initial bid of $ 900 million for Nortel patents .	-2.6049
Google increased its offer several times and last offered $ 4.4 billion .	-2.5127
After being outbid with Rockstar ’ s Nortel patents , Google Motorola Mobility acquired $ 12.5 billion , a business that was also partly motivated by Motorola ’ s library of patents .	-4.0659
“ Although Google has failed in trying to purchase the patent at the auction , Google has violated the patents and continues to do so , ” says the letter of appeal .	-6.1321
Rockstar claims a high compensation from Google because it claims that Google ’ s patent infringement is intentional , according to the accusation .	-4.5194
Egypt ’ s First freely elected President	-2.9466
Mohammed Morsi leaves office , but his day of triumph is unlikely to mark the end of political disputes in Egypt .	-4.2846
Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised a “ new Egypt , ” when he was sworn as the country ’ s first freely elected president , succeeding Husni Mubarak , who had been expelled from office 16 months earlier .	-3.5851
With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court , Morsi became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world , and Egypt ’ s fifth head of state since the fall of the monarchy some 60 years ago .	-8.2870
He placed the oath in front of the 18 judges of the court dressed in black robes , which is located at the Nile and has an ancient Egyptian temple .	-6.0576
“ We are striving for a better future , a new Egypt and a second republic , ” said Morsi at the solemn ceremony broadcast live on state television .	-3.4969
“ Today , the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom , real democracy , and stability , ” said 60-year-old Morsi , a US-trained engineer and member of the Muslim Brotherhood , a fundamentalist group that , since its foundation 84 years ago , had been targeted by the government in question as a forbidden organization .	-5.9029
Hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building when Morsi arrived in a small car convoy shortly after 11 o 'clock local time .	-4.0050
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered in the court to rejoice the new president , and , unlike the Mubarak presidential Prunk , traffic was stopped only briefly , so that the car convoy could cross the usually busy road linking the city centre with the southern suburbs .	-7.2868
As the Brotherhood ’ s uncharismatic “ spare wheel , ” his personal prestige has increased since his victory and a Friday speech , in which he presented himself not only as a candidate for Islamists , but all of those who sought the 2011 uprising against authoritarian Mubarak .	-6.3523
“ Egypt is now a civilian , national , constitutional , and modern state , ” Morsi , dressed in a blue suit with red tie , explained to the judges in the wood-panelled chamber in which he took office .	-10.6159

Morsi placed a symbolic oath in Tahir Square on Friday , the birthplace of the insurgency that ended last year ’ s end of Mubarak ’ s authoritarian rule , and he praised to reclaim presidential powers that the military council had taken over by the head of state driven out of office .	-5.6814
But , by putting official oath before the court , and not before Parliament as usual , he is bowing to the will of the military , which indicates that the power struggle will continue .	-10.9451
Morsi ’ s Tahir Square speech was full of dramatic populist gestures .	-1.0920

Rapid in South Africa : Two Lifelong Prison	-4.2506
Nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa , the offender was sentenced to two life sentences on Friday .	-2.6873
This was reported by SABC .	-2.6286
The victim died later as a result of serious injuries .	-2.8873
Johannes Kana had already been found guilty at the beginning of the week of the crime .	-2.1506
The act caused horror nationwide .	-3.7442
The 21-year-old had raped Anene Booysen in February in an industrial area in Bredasdorp near Cape Town .	-3.4141
The doctors fought for the survival of the victim for 14 hours , but in vain .	-2.8999
The sight of young people was so horrible that carers and sisters needed psychological assistance .	-3.9487
Kana had admitted during the trial that he was in a bar during the night with Booysen .	-5.5431
He also confessed to have beaten and raped them , but he denied to be responsible for the death of the girl .	-4.1353
The police had initially assumed several perpetrators , but released two suspects from prison because the evidence against them was insufficient .	-5.2375
The prosecutor also stressed during the trial that she was convinced that Kana was alone at the time of the attack .	-2.8498
Rape is already almost an everyday occurrence in South Africa : there are around 64 000 indications of sexual violence every year .	-5.3905
This is almost ten times as much as in Germany , but with 82 million people , it has significantly more inhabitants than South Africa ( 50 million ) .	-4.4271

You thought travel agencies were a thing of the past thanks to the Internet ?	-3.0865
Flight Centre seems to be resisting the trend .	-1.6829
The company has increased its profit prospects for the entire year and expects record income from holidaymakers in Australia and the UK .	-4.4529
The travel company now expects an adjusted pre-tax profit of between $ 325 and $ 340 million , compared to $ 305 to $ 315 million in its earlier forecast .	-4.4752
If the current target values are met , that means growth of 12 to 17 % compared to the record gain of $ 290.4 million in 2011 / 12 .	-5.6381
As CEO Graham Turner announced , Flight Centre achieved eight percent profit in the first half of the year and had a strong start in the second half of the year , especially in Australian and British private business .	-5.3822
“ Since the beginning of the year , our ten countries have been profitable , and some of them are well on the way to record annual earnings before interest and taxes , ” he said .	-4.5727
These include Australia and the United Kingdom , which are typically among our strongest performers .	-3.7981
In Australia , the leisure industry recovered in the second half of the year , balancing a slightly weaker market for business trips .	-3.9685
It was similarly good for the leisure business of Flight Centre in the UK , while business customers were spending less . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , . ,	-9.6564

Boarding Schools to a greater Focus on Mathematics , Spelling , and Grammar	-4.1258
In future , students will have to treat at least one piece of Shakespeare , a 19th century novel , romantic lyrics , and contemporary British novels from 1914 .	-4.5864
The exam also includes “ unseen texts ” to encourage wider reading .	-4.2211
The combined course of English literature and language will be abolished .	-2.5283
From 2015 , students will have to pass an independent GCSE exam for language , with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification .	-4.0976
The Ministry of Education will publish the new curricula for English and mathematics tomorrow – the first subjects that have been radically redesigned .	-3.6429
Other core subjects will be changed next year .	-1.4883
In a separate initiative , Ofqual , the Audit Supervisory Authority , will announce a reorganization of the GCSE structures , including a new system of benchmarking and fewer course work .	-4.9940
In a speech in the summer , education minister Michael Gove said that there is a “ broad consensus that we need to reform our audit system to restore public confidence , ” emphasizing that GCSEs are becoming “ more challenging , ambitious , and stricter . ”	-5.0386
Studies show that English schools spend less time on mathematics – 116 hours a year , or three hours a week per school year – than in most other countries .	-6.1026
On the other hand , Australian schools teach an average of 143 hours a year , and Singapore students receive 138 hours .	-7.6867
While there will be no formal requirement to provide more time for mathematics in the timetable , coalition journeys say that the comprehensive math test – combined with greater weighting of the subject in rankings – will probably encourage schools to take more hours .	-6.3453
The curriculum focuses more on “ real life problems , ” including financial mathematics .	-2.7583

Salem : Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical Talk Forum	-1.9428
The next Ecumenical Discussion Forum on Monday , October 21 , at the Neue Museum des Schlo<unk>es is about the topic " On Hell with Hell - Theological Thinking about the current handling of the last things " .	-7.2690
Referentin is Professor Johanna Rahner .	-2.8330
The Ecumenical Talk Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Protestant parish of Salem , the Salem Castle and the Lake Constance Cultural Office .	-4.3915
Johanna Rahner wants to look at the forum on how people today classify the " last things " after death .	-4.3984
If people had known too much about it in the past centuries , and had placed it on the images of heaven and hell , " which still characterize our notions today " , the contemporary prophetic doctrine of hope for completion is more of a certain embarrassment or even a lack of language .	-9.5539
" The greater hope has been sufficiently driven out by religious criticism , " says the speaker .	-5.3408
She ' provided us with so many question marks that the exclamation marks seem to have come to us ' ' . , , and , are . , , , and , .	-11.3599
Johanna Rahner continues : " But the crucial challenge remains the irritation of death " .	-3.1948
That is the question of the longing , " which dreams that everything will end up being good " .	-6.5353
Johanna Rahner , born in Baden-Baden in 1962 , studied Catholic theology and biology at the Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg from 1982 to 1989 .	-2.1195
She received her doctorate in 1997 from Dr. theol . , also in Freiburg .	-3.0058
The Habilitation for Fundamental Theology and Ecumenical Theology followed in 2003 at the Westphalian Wilhelms University .	-3.9353
Since 2010 Johanna Rahner holds a chair of Systematic Theology at the Institute of Catholic Theology at the University of Kassel .	-3.2696
Geislingen : More than 100 young Catholics of the Klein Heuberg reaffirm their faith in the company .	-4.0497
In two worship services , 101 15- and 16-year-old youths of the SeelsorgeUnit Am Kleinen Heuberg were filmed .	-5.9904
The church service was accompanied in the morning by the Laudato-Si group , in the afternoon by the youth choir The Spirit .	-4.3623
With the reception of the Firmsacrament , the young people said yes to their baptism and gave up the power of the Holy Ghost .	-5.7616
In the last few months , under the direction of Diakon Reiner Dehner and the help of many members of the community , the firmlings had prepared themselves for the big festival .	-7.0907
In various projects they met various tasks of the Christian community level and together experienced the Youth Day in Untermachtal .	-4.7276
Illmensee : Second Mountain Bike Race Enthusiasts	-3.4705
In fine weather 214 cyclists came to Illmensee to complete the round course on the hills around the lake .	-5.0922
This is shared by Ulrich Knobel of the sports club Illmensee .	-4.1048
Among the participants , especially on the short distance over 15 kilometres and 300 metres of altitude , were also numerous cyclists who wanted to practise their hobby in a competitive atmosphere .	-6.2683
Two top-class German juniors were also at the start of this race : Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz won a good place at the German Championships .	-6.1160
Both were expected to depart from the field .	-7.3618
As in the previous year , Felix Bader was able to save a small lead to the finish and defended his title as the overall winner of the short distance .	-4.9740
In second place , Pascal Treubel was able to compete again .	-5.8902
At the ladies it was Theresa Duelli of the team nightmare who made it to the top of the victorious stack .	-6.0558
In place two and three Anne Adel came from Illmensee and Leone drivers from Owingen .	-3.1703
An encouraging development is the increasing number of drivers living or working in the community .	-3.7806
Not only in terms of performance , the whole range of athletes was represented .	-3.6712
The age structure also reached over 70 years for the youngest to the oldest starters .	-6.6025
In the main race even more absolute top athletes were at the start this year .	-4.0704
Four riders were able to compete from the regional top drivers .	-4.7050
Among them Philipp Pangerl , a mountain-bike semi-pro from the black-tusk racing team .	-4.4098
Pangerl , together with a team-mate , was twice World Champion in the twelve-hour driving .	-5.2117
This year he became the European Champion in this special discipline .	-3.4805
Roland Ballerstedt , who already has two German championship titles in the Duathlon , has also .	-6.0749
After 45 kilometres and 900 metres of altitude , the finale of the Wimperschlachfinale came to the finish in front of the three-lake hall .	-8.2878
Pangerl first race over the finish line .	-3.5655
Only a second behind it was possible for the Routinier Ballerstedt to win the second in . were . were . were . were . were . were .	-10.4924

Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical assistance to remote villages in Cameroon .	-2.5508
BW and his team spend almost every weekend treating hundreds of patients .	-2.9727
In West Africa , there are not many doctors , just one for 5,000 people .	-3.0677
Vote here or with your mobile device	-1.3307
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 of the “ CNN Heroes of 2013 ” .	-2.7141
You can vote for him or any of the other heroes in the top 10 to choose him as the “ CNN Hero of the Year ” .	-3.3859
The winner receives $ 250,000 to continue his exceptional work .	-2.5968
For 21 years Georges Bwelle looked at how his sick father repeatedly lost consciousness and traveled to hospitals that did not have the means to help him .	-4.4001
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near Youndé , the capital of Cameroon in 1981 .	-2.9066
At first , he had only a broken arm , but then there was an inflammation that spread to his brain , causing a hematom to affect him for the rest of his life .	-5.4515
“ There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon , ” says Georges Bwelle .	-2.8191
We would have brought him out of Cameroon if we had had the money .	-2.6556
Instead , Bwelle spent years accompanying his father in overcrowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer .	-4.1233
“ It ’ s not easy , ” commented Bwave .	-2.5489
You can leave the house at five o 'clock in the morning and go to the hospital to be the first , and it is not the first .	-5.0127
There are many patients .	-1.5000
Some people even die because they have to wait .	-1.3098
The situation has hardly changed since Bwelle 's father died in 2002 .	-2.4492
In Cameroon , there is only one doctor per 5,000 people , according to the World Health Organisation .	-3.2374
On the other hand , the relationship in the United States is with a doctor for 413 people .	-3.3596
But even if there was a doctor for them , most cameras could not afford to visit .	-4.1377
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line , and nearly three-quarters of the country ’ s health spending is private .	-3.2287
“ The only problem they have is poverty , ” says Bwelle .	-2.3473
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life .	-0.9421
To see his father and so many of his compatriots suffer in Bwelle made the decision to do something about it mature .	-5.7525
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team performed 700 free operations last year .	-2.5688
He became a doctor himself and works as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Youndé .	-3.2257
He also established a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME , which travels to rural areas on weekends and offers free medical care .	-3.9591
Since 2008 , he and his voluntary group have helped nearly 32,000 people .	-2.5635
Almost every Friday , he and up to 30 people forced themselves into minibuses and go to the villages that need help with the dirty medical equipment on the roof .	-6.6682
Not always everything runs smoothly .	-3.3890
More than once they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud .	-2.8223
But when they arrive , they will be received like heroes : a feast , singing and dance , and the best accommodation the place has to offer .	-4.7910
In these villages , free medical care is really a reason to celebrate and shave – with its wide smile and limitless energy – is happy to celebrate .	-7.2171
The next morning , the team will start studying hundreds of patients .	-3.5876
“ We treat 500 people per ride ” , says Bwelle .	-4.6336
They come from a 60 km radius around the village – and that on foot .	-4.1783
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas .	-2.4368
Many people are treated for malaria , tuberculosis , malnutrition , diabetes , parasites , and sexually transmitted diseases .	-1.4717
Others get crutches , donated glasses , or free birth certificates – a document that is needed for school , but many poor families simply cannot afford .	-3.4855
In the evening , the team performs simple operations with local anesthesia .	-2.4388
The operations usually take place in a school , a town hall or an apartment ; after the surgery , the patients are on their way to the recreation area to make room for the next one .	-8.0502
The lighting for the OP and the disinfection equipment is supplied by the generator of the group and so Bwave and its volunteers work until the early morning hours on Sunday .	-4.6095
It is a tiring pensum , but village musicians usually help keep the team motivated .	-3.8286
“ They are drumming all night so that we can stay awake and continue our work , ” says Bwelle .	-4.5520
On Sunday the team returns to the city , tired but proud of the work done .	-3.4590
The group – a mixture of Cameroon doctors and foreign medical students – carried out 700 free operations last year and knows that its work makes a huge difference for the people they help .	-4.9013
A man explained that the free operation of a barrel break that he had received now allows him to work again .	-5.4598
“ This changes the future of my family , ” the man said .	-2.8990
In addition to weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital , Bwelle also works at private clinics in Youndé at night .	-4.2952
With this second job , he financed 60 % of his non-profit activity , according to Bwelle ; the rest comes from private donations .	-5.1925
“ I really don ’ t know when he sleeps , ” says Katie O ’ Malley , who studied medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia in the second year and volunteered to work in Bwelles Group .	-4.5876
He is always either in hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so that he can go to these campaigns .	-4.4026
For medical and nursing students , such as O 'Malley , who come from the US and Europe and support Bwelle , this is an opportunity to gain practical experience that they would never get at home .	-4.6886
" We can be involved in operations where we help to absorb blood or keep the instruments for Dr. Bwelle , " explains O 'Malley .	-4.8460
This would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year .	-2.2824
The students usually pay for their trip to Cameroon themselves and bring with them frequently donated medical material .	-5.2695
Once you are in Youndé , Bwelle takes care of accommodation , transport and instruction .	-5.3319
" He is undoubtedly a hero , " says O 'Malley .	-2.3672
He devotes his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroon people knows no limits .	-2.8648
For BWD , almost permanent work is not a burden .	-4.7748
Giving others a happier life and thereby fulfilling a promise that he gave to his father gives him great pleasure .	-4.9488
“ I am so happy when I do this work , ” says Bwelle .	-3.3832
And I remember my father .	-1.1727
I hope he sees what I do .	-1.1664
I do it to make people laugh again and to relieve the pain .	-2.7110

Highly Fighted	-4.1908
The role of Santiago , the old man in Hemingway 's novel " The Old Man and the Sea " , is cut to Horst Janson .	-3.4782
Janson himself is an old hare in his profession , the art of acting .	-4.2769
No one can fool the old man Santiago with fishing .	-4.0007
So the two just complement each other great .	-4.0480
It is almost believed that the wrinkles in the neck of the old man , of whom the fishing boy Manolo speaks , can be seen .	-5.5812
If Santiago is tired of living on the chair , that 's true with Janson .	-5.3006
In addition , the role of the old fisherman is through and through a character role that Janson performs excellently .	-4.6794
Hemingway told the story of a fighter , a courageous man who does not give up and ultimately wins the battle against the fish through his knowledge and will .	-4.5189
Janson is on stage for a long time as a single actor .	-4.3740
He manages to focus the audience ’ s attention so that his monologues are not boring .	-3.4750
His efforts to finally draw the fish to the surface of the water are so genuine that the spectators forget that the sea consists only of blue illuminated water bottles .	-5.3741
Director Jens Hasselmann lets the old man act in the boat in front of the fishing village .	-2.7733
In the course of the performance , he brings to light the active scene : the Santiago hut , the bar of singer Marie-Luise Gunst , who with her songs and her splendid voice sings the feeling of life of Cuba .	-7.1581
The four musicians play Cuba 's rhythm and are also guests of the bar .	-2.8065
Tourism : Departure to the Romans	-2.0422
At about 120 metres in length , a Roman sewage channel is preserved below Cologne .	-5.2804
If you visit Cologne , don 't miss the cathedral .	-4.1601
The two towers reach the sky about 157 metres and make it the second highest church building in Europe .	-3.8965
But only a few visitors , who admire the two filigree towers , know that there is also a lot to discover under the Duomo .	-7.1855
Rainer Schulze is an expert in matters related to Cologne 's underworld .	-3.6707
Meeting point for its guided tours is the service center of Cologne tourism directly at the Duomo .	-5.0848
The tour starts quite unspectacular : " We start in the underground car park , " says Schulze .	-11.0670
In the 1970s , the city ’ s fathers wanted to be an autogenous city , and that ’ s why the remains of the old city wall remained only that which was not too big .	-8.1944
For this reason , most users of the car park pass the Roman remains today and only leave their cars .	-7.3858
But if you take a closer look , you will find an archaeological site separated by metal grid rods in the Parkdeck D2 .	-6.6382
You can see about five meters high ruins of handmade stones .	-5.5429
" They are remnants of the Roman city wall that was built in the second half of the first century after Christ , " says Schulze .	-4.2716
Before going back to the daylight , Schulze allows participants on the upper level to take a look at a dark , 15 metres deep shaft .	-6.5876
This is the fountain of the old cathedral , which is unfortunately hardly seen .	-4.5859
The next stop of the tour is the Pretorium , where the participants descend back into the depth .	-5.5266
Here we see the seat of the once most powerful man north of the Alps , the preacher of the CCAA .	-4.4454
What CCAA means , a visitor wants to know .	-2.2470
" The abbreviation stands for " Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium " , which means in German as much as " City of Roman Law and City of Agrippinenser , founded under Emperor Claudius at the place of the altar for the Emperor " .	-5.3265
And the Pretorium is the former state palace , the power center of the Roman Empire on the Rhine .	-4.1038
From the hall of the exhibition there is a tunnel access to the Roman sewage channel , which is preserved here at about 120 metres in length .	-5.5253
" You can quietly walk along the so-called Cloaca Maxima , if you like , " Schulze will delight the guests .	-5.7479
Schulze still has a surprise .	-1.3356
After he got the key at the checkout , he leads the group to a 16-meter deep walkable pit .	-5.0863
" We are now in the Mikwe , a ritual Jewish bath , " he explains .	-1.9114
The Jewish community built its bathroom deep into the ground to reach the groundwater , which was indispensable for ritual washing .	-4.5408
To this day , in the lower end of the Mikwe , whose origins date back to the eighth century , different water levels can be traced through changing levels of the Rhine .	-5.1627
The Mikwe will be part of an archaeological area on the Town Hall Square , for which construction works will begin shortly .	-5.0944
However , a few years will pass by until completion .	-4.7738
Nearly hacked off : Re-run Rocker Process	-7.1309
A bloody attack in the rocker milieu is reopened after more than four years .	-3.1715
A trial for attempted slaughter , dangerous bodily injury and damage to property against two 30-year-olds has begun before the district court of Frankfurt ( Oder ) .	-6.0133
It is accompanied by strict security measures .	-2.2829
The defendants are silent at the beginning .	-4.2737
They were supposed to have been active in the rock scene and at that time were among the bandidos .	-4.5485
The Public Prosecutor accuses them that in June 2009 , together with unknown accomplices , in Finowfurt , three men were trapped in a car .	-6.6475
All the victims were seriously injured , a man almost lost his leg .	-2.6199
The victims are said to have been part of Hells Angel ’ s competing faction .	-5.0289
One should have been a high-level member from Berlin .	-2.2216
It would appear that the preceding was a multi-car chase .	-6.8463
According to the indictment , it was about riots and a demonstration of power .	-4.7268
The two defendants had been acquitted in a first trial in early 2012 .	-2.3535
A spokesman said then that it was impossible to prove that men had actually been involved in the bloody feud .	-4.2476
The perpetrators had worn masks and had not been recognized .	-1.8696
The Federal Court of Justice lifted the judgment after the public prosecutor ’ s review and referred it back to the court for further trial .	-6.8789
One of the defendants is currently in open trial for another offence .	-2.7003
The first step was to reconstruct the procedures during the day .	-5.7518
The Commissioner who was then investigating was invited as a witness .	-4.3157
The focus was on mobile phone calls from the defendants and other people who had interrogated the police .	-4.9937
It is difficult that rockers almost always abide by a law that they consider to be a law - not an expression .	-8.0769
This also applies to the victims .	-1.9387
In the first process , only one of the victims had been unpacked .	-3.4281

The Disclosure Society Think Not	-3.7908
The night was long , the music was loud and the mood was good , but at some point it goes home .	-3.6304
But hunger is noticeable in the belts of people on the front-passenger seat and rear seat .	-5.5166
Of course , some cocktails or champagne may be responsible for this !	-4.3236
What is more obvious than driving chilled to the next drive-in , to indulge in a little bit ?	-12.3450
I admit that I am happy to be part of this when it comes to fast food picking at night or early in the morning .	-7.2617
A couple of pommes , a cola , a burger - and then nothing like home and in bed !	-5.3453
But on the way home , the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco geese make themselves felt .	-4.7126
After all , what do you need to do with the constant regularity of throwing your fast food bags out of the car window ? !	-10.2059
Especially at weekends , paper bags thrown away are on street edges and on parking spaces .	-5.9323
'Why ? ' I wonder .	-1.7168
Are the people too doof to take the bags with home or to the next bin ?	-4.5822
It is not just that the paper toy is sweeping the landscape .	-6.0648
Bags have already covered up transport facilities such as safety barriers , causing accidents .	-6.5300
But what does that say about " dispossessm" , she probably does not even know what this means .	-7.3480
If you are travelling more often in the evening , especially with several people in the car , you know what a backbench can look like after the nights that have been celebrated : clothes , bottles and other garbage towers .	-8.6668
There are a few bags that would not make up any more or less - unlike the street , where nobody wants to trample on the food leftovers .	-8.1207
I can already see the day when cities and municipalities are being bloated away - and the fast food chains have to demand a deposit for their bags .	-6.9545
Obama ’ s Health-Politics Retreat	-4.1488
After fierce criticism , President Obama made a withdrawal yesterday in his often repeated , unambiguous promise : “ If you like your health insurance , you can keep it . ”	-5.9949
After hundreds of thousands of insurers have received a letter of termination , Republicans have recently accused the president of deceiving the American public .	-5.1088
Yesterday , Obama relativized his original promise .	-1.4792
“ The vast majority of citizens with functioning health insurance can keep them , ” he said in a speech in Boston .	-3.5815
In response to the numerous media reports on the dismissals , Obama urged those Americans who received such communications to look for new insurance in the free market .	-4.1951
Most citizens could receive better , more comprehensive health insurance at the same price or cheaper than predicted .	-4.2446
“ You get a better offer , ” he said .	-2.5233
The government described it as little surprising that the five per cent of the population who have insurance themselves would have to look for a different tariff because their contract did not meet the new standards under the Affordable Care Act .	-6.0826
“ I would like to say to these Americans very directly : they deserve better , ” Sebelius said at a hearing in front of the House of Representatives ’ Energy and Trade Committee in Washington .	-4.5245
Sebelius , who is responsible for implementing the Affordable Care Act , declared that the online platform ’ s launch has been “ abysmal ” since October .	-9.5473
“ I am as frustrated and angry as everyone else , ” she said .	-2.1260
I am determined to regain your confidence .	-1.2820
This statement by a seduced Sebelius as a counselor behind her at yesterday ’ s House hearing was received after a dispute with Republican MEP Billy Long of Missouri about whether she should be required to participate in Obamacare .	-8.4845
After more than three hours of hearing , Long Sebelius repeatedly urged the question of why the Affordable Care Act ’ s “ architect ” did not voluntarily dispense with state-sponsored insurance to conclude a tariff with HealthCare.gov , which she now wants to sell to millions of Americans .	-6.3523
Government in Jerusalem does not confirm the attack on Syrian air base	-3.9876
On Thursday , an American government official who wanted to remain anonymous claimed to the American news channel CNN that Israeli fighter aircraft had attacked an airbase in Syria ’ s Latavia a day earlier .	-5.9159
The target had been ' missiles and associated equipment ' , which the Israeli Government feared were destined for Lebanese Hezbollah , according to CNN .	-4.7891
Syrian and Lebanese media , as well as the Arab channel Al-Arabiya , had previously reported that the base in the port city of Latavia had been fired on Thursday night , blaming the Israelis .	-6.2556
The Israeli television channel Channel 2 showed satellite images of the Latakia base , on which Russian S-125 Newa defence missiles and SA-3 missiles could be seen , which , according to Channel 2 , have a range of 35 kilometres and can transport explosives up to 70 kilometres .	-8.1314
Unsure The Jerusalem Government has not officially confirmed the attack .	-3.1459
But the Reuters news agency quotes an equally anonymous Israeli government official in the words that he believes Israel has carried out the attack , but is not sure .	-5.3030
In any case , a spokesman from the Israeli Ministry of Defence said : ' We are not commenting on these reports ' .	-3.8170
In the daily Yedioth Ahronoth Ahronoth , journalist Ron Ben-Yishai stressed that the Syrian regime had already tried , sometimes successfully , to supply ground air missiles to Hezbollah .	-9.7273
The Israeli Government had repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to supply Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons would mean crossing a " red line " that would be followed by a military response .	-9.8860
John Kerry , in an unprecedented admission that US espionage has “ gone unreasonably far ”	-3.8515
John Kerry , with an unexpected admission , suggested a softening of the US ’ s defensive stance on its surveillance programs by saying that espionage has , in certain cases , “ gone too far ” .	-5.4679
The Foreign Minister also admitted that he , together with Barack Obama , was responsible for “ autopilot ” when the explosive revelations of the whistleblower Edward Snowden about NSA ’ s spying activities became public .	-4.6432
The leaked information has plunged the US government into a diplomatic storm of indignation on the part of its allies .	-3.1245
In a video-related speech at the Open Government Conference in London , Kerry said : “ There is no doubt that the President and I , as well as others in the government , have learned of some things that have almost gone by car pilot , simply because there was a capacity to do so , which dates back to World War II and the difficult years of the Cold War and , of course , to September 11 . ”	-7.9017
He then admitted , as the first senior member of the US government , that US espionage had crossed a border , but also stressed that no rights had been abused .	-5.2049
He said , “ In some cases , this has gone too far . ”	-3.1462
The President is determined to provide clarity and is therefore conducting a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel that abuse is taking place .	-5.1068
I assure you that the rights of innocent people are not affected in this process .	-2.3481
Kerry insisted , however , that the NSA was a force of good , and that many lives were saved by its surveillance operations .	-4.5731
He added , “ We are dealing with a new world in which people are prepared to blow themselves up . ”	-3.6059
There is a radical extremism in the world that seeks to kill people , blow up the air , and attack governments .	-3.6434
So what if we were able to intercept and stop it before it happens ?	-3.6664
We have indeed prevented aircraft crashes , attacks on buildings and the murder of people , because we have learned of such plans in advance .	-5.0048
Meanwhile , US legislators will travel to Europe to dispel concerns about the alleged American espionage , and to convince Europeans of the need to continue working with the US on anti-terrorism efforts , as the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said on Thursday .	-5.3695
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said that he spoke with representatives of the European Parliament and other people this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorist organisations because of the frustration with the National Security Agency 's monitoring .	-5.4748
“ It is very important for the US ’ s national security interests that Europeans remain on board in view of our joint efforts against terrorism , ” said Murphy , who , as a democrat , is sitting in the Senate for the first time and acting as Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Relations and European Affairs , in an interview in in Washington . .	-10.5955
I am also going to Europe to make it clear there that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism , regardless of their annoyance about the NSA programmes . are .	-4.8126
Media reports that the NSA has collected millions of telephone data in Europe have strained relations with some US allies , even though the intelligence service ’ s head said this week that the reports were inaccurate and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and exchanged with the United States .	-5.7853
Other revelations cited in Snowden ’ s forwarded documents that the NSA had monitored Chancellor Angela Merkel ’ s mobile phone and up to 34 other heads of state worldwide .	-4.2665
The head of the national intelligence services , James Clapper , defended espionage among allies as necessary and declared that it was common on both sides .	-4.5744
In all this tumult , Murphy said that his authority was preparing the congress to take place this year , and hoped that the delegation would include members from both parties and chambers .	-4.6059
The names of the other Members participating will be published in the coming days .	-2.9606
He said that the exact route is still being worked out .	-2.7761
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the journey was to improve relations , he also said that there would be some “ serious words . ”	-3.0497
He said that European governments should be honest with their people about the kind of espionage programs they have been using for years .	-3.8759
“ While we can change our surveillance programs and thus better protect Europeans ’ rights , they must also adapt to the fact that we are not the only ones to spy , ” says Murphy .	-4.8794
Meanwhile , John Kerry is on a weekend trip to the Middle East and Poland to address the resentment of US strategy in Syria , Egypt , and Iran , as well as US surveillance activities .	-3.8550
A stubborn injury to the jumping leg is threatening to prevent Nicolai Müller from playing in the Bundesliga foreign match of FSV Mainz 05 at FC Augsburg .	-7.1113
Mainz is about a deployment of Nicolai Müller .	-3.9367
Tomorrow he will try to train with the team .	-1.4540
So far he could only do this individually .	-3.3465

Australian Arbitration Against Prison in Thailand	-3.0995
A 21-year-old Sydney woman , sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for falsely claiming to have been raped by a taxi driver , appealed against the sentence and was released on bail .	-3.5681
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty by a provincial court in Phuket on 15 June of having made a false statement after she told the Thai police that a local taxi driver raped her in the morning hours on Sunday 10 June , while two other men arrested her .	-5.0727
Later , however , the recordings of a video camera showed that she had safely entered her hotel after being separated from her Australian friend .	-4.8289
The police in Phuket interrogated Bamford for two days until she confessed to have imagined history .	-3.6360
Until the trial , she was in police custody on the spot .	-3.8500
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a low-level prison on the outskirts of Phuket , rather than in a prison for adult women .	-3.6087
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks , a former player of the Australian Rubgy League , who contacted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra to ask for help for his daughter .	-4.7314
Tunks told the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was “ extremely worried ” about his daughter ’ s welfare and wanted to have her back in Australia .	-4.2096
“ Of course we are very concerned , but we hope that she will be back home as soon as possible , ” said Tunks .	-3.7344
Bamford has appealed against the judgment and is against a bail of 50,000 Baht on free foot .	-4.0309
In Australian reports it was read that she is taking a holiday in the resort of Krabi in South Thailand .	-6.0585
The court heard that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and warned that the appeal could also lead to a higher sentence of up to two years in an adult prison .	-4.2200
However , it is also possible that , following the recent assassination of the travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket , Thailand might try to improve its fragile tourist image , and that is why it is acquitted .	-6.9997
