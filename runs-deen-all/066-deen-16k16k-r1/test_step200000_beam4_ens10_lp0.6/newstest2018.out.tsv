Munich 1856 : Four Maps Changing Your City Look	-3.3777
A madness institution where young people are to meet today .	-5.7947
A tomb chapel where the S-Bahn tunnel is now being excavated .	-5.2872
Small gardeners manage the former land of farmers .	-4.7912
The oldest official map in Munich reveals exciting stories .	-2.8256
It is annoying if maps are not up to date .	-2.4551
Everyone knows this , who has had to get up and running because the car Navi showed a green meadow instead of a bypass road .	-6.9521
The historical maps of the digital Bayern-Atlas , an offer of the Geoportal Bavarian State Government , are far from current - but for this very reason very revealing .	-6.5933
Especially when compared to current online cards .	-2.6959
Then it becomes clear how cities and communities in the Munich Merkur area have changed since the 19th century .	-3.9875
The digital Bayern Atlas is a patchwork that cannot be seen as such .	-4.3690
More detailed maps , so-called original position sheets , were incorporated into the large overview map for cities and municipalities .	-5.4127
These were created according to the Bavarian survey administration between 1810 and 1864 and originated from the first survey of Bavaria .	-5.3082
Your client : Napoleon .	-0.9893
The French Army leader occupied Bavaria with Austria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War .	-7.7034
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic admission of Bavaria - for military purposes , of course .	-4.1103
Although the French troops finally departed with Lunéville 's peace of 9 February 1801 , it was today 's neighbours who created the idea of a comprehensive Bavaria map .	-5.5092
Kurfürst Max IV Joseph pushed the project forward , founded the " Topographic Bureau " - and thus the Bavarian survey administration .	-5.0468
The original position sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and can be found on the website of the Bavarian State Library , like all others .	-9.1151
The comparison of the past / present is most impressive , for example , in the state capital .	-6.2246
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .	-3.3508
An example of this is the Untersendling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856 .	-4.2391
Sendling was incorporated into Munich as a quarter 21 years after the map was created in 1877 .	-4.1145
Today , Untersendling lies in the heart of the city .	-2.9468
The houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along the current Plinganserstra<unk>e , which was only named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878 , a leader of the uprising of Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705 .	-4.5425
Where the West Park is today , you can see nothing but fields - at first glance : when zooming in , a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears : handwritten numbered pieces of land from the so-called " original " , from which the property tax was derived .	-7.9816
Small plots no longer occupy farmers there - but small gardeners of the plant " Land in Sun " .	-4.9478
A large green area is to the north of Untersendling .	-3.3023
The Theresienwiese , since 1810 the location of the Oktoberfest , was actually a meadow in the 19th century - not a concrete desert .	-3.9944
On the other side of the Isar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine .	-2.4221
In the original position sheet , in the area of the current district of Au-Haidhausen , you can read not only the street name " am Gasteig " or the hill " Auf der Lüften " - but also in large letters " Irren Anstalt " .	-6.3875
Yes , here on the Auerfeldstra<unk>e people were once locked up with delusions . were .	-5.0198
In 1858 / 59 the Munich Kreis Irrenanstalt " Auf der Auer Lüften " was established .	-4.8090
In 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the establishment - the psychiatrist who was brought into connection with the death of King Ludwig II .	-4.7497
" He was progressive for his time and ended , for example , the appending of the so-called madness .	-5.5769
In addition , he has forbidden the staff to use force against the occupants , " says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Haidhausen Museum , who has worked with the institution for an exhibition .	-6.0212
There was room for 280 patients at first , later 500 seats were added .	-5.8814
At some point this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenstalt in Haar in 1905 .	-9.0195
The Isar Amper Clinic München-Ost , one of Germany ’ s largest psychiatrists , has been located there since 2006 .	-4.5920
Young people in the Munich Salesianum now meet in the area of the former Auer Anstalt .	-11.0921
The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth home with training facilities .	-3.6233
To the west lies the football pitch of TSV München East , housing houses from the 1980s .	-5.4117
In 2015 , the " Casa Don Bosco " children 's house was built , in an architectural style , following the original building of the Irrenanstalt , which had been destroyed by bombing during World War II .	-6.9531
The Marienplatz was named " Haut Platz " around 1856 , the Kaudinger Strasse .	-5.3467
The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .	-2.8796
The Allied bombs hit many holes in the city centre in December 1944 .	-3.4657
A large one remained to this day - at the Marienhof .	-3.2074
The English Institute , small business houses and a Middle Ages crypt chapel were once at the Marienhof , where the preparatory work and the Spatenstich for the second line of S-Bahn take place on April 5 , 2017 .	-8.1539
With the slider you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial photo of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof .	-4.6313
Citizens ' Rights Group Published Travel Warning for Missouri	-2.0679
The National Association for the Promotion of Colours has issued a warning to coloured people travelling to Missouri on the basis of discriminatory policies and racist attacks by the state .	-4.6818
" The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri , which is due to enter into force by 28 August 2017 , calls on African-American travellers , visitors and Missourians to pay particular attention when travelling through the state and to exercise extreme caution , as a number of questionable racial incidents have recently occurred and are being recorded here throughout the state , " said the Group 's opinion .	-8.1761
A recent law by Missouri , which makes it harder for people to win discrimination actions , as well as the law enforcement authorities of the state , which disproportionately target minorities , prompted the group to issue the travel warning , said the NAACP .	-5.4615
" They have violations of civil rights that happen to people .	-2.6203
They are stopped because of their skin colour , they are beaten up or killed , " said the President of Missouri NAACP , Rod Chapel , the Kansas City Star .	-2.9585
'We hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not heard yet ' .	-2.8814
It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States .	-2.5027
The group cited incidents such as racist crimes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .	-2.2862
Sanders died in dubious circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no petrol and was arrested by the Missouri police without being accused of a crime .	-5.8233
The Council also refers to a recent report by the Missouri Public Prosecutor 's Office , which shows that black drivers in the state are held at 75 % more than white .	-5.4189
" The recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri , " said Chapel .	-3.0009
'People must be prepared to bring bail money or let the relatives know that they are travelling through the state ' .	-4.8510
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FBI ’ s hate crime report , which classify the state at the 16th rank in terms of the number of such violations .	-5.3222
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination .	-3.1582
Previously , the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the States adopted immigration laws requiring local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration violations , which the ACLU believes will contribute to further race profiling .	-5.4801
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to other countries , but interest groups have recently used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US .	-4.2664
Bread fence Project is Elementary	-5.3473
The Fischerbacher Weidezaun project is a success and will continue in the coming year .	-3.2675
The CDU members Peter Wei<unk> and Kordula Kovac gave a picture on the spot .	-4.4209
At the Schwendemann family ’ s rechtgrabenhof , representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU local association met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MPs .	-5.4453
Markus Schwendemann initially gave insights into his farm , where he managed 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , supplied 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and housed in five apartments holiday guests .	-5.5365
For him , " Black Forest milk " is the alternative way of marketing the milk of his cows , according to Schwendemann .	-4.6137
Only regional ones are on the table of the holiday guests .	-5.1561
Since he is also BLHV chairman of Fischerbach , he described the pasture project as " elementary important " .	-4.5257
I cannot make a profit on such steep areas .	-3.5493
The green area provides for a lot of work , and a lot of things have to be done with the engine sense .	-7.0896
" We are struggling with the conditions and topography here , " said Schwendemann .	-3.6945
In 2003 he took over the parent company and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if he did not run a bio-plant .	-5.4478
For mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : " The municipality has recognized the importance of the pasture project and is happy about the leadership promotion " .	-5.8225
Farmers would have to be supported at the cost of EUR 3000 to EUR 4000 per hectare .	-3.2052
It is hoped that the reforestation of the land could be extended for a while .	-5.0641
" The greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they move their business forward , " said the mayor .	-5.4947
Farmers are often critical of support .	-3.0427
In 2013 , a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in via pasture fencing .	-4.8193
The area is 40 hectares , which must not be forested by at least 2023 .	-5.6525
Of the total cost of EUR 71 500 , half was funded over Leader , a quarter was carried by the municipality of Fischerbach .	-5.0046
Farmers thus remained EUR 12 610 , which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of pasture fence .	-3.8362
" The big advantage is the longevity of fences , " said Schwendemann .	-3.0068
Kordula Kovac stressed : " You do a really good job without farmers and rural women " .	-4.8609
For Peter Wei<unk> , too , it was clear that " best food is produced here " .	-4.7429
The Landscape Care Directive ( LPR ) of Baden-Württemberg allows state support for pasture fences .	-3.5095
The aim is to keep the Black Forest open .	-1.8484
The requirement is to have a funding framework defined by the LPR .	-5.2563
In addition , the enclosed area must not be traceable ( exposure over 35 % ) and must therefore be threatened by reforestation .	-5.1305
For the Fischerbacher Weidezaunprojekt 2018 , the application is currently being made by eight participants with 24 plots , who want to build almost 16 kilometres of fence .	-5.5858
The area is 35 hectares , the estimated costs are more than EUR 112 000 .	-5.1219
Is nothing more sacred ?	-1.6303
Now Trump ’ s White House Takes the Statue of Liberty	-3.2757
The safest sign of regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .	-2.2272
Americans appreciate it , as do anyone else , so the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein in Baghdad ’ s Firdos Square in 2003 .	-9.6574
Stephen Miller , one of the Trump regime ’ s key ideologues , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe into the status of freedom in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN about the president ’ s proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration .	-3.7781
To remain fair , Miller did not attack the statue itself .	-2.1110
A Horde of boat owners and Liberty Imitators would have laughed him if he had done so .	-4.1937
But he attacked their meaning , and in particular the importance attributed to it , when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus was added to his base in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument .	-4.6643
As Miller Acosta accused : " I do not want to go into a complete thing about history here , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world .	-4.6206
The poem to which you refer , which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . '	-2.6017
Miller is factually right , but as he himself put it , it is not really about history .	-3.4985
It is about the contemporary response to Lazarus 's shocking words , the only one in which a state not only invites any old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : ' Your wives , your poor , / your crowded masses who yearn to breathe freely , / the miserable waste of your rich coasts . '	-7.4161
There was never a time when the ' miserable waste ' on our screens was better seen .	-3.4871
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump ’ s US .	-2.6607
This conflict , because of the importance of a statue , is part of a broader political and cultural struggle : it is indeed a conflict over the importance of America .	-4.0877
Lazarus - and her friends who worked to place their words at the base after their death - knew very well that they were carrying out a highly political act .	-5.2054
The sculpture was supposed to show the connections between French and American Republicanism by portraying the feminine embodiment of freedom in an abused classical depiction .	-5.2838
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she received a voice .	-3.1197
And she gives herself a very different name : Mother of the exiles .	-2.4267
The connection of poetry with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism .	-3.2440
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , people from the right wing wanted to change it back for a long time .	-3.9366
The great cry of Rush Limbaugh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is not inviting anyone , but rather an early neo-conservative that brings the American flame to the surrounding world : " Lady Liberty is moving forward .	-5.0972
It is supposed to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .	-1.9701
The torch is not supposed to light the way to the United States . '	-3.3402
Quite unusual is Limbaugh here .	-4.3361
The significance of the statue is entirely a question of the point of view of perception .	-3.1747
The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted , miserable but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the deck of ships .	-4.4915
It is truly a matter of seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and an opportunity to improve their lives .	-3.4413
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome that they have to hear .	-8.1977
And that , of course , is not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to recognize .	-3.5678
Their torch is not supposed to enlighten the way , but to inflame the hatred that is their only source of power .	-9.9800
World Cup 2017 : Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team .	-2.8437
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots were part of the UK team .	-2.4022
The UK athletics director , Neil Black , says that the 16-member Scottish contingent in the World Cup cadre will ' make a massive contribution to the team ' .	-5.0668
A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which will start on Friday .	-2.3236
Black believes that ' something special is developing in Scotland ' and that the UK athletics need to learn something from it .	-4.4232
" We welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find it , " said Black .	-2.4223
" I am talking to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done .	-3.0545
Scottish athletes think that what they have done has something to do with what they have done .	-3.5878
British athletics : It has something to do with what they have done .	-1.9160
And also with the type on the street corner .	-2.8888
Whatever the combination of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . '	-1.6508
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal candidates , including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart , who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track , while Eilidh Doyle was elected team captain by the team .	-5.2537
" Eilidh is quite modest .	-1.3180
Her captain 's speech was incredible , " says Black .	-1.8022
" A number of athletes , whether Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .	-4.1620
The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh naturally brought was great . "	-4.0161
The Commonwealth Silver Medal winner , who will compete in the 400-metre hurdles on her fifth World Championship , says that it is " incredible " that 16 Scots are in the British team .	-5.3226
Scotland ’ s best total of athletes at the World Cup was seven achieved in 1983 and 2015 .	-4.6335
The medium-distance runner , Muir , is on this path and last year set five British and two European records .	-5.8432
It will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs .	-3.7071
Chris O 'Hare , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot to be observed after a great season that included the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games .	-4.6600
Doyle remembers her first World Championships when the only other Scot in the team was Lee McConnell .	-3.6393
The team captain says that she is " hugely proud " of the fact that many of her compatriots not only belong to the team , but in some cases will also be involved in medals and finals .	-4.9719
" The special thing about being a team captain is that she was elected by the other members of the team , so it was a great honour anyway , but to know that my team mates voted for me and elected me , makes it something very special for me , " she added .	-5.0988
" Obviously I am very proud of all the Scots who belong to the team .	-1.8645
It only shows how far we have come .	-1.9297
And they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to climb on podiums .	-4.0298
As far as my speech as captain is concerned ?	-2.9249
Yes , I think she went well .	-1.4403
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation , as we have a World Home Championship .	-4.1613
So it is really important to rely on this support and to benefit from the fact that we are back in the Olympic Stadium .	-4.8128
I get a second chance to go out and compete there and it will be just such a great atmosphere out there . '	-4.1692
Blocking critics via Facebook : Don ’ t worry about public office if you can ’ t afford to stoke voters .	-5.7146
The father of our country knew something about bad press .	-2.1303
Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long for newspapers to beat him for everything , from domestic politics to its political principles .	-3.4372
He certainly fought with criticism .	-4.9529
But he has not silenced his critics .	-1.1407
After all , in 1783 , Washington said : ' Freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and mute , we are being slaughtered like sheep ' .	-4.2096
This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan , who must work on being more like Washington .	-2.8739
Hogan ’ s staff blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .	-4.1096
And the American Civil Liberties Union therefore sued him earlier this week .	-3.1553
The staff of the governor dismissed the complaint as frivol , and the online comment was full of a backlash with " Well , and ? " .	-3.4431
" It 's just Facebook , " many people said .	-1.5756
But it is important .	-0.7583
And it is especially important when it is a type like Hogan .	-2.6504
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state that is surprisingly popular .	-2.1783
He has the second highest approval of the nation ’ s 50 governors .	-6.4408
Hogan is not a reactionary heat head .	-0.9620
He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles .	-3.6205
He was also very skilful in using Facebook as a primary means of connecting with his voters and playing his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side .	-5.2564
As a result , the blocking of people on the governor 's side - which is a public forum called official and paid by public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .	-6.4964
In an interview with The Washington Post , Hogan ’ s spokesman , Amelia Chasse , defended the governor ’ s actions , arguing that blocking comments is nothing but moderation .	-3.4399
But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers , or hated people who vibrate the stick online .	-9.9751
The post talked to some of the real people blocked by Hogan .	-2.1569
And these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur , and a pastor , not trolls .	-7.7107
They all said that their comments were respectful , thoughtful and not profane .	-2.3150
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan ’ s Catholic faith .	-2.4196
Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie , MD , was not hateful , but she asked for hate crimes .	-2.6956
" I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other current news , " she wrote in the commentary section of the news program " The Post " .	-3.3475
" I don 't appreciate this idea either , if a number of people take a stand on the same subject , they are disregarded by some as a so-called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens " .	-7.1070
What the governor ’ s staff called a “ concentrated spam attack , ” others would probably call “ intercession . ”	-8.8046
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment .	-2.7117
It is much cleaner than in the past if the same thing had been done , that staff were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials , or arrest and silence demonstrators .	-4.5600
But that is exactly what is happening digitally .	-2.6340
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticised for insulting Facebook and other social media .	-2.6499
President Trump is sued by Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed .	-2.1406
One of the first milestones on this issue was in Virginia last week .	-2.5693
The Chairman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment , according to US regional judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria , when she banished a voter from her Facebook page .	-4.1812
And in Kentucky , Governor Matt Bevin ( R ) also received a visit from the ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter .	-2.0995
This should not be so difficult .	-2.2991
At present , Washington ’ s affordable porto time has had a similar impact to the Internet .	-4.9487
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800 , and anonymous correspondents suggested his leadership .	-2.9794
And even then , Washington had anonymous trolls .	-8.3363
The people who used pseudonyms such as " Juricola " , " Valerius " , " Belisarius " and " Portius " wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington 's decisions .	-3.0315
Petitions that criticized his position on the Amity Treaty , trade , and shipping with Britain overwhelmed his office , according to the historical documents collected by the George Washington Project ’ s online papers .	-5.1431
But he did not silence them .	-1.5890
Freedom of speech , disagreement and discourses are the basis of our nation .	-2.8590
And true leadership means accepting it .	-1.7595
Ronan Rafferty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club	-3.0192
Former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope for domestic comfort in the next three days , as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian will host the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .	-3.8042
The Northern Ireland , who led links to the final round in the Archerfield last year before losing to Paul Eales , is linked to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador on behalf of the club founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi .	-5.8113
" I have seen how the Renaissance club was built and we see how it is reaching its glory with this event , " said Rafferty .	-4.9839
" The players will see this course from its best side , it is in a great state .	-3.8987
Jerry did a great job in setting this place .	-3.5536
He is a keen advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here .	-3.5569
This is a great showcase for this course . '	-2.7340
The English Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , even though he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career .	-3.8294
" This really feels special , " said the player resident in Southport .	-4.1102
" I couldn 't defend the Extremadura Open because it was taken out of the program year after I won it .	-3.6113
Coming back to this part of the world is magical .	-1.4596
It is a wonderful place to play golf .	-1.8492
Last year 's memories come back , and it was something special for me and my wife , Sharon , to win here last year .	-3.9296
It was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . '	-2.6214
Gary Orr , who came to the European Senior Tour earlier this year after his 50th birthday , returns to the action on homeland .	-3.5180
This event will be its first Scottish performance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .	-8.1420
" It always means a bit more when you play at home , " said Orr , the man from Helensburgh .	-2.2396
" You want to do it well , but you also feel this extra pressure .	-2.5490
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .	-1.9074
I am glad to see what has happened . '	-3.8067
With the trio in the field are former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and Senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst , Roger Chapman , Mark James and Mark McNulty .	-2.6992
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scots on the field , the others are Andrew Oldcorn , Stephen McAllister , Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond .	-2.6357

Less lung cancer deaths from passive smoking	-2.2326
Over the past two decades , fewer and fewer people have died from lung cancer because of passive smoking .	-2.6318
Scientists from the Hamburg-Eppendorf University Hospital ( UKE ) are presented with this result in a study .	-5.1747
" According to our estimates , 167 cases of lung cancer per year are due to passive smoking , " said Head of study Heiko Becher .	-4.5762
As a comparison , he used his own study on this subject from 1994 .	-4.8484
At that time there were still 400 cases of lung cancer due to passive smoking in Germany per year .	-3.6194
The new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health .	-2.2882
Household connections prove to be very complex .	-3.2785
The construction works in Villinger Stra<unk>e are in full swing and " lie somewhat in time " , says the head of the Bauhof Fred Heinze .	-5.2868
The situation in the area of domestic connections is more complicated than expected , as there is much hidden underground , which is not mentioned in the plans .	-6.2187
Traffic , which keeps hampering the construction work , is a major problem for the Stumpp construction company .	-6.8902
" The ignorance of drivers in front of red traffic lights and bars is already enormous , " says Heinze .	-5.3893
The road was closed and only the regular buses were allowed to pass .	-4.5326

When Bardina Degei cooks dinner , she does not use a stove .	-2.3294
It even seldom uses a pot .	-2.2527
In her wooden house in Enarotali , the capital of the Paniai Regency in the troubled Indonesian province of Papua , the housewife usually puts a sweet potato - locally called " nota " - directly into the fireplace .	-4.1429
After half an hour , the chopped bone is taken out with diligent , unwashed hands and swallowed .	-6.0817
Degei sits on the clay floor - she does not have any furniture - where she also performs her daily work , for example washing clothes with cloudy water from the nearby swamp .	-4.9608
A bucket in a roofless room serves as a latrine .	-3.0430
As the youngest of the four wives of her husband , she was not assigned fields .	-3.4921
Polygamy is common here .	-1.7634
Of course , working late can be dangerous : most villagers are unemployed , and many drink hard , and there are soldiers here .	-3.5724
" Nobody dares to walk around the village after 5 p.m. , " she says .	-2.8483
It is a rare insight into daily life in the highlands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was admitted in 1969 after a disputed referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,026 elders were to vote by means of a public handshake before the occupying forces .	-9.9072
An existing movement that stirred up independence against Dutch rule quickly turned against the government of Jakarta , which controls the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers .	-3.9856
In 2003 , the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua , with the independent part of Papua New Guinea encompassing the eastern part of the island .	-3.8025
The trip includes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire and then a 5-hour car ride in the morning .	-5.4319
There is no public transport .	-1.9038
The city , with approximately 19,000 inhabitants , consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences and corrugated roofs , which were converted into different yellow brown tones by rust .	-5.6484
Very few Indonesians have made their journey here , let alone journalists and practically no foreigners .	-2.7355
Before Christian missionaries arrived , Mee Pago Papuans worshipped a god called Uga Tamee .	-2.1694
There have also been other changes .	-1.5566
" We were not accustomed to wearing these clothes , " Degei says , pointing to her lively , handwoven turban , her dark shirt and her bright skirt .	-4.6761
'In the past we had only leaves on our bodies ' .	-2.8624
Papua is Indonesia ’ s poorest province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and some of the worst child mortality and literacy rates in Asia .	-2.6041
But it is also Indonesia ’ s goldland .	-2.8555
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Grasberg , owned by Freeport McMoran of Phoenix , is only 60 miles from Paniai , a highland province of the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants .	-3.4677
In 2015 alone , Freeport lost $ 3.1 billion in gold and copper .	-2.5460
Moreover , Papua has wood resources worth an estimated $ 78 billion .	-3.3663
These riches , however , are a source of misery for the Papua people to ensure that Indonesia ’ s powerful military maintains a stifling presence .	-4.0531
A 2005 survey in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid nearly $ 20 million to local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004 , including up to $ 150,000 to a single officer .	-3.5760
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden gans and are treated mercilessly .	-2.2621
According to activists , more than 500,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been raped , tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969 .	-2.5030
Mass killings in Papua ’ s tribal highlands in the 1970 ’ s became genocide according to the Asia Human Rights Commission .	-2.8983
In the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful demonstrators last year .	-1.6882
" We will lose all " is said in a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane , which contains reports of atrocities of the previous year , such as illegal executions and torture - rape and electric strikes are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations .	-6.1276
" It is difficult to count the number of victims because incidents happen every week , " says Andreas Harsono , Indonesian researcher for Human Rights Watch .	-2.9138
The screws have increased , as Papua 's resources generate an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia .	-3.8645
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic development is changing as Muslim economic migrants come from the populous islands of Java , Borneo , Sumatra and Sulawesi .	-3.8129
Javanese Warung canteens sell fried chicken and Gado-Gado , a mixed vegetables served with peanut sauce .	-3.7758
Local people are fighting to keep up here .	-3.1805
" Migrants have begun to sell chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than local Papua , " explains Abeth You , a 24-year-old Paniai natives who moved to the provincial capital of Jayapura .	-10.6188
'It has cost the indigenous Papua - the Mama Mama [ the women ] of Papua - their market . '	-4.0211
Indonesian President Joko Widodo , popularly known as Jokowi , promised to address the inequalities and violations of the law in Papua during his 2014 campaign .	-3.8449
The former carpenter secured 27 of Papua 's 29 districts - including Paniai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jakarta .	-3.1407
But little has changed in Papua , and today the locals feel cheated .	-2.8437
" Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014 , with the expectation that he will meet our hopes that justice will be restored , " says you .	-3.1244
Indeed , Paniai suffered a low point only two months after Jokowi ’ s inauguration in October .	-2.6621
On December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children was out and sang Christmas songs in front of a campfire in Enarotali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the dark on a motorcycle .	-3.6808
The frightened children told them that they should turn their headlights on .	-3.0141
One of the soldiers took offence at their tone and came back later with four soldiers , according to the local pastor Yavedt Tebai .	-5.2101
The soldiers who had drunk hunted and beat the group with their rifles , said victims and witnesses .	-3.0822
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .	-2.4127
A child , the 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo , was hit so hard that he fell into coma .	-3.0588
A few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escalated the next day .	-2.9195
About 1,000 young Papua men , women , and children gathered on a football pitch in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice .	-3.4986
They carried out ceremonial hunting arches and performed the Waita dance - in a circle and imitating a bird song - by Papuas Mee Pago tribe .	-4.5908
Some demonstrators began to throw stones on police and military posts .	-3.3543
When the mood was heated , the soldier was sent a command of an internal radio : " If the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , " it is said in an official TIME document that was not released to the local media .	-11.1541
Yeremias Kayame , 56 , the head of the Kego Koto district of Enarotali , saw the threat and called for calm and called for the crowd to return home .	-3.6965
Nobody was in the mood to listen .	-2.0496
" When I turned around , I was suddenly shot into my left wrist , " he said TIME on the veranda of his colorful wooden house .	-3.3789
Kayame still does not know who fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here .	-3.2618
" It was overcrowded , many shots were fired , " he adds .	-2.0289
The native man Alfius Youw was met three times , so his cousin , who witnessed the shootings .	-3.7170
" I ran to him and studied his body to make sure he was , " said Yohanes , who , like many Indonesians , bears only one name , the TIME in dire mood .	-4.2915
'I saw that he was dead ... I kissed him ' .	-2.2031
The chief inspector of the Papua police , Yotje Mende , told reporters that his officers wanted to " secure " their station because they were attacked .	-3.9098
" We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us , " said the spokesman of the Papua police , Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo , in 2015 .	-3.2746
'It is about life and death ' .	-1.8285
According to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstrators were killed and many others injured .	-2.1804
The news about the killings came only the following day ' filtered ' to Jakarta .	-2.1258
Three weeks in Jayapura , Jokowi delivered a passionate speech expressing sympathy for the families of the victims and vowed to address the historical abuses in Papua .	-4.2765
" I want this case to be resolved immediately so that it will not happen in the future , " he said .	-2.7714
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he set up an extrajudicial mechanism to resolve historical human rights violations .	-3.8417
But the excuses began almost immediately .	-1.2779
" Most injuries occurred long ago .	-1.8853
Some were in the 1990s and in the early 2000 's .	-4.3449
The point is that we have committed ourselves to tackling these violations , but there are processes that need to be passed through , " he said .	-3.9429
Then Wiranto resigned when he spoke to TIME in Jakarta on 5 June and said that he had no plans to set up a complaints mechanism in Papua .	-4.4937
Instead , " everything is regulated by law , " he said .	-1.8191
Wiranto , accused by the UN for " crimes against humanity " , which claimed more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor 's bloody independence vote in 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights violations have already been settled in Papua , including the Paniai incident .	-4.0207
Families of the Paniai victims received such claims with fierce disbelief .	-3.0694
" I have been interviewed four times over the last three years , but no progress has been made , " Yohanes says .	-2.7912
'I am tired ' .	-0.8429
He says that years later he still lives in fear .	-2.0478
" I am afraid , " he says .	-1.2738
'I am afraid to be arrested by the military , I am afraid to be shot ' .	-2.9300
His brother Yacobus repeated the view that the people of Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident .	-2.4589
He says he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims .	-2.2126
" After I had buried the corpses , the military searched for me , " he says . , , , . , , , , . , , . ,	-7.5331
The shootings did not stop .	-2.1588
On Tuesday the Indonesian police shot at villagers in Paniais neighborhood Deiyai .	-2.6182
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company that refused to bring an unconscious man to the hospital , one person and 17 others were injured , including children .	-13.7190
The man , the 24-year-old Ravianus Douw , who was drowned when he was fishing in a nearby river , died on his way to the hospital .	-3.5700
Surprised villagers protested in front of the company ’ s location office .	-4.0204
The police said that villagers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warnings .	-3.1466
But locals say that the mobile brigade ( Indonesian paramilitary police ) began to shoot at the crowd and killed one .	-2.0347
" We were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , " says the 29-year-old Dominggu Badii , who lives near the hospital and was witnessing how the injured were quickly admitted here , says the TIME .	-5.6456
'I hid myself two days in my house ' .	-2.9390
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the officers involved to be held accountable and for withdrawing the police ’ s mobile brigade from the area .	-3.7577
Paniai has always been a disorder for the Indonesian Government .	-2.7186
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the discontent of the tribal members Mee , Moni , Dani and Damal who live in the green highlands of Papua .	-3.5825
Many joined the " Free Papua Movement " ( OPM ) , the rebel army , which claims to defend the rights of the Papua by launching sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers .	-3.6704
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai , including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya .	-1.6564
In response , in recent years , thousands of people have been arrested in Paniai and arbitrarily detained , on the pretext of ' safeguarding national sovereignty ' .	-3.7939
Some never appear again .	-2.5599
Among the people of Papua , Paniai is known as ' a tragic , forgotten place ' .	-2.8116
Poverty strengthens discontent .	-1.1863
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals .	-2.2634
Bread is also out of reach .	-1.9625
People here grow everything they eat : especially notas and fruit and leaf vegetables .	-4.6825
Agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potatoes each .	-4.8502
They retain most of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market .	-2.3893
Ten pieces of Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees ( 75 cents ) .	-1.9698
Over time , economic inequalities have grown between the indigenous Papua and the new migrants , who have increased in number since the opening of new routes to Nabire airport .	-5.2095
The few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better-educated and wealthier migrants .	-3.5377
Papua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to run their own businesses competitive .	-3.8604
" Young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money here , " says John Gobai , chairman of the Paniai tribal council .	-3.6437
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua .	-1.4804
Moreover , restrictions on reporting remain strained by international media .	-2.3257
At the beginning of the year , French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported for lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua , although they were given the rare permission to film .	-3.4552
According to Phelim Kine , the Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises made by Jokowi ’ s campaign to lift the restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development have not been realized .	-4.5030
" There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia 's troubled easternmost provinces of Papua and West Papua : visa denial and a black list , " he said in a statement .	-11.0090
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian Government remains largely confined to Papua ’ s immediate neighbors .	-2.9702
In March , six pacific states - Tonga , Nauru , Palau , Tuvalu , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the ' various and widespread injuries ' in Papua , including the Paniai Shooting .	-3.8791
The same countries have historically supported the OPM .	-1.6594
The spokesman of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry , Arrmanatha Nasir , rejected the group 's allegations and said to journalists in Jakarta : ' There is still a democratic system in Indonesia , and there are free media , so it is difficult to cover up evidence of human rights cases ' .	-4.9563
The people on the ground want more foreign governments to take note of this .	-2.0547
When an official delegation from the Netherlands , led by the human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar , visited Jayapura on 4 May , locals broke their silence and afflicted him " We want freedom " , according to a source that also attended the meeting but wants to remain anonymous .	-5.5583
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua say that they are unlikely to vote for Jokowi again .	-2.3323
" Jokowi is a person with good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Paniai shots , " says Gobai , chairman of the tribal council .	-4.1778
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people , apart from living under the constant threat of a predatory military , are in poor education and health services .	-2.9350
Gobai says that the Paniai people , like other Papua people , regard their vote for Jokowi as a " guilt " that he must repay .	-4.1365
" They do not need money , they just want justice , " he says .	-2.2449
Despite threats and intimidation , the Paniai victims ’ families carried out a final symbolic act of defiance : the victim ’ s corpse was buried on a site just opposite the police and the military station .	-6.1905
They know that they may never have justice , but at least they do not let those responsible forget their crimes .	-3.8110
" A member of our family was killed , " Yacobus says .	-2.1579
'What else can we do ? '	-0.9902
Fire Capture Dubai ’ s Torch Cloudscratcher for the second time	-5.5347
A fire took place on Friday in one of the highest residential towers in the world in Dubai , forcing hundreds of residents to flee from the 337 meter high 79-storey building .	-4.4106
It is the second fire that sweeps through the high house in just two years , which is accidentally called the Torch Tower .	-5.5647
The building was evacuated , no injuries were reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .	-2.8093
" We slept and we stood up at the fire alarm and at the shouting of the people .	-3.4197
We ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50th floor , " a resident who called his name as George , Reuters .	-3.6858
Dubai ’ s civil protection authorities said that the fire-fighting units at 4.00 p.m. local time ( 00.00 a.m. GMT ) cleared the fire and cooled the building .	-5.3825
The government said that it is working to provide accommodation for those affected .	-3.0543
The incident can revive questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas by high-rise buildings around the world .	-3.9313
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage was caused by the cladding , the exterior cladding to the decoration or isolation .	-6.9774
In Britain , the police said that they believe that the system of plates for isolation and disguise on the London Grenfell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire that killed about 80 people .	-5.3978
No Davis Cup Reform : Continue Best of Five	-2.0974
The President of the International Tennis Federation ( ITF ) has gone through the General Assembly with his great Davis Cup Coup .	-4.2244
At the Ho Chi Minh City meeting , the revolutionary proposal for this sport to play Davis Cup individuals on only two wins was not supported by the necessary two-thirds majority .	-6.3310
The five sets classics , which are often very long , but also highly valued for this reason , are thus retained by the traditional competition .	-7.5287
63.54 % of the Member States voted in favour of the reform , so ITF President David Haggerty ’ s goal has been narrowly missed .	-5.0967
" We respect this decision , but are disappointed that our membership has not adopted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup .	-3.2589
We need a change to safeguard the long-term future of these iconic and historical contests , " said Haggerty .	-2.8246
We will continue to work on improving the candidates .	-3.6430
After many objections , it was not until the vote that the proposal had already been made to hold the final in a neutral place .	-6.4325
New from 2018 are only comparatively small details : the finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have host rights in the next year in the first round .	-4.9315
In order to reduce the costs for the organizers , the requirements for training places etc. will be made easier and players will have to take less official media appointments before the Davis Cup .	-6.3270
More than 1 out of 5 US passengers is bringing banned items onto the plane and finding a poll .	-5.7883
A survey of air passengers found that more than 20 % deliberately or unconsciously smuggled prohibited items past the US Transportation Security Administration ’ s control points , including at least 6 % of the aircraft ’ s value while carrying inadvertently banned knives or other items with blades .	-6.0183
Less than 1 % claimed that they had discovered late that they were mistaken for guns , ammunition , or explosives .	-3.7919
The survey of more than 1,000 people - carried out by a jet charter service , the Stratos Jet Charters Inc . - also found that younger travellers tend to disregard the rules .	-4.9700
Of those surveyed who admitted that they had deliberately tried to fly with something that was banned by the TSA , 19.7 % were millennials , compared to less than 15 % , who were members of Generation X .	-4.8664
The most common items deliberately passed by TSA agents were food and liquids .	-3.2138
More than 3 % admitted that they knowingly carried objects with blades through security control , while 2.2 % of female respondents and 3.7 % of male respondents also confirmed that they had deliberately brought banned drugs onto the plane .	-5.6780
The company said that it asked travellers across the country to find out how many accidentally smuggling goods would have brought through airport security and how many would have done it intentionally .	-5.4817
It is no surprise that the people who are most likely to carry smuggling - knowingly or unwittingly - through security were the ones who fly most .	-5.5968
However , the company points out that the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing .	-2.8413
People are often unsure which liquids they can take with them or how much of it .	-3.8728
So it is no surprise that the largest amount of liquids seized by the TSA are prohibited .	-4.3423
For a while , people thought that TSA could view books as smuggling .	-3.3327
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .	-2.0135
Elon Musk doesn ’ t care : Tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel orders .	-2.4877
Elon Musk is pleased to announce the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla " Model 3 " .	-3.7661
In doing so , he has so far failed to accept that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation .	-6.1313
In addition to the always triumphal figures on revenue increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tesla CEO Elon Musk first betrayed another , less glamorous figure in the announcement of the recent quarterly balance : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 .	-7.6621
In recent months , Musk had often advertised more than 500,000 preconditions for the new car , which is just beginning to be delivered .	-5.3436
Now Musk admits : 63,000 of the total 518,000 preconditions have already been withdrawn .	-4.2996
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations .	-3.4816
In case of cancellation , Tesla will fully refund the 1000 Euro ( US $ 1000 and UK $ 1000 ) " Reservation Deposit " .	-5.7643
Currently there are 455,000 such non-binding reservations and Musk admitted in a telephone conference with analysts .	-4.6186
However , the Tesla boss does not believe that the cancellation of around 12 percent of all orders could become a problem .	-5.4708
His argument : the challenge of ambitious growth targets is not demand , but production .	-3.2464
Last year Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles .	-1.2914
In 2018 - all models taken together - it will be 500,000 , in 2020 a million .	-4.2346
The demand for this is obviously there .	-2.4823
According to Musk there are currently 1800 reservations per day .	-2.3718
If you order a " Model 3 " today , you can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla is able to drive its brand new production lines , which have never been tested in practice , with maximum utilization without major interruptions .	-6.8930
Many experts doubt that this is possible .	-1.4747
If , however , there are major delays , the non-binding nature of reservations could become the problem for Tesla .	-5.3487
After all , the company cannot prevent unsatisfied customers from running away .	-4.6380
EPA leader Pruitt is withdrawing because of the Obama Era ’ s delaying rules on reducing emissions .	-4.8222
One day after being sued by 15 states , Scott Pruitt , the head of the Environmental Protection Agency , reverted his earlier decision to delay implementation of the Obama era ’ s rules in order to reduce emissions of air pollutants that cause smo.	-4.9305
Pruitt presented the change when his agency was more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administrations .	-3.7183
He did not mention the complaint that had been lodged against his previous post in a Federal Court of Appeal .	-4.6533
It is a deadline that took place on 1 October for states to meet the 2015 standards for ground-level ozone .	-4.0630
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid ' interfering in local decisions or impeding economic growth ' .	-3.8849
Pruitt , who was a prosecutor of Oklahoma before his appointment by President Donald Trump , has long been a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations .	-4.0967
Since its arrival in Washington , Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations that the chemical industry and the fossil-fuel industry oppose .	-3.8056
The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the latest legal setback for the Pruitts regulatory rollback agenda .	-1.9301
Last month , a Federal Court of Appeal in Washington ruled that the EPA administrator overstepped his authority when trying to delay the implementation of a Obama administration rule that required oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks .	-5.3569
In a statement published on Wednesday evening , Pruitt suggested that its reversal to ozone standards simply increases the willingness of EPAs to cooperate with states through the complex process of meeting the new standards in good time .	-5.6847
" Among previous administrations , CEPOL has often failed to meet the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be charged by activist groups and others and set the deadline for implementation in an agreement , " said Pruitt , who sued the CEPOL more than a dozen times in his previous job .	-5.6641
" We do not believe in legal regulation and we take deadlines seriously .	-2.9400
We also take seriously the law and authority that exists . '	-2.5317
Nevertheless , the EPO 's opinion said that Pruitt will at some point use his ' power of delay and all other legal powers ' to ensure that the rules are ' based on sound policies and the best available information ' .	-5.7930
Congressional Republicans are pushing for a broader recast of ozone rules .	-3.0004
A bill approved last month is intended to delay implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .	-2.5980
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate .	-1.4767
The New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman , who led the coalition of states that the EPO had sued this week , said that the group intends to maintain legal pressure .	-3.8333
" The EPO 's reversal - according to our complaints - is an important benefit for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities , " said Schneiderman .	-4.6470
In this case , New York joined California , Connecticut , Delaware , Illinois , Iowa , Maine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Pennsylvania , Rhode Island , Vermont and Washington , and the District of Columbia .	-2.1360
Soil ozone occurs when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil refineries , chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight .	-3.0063
The resulting smog can cause serious respiratory problems in vulnerable groups of people and can contribute to thousands of premature deaths every year .	-3.5111
Public health officials and environmentalists rejoiced about Pruitts ’ surprising change of course .	-3.5367
" It is worrying how much pressure it needs to get this sensible step from the person responsible for the protection of the air we breathe , " said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity .	-3.8380
'We must continue to fight the Trump administration 's ideological crusade to bend on polluters and their particular interests ' .	-4.1198
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church	-2.2727
750 Years of St. Hilarius Church : On the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church , the old cemetery area in Tumlingen is invited to a serenade at 4.30 p.m. on Sunday 16 July .	-4.8344
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historic St. Hilarius complex is a popular place to stay .	-3.7561
Visitors to the sixth benefit serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place .	-3.6523
The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village has made the friends and sponsors of Tumlingen their concern .	-5.3884
Walter Martini stresses : " It is a unique village gem " .	-3.5015
In 1267 the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in the Württemberg document book : Count Hermann von Sulz sold the mountain with the parish church in Tumlingen and the Vogtei " to Magister Eberhard von Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver .	-11.4784
According to the text of the document , in addition to the former parish church , the Tumlinger Berg also had a ruling court , including the church or patronage law , and not the other way round .	-6.4710
So people lived there as well .	-3.3318
As can be seen from the description of the Upper Office of Freudenstadt of 1858 , next to the village and the Oberdorf , which are still visible today in the townscape of Tumlingen , the " mountain " was the third , the stately settlement centre of the village .	-7.0307
Old maps from around the year 1600 underpin these historical realities .	-5.0352
Patronage law originated from early medieval private church law .	-4.1400
A Lord who built , equiped and occupied a church with a priest remained the owner of this church and could inherit it it .	-6.0723
It was linked to the right to appoint a pastor or or to propose a new pastor to the bishop .	-4.2565
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower .	-1.8619
The larger of the two crushed at Christmas 1673 .	-3.1934
The newly created bell was then first heard in 1692 , but had to be left later in World War II in 1942 .	-6.0954
In the Thirty Years War ( 1616 to 1648 ) , the windows and the bell ropes were stolen .	-4.5758
The roof was leaky .	-2.5636
In 1796 , French troops camp near the church .	-2.9337
They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood .	-2.6336
The remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809 .	-2.7339
Until 1869 , the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery also served as the last resting place for the dead from Swiss horns .	-4.6372
In 1823 the cemetery was expanded and the Hilarius church was abandoned .	-4.0714
Only the church tower was left standing .	-2.7557
In New Year 's Eve 1834 , a storm split the church tower and half collapsed .	-4.2263
In order to prevent an accident , the tower was cut off .	-8.5494
Only the tower dwarf still exists today was preserved as a witness to the 750-year-old church history .	-5.5187
Today , Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem from the " sheep pensioners " as the successor of Dieter Dockhorn maintain the Hilarius plant .	-4.3387
As organiser , the friends and sponsors of Tumlingen invite to the sixth serenade of the old cemetery to the St. Hilarius Chapel .	-5.9994
This is done by the Combo of the Kepler Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with contributions from Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis .	-4.4021
Local leader Hartmut Romann speaks the final word .	-2.9963
The program starts at 4.30 p.m.	-1.7502
The entrance is from 3.30 p.m.	-3.3067
To end the serenade there is a transfer in front of the graveyard .	-4.6509
" Enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows towards the forest " , the organizers show the fantastic view .	-5.1715
The serenade takes place only in dry weather .	-2.6726
The organisers hope that many supporters will receive the historic St. Hilarius facility , which is important for Tumlingen and Hörschweiler .	-4.8760
Friends and sponsors of Tumlingen feel particularly committed to home care , as Serenade organizer Walter Martini reaffirms .	-4.7694
Association wants to have windmills approved	-3.7985
" Boisheim defends itself " does not see any legal condition for the construction and has therefore approached the council .	-4.9503
The association " Boisheim wears itself " asked Landrat Andreas Coenen ( CDU ) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheim net .	-4.8421
It was illegal .	-2.3080
The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 , no wind turbines could have been approved at all in Boisheim ’ s net , because at the time in Viersen there was only a wind-power concentration zone at the city border to Schwalmtal .	-6.9217
Within this concentration zone , the construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes the use of wind energy to be excluded from the rest of the city .	-10.4426
Such zones should prevent the landscape from being " paralysed " .	-4.4415
The city of Viersen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette , which had not been approved by the district government of Düsseldorf , due to a form defect , a few days earlier .	-7.6328
" Due to the lack of a regulatory requirement , the approval document issued is still illegal and therefore also withdrawn , " said Christoph Erkens , Chairman of " Boisheim defends itself .	-11.2488
The current state of affairs : before the summer break , the town council decided again the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette ; approval of the district government is still pending .	-7.2591
Erkens : " This excludes the granting of approval for the construction of wind turbines in terms of planning law " .	-5.9630
The circle confirms the receipt of the request .	-1.5904
" The corresponding letters have been received by the district of Viersen since last week , " said a speaker .	-4.1497
The circle makes it an opportunity to examine the matter again .	-4.3443
However , they are not likely to lead to the procedure being stopped .	-3.9448
With regard to ongoing proceedings at the administrative court , the circle on Thursday did not want to comment on the content of the argument of the association " Boisheim defends itself " .	-6.2129
NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , plans to build four 200-metre high windmills on an area on Boisheimer Nette .	-9.6282
Last year , the company , in which the city of Viersen is indirectly involved , had already concluded leased contracts with the owner of the area of about 65 hectares .	-8.7315
With the construction of the four wind turbines , the electricity needs of around 11 400 households are to be met - that is about one fifth of the electricity needs of all four households .	-6.3112
The NEW Re wants to invest around € 20 million .	-2.6750
Last summer , Viersens City Council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines at the Linnich wind farm near Aachen , as well as to participate in a wind turbine in <unk>bach-Palenberg in Heinsberg county .	-5.3582
Cars and tractors crack together : a woman dies in a terrible accident .	-5.1083
A terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at around 10 a.m. on the L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel ( Rhein-Lahn district ) .	-3.4469
A woman was killed .	-2.3012
Two more people were slightly injured .	-1.8945
The state road remained closed for hours .	-2.6280
According to police data , a 17-year-old young woman from Bornich with her car was able to take the L 333 in the direction of Bogel in the course of the accompanying journey with her 53-year-old mother .	-6.9116
City and Retailers are planning " Home Shops " weekend	-4.6758
Bad Langensalza and people from the region are expected to rediscover shopping opportunities in the city centre in September .	-4.6016
The trade association and the city administration want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to entice the residents to go shopping in the city centre .	-6.3778
As Christian König , Chairman of the Commercial Association , announced , the " Heimat Shop " weekend is intended to sensitize customers to what offers their own city offers apart from the usual supermarket goods .	-7.5279
The plan is therefore to have a market with regional suppliers , similar to the weekly market .	-7.8742
In addition , domestic companies are to present themselves with their training places .	-4.2896
In addition , the shops in the city centre are supposed to invite you to " midnight shopping " .	-8.5793
The action does not only target residents of the city and the surrounding region .	-5.4975
In preparation are commercials on the radio , an internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend , says Christian König .	-4.3112
City administration and commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce .	-4.2813
This will take the commercial association and the city into another stage of the project " Attractive downtown " .	-5.4604
This includes new offers such as the first " active day " at the Brunnenfest and sold Sunday , talks with all tradesmen and hosts to encourage them to participate actively .	-6.4787
Also attractive offers on Saturday and the waiver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept .	-3.7172
In addition , customer potential is to be reopened or reopened .	-4.1680
These include spa guests and tourists .	-2.5812
But many locals would also have lost sight of the city centre when shopping .	-3.8597
In the end , everyone would have to contribute to revitalising the city centre , right up to landlords , the businesses of the whole city and clubs .	-6.4922
It would be a matter of overcoming the lethargy with a network that partly spread , King said in the spring .	-5.6960
Birgit Streich , head of the IHK Center in Mühlhausen , said that the third " home shop " day , for the first time five Thuringian cities , took part in the nationwide " day " .	-5.9595
Beside Bad Langensalza these are Weimar , Smmerda , Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode .	-3.2404
The day should " promote the appreciation of local trade and highlight its importance for the common good of our cities , " he says .	-5.3205
The action under the auspices of the IHK and with many partners also makes it clear that each citizen can influence his / her own purchasing behavior .	-5.6336
Two dead and several injured after explosion to US school	-3.5789
During construction work there was a gas explosion in the school building .	-2.5729
New people were injured .	-1.7617
In a gas explosion in the US town of Minneapolis , two people were killed and nine others injured , some of them heavy .	-3.3955
According to the fire brigade , on Wednesday ( local time ) an injured person was still in a critical state .	-8.6312
A person died when part of a school building collapsed during the explosion .	-2.4914
A missing one was also found dead later .	-5.4761
The dead were school employees .	-2.5261
As an accident , the authorities suspected work on a gas pipeline .	-3.6705
During the holiday season , few people stayed in the Minnehaha Academy building .	-3.9193
Trump pressurized Mexico ’ s Sensed Transcripts of Telephone Calls for Border Wall Payment	-5.1867
Transcripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Trump and Mexico and Australia leaders were published by the Washington Post .	-2.0090
On January 27 , Trump , in a telephone conversation with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto , called for an end to saying publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall .	-3.4496
The President of the United States insulted him because he had publicly denounced the wall , and he reportedly said to him : ' You cannot say that to the press ' .	-5.1378
Trump launched his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the US southern border , and vowed to let Mexico pay for the project .	-3.4442
Transcripts of his first call to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and revealed a tense exchange .	-2.4799
Mr. Trump said Mr. Turnbull that a trade for the US would take over refugees who emigrated to Australia " ridiculous " , " mies " and " stupid " , and that the trade that the Obama administration imparted would make him look like a " depot " after proposing a ban on the resettlement of refugees to the US .	-6.2603
Mr Trump ended the call after he told Mr Turnbull that ' this is the most unpleasant call for the whole day ' .	-4.0492
Moore ’ s Ford Massacre : Activists Restart racist Lynchact as a Call for Justice	-5.2983
A 1948 Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in rural Monroe , Georgia , and rushed to the Ford Bridge of Moore .	-4.0192
Before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men came out with guns to block his way .	-8.7202
The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man in a pinstripe suit - took a long train on his cigar and looked through the windshield .	-4.9905
Inside , the inmates floated in fear .	-3.2104
" We want this n --- r Roger ! " brillthe man .	-2.8225
'Get him out of the car ! '	-1.3976
cries torn the silence when a young black man was torn by the front-passenger seat .	-4.3151
Fortunately , this terrible scene , which was played on 22 July , is only a replay .	-4.3213
But when a noose is thrown around the neck of " Roger " , almost everyone in the audience found very real sighs .	-5.4286
Since 2005 , civil rights activists have returned to the Moore 's Ford Bridge to imitate the night when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by Ku Klux Klan in 1946 .	-3.6901
No one has ever been charged with murders .	-2.4291
" It is really incomprehensible that no single person has been arrested in all these years - although we see them in our communities , although we know who they are , " said Tyrone Brooks , who helps to organise the post .	-5.5750
'It is a dirt on a story , but it is a burden on our souls . '	-2.7557
Brooks is a 71-year old former Congressman of the State of Georgia and a lifetime civil rights activist .	-3.7921
For him , rescheduling serves as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected .	-4.4085
" We want prosecution , we want the end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we need justice , " he said .	-2.7598
'We cannot get healing and reconciliation until we get justice ' .	-2.9550
A legal practitioner puts a blanket over the corpse of one of the victims of the Moore-Ford Lynch on 27 July 1946 .	-4.8602
According to FBI files received by NBC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the lynch process .	-2.9819
But no one has ever been charged .	-2.3015
Although suspects have remained free for decades , civil rights activists say that the double motivation for Lynch actions throughout the city has always been known : politics and sex .	-4.2033
In April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court allowed the black citizens of Georgia to vote for the first time in the summer election campaign .	-4.6638
About the same time as the election , according to the FBI , the black farmer Roger Malcom stabbed a white landowner , Barnett Hester , during a fight - allegedly for a woman .	-4.7149
Brooks said that the rumor in the city was that Hester slept with Malcom 's wife Dorothy and that the baby she wore was not from her husband .	-3.8399
On July 25 , 1946 , Loy Harrison , a prominent white landowner , paid $ 600 to free Malcom from prison , according to the FBI .	-3.1054
He was accompanied to prison by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey .	-1.8813
But when they moved away from prison and approached the Moore 's Ford Bridge , a lynchmob surrounded the car .	-4.0728
" As it turns out , it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murders , " concludes an FBI report .	-3.0365
" It is also obvious that there was a plot between state and local prosecution , which was not only involved in the murders , removed evidence and masked the identity of witnesses " .	-4.8140
Brooks puts it even more concise .	-2.3613
" It was an electoral massacre , " he said .	-1.5526
'You have all been killed to send a message to black people in this community : ' If you register and vote , you will be here . '	-4.1898
For almost a decade , Cassandra Greene has led the annual re-creation of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murders .	-3.7721
Their presentation is vivid , seductive , and rooted in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe is no longer present in America .	-6.5434
It is difficult to watch and even more difficult to look away , but Greene said that this is the point .	-3.6947
" We do not want to talk about the lynch , because we are then confronted with its ugliness in all of us , " she said .	-4.2410
" But I cannot build a relationship with you if you don 't want to listen to me or you don 't want to hear what I 've been through " .	-7.8450
The rehearsals for this year 's production began in June , and on the first day , almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest of blacks - were rushing into a room and listening when Greene started a well-recorded overview of the play .	-7.1008
Wade Marbaugh is a co-director here .	-2.0557
He has played the role of chief clan member for years , but he said that the role never became easier .	-4.0266
" I feel dirty because I am not that , " said Marbaugh .	-2.3997
'But I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return to these times ' .	-3.0518
On the other side of the room , the actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona , who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester , tried their lines .	-2.6962
The play begins with Malcom , who attacks and afflicts Hester , angry that he slept with his wife Dorothy .	-3.8112
'I said n --- he , disappears from my property ! '	-2.0669
Rascona replies to the fire .	-2.9205
There is a pause .	-1.1145
And then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .	-2.7993
Greene laughs the loudest .	-1.4625
" What ? ! " Rascona asked .	-1.8535
It is alarmed and confused .	-1.0158
Was I too hard ?	-1.5607
" No , " said Greene , still crazy .	-4.1944
'I simply do not think that white people said ' n --- he ' . '	-3.7149
" But , " one of the other black actors joked .	-3.6838
'You only have to hit the hard ' R. '	-2.1072
And that is precisely where the energy shifts in the room ; a sense of comradeship replaces unease .	-5.5740
Everyone is busy getting this right , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four people killed .	-3.3985
The scene starts again .	-1.2794
This time , when Rascona says the N word , he says it sharply and forcefully .	-3.8239
Absolutely nobody laughs .	-1.5250
This repetition ends violently and quickly .	-1.9710
There are cries , shots and then silence .	-2.0756
A woman dressed with a mourning dress stands above the bodies of the actors and conducts Billie Holidays mourning praises " Strange Fruit " .	-4.8823
Your vote breaks every second word .	-2.8220
About a hundred meters behind it , a group of about four dozen spectators sweat and tears out of their eyes .	-11.1175
The audience is divided almost evenly between black and white .	-2.2149
A couple came from Ithaca , New York , to see the performance , many just come down the street .	-3.9298
They have experienced Georgian humidity every nearly eight hours , when Brooks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tombs of the Malcoms and Dorsey .	-5.7479
Up to this point , the murders have remained an anecdote , but now , when you stand in the same country where the lynch killings took place , the air feels ghostly .	-5.6471
When the last notes of the song end , Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the corpse name .	-3.6425
Children hook at their heads , register the falsified blood and the silent bodies and whisper each other .	-4.0060
" They are not really dead , " a small boy murmurmurs as if he wanted to remember .	-4.7570
After a few minutes Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it 's over .	-2.7779
The actors throw away the lynch rope and wipe off their tears .	-2.9028
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh , the man in suit who played the clan member .	-2.2719
Nick Rascona embraces two of his fellow players and then crashes in their arms whipping , the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through with him .	-6.2590
" It 's okay " , whispers one of the women .	-2.3920
" We know that this is not in your heart .	-1.8624
You did so for one reason . '	-2.1568
Later , the audience meets the actors for dinner .	-4.0756
At a table , a white couple from Atlanta chat about the replay with a black couple they just got to know .	-5.5876
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words that left the performance feeling .	-7.9095
" It 's hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... from people who look like you and who do so because they look like you , " she said .	-3.3034
'What this really does with me makes me believe that the lynch is still going on ' , she added , ' today this is only called police shootings ' .	-5.5520
In the same room , Tyrone Brooks ’ court keeps at his table , he eats and reminds us of civil rights .	-8.4721
He said he had already started to plan the show next year .	-3.2028
" The replay is somewhat inspiring , because it describes the horror of what we have endured , but it is also a moment of learning , " he said .	-3.5532
" It 's so if we don 't learn anything from it , then it can happen again .	-3.9983
Those who do not study their own history , those who do not know their own history , are condemned to repeat them . '	-3.6774
" Divine Dawn " reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth	-2.2431
Also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner ’ s monumental work , director Frank Castorf places his emphasis on a colorful frivolous staging with a gigantic , six-storey backdrop .	-5.7860
The turning stage ( designed by Aleksandar Denic ) features a shabby street corner with a Berlin Wall and Dönerbode , a GDR era Plaste and Elaste logo or the New York Stock Exchange .	-7.5613
Before that , an open Mercedes classic car , in which the Rhine daughters pose as rocker girls , or alternatively an Isetta , parked .	-6.1417
Stamped oil barrels remind of Castorf 's leitmotif - money , power and greed - which pulls through his " ring " staging .	-5.1739
The three Rhine daughters - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel , Wiebke Lehmkühl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize as they did in the " Rheingold " .	-3.7948
Kess seduce them Siegfried ( Stefan Vinke ) , break a corpse into the boot in Hollywood style and give the Krawallo clique .	-4.5899
Stephen Milling sings the wonderfully fierce hate that the aura of a heavyweight boxer surrounds .	-4.4201
Brutal the scene when he hits Siegfried .	-1.8421
Later Gunther ( Markus Eiche ) has to believe .	-3.7467
The audience thanks the ensemble with strong applause .	-2.4955
Stürlich gefeiert werden Foster , Milling , Vinke und Dirigent Janowski , der sich humble und die Hand zur Merkel-Raute formiert berügt .	-5.7876
There is great applause for the festival orchestra , which is showing itself on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat , again in casual leisure clothes .	-7.8263
The appearance of Frank Castorf and his director team was eagerly awaited .	-3.6072
If he had yet to perform a yellowish pipe concert in 2013 , there was a great jubilation five years later in which the isolated " buh " calls were lost .	-8.4741
Katharina Wagner will have been pleased about this .	-5.5802
" It was noticed that the audience had grown together with the " ring " in a way , " she said just before the performance of the dpa .	-6.1106
The audience not only made a form of peace with Castorf , but it also grew an understanding of his view .	-4.5759
I draw a positive conclusion .	-1.6351

The Taliban said that they had carried out this attack .	-2.2628
On May 31 , a massive bombing in the center of the city killed more than 150 people with the country ’ s deadliest militant attack since the US-led troops expelled the Taliban from power in 2001 . were .	-4.7369
The violence highlights the precarious security situation in Afghanistan , as US President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of US troops supporting the country ’ s military and police forces .	-3.4479
Correspondents say that the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , its policies and , in particular , the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani .	-3.6162
EPO ’ s Delay of the Smog Rule Reverse	-5.7563
The US Environmental Protection Agency has revoked a decision to delay regulation of the Obama administration that states are obliged to curb Smog-causing emissions , one day after 15 states sued the agency for the move .	-6.4592
The EPO announced late on Wednesday the decision to push ahead with the so-called ' ozone provisions 2015 ' and said that it had a commitment to work with states .	-6.5637
" We believe in dialogue with and in responding to our state partners , " said EPA CEO Scott Pruitt in a statement .	-3.1650
Pruitt announced in June that the EPAs intend to delay the ozone regulations - in which pollutants are to be measured in part of the country to determine where cuts must be made to meet stricter air quality standards - by one year until October 2018 .	-5.8700
A group of 15 largely democratic states , together with the district of Colombia , filed a complaint on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .	-3.7589
President Donald Trump ’ s administration has tried to reduce a wide range of environmental constraints imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that Trump claims to boost economic growth .	-4.1278
Efforts , however , have triggered the reversal of democrats and nature conservation groups , who worry about the impact of greater emissions on public health .	-5.2704
The EPO website says that breathing in air containing ozone can " reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms " such as asthma .	-3.6808
The Council wants Community space	-3.1151
In the end , the decision was clear : with two votes against , the municipal council of Fluorn-Winzeln decides to create a common space in the future senior residence .	-10.3286
Before the discussion there is an important information : The purchase contract for the missing property is signed , reports Mayor Bernhard Tjaden .	-5.0515
Although it will still take time for the area belonging to the parish to date to be in municipal possession , there is no longer any obstacle to planning the project to be managed by a private investor .	-6.9234
There is a discussion on a Community area .	-3.8999
One of the two investors still in the boat has offered to meet the community .	-3.7746
On the ground floor it would provide a living area - around 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a surface area of 70 square meters for a special price .	-4.7850
The administration and the majority of the municipal council propose that such a common area should not be a meeting place only for residents of senior-appropriate housing , but should be open to the community .	-8.1413
As an example , the word " knickcafé " made the round .	-3.7648
The decision , which was already decided last autumn by allocating funds to the current budget , will be sweetened by means of funding .	-7.1984
The building is located in the rehabilitation area .	-3.3960
According to Tjaden , the creation of a Community area would be eligible at 60 % of 30 % .	-4.4715
The proposal for a resolution , in order to signal to the investor that he does not want to throw a stick between his legs in this respect , provides for the observation that both the saddle - which is similar to the surrounding construction - and the roof - which reduces the grip height and makes the construction more economical .	-9.6691
Needless to say , Wilfried Sohmer does not think that this addition is necessary .	-4.6214
If it helps : unanimously he happens the body .	-4.7488
It is not as easy as the Community area .	-3.5207
Daniela Ruf refers to the many private buildings that do not really make progress , for which the common room is now being rejected from the window , she says : ' I am doing it hard ' .	-9.7339
Yvonne Staiger is absolutely in favour of the Community area - but absolutely against local participation .	-4.6440
It sees a hidden subsidy to already wealthy or even external investors .	-3.8570
This is not the case , because the acquisition of the area does not give a subsidy , but instead receives a real value that can be marketed in case of doubt , is the counterpart .	-8.7686
Staiger ’ s request to split the proposal for a resolution accordingly has three supporters .	-3.8951
So there are two votes against the original programme , which Stefan Haller summarizes : ' If we take the decision in this way , we are taking a giant step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure ' .	-5.8387
Collision by Car : Cycling	-4.7800
When crossing the road , an 82-year-old cyclist was captured by a car on Wednesday in Garath and seriously injured .	-4.5039
As the police reported , the 82-year old Langenfelder had been travelling on his bike on the Black Way road from Hilden at 12.20 pm .	-6.9675
The senior wanted to cross the road in the height of the road Am Buchholzer Busch .	-3.2109
A car driver travelling in the same direction gave him priority .	-3.2152
When the Langenfelder took to the streets , he apparently did not pay attention to the traffic .	-6.3764
He met with a car running a 66-year-old Hildenerin .	-4.4631
The man was thrown onto the street .	-2.8374
He suffered severe injuries and was taken to hospital by a rescue car .	-4.1342
FC Bayern Munich must renounce David Alaba and Thiago in the Supercup against Borussia Dortmund .	-3.2352
The Supercup takes place without him : David Alaba has to suck the game against Dortmund .	-3.6555
With staff cares , FC Bayern travels to Dortmund for the first mandatory game of the new season .	-4.8517
Seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Supercup against the trophy winner .	-4.3793
The team cares at the German football record champion Bayern München are getting bigger and bigger before the Supercup on Saturday ( 20.30 p.m. / ZDF and Eurosport ) at Pokalwinner Borussia Dortmund .	-6.7753
Trainer Carlo Ancelotti must also give up David Alaba in the duel with the BVB .	-3.6506
The Italian confirmed this on Friday .	-2.1196
In addition , the Munich authorities lack Manuel Neuer , James , Thiago , Jerome Boateng , Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat .	-3.5145
Ancelotti was responsible for the five defeats in the past six test games for the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team .	-5.1689
" We know that we are not in the best physical condition , " said Ancelotti , adding : " The most important point is the balance in the team .	-9.4061
It was not good last time . '	-3.0533
The 58-year-old , however , believes in an increase in performance in the first official season of the season . are . are . , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-9.3102
" Football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation .	-1.1525
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .	-2.3407
The team is ready .	-0.7942
We want to play intelligently , " said Ancelotti , who expects a " difficult , intensive game " .	-2.6611
The duel of the two German football weights captivates the fans .	-3.7276
The game is sold out with 81,360 spectators , the German Football League ( DFL ) announced on Friday .	-3.8140
Walking from Star to Star Harz	-3.1371
In resin , the first " star path " is to be created throughout Germany .	-4.9076
The association Sternwarte Sankt Andreasberg is planning this .	-6.8763
There is a planetary path in Göttingen - since 2003 .	-2.7103
A " star path " meets the information needs of many Harz visitors , it was said .	-4.8009
It combines nature , science , movement and sporting performance .	-2.7306
Members want to set up tables along the planned route and inform them about stars and constellations .	-5.0805
In a first phase until 2018 the association plans " well-reachable installations in five to six places " in Oberresin .	-4.8188
There are questions about St. Andreasberg , Braunlage , Hohegeei<unk> and Sieber .	-4.9595
The information on the boards should be supplemented via the Internet .	-3.8550
That is why good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of locations .	-4.4272
Accessibility is also a criterion .	-1.1757
Later , the Star Trail is to be extended by train .	-4.9502
" On the Star Path , the viewers get to know a lot of interesting things , such as the physics of the individual stars , " explained the association .	-6.3768
They also learned why stars have different colors , or why a star shines more than another , even though it is far further away .	-4.6943
It also informs about the constellation of a selected star and when it is best to see it .	-6.2980
The association has been operating the highest observatory in northern Germany since 2014 in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg .	-3.4193
According to the Federal Office for Nature Protection , the location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany .	-4.1713
The Milky Way and even the Andromeda galaxy with the naked eye are often visible from there .	-3.5789
In the university town since 2003 , on the initiative of the Planetarium Göttingen Förderverein , there is something similar to the planned Sternenwerg - the Planetenweg .	-5.3358
Starting in front of Gebhards Hotel in Goetheallee , which forms the interior of our solar system , the Planetenweg with its steels leads up to the Hainberg and the observatory - as well as an " extraterrestrial " location in Diemarden ( municipality of Gleiden ) with the planet Sedna .	-6.2242
The shells with the individual planets - including the pluto degraded to the dwarf planet at the endpoint - are precisely positioned at a distance of one to two billion .	-6.0870
The earth thus shrinks to a 6.5 millimetre diameter ball , while the exactly 75 meter distant sun measures 70 centimetres .	-5.0738
The entire distance of the planetary path is about four kilometres .	-3.3681
While the light from the sun to the Pluto takes about eight hours , pedestrians need a good hour to get to the Stele with Pluto .	-4.9612
So pedestrians are faster than the light in space .	-2.4214
But the march to the next fixed star would take half a year .	-3.3008
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomakenko meet for the first time to discuss a possible showdown .	-3.0713
Vasyl Lomakenko and Mikey Garcia , who were to be in a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing match under <unk> 147 in the near future , met for the first time on Thursday .	-4.7855
They were in separate rooms in ESPN offices in Los Angeles , until Garcia , the unbeaten World Boxing Council lightweight champion , went down the corridor to welcome Lomakenko , the World Boxing Organization Super-Defense Champion .	-5.2126
After Garcia 's victory by unanimous decision on the former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday at Showtime , both fighters are members of the Top Five Pound-for Pound list .	-4.2585
Garcia stretched the right hand and said : " How do you , Champion ?	-4.0098
I wish you good luck ' .	-1.5171
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday evening at 7 pm on ESPN .	-2.6895
When the pair placed for photos , Lomachenko manager Egi Klimas noticed that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the " perfect order of magnitude " .	-4.9433
" I am a former feather weight , " reminded Garcia .	-2.7531
" I climbed for Broner [ to 140 pounds ] , but I 'm not so big .	-3.1989
I am small for 140 .	-0.9134
I want to come down to light weight .	-2.7849
And he must move on lightweight [ 135 pounds ] and then we fight .	-1.8768
That is what the fans are asking for .	-2.3714
Let us give them that . '	-1.7080
Lomachenko agreed .	-1.8177
'Boxes need this fight ' .	-1.9778
Climate asked whether it should be on pay-per-view , part of a strategy that Lomakenko will have to fight with a 135-pound debut this year to agree next summer with Garcia a date ( 37-0 , 30 knockouts ) that also has an interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight title fight in the forum on September 23 .	-5.8738
" This fight could take place in pay-per-view mode because all the fans asked for it , " Garcia said and later openly expressed himself to fight in the network that offers the best financial package .	-5.4266
We are the best .	-0.6509
No other names can create this kind of attention .	-2.2196
Whenever they are ready ... '	-1.4974
Garcia said he thought Lomakenko was " an enormous fighter , " and he might be taking part in his Saturday fight .	-5.3890
But Lomachenko stopped at the generous praise for Garcia and said that he thought the triumphant champion from Riverside " very slowly look , sorry Mikey ... you wanted the co-off " .	-7.2279
Garcia said that the focus is to show beat strength , then boxes .	-3.3567
Both said that they could feel the momentum that built up for their own struggle .	-3.5370
" This is the fight that needs to be conducted .	-4.2971
No other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm .	-2.1693
I am more than happy to work on it , " said Garcia .	-1.6295
Lomachenko said : " I have waited for the top fighters , and that is Mikey .	-2.9982
It will be a great battle . '	-1.8786
Four injured after Reifenburger	-3.4490
In the event of an accident on the A7 , four people were seriously injured on Thursday afternoon .	-3.2169
According to initial information , the driver of an Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle at 4.30 p.m. just before the Marktbrecht junction , presumably after a tire placer .	-7.0190
The car dragged to the right into the embankment , where it overlapped and then remained on the roof in the green stripe .	-11.9717
The four occupants - two adults and two children - were sometimes seriously injured in the accident .	-3.1981
During the initial care of the injured by the rescue service , the A7 was closed to the north for about an hour , followed by the traffic on the left track passing the accident site .	-7.0731
Fortunas Hoffmann : ' Tripartite Better '	-3.3728
After 2 : 2 , Andre Hoffmann hopes that the optimization of the defense formation will bring points to Aue .	-5.2248
Andre Hoffmann was happy with the first season game , and the result would not have been the two opponents at the 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .	-5.8752
" These were two opposing points too much , and we need to be even more careful in Aue , " says the defender of Fortuna Düsseldorf .	-5.4383
In the Erzgebirge the trio chain is to be further optimized .	-4.0543
And a gateway to a blast is no longer intended to capture the Fortunes .	-6.9899
'It will be the case for the future that no one will stand up to Michael ( Rensing ) . '	-4.7688
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better able to cope with the trio chain even after the experience in preparing the trio chain than with the four-string .	-7.0412
" I still do not know how we are going to act in Aue , " says his coach Friedhelm Funkel , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , " because we are currently in the trio chain on the semi-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Giesselmann players who can build well , " said Hoffmann .	-5.9278
" It is a prerequisite , but that we are even more harmonized and that we do not afford so many playback errors . "	-7.3917
Of course Hoffmann also goes to Aue to win the game .	-2.8462
" But it doesn 't know whether you can speak of a failed start after a draw .	-5.5349
The performance could be okay , " Hoffmann said .	-3.4882
'If , however , we have four points on Sunday and we can concentrate on the cup , we will certainly be able to speak of a good start to the season ' .	-5.9934
His trainer did not want to know about that .	-3.1167
" I only judge the start of the season after six to eight days of play , " said Friedhelm Funkel , who does not want to speak of an advantage over Aue , just because the game of the Saxons in Heidenheim had to be cancelled prematurely because of a storm .	-5.7915
" Now they can start the season with a home game , " said Funkel and Hoffmann believes that the players from Aue might even be a little fresher , because they would not have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against an ascent favorite in the bones .	-7.2894
" But they don 't know where they are at present " , says the interior defender of Fortuna .	-4.8549
The guests from the Rhineland as a light favourite will meet on Sunday in the final ( almost ) finished stadium of Aue .	-5.9272
" The fact that we are sweeping them away simply because we are entitled to come under the first six is blasphemy , " says Funkel , whose balance sheet is very positive in only one defeat against Aue from nine games .	-7.6357
" There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga that must be beaten in advance , " says Fortunas Chefcoach .	-4.7426
" To make such a statement would be arrogant and exaggerated " .	-3.1727
And so Funkel doesn 't want to experience its players on Sunday .	-5.2822
New findings of the Swedish Asylum Age Assessment Tests	-11.4290
The recent results of tests on asylum seekers in Sweden , which have been subjected to a new method of medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 % of the people tested are older than 18 years , but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .	-5.5513
The Swedish Forensic Medicine Authority ( Rättsmedicinalverket ) has started carrying out the tests last year .	-3.6913
They should make the assessment of age more accurate during the asylum procedure , after the Swedish Migration Authority ( Migration Reduction ) has been criticised for errors in assessing the correct age of some of the refugees who have been underage .	-7.4951
To date , Migration Verket has sent 6.880 cases to be tested and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31st July 2017 .	-4.7676
Eighty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the person was " possibly 18 years or older " .	-3.9645
In 432 cases , the conclusion was that the person " may be under 18 years of age " .	-2.4608
The tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .	-3.2396
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency , the results have been consistent in recent months .	-2.7160
" We see no big difference in statistics of recent months , the numbers are quite constant , " he said to the magazine The Local .	-3.7765
The high proportion of cases in which the person was judged to be over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker lied above his age .	-3.7806
In May , the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases that ' suggest that the person investigated was 18 years or older ' .	-4.1974
When Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results , she found that in 243 of these cases , the person had frankly said that she would be 18 years old this year .	-4.3470
The method of medical age assessment , in which x-rays of wisdom teeth and MRT images of knee joints are taken , which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists , has also been criticized in some areas .	-5.7954
A skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute , whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of humans to see if they went through puberty sooner or later than usual .	-4.3914
" I had reason to think about it and I do not think that the type of measurement should be used .	-2.3808
Judging biological age in this way is very uncertain .	-2.7616
If we cannot say it safely , we should not pretend that we could , " he said to the newspaper Metro .	-3.9870
Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of the tests : " In general , you can say that the risk of judging a child as an adult is low .	-3.4908
The biggest risk is if the person is under 18 , in this case it is about 10 % . '	-4.5004
Full in Plan	-2.1299
Work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well .	-2.9907
On Wednesday , a seven tonne heavy concrete section was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach .	-10.9148
" We are very good at the time , it is running super , " says Reinhold Leicht , construction manager at the department of road and traffic at the government headquarters of Freiburg .	-5.6937
In April , the work started simultaneously on all three bridges in need of renovation between Schramberg and Lauterbach .	-4.0464
The construction is scheduled for October and it is easy to be sure that the timetable will be met .	-5.6996
The first bridge , coming from Schramberg , leads over the Trombach .	-2.9108
It is a vaulted concrete arch bridge covered with red stained brick and has a total length of 4.80 meters .	-5.1688
It was built in 1900 .	-1.1401
Like the other two bridges , it has come into the years .	-3.8035
In order to ensure stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated .	-4.4025
The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach .	-2.5338
They are made of red brick .	-2.7892
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve or 10.60 meters long .	-3.2896
On Wednesday morning , the bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach received a 1.30 m wide and seven tons of heavy bridge cap on the north .	-5.7419
This is a side fixing , which is also used as an operating route .	-5.7793
On the southern part of the bridge a 2.20 meter wide bridge cap is to be used on Friday .	-4.5025
This is where the pedestrian path should go .	-5.0114
The special thing is that it is finished parts , a patent of the Schramberg company Dizwo .	-4.6660
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps .	-2.5672
Particular sensitivity has required the laying of lines through the building in Lauterbach .	-5.3346
There is also a fiber optic cable , to which many companies are connected .	-4.1925
In the run-up to the work , the residents were informed about the project by .	-5.0147
In addition , fish and cancer had to be fished .	-3.9202
For the bridges between the Bauhofbauhaus building and the Collegemelweiher in the direction of Schramberg , traffic is regulated by a traffic light .	-6.1118
For the construction work on the bridge at the Lauterbach entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels " Tannenhof " and " Seven Linden " is fully closed .	-4.9511
The combined cost of the three bridges is EUR 700 000 .	-2.9666
The whole thing is financed by the country .	-3.0101
AfD in Gerolstein : Bund in German potato salad	-3.2050
It is not so common for parties to pull together , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( AfD ) , it comes together , which otherwise is difficult to reconcile .	-5.4756
The parties represented in the Kreistag Vulkaneifel ( CDU , SPD , Grüne , FDP , FWG , Left ) belong to a broad alliance , which on this day shows peacefully the flag , because the AfD in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle Rondell invites to the " big campaign kick-start " according .	-7.2107
And well known names - like Alice Weidel , who , together with Alexander Gauland , is the top duo for the federal election on September 24 , and the deputy president Beatrix of Storch .	-6.2072
But those who are already on the ground hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the AfD-experts , but to demonstrate .	-5.4913
The motto " The Eifel remains colorful " .	-2.6511
Originally the City Picnick was planned under the motto " All at a Table " on the Brunnenplatz , but now takes place in the parking lot below the Rondell - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the Stadthalle .	-6.9607
A colorful picture that can be seen .	-4.4879
And what Christa Karoli , chairman of the Forum Eine Welt and one of the leading organizers , is really pleased : " Great how many people have met here " .	-6.2177
There is music and a lot of food , including a " primeval German potato salad , which the AfD could eat easily " , says the woman who brought him with him .	-5.3136
The police have ordered many officials to Gerolstein , and it shows presence mainly at the station , which is just a few metres from the venues .	-6.2173
How did the AfD actually come to Gerolstein ?	-1.5820
Mario Hompes from the AfD Vulkaneifel reports that he has tried to attend such an event and received the award .	-5.6340
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had initially asked in Daun for a cancellation because of the already built Laurentiuskirmes .	-6.3231
Now the Rondell , Hompes is pleased that " we can have such a nice event here " .	-3.4089
Looking at the event at the Rondelvorplatz , he says : " This is the right of the people , the main thing , it remains peaceful " .	-5.2230
This is also the case : at 8 p.m. on Rondellvorplatz a band provides entertainment , and in the Stadthalle various speakers , including Rheinland-Pfälzische AfD-Chairman Uwe Junge .	-7.5714
There are about 200 listeners in the Chamber who are waiting for the top candidate for the federal election , Alice Weidel , and the deputy president , Beatrix von Storch , to make their speeches .	-5.6228
The police presence is unchanged , but so far the officials have had a quiet evening .	-8.1245
The AfD-Event lasts a little more than an hour , the guests on the square have a longer breath , but there too is planned to clean up shortly after 9 pm .	-7.4882
The police can move away - no special events .	-3.8171
Trombone Meets Trompet	-3.8737
In the series Haslacher Klosterkonzerte tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 pm in the Klosterkirche , there is a rehearsal with the wolf trombonist Frederic Belli .	-7.0646
Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov he gives a concert under the motto " Black Sea meets Black Forest " , or also " Balkan folklore " meets a classical German training with roots in the brass music .	-4.2779
Both soloists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and hold solo positions in top European orchestras .	-3.3637
Petkov is solotrompeter at the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is the solo artist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra .	-3.6378
Both combine the desire not only to cross the boundaries of their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres .	-4.3237
For example , Johann Sebastian Bach performs both in a new style and in a new style , Daniel Schnyder 's " World Music " combines with Bulgarian folklore , and in the play " Exchange Suite " by the Jazzecho Prize winner Nils Wogram , classical music , jazz and free play combine to form a fascinating piece of art .	-8.9736
This core of the programme was premiered only this spring with huge success in Freiburg .	-3.2784
The renowned composer Nils Wogram has written it especially for the two musicians and even more so : the Haslach monastery church with its special acoustics is deliberately included in the concert .	-5.3586
Kristen Stewart talks about bisexuality	-1.5929
" Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives .	-2.2946
But I want to try it out , " says Kristen Stewart quite openly about her bisexuality .	-3.6353
'When I bite in grilled cheese , I think : ' Oh that was cool , what comes next ? '	-4.3152
The Hollywood star 's best known relationship was that of her twin colleague Robert Pattinson , who eventually got bitter apart .	-6.1565

In particular , they don 't like to explain their love life to the public : " People expect you to behave in a certain way and that annoys me .	-4.3895

. West Virginia ’ s Democratic Governor Jim Justice announced on Thursday evening , in a rally with President Trump , that he would change the party .	-3.4577
Whether you like it or not , the Democrats have moved away from me , " said Governor Justice .	-2.6684

The rally broke out in jubilation .	-3.1462

In the meantime , on Thursday evening , the Republican National Committee made a statement saying : ' Governor Justice 's change is another blow to a Democratic Party that would prevent us rather than work to make our country great again ' .	-5.1143
" With only 15 governors and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement by Governor Justice is only the last rejection of a party that is out of leadership from top to bottom and unable to find a positive , unifying message , " said RNC Chairman Ronna McDaniel in a statement the CBS News .	-5.6195
Coe praises ' honest ' Russian apology for doping scandal	-1.9138
The global leader of athletics , Sebastian Coe , praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious apology from Russia to a doping scandal , but he repeated that it was not the time for the country to be reinstated in sport .	-5.1050
Russia ’ s athletic leader Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Championships that his country ’ s ban from sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping .	-10.5391
He said he was sorry for " all athletes who were snapped gold and silver medals in competitions " .	-5.2942
Despite his comments , the IAAF Congress voted in favour of maintaining the ban imposed in November 2015 , after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia .	-3.2652
" I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , " said IAAF President Coe to reporters .	-2.1945
'The entire Council and Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognised itself that it has experienced some fairly hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the federation is redesigned ' .	-5.6014
Coe said that he was also " pleased " that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction .	-3.2273
" I think it was a very constructive day , and I think progress has been made , but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to reinstate Russia , " said Coe .	-3.5323
" We must do everything in the coming months to normalise this situation .	-2.7383
The guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate clean athletes from the spoiled system , ' he added .	-2.9387
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete as neutral players in the World Athletics Championships that will start in London on Friday , according to the strict IAAF criteria .	-5.2968
The head of the IAAF-Task Force , Rune Andersen , said on Monday that Russia still has to meet some of the criteria for reinstatement .	-3.5704

The ceremony took place on Thursday in the Cathedral City under high security measures .	-3.6203
On the still unexplained crash , Secretary of Defense Ursula of the Leyen ( CDU ) said nothing .	-7.1873

At midday only the family left the church .	-3.9354
After that , the funeral began in the family circle , close friends , representatives of the Bundeswehr and politics .	-5.1977
Hessen ’ s prime minister Volker Bouffier ( CDU ) and the general inspector of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker were also included .	-3.7759
Fearful guests laid down roses , the relatives stood arm in arm on the coffins .	-5.3201
In front of the church , Fritzlarer and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas .	-7.2210
Defense Minister of the Leyen described the killed soldiers as " highly decorated " and experienced .	-5.2671
The Chief of Staff helped build the flight operation of the combat helicopter Tiger in Fritzlar and was one of the first six trained tiger pilots of his regiment .	-5.2429
Volker Bauersachs , the commander of the regime to which the soldiers belong , also said : " If this crew could not avert the crash , then no one would have been able to do so " .	-11.4148
Doubts about the UN mission in Mali did not show the Leyen Minister : the deployment was dangerous .	-3.8624
But it is also of great importance ' for a country from which we are only separated by two states ' , she said .	-3.7465
After the funeral , the coffins were brought from the cathedral .	-3.2113
When and where they are buried , the Bundeswehr did not provide any information .	-4.1504
Prince Henrik does not want a grave next to his wife .	-2.3134
The man of the Danish Queen Margrethe ( 77 ) , Prince Henrik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried beside his wife after his death .	-2.5903
The Royal House shared that on Thursday .	-3.7553
Traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the Cathedral Church of Roskilde .	-4.6088
The sculptor Bj<unk>rn N<unk>rgaard already made a sarcophagus for the two .	-2.5634
The queen agreed with her husband ’ s decision , as the communication continued .	-5.0858
Where Prince Henrik is buried , it is still unclear .	-2.1202
But he does not intend to be buried in his French homeland .	-3.2256
Prince Henrik had never made a heel out of the fact that he was not happy with his title .	-3.1289
After the throne ascent of his wife Margrethe in 1972 , he would have liked to have become king . , , , , , , , , , , . , , ,	-7.5084
In 2016 , he retired , with the title " prince-mate " .	-5.8695
Since Henrik did not get the title and function he wanted in Denmark , he does not consider himself equal to his wife - even after death , Lene Balleby , the chief speaker of the Danish royal house , declared .	-6.4309
Where the last retirement place of the 83-year-old will ultimately be , it is still unclear .	-4.8371
However , he does not intend to be buried in his French home country , but in Denmark .	-7.4175
He likes the country he has worked for over 50 years .	-2.1240

He worked on the Thames in the French Embassy .	-2.2930
While his later wife always flew popular sympathies , Prince Henrik had a difficult stand with the Danes in his almost 50 years of reign .	-6.0605
In an autobiography Henrik said about the first years in Denmark : " A few months after my arrival , everything I did was criticized .	-3.4361
My Danish was volatile , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk stockings instead of knitting socks , Citro<unk>n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .	-2.8061

Prime Minister Weil ’ s New Election	-3.3149
CDU and FDP before a possible majority in Lower Saxony	-2.5079
Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) of Lower Saxony is in favour of a speedy re-election of the country after the loss of the red-green majority , but he does not want to resign .	-5.1636
Because , on Friday , Parliament was in favour of disbanding .	-8.7766
Prior to that , the surprising departure of a Green MEP from her rural faction in Lower Saxony had plunged Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) ’ s government into a severe crisis .	-4.9359
Five months before the official election date , the red-green coalition in Hanover lost its narrow one-vote majority in parliament to the opposition from the CDU and the FDP .	-3.8091
The former Green MEP Elke Twesten founded her move by non-nominating for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg ( Wümme ) .	-10.4732
" I see my political future in the CDU , " she explained on Friday in Hannover .	-2.0320
CDU group leader Björn Thümler wishes to recommend that his group accept them .	-3.7751
This means that the CDU and FDP together have 69 seats in the Lower Saxony parliament , the SPD and the Greens with 68 seats .	-5.5400
So far , the relationship has been reversed .	-1.8563
The new Landtag will be elected regularly on 14 January next year .	-3.8399
Thümler said that the red-green state government must now decide whether it can continue to govern without a majority in this situation .	-3.9157
Stephan Weil , however , considers it essential that the day of the country should decide its own solution as quickly as possible .	-5.7143
The CDU Group is expected to decide on how to proceed on Tuesday .	-2.8547
The constitution also provides for the possibility that the country ’ s day will deprive the prime minister of confidence and elect a successor .	-5.1430
" Our constitution offers several options .	-1.5778
These possibilities need to be examined legally , " Thümler said .	-5.2991
'All questions will be discussed calmly if they are legally properly examined ' .	-4.9581
Thümler called Twelen 's step " but somewhat curious " .	-4.2237
The politician herself stressed : " I am not a traitor .	-2.6127
I feel very good " .	-1.4936
She called herself a follower of black and green .	-3.7899
The Greens called on the dissident Members to return their country mandate .	-4.4927
" Of course , we assume that she will return with immediate effect her Landtag mandate , which she has received via the green country list , " said the national chairmen Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner .	-6.9031
The chairmen of the Green Group , Anja Piel , said : ' We regret Elke Twesten 's decision extraordinarily ' .	-4.9600
She has deliberately chosen not to hold a debate in the group .	-3.2004
'Even in the absence of any differences in content , we cannot understand this step ' .	-4.6289
SPD Chancellor Martin Schulz condemns the resignation of the Lower Saxon Green MEP Elke Twesten to the CDU as a betrayal .	-4.7929
" The behaviour of the former Green MEPs in Lower Saxony is not only betrayal of the voters , but also betrayal of the Red Green , " wrote the German Social Democrats on Friday on Facebook .	-5.0191
He supports Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) ’ s decision to quickly re-elect the country ’ s day .	-3.1141
Leaving Twenty costs the majority Red Green in Lower Saxony .	-4.1727
The politician " put her personal interests before the good of the country in her hurt vanity and in her frustration , " criticized SPD Secretary-General Hubertus Heil .	-4.5591
" It is scandalous that the CDU in Lower Saxony is taking part in this dirty intrigue game and is trying to make political capital out of it " .	-3.9255
Niedersachsen ’ s CDU group leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend that his fellow MEPs include Elke Twelen in the CDU .	-5.6333
The SPD ’ s leader in the Bundestag , Thomas Oppermann , accused Twelve of falsifying the outcome of the 2013 Landtag election with personal career prospects .	-5.4609

Agriculture Minister in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from poisonous eggs , Mr Schmidt ?	-3.0766
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs .	-0.8167
How could the scandal happen ?	-2.0904
How can consumers protect themselves .	-1.0682
Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt ( CSU ) is in interview with the German editorial network ( RND ) .	-3.7725
Mr Schmidt , how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs ?	-1.9039
I can only encourage all consumers to look closely at the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp print .	-3.4451
On the consumer protection portal www.Gro<unk>warnung.de , the Federal States provide the latest information on the egg batches concerned .	-5.7907
Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .	-1.9695
Even if , according to everything we know at the moment , a health hazard is practically excluded .	-8.3796
Is Aldi now taking the best possible crisis response - all the eggs out of supply - because the Federal Minister of Agriculture is not really aware of the central role of the enlightener ?	-6.0684
Food surveillance is the responsibility of the federal states .	-3.4930
Nevertheless , my House has immediately opened itself up and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of Germany 's concern .	-6.3787
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers .	-2.1307
Trade , like manufacturers , must ensure that the products sold are viable and safe to health .	-4.8066
If the maximum residue content of 0.005mg / kg is exceeded for eggs , they are not usable .	-5.0504
However , unloaded eggs can be sold and consumed .	-2.5841
This time , businesses are not to blame .	-2.8446
Are manufacturing companies and consumers sitting in the same boat ?	-2.7068
According to current knowledge , production companies are not directly to blame .	-4.3678
Instead , they must face economic damage as a result of alleged illegal practices by service companies .	-9.1120
As always , there are too few controllers in the event of an emergency .	-3.3239
Is it only a lack of staff or of coherent competence ?	-4.5637
It was the official controls that exposed the process .	-3.8757
However , the truth is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded 100 % .	-3.3834
It is precisely for this reason that it is essential to provide consistent information on such events and to hand over them to prosecutors in cases where criminal offences may occur .	-8.0200
I have already made it clear on a number of occasions that I expect the authorities responsible to be fully informed .	-4.3653
Is regular alarm about food scandals really necessary ?	-2.1949
Consumers have the right to receive only safe and transportable food .	-3.5986
If an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly outraged .	-2.7031
The money that has been spent has put manufacturers , traders and consumers in a situation that is absolutely unnecessary .	-5.7514
In principle , it must be clear that the illegal use of the insecticide Fipronil in the attitude of food suppliers is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately .	-5.0287
This needs to be worked on consistently and with high pressure at all levels .	-3.7291
I expect all the competent authorities to clarify the matter quickly and completely .	-4.3728
The impact of football ’ s financial rules on Neymar ’ s move to Paris	-2.1972
The rules aimed at preventing unfettered spending by European football clubs will not disturb Neymar ’ s world record transfer from Spain ’ s Barcelona to the French Paris-Germain .	-5.1976
Any consequences will come from UEFA for Paris Saint-Germain , because the leading organisation that has supervised the European game has the power to ban teams from accessing the prestigious Champions-League tournament .	-6.2417
Financial fair play rules , launched in 2011 by UEFA , mean that PSG will eventually have to prove that the transfer of Neymar was financed without big losses .	-4.1151
Barcelona has paid EUR 222 million ( $ 262 million ) to buy the Brazilian out of his contract , and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several tens of millions of dollars a year . will . will , , , , , , , , , .	-7.8124
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar 's move to France .	-1.1714
PSG can certainly make money easier for Neymar to sign and bring it into a galaxy of other stars , given the team ’ s funding by the energetic Qatar ruling family .	-5.6457
Clubs may spend a lot of money on acquiring players , but they must counteract legitimate revenue sources that allow them to break the Eve point in their soccer related business .	-6.7110
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA president in 2007 .	-2.7708
Former French players believed that clubs that had taken huge debts in their quest for success would effectively deceive and risk ruining themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support .	-4.4413
In 2011 , FFP shifted from focusing on club debt to monitoring its losses .	-1.9541
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a tougher issue .	-3.8958
During the current three-year FFP period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses of € 30 million .	-3.9267
And , while Platini was disgraced by the presidency in 2015 , his UEFA successor , Aleksander Ceferin , remains committed to discouraging excessive spending .	-3.6772
" Certainly FFP is not dead and we will certainly strengthen the rules for the future , " said Andrea Traverso , who is responsible for FFP at UEFA , to The Associated Press last week .	-3.0177
Although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a lump sum , it can distribute the amount for invoicing over the duration of its contract .	-4.6491
Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the redeeming sum of EUR 44.4 million for the next five years can be reported in the annual accounts .	-5.0648
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 hit the PSG , together with Abu Dhabi , owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions .	-2.9952
The PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million ( $ 82 million at the time ) , which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions-League of the 2014 / 15 season should be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players .	-5.8864
UEFA is looking for clubs that might try to outperform their financial supervision by inflating revenue from companies associated with club owners .	-5.2344
While a Catholic company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsorship exceeded the standard market rates , UEFA would not allow this to be considered legitimate income .	-5.3968
This was exactly what happened in 2014 , when UEFA decided that the value of PSA sponsorship was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .	-3.0730
It has been reported that some of the PSG payments to Neymar could be made to Qatar by the World Trade Organization Committee in 2022 .	-4.2122
But PSG and Qatar in 2022 have denied that Neymar will become World Cup ambassadors , and that such a maneuver for UEFA regulators could easily be found .	-4.2028
The previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules .	-3.2045
UEFA did not have any preparatory discussions with PSG about Neymar 's Transfer , said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .	-4.6135
They spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity , because they were not empowered to discuss the PSG situation .	-3.2031
The latest reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 , with sales of 542.4 million euros , achieved a profit of more than EUR 10 million .	-4.9308
The accounts for the last fiscal year are still to be published .	-2.7670
PSG expects Neymar ’ s arrival to be a boon for sponsorship deals , merchandising , and jersey sales .	-2.2318
The association expects sales to increase by at least 30 percent after signing .	-3.5059
The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players going , and it tried to prevent Neymar ’ s move by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP .	-3.6686
" It is a clear case of " financial doping " with the club and the state , " said the President of the La League , Javier Tebas , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar 's eventual ownership of PSG .	-3.2769
Arsenal Manager Arsene Wenger , whose association is owned by an American sports team , shares the reservations of La League against a state that finances an association .	-4.4121
" It is the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , " said Wenger on Thursday .	-2.9455
" As soon as a country has a club , everything is possible .	-7.4563
It will be very difficult to respect financial fair play , because you can go different ways or have different interests when a country has such a large player to represent a country . '	-4.8498
Swiss is Searching for a New Schogglie	-4.7541
In recent years , Chocolat has produced Frey Bord chocolate for the Swiss .	-2.8690
Now sweet cooperation is about to end : the airline rewrites the order .	-5.2084
Swiss-Sprecherin Meike Fuhlrott confirmed on request of the news agency sda a corresponding report of Friday 's newspaper " Northwest Switzerland " .	-4.8808
According to current plans , the airline will sign a new contract in the first half of 2018 .	-3.1222
The products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .	-3.2035
" We are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolat Frey , " said the speaker .	-2.2797
Approximately 17 million small , red-white chocolate panels to 14 grams each year distribute the cabin crew to passengers before landing .	-6.9189
Swiss did not want to provide information about the costs .	-3.1492
Industry insiders estimate the order volume according to " Northwest Switzerland " to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Migros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around one billion francs .	-5.8745
But the advertising effect is all the more important : it is a prestigious contract for a Schoggier manufacturer .	-5.6240
The Swiss does not want to reveal how many applicants there are for the new tender .	-4.6766
However , only Swiss manufacturers are eligible .	-3.1568
According to the newspaper report , Chocolat Frey wants to renew the treaty beyond spring 2018 .	-3.9286
For the sda the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion .	-3.0779
The Swiss has been distributing chocolate tables on board their flights since 2006 .	-3.1703
Before the Swiss concluded a contract with Migros ’ daughter , Barry Callebaut had delivered the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hug .	-3.8579
Swiss introduced the possibility of placing the logo two and a half years ago with the start of cooperation with Chocolat Frey .	-3.6228
The airline cooperates with various Swiss chocolate producers .	-2.0227
On long-haul flights , First Class customers are pampered with delicacies from the Confiserie Sprüngli , in the Business Class wet passengers Schoggi of Lindt and in the Economy Class Schoggi of Chocolat Frey .	-5.2000
Swiss Schoggi is also distributed in Business and Economy Class by Chocolat Frey .	-4.5488

Nostalgia goes into the niche of Wet Hot American Summer and Comrade Detective .	-3.2116
This repetition of history is nostalgic at the same time because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80s , for the 90-year Grunge era ( when the thinkers David Wain and Michael Showalter shot the Sketch comedy " The State " for MTV ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , such as Elizabeth Banks , Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to bigger things .	-6.1711
As a cultural artefact , it is equally a parody and embodiment of our Facebook capable era of permanent memories .	-3.1565
But as a franchise , it feels as if time is running out .	-8.4876
" First Day of Camp " worked surprisingly well , not only because of its absurd humour ( it contained an original story for a talking can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .	-3.3944
By sticking to the core of the gag - middle-aged actors play horny children who will grow up - they nevertheless made it impossible to win back the last part of the joke .	-11.0581
" Ten Years Later " , with its adults now playing , is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more according to the casting cane principle , including a reef on the Stalker films of the 1990s such as " The Hand That Rocks the Cradle " .	-5.3089
At one point , a character explores through an Apple Powerbook , some inline skates and " a number of other things from 1991 " .	-4.1291
Many of the central stories are the same .	-1.2725
The loving Coop ( Mr. Showalter ) , now a novelist , has still not forgotten Katie ( Marguerite Moreau ) .	-4.3573
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost his virginity .	-1.5550
And there is another crazy malicious plot involving Ronald Reagan ( also Mr. Showalter ) , now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good impression of Michael Ian Black ) .	-5.0252
As always , the excursions are the best part of the franchise .	-5.6758
It is a lot of fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rudd , who shows Matt Dillon 's Unterlippenbart by " Singles " , whose former Big Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old cracker .	-5.4946
It is the moments of random madness that could fuel this franchise like a kind of repetitive " Seven Up ! " series until it reaches what I consider to be his logical conclusion : " Wet Hot American Summer : Twenty Years Later " , the last scene of which will show the band how to visit the film premiere of " Wet Hot American Summer " .	-5.6729
" Comrade Detective " in Amazon is now reminiscent of another kind of nostalgia : the revival of the Cold War of " The Americans " , the film " Atomic Blonde " , and even " GLOW " with its East to West ringfight iconography .	-5.2902
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as director suggests to be a television series found : a Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two policemen as friends , two officers from Bucharest fighting for truth , atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism .	-4.6396
The main roles - a hard-hitted Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici , whose dialogues are synchronized by Channing Tatum ( also an executive producer ) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English .	-4.3304
It is a brilliant idea .	-1.2570
But it is not much more than an idea .	-1.5253
There are some nice gags to see ( the police spend the time watching chess on television , as Americans might do with football ) .	-4.7426
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate , Nick Offerman , Mahershala Ali and Chlo<unk> Sevigny - ensures a decent game of ' Find the Voice Out ' .	-3.2335
But " Comrade Detective " is so committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer carrying a Reagan mask is included - that it often plays like one .	-4.2193
Six long episodes have gone , and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough .	-4.4298
" Comrade Detective " , which has been revised to a smaller length , could better deliver its agitprop satire , as Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the American Embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men devouring a bunch of hamburgers .	-7.4037
The message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can make everything a fodder for a gelage .	-3.8991
The fictitious Romanian creators were not wrong : we even do it with our own recent history and with their own .	-3.5341

On Wednesday morning , in the Schwarzwald-Baar district , in Rottweil , Konstanz , Esslingen and Stuttgart , numerous objects were searched , as the Konstanz Public Prosecutor announced on Friday .	-4.3591
15 people were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 , and arrest warrants were already issued .	-5.1902
In addition , officials secured larger quantities of marijuana and cocaine , firearms and several hundred thousand euros .	-3.6009
Two people were arrested at the same time in Italy .	-3.2365
German arrest warrants were issued against the two suspects of Italians .	-2.5382
The two are therefore presumably shipped to Germany .	-3.6265
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action .	-2.4334
In total , more than 300 police officers were in operation . were . . were . . were . were , .	-6.8463
The members of the Mafia are accused of organised drug crime , serious acts of violence , attempted murder , robbery and blackmail .	-3.9774
Since the summer of 2016 , the Konstanz Prosecutor ’ s Office has been investigating the organised drug trade in southern Germany .	-4.7357
Between the prosecutors in Konstanz and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investigators of Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .	-4.2377
Therefore , on Wednesday morning , four Palermo officials accompanied the large-scale operation .	-5.7573
The investigation was aimed mainly at Italian nationals with close reference to the Italian mafia .	-5.4183
Also an incident on 27 May in Hüfingen , where several shots were fired into a restaurant early in the morning , is likely to go to the account of the band .	-6.3522
Wrong the Foreign Register ’ s Big	-4.2510
" Data from citizens who should not appear there " : according to a report , the Foreign Register in Germany has serious shortcomings .	-5.4268
This leads to some serious mistakes in asylum procedures .	-3.2902
According to a media report , the Federal Government ’ s Refugee Management Officer , Frank-Jürgen Weise , has drawn attention to major gaps in the Foreign Central Register .	-5.3894
In the case of asylum procedures and deportations , deficiencies in the data registered there could lead " to some serious mistakes " , warned way in an analysis presented by the " Süddeutsche Zeitung " .	-6.4620
According to the figures , the register covers ten million people with foreign nationality , including some 5.7 million from non-EU countries .	-5.1505
The data is thus administered by approximately 600 foreign authorities in Germany .	-3.7900
Because the data had not been adequately maintained , some data quality has not been good .	-4.6851
In individual cases , data from 1921 were found , ' by people who have long since ceased to live , or by citizens who have become German citizens and should not appear in the register ' .	-5.4340
" Flawed data input can slow down returns considerably , " the report continues .	-4.7624
Moreover , statistics on expatriate people include EU citizens who do not have to leave .	-4.9550
However , such false assignments led to ' a distorted debate on the handling of expatriates ' , as the analysis says .	-6.9009
Meanwhile , the Federal Government seems to have begun to send refugee families with children under 16 years old back to Italy once they have entered from there .	-5.5404
This is evident from an internal paper by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees ( BAMF ) , the " Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung " reports .	-3.7651
The paper therefore states that the BAMF has been carrying out such procedures " on families with children - with the exception of infants and infants - to Italy since 1 June 2017 " .	-5.4121
This has been virtually impossible since the end of 2014 , according to the newspaper , pointing out the difficult situation on the ground .	-4.0924
Under the Dublin Agreement , refugees are the responsibility of the EU state they first reach .	-3.5243
If a migrant travels to another EU country , that state can return him to the country of entry .	-3.4079
To justify this , the office writes : ' Meanwhile , the absorption capacity for families with underage children in Italy has increased considerably ' .	-5.6709
Italy has given guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families .	-2.6808
Even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECHR ) considers these commitments to be sufficient .	-2.8014
Other EU states would also send refugees back there under the Dublin Agreement .	-2.6576
The German left-wing spokesperson in the Bundestag , Ulla Jelpke , criticized this decision : " Families with children are threatened with unlawful reception conditions and a threat to the welfare of children because of the shortcomings of the Italian asylum system " .	-6.2029
The Second Best Result	-3.3918
A total of 220 litres of blood from people living in Oberreichenbach was already available to other people .	-4.4399
At least of the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .	-3.3763
Primarily Jürgen Greule , who with his 100 donations now shared 50 litres of blood .	-5.2803
Traditionally , at the municipal council meeting , the community acknowledges the multiple willingness to donate blood .	-4.8965
" It is ingenious how our body is designed for this , and we pay tribute to the donors who provide their blood to strangers , and also unselfish , " said Mayor Karlheinz Kistner .	-6.7181
" A single blood donation helps several people , " explained Holger Maisenbacher , the head of the German Red Cross ( DRK ) , because the canned are broken into their components .	-7.2120
For example , three people could benefit from a blood donation .	-3.9924
At the same time , Maisenbacher reported about the actions that were carried out in the spring in Oberreichenbach .	-4.2411
" This year we achieved the second best result with 114 donors , " said the DRK Regional Coordinator .	-4.3531
Obviously , a few years ago , the change to the theatre house led to higher numbers of participants .	-5.0103
Already before that , Thomas Bockstadt , Susanne Reichle , Sandra Schöck , Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiple donors and were awarded for 50 blood donations each .	-4.3626
Half so many Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger recorded , while Tamara Pframmer , Petra Schleeh , Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter gave off their life juice ten times a 500 millilitres .	-5.9726
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25 %	-1.1858
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and the weakening of inflation have dampened speculation about an increase .	-3.7032
The Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain " sluggish " when it maintained interest rates on family incomes in the midst of increasing pressure .	-3.6515
The Bank ’ s monetary committee ( MPC ) policymakers voted 6-to-2 to keep interest rates to 0.25 % , with fewer members seeking an increase this month , as weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase .	-4.6427
In its quarterly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts to 1.7 % in 2017 and 1.6 % in 2018 , warning that fiscal pressure would continue , with inflation expected to rise to just under 3 % in the autumn .	-3.7259
But it signaled that , in the coming years , interest-rate hikes would be needed to curb Brexit ’ s fueled inflation , and it said that borrowing costs may have to rise more than expected in financial markets .	-4.8285
Members also voted to withdraw part of the Mammut stimulus package issued a year ago after Brexit .	-2.7842
It will demand time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funding for banks from next February , although it has been said that it is now expected to provide GBP 15 billion more under this system - with GBP 115 billion sterling .	-5.0588
minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : " In the central prediction of the MPC , gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak in the short term , as pressure on real household incomes continues to burden consumption . "	-5.3827
At interest rates , she repeated that " a certain tightening of monetary policy " would be necessary to cool inflation and a " slightly larger " extent than markets expect .	-10.7243
Markets are predicting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .	-2.9105
However , the Bank stressed that increases would be ' gradual ' and ' limited ' .	-2.8730
The Bank ’ s downward adjusted growth forecasts for this and next year are relative to the 1.9 % and 1.7 % projected in May .	-3.8702
It has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .	-2.2679
The pound fell against the dollar and the euro after these news .	-2.6497
The pound fell by 0.5 % to $ 1.31 and fell by 0.4 % to € 1.11 .	-2.1215
The decision does not change after the recent disappointing growth figures have dampened rising expectations for an interest-rate hike , and GDP rose from 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % in the second quarter .	-4.9974
Growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , even though it will recover slightly by the end of the year .	-3.8423
The latest inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and marginal wage increases , as tightening becomes worse before it improves .	-5.5526
It added that monetary policy cannot " prevent " the fall in income over the next few years , but it added that wages will " clearly " recover at the end of their three-year forecast .	-4.6738
The economy is also boosted by rising demand for British goods , owing to the weak pound , which will compensate for part of lower consumer spending .	-3.5799
The decision comes one year after the fall in interest rates to 0.25 % last August , following the shocking EU vote that caused the pound to fall .	-3.5640
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years for this to fully achieve prices and the economy .	-3.6529
Before the Bank ’ s last judgment on interest rates , the call for an increase in interest rates had risen , as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households , with three policymakers demanding an increase of 0.5 % in July .	-4.3158
Inflation fell last month from 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % , even though the bank said it was expected to do so and it will resume its activity in the coming months .	-5.4309
The Bank said that exceeding the 2 % target would be " entirely " to the weak pound .	-4.6719
Andrew Montlake , director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers , said : " Given the recent decline in the swap rates , the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again , because lenders are looking loudly for business and want to end the year in a positive way .	-5.5282
The market looks particularly good for those who run out of existing deals and complete the new mortgages , and many with toll-free options and low rates are becoming more popular . '	-5.7473
NHS ( National Health Service ) is supposed to prescribe controversial HIV drugs to 10,000 people .	-2.7943
Patients will gain access to a " transformative " HIV prevention treatment from September , following a fight in front of the High Court against funding the drug in the NHS .	-5.3286
NHS England announced that a pre-sexual preexposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) that can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by about 86 % is now delivered by the health service through a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people .	-5.1446
He agreed to finance the process after last year 's Court of Appeal confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court that the NHS had the power to pay for PrEP despite the claim that local authorities should finance it .	-4.7570
The move announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England-CEO Simon Stevens as a " important new intervention " , while the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) called this a " decisive moment " .	-5.4387
Sexual health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool , and Sheffield will be among the first to allow people to register , and other clinics will follow in October , before it will be introduced across England in April 2018 .	-3.3119
Preexposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) is a result of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .	-3.1982
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in the case of infectious people .	-3.1888
Taking PrEP before sexual intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in a person 's body to prevent HIV infection .	-3.3704
Such medicines can be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse .	-3.1561
Those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men , transsexuals , and people with HIV positive partners who have not been treated successfully .	-3.3181
In clinics , appropriate participants are identified who agree to the study , including men , women , transgender , and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment .	-3.9184
People who live in England and are registered with a pediatrician may also register for participation in their local participating sex clinic .	-4.5088
The program will sign $ 10 million and NHS England signed a contract to deliver drugs this week following an international competitive procurement .	-3.0228
The study aims to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence , as it is targeted , recorded and implemented on a large scale .	-5.1773
Stevens said : " This major new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .	-3.0330
It is another milestone in more than three decades of ongoing progress in addressing one of humanity 's greatest health challenges . "	-4.2907
Deborah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National Aids Trust ) , said : " This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .	-2.2013
PrEP , if targeted at needy and vulnerable people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic .	-4.4899
From September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiations with a partner , which will lead to an improvement in many , many lives .	-5.6403
We warmly welcome this announcement ' .	-1.9133
Ian Green , Chairman of the Terrence Higgins Trust , said : " The priority now must be to ensure that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk to HIV is left behind .	-4.8004
Now that PrEP test medicine has been obtained , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 people infected with HIV . '	-3.9439
Sharon Hodgson , shadow health minister , said : " The beginning of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and hesitation by the government .	-3.3599
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection .	-3.0702
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP .	-2.9358
It is now important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected with HIV and that it will help us move a step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society ' .	-4.8914
Living the Great Living : The mezzanine and smart designer tricks have transformed this small Earls Court apartment into a generous home .	-5.3509
Joanne Leigh , a former banker with a passion for real estate , resigned from a large house in Knightsbridge in 2014 to an Earls Court apartment .	-2.6207
It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags .	-2.9269
" Before that I lived with my ex-husband in Knightsbridge in a much larger room , " says Joanne .	-3.7358
" I was looking for something comparable to my price .	-2.1244
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings .	-2.4466
I fell in love with them and made an offer on that day ' .	-2.6290
Since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely overtaken .	-3.8100
Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine floor to make the most of the generous ceiling height .	-4.9685
" I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .	-1.5477
That was my request , " she says .	-1.7144
To this end , she commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development , but also a place to live for Joanne .	-4.4403
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms above each other , so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine floor where one could stand .	-3.9911
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the preset .	-2.1718
" The steel mill is quite complicated , " he explains .	-2.7056
" We had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked on top of each other without us having to fall down .	-4.9302
It was not just a matter of building a simple platform , but of creating steel in such a way that it had the right height for the above or below function . "	-8.9499
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms in full height above each other - with much additional drama .	-4.8240
For the mezzanine , a classic copper light window of retrouvius overlooks the glamorous living area .	-4.7338
Spiegelte Goldmöbel , silberne Akzente und Vintage Serge Mouille Lichtung the style of .	-3.3363
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .	-1.9655
At both ends a short corridor is mirrored to allow it to work longer .	-3.5459
In the kitchen the mirror feels like a window in another room .	-4.0487
At the entrance mirrored units provide space for all Joanne bricks and glasses .	-2.7993
By perceiving a glamorous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .	-3.4956
Folding kitchens are nothing new .	-2.8246
What is special about this is that it is a garage door .	-3.1060
" A bit of engineering went in , " explains Erfan of the steel reinforced , venerated MDF door .	-4.0262
'It is counterweight , so that when you push the door , it glides very easily ' .	-4.0614
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space Joanne could gain an additional 16 m <unk> , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .	-3.6766
" At the end of the day , you will sell the base area - or how your property is appreciated , " says Erfan .	-4.0956
'In a rudimentary form , a real estate agent will enter and carry out a calculation based on the size of the land ' .	-3.7191
Here they have managed to enlarge the floor area and at the same time to use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage .	-6.1915
" The materials are the things you touch and which therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home , " says Erfan .	-4.0348
" You do not fall in love with the electric sockets in the walls .	-2.5858
These are important , but they do not play with your heart . '	-2.2980
It shows that an apartment can be transformed into something quite amazing by good design and increased square meters of something standard .	-4.6314
In fact , like Joanne , you could decide not to leave it .	-6.5866
Brothers Fight for a $ 500 million Real Estate Empire	-3.7748
Two brothers , four decades after their Italian family established the dynasty , are in a dispute over one of Victoria ’ s largest real-estate empires worth more than $ 500 million .	-4.3805
Former director of the ' Carlton Football Club ' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak , just three doors away from his younger brother Paul , who brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets should be shared .	-4.7012
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp argument about the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .	-4.7742
Together with her mother Anna , the brothers hold 38 homes worth more than half a billion dollars since the family bought a deal in Smith Street , Collingwood , in 1973 .	-4.1384
The Westco Jeans family founded there and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores .	-3.6466
It was sold for $ 85 million in 1999 .	-1.6544
This money has been invested in real estate , and the De Lutis portfolio now includes offices in the city centre , the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centers in the suburbs .	-4.5220
After an agreement with her late father , Colin - described by Paul as " the main operator and the dominant personality " in the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of corporate wealth and Paul about one-third .	-5.1065
A court case says that this means that Colin owns $ 316 million and Paul worth $ 176 million .	-3.8768
The distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .	-2.8477
" The divisions proposed by Colin left him with what I thought to be the best objects , " he wrote in a first affidavit in 2015 .	-3.1570
Last Friday , after several failed mediations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place .	-2.2650
The brothers are now also fighting for control of the existing business , which Colin , as Paul claims , has ruled out .	-4.7608
Colin argues that this is not true , but that Paul accuses him of managing some possessions incompetently .	-3.9301
In an early affidavit submitted by Colin , he says he hopes to resolve the dispute .	-2.7390
" My Italian heritage dictates that the family is the most important priority , " he wrote .	-2.5309
Costs are rising in the case of hundreds of affiliates , e-mails and reports from companies , including Deloitte , Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer , and leading lawyers , including Allan Myers , QC , and law firms held by both sides .	-4.7995
Mrs De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicatessen shops from the late 1950s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early 1970s .	-3.6331
They used the security to buy the Collingwood estate , where Colin opened the first jeans shop of the family .	-4.1481
Colin says he started Westco there when he was ' high school in my last years when Paul was a little child ( about 10 years old ) . '	-3.8083
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass on their property amicably to their sons .	-2.3004
" Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to go to court , " she wrote .	-2.7997
Two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies , with Colin claiming that Mark was paid $ 10 million and Luke $ 26 million when leaving the company .	-3.6726
Both Luke and Mark , Paul says , were bitter about the conditions of their financial separation .	-4.1871
Colin has been very reluctant , even though he was a former member of the AFL Board of Directors , and after a 2015 biography by Eddie McGuire , he was the best friend of the TV star .	-10.5654
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers .	-1.8117
Only Colin replied via SMS to say " I really can 't say much " because the case was before the courts .	-3.4253
" It is very , very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and take our family name through the courts , " he wrote .	-2.6935
In mid-2016 , Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to fulfill his brother ’ s demands .	-2.8513
" Our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end in our current dispute , " he said and added that he " still hope for a solution " .	-3.5824
On Friday , that hope seemed to be over .	-2.6158
" Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future , " Colin wrote .	-2.2726
Trump ’ s new chief of staff plans to curtail the president ’ s media abstinence .	-2.8608
Others tried it and failed .	-1.4131
Perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it .	-2.0114
If so , he will be the first .	-1.4557
Politicio reports that the White House ’ s new chief of staff is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Trump , including news media reports , in the hope of keeping the boss on a more uniform course .	-5.1653
Here is a piece by reporter Josh Dawsey :	-1.9630
" When John F. Kelly , the White House ’ s new chief of staff , met with senior executives on his first day , he posed a major problem in President Donald Trump ’ s White House that he wanted to repair : bad information that comes into the president ’ s hands .	-4.6649
Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he received good information . "	-4.2621
Kelly ’ s diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet .	-1.6140
President Trump ’ s relationship with television goes back decades – and now that he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong .	-3.6943
" If Trump was angry about unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting of posts to be persuaded , " said former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg in February .	-5.2605
Politicicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that " the key to keeping Trump 's Twitter habit under control , according to six former campaign officials , is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise . "	-4.1602
Okay .	-0.7805
But the idea that Trump ’ s Twitter habit has ever been “ under control ” is ridiculous .	-1.9692
Perhaps these campaign officials know something that we others do not know - that without their interventions , Trump ’ s tweets would have contained even more fuel .	-4.4374
We will probably never hear about the tweets Trump has not sent .	-2.7873
If his staff has been able to keep him away from trouble several times , their efforts have been worthwhile .	-5.3799
But no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump from provoking controversy .	-2.2842
Part of the problem is that people in a White House made up of competing parties are constantly trying to advance their own agenda by presenting material to Trump that may promote their views from the world .	-4.5207
Politico - all of this story - reported in May on the advisers ' preference to provide the president with dubious information for strategic reasons .	-6.2361
This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher :	-1.9606
" Current and former Trump officials say that Trump , like a volcano , can respond to negative press clips , especially those with damaging leaks , and that he is pouring out where they come from .	-5.2101
This was exactly what happened at the end of February , when someone maliciously gave the president a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com , the website of Internet provocator Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh of being " the source behind a bunch of leaks " in the White House .	-4.5623
Although Johnson has been permanently banned from Twitter for harassment , or has not offered any concrete evidence , or has voiced false accusations and revoked them in the past .	-4.6876
Trump read the article and began to ask staff about Walsh . "	-3.2101
Goldmaker added that then-chief of staff , Reince Priebus , and White House Secretary General Rob Porter , " tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork that Trump receives . "	-4.6492
How did that work ?	-1.5721
Kelly tries to do the same three months later .	-1.9414
Perhaps he will prove himself as a priebus manager , but Trump is still his impulsive self , and his advisers are still seeking influence .	-4.6164
These immutable factors make Kelly 's mission very difficult .	-2.6356
Europol 's Postal Office of the most sought criminals	-7.0128
Since the address is unknown , the support of the population is requested and hoped for .	-4.7384
Police across Europe this summer sends ( virtual ) postcards to dangerous criminals fleeing .	-3.8163
As the addresses of the serious criminals who are seeking are naturally not known , people are encouraged and encouraged to receive information .	-9.6829
Europol reported on Friday of the action following the winter ' EU Most Wanted ' advent calendar .	-3.8882
Experience has shown that many refugees are hiding at holiday destinations , as Europol has said .	-5.4235
21 postcards were put together for wanted criminals from 21 EU countries .	-3.5729
Since 2016 there has been the website www.eumostwanted , more than 2.5 million times this was viewed .	-4.9118
36 of the online searches have been arrested so far , at least eleven of them on the basis of indications after the publication on the website .	-5.5422
Travellers negotiate a ditch and return to the ' millionaire series ' .	-3.1795
Some of the West Midlands ’ wealthiest landowners are once again at war with some determined travellers who negotiated a ditch drawn by the community to reclaim a field in front of their mansions .	-6.0251
Travellers parked their 20 caravans on a field outside a wealthy street of Solihull called the " millionaires series " .	-4.2213
They brought horses , babies and an army of transporters , after being thrown out only in May , without being deterred by a tomb excavated by the Council in order to avoid their incursions .	-6.6416
The tactful group found a gap in defense systems and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unhindered to find a way .	-4.5619
Deserted residents have afflicted the Solihull Council , which said that it was ' useless to deal with the problem ' .	-5.4205
An anonymous resident said : " They moved there on Monday evening after being sent by Bentley Heath , where they threw stones on the passers-by .	-4.4291
The Council must be forced into practice by shame , because it was useless in dealing with the problem .	-4.3100
The travellers were there in May , were moved forward and are now back again .	-3.5198
More came last night , probably more today . '	-3.2451
She added : " The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by holding long instruction to protect its parks .	-3.5205
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I am not happy to continue to pay my local tax if the Council cannot even stop it . '	-3.7033
A resident who did not want to be mentioned said : " It is ridiculous , we have just seen the last round of these travellers , just to be plundered by another round .	-4.7834
The figures have increased this time and even a horse has been seen in the parking area . '	-4.1669
A spokeswoman from the Solihull Council said : " We are aware of an unauthorized camp in the countryside beyond Streetsbrook Road and work with the Police of Solihull .	-6.3949
To support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible report anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101 .	-2.9467
This will help to create a picture of the situation in which the Court must examine when we present our case . '	-4.7475
Waldhotel Luise from Birkenhof	-1.8341
The former Hotel Birkenhof becomes the Waldhotel Luise .	-1.9345
The house at the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and will be reopened on 1 March next year .	-4.1777
This is good news for the city .	-1.6714
After all , with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014 , some 30 000 nights per year were lost and also revenues from the tourist tax were lost .	-5.5580
In the autumn of 2014 , the hotel building was offered to the Councillor as a collective accommodation , with dramatically rising numbers of refugees entering the county , causing controversial discussions .	-7.4307
The city prevented the lodging of asylum seekers by drawing up a construction plan to secure the area as a hotel location .	-4.6672
The decision was not uncontested at that time in the municipal council .	-3.4084
But above all , Freudenstadt ’ s Oberbürgermeister Julian Osswald defended the hotel ’ s location and talked about serious prospective guests at the house .	-11.7830
He should be right .	-1.1972
The Luisenhotels Group with its managing director , Birgit Scherer , based in Bad Bergzabern , has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it again a house of the three-star plus category under the name of Waldhotel Luise . is . , , , , , , , , , , ,	-11.0200
The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object .	-2.9765
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb .	-1.6643
You are called Hotel Luise , Luisenpark , Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise .	-1.2909
The former Hotel Birkenhof has been in front of the entrance for a long time now , and when you enter the house , you will see the extensive renovation work being done .	-6.8612
The floors were broken down , some of the ceilings were broken down , old bathtubs removed from the rooms .	-6.3763
The entire hotel building is a single building site .	-2.6277
There is still much to be done by March .	-2.1943
" It is actually a nice hotel , " says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper .	-2.9166
Everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style .	-2.0834
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers , the entrance area is redesigned and new windows are installed .	-4.1032
Everything should later become " nicely close to the citizen " , as Thomas Scherer puts it .	-7.7060
'We want to make a jewel out there ' .	-2.2822
Swimming pool , spa area and meeting room are all equipped .	-4.0242
You don 't want to position yourself at the high level of hotels in Lauterbad , but at an upscale level in the city , Scherer points out .	-6.5021
The Waldhotel Luise , with its approximately 60 rooms , would like to be broadly located , explains Scherer .	-6.0133
Both individual tourists , groups and business people should feel at home in the hotel .	-5.0303
Discussions with OB Julian Osswald and Tourism Director Michael Krause have already taken place , Scherer said .	-4.2138
The city 's ideas are identical to those of the hotel group .	-4.2383
'We are on the same line ' .	-1.3780
When asked about the level of investment , Thomas Scherer does not want to be precise .	-4.2542
He expects less than a million euros .	-3.9029
The outdoor installations are also brought to the fore , which is already clearly visible .	-5.6278
In a courtyard there is a large terrace which will be accessible from the restaurant , which is open to the public .	-5.0909
Thomas Scherer is optimistic : " Freudenstadt ist ein gute Markt " . . , , , , , , , , , , , . ,	-7.4592
Russia ’ s Deal : US Special Counsel	-3.8976
In the Russia affair about US President Donald Trump , Special Counsel Robert Mueller is said to have set up a so-called Grand Jury after a report .	-4.5745
The panel has started work in recent weeks , wrote the Wall Street Journal , calling on people who are familiar with the matter .	-5.8151
The newspaper saw the move as a sign that Mueller has expanded and intensified his investigations .	-3.9330
The CNN transmitter reported that there were already initial subpoenas from the panel in connection with a meeting between Trump ’ s oldest son and a Russian lawyer .	-5.0935
US intelligence agencies have long accused the Kremlin of intervening specifically in the 2016 presidential campaign .	-3.0389
Mueller is investigating whether there has been agreement between Trump ’ s campaign and Moscow .	-3.3772
The investigation will focus on several men who campaigned as Republican advisors .	-4.0266
According to reports , Mueller also looked more and more at Trump ’ s private and business environment .	-3.1504
A few weeks ago , the Washington Post wrote that the special investigator had personally put Trump at the center , investigating whether the president might have obstructed the judiciary in the course of the affair .	-6.0913
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine the evidence in possible criminal cases and to decide whether to prosecute them .	-5.0584
The Grand Jurys are therefore also called indictment chambers .	-4.6949
They are usually switched on when they are major and controversial cases .	-3.9413
The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors .	-1.9057
The panel can also be activated by the Public Prosecutor to invite people to interrogate under oath .	-4.5853
According to CNN , charges have already been issued that revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer .	-3.6325
People who were involved in the meeting were asked to make a statement , as the report said .	-4.3179
They should also provide documents .	-1.0311
In addition to Trump Jr. , Trump ’ s adviser and son-in-law , Jared Kushner , as well as his then campaign leader , Paul Manafort , attended the conversation .	-4.6012
On Thursday evening , legal experts said on US television that the establishment showed that Mueller was not intimidating in his work and that , if necessary , he wanted to act quickly .	-5.5032
However , it should not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the prosecution .	-5.4984
Nevertheless , setting up the body is the beginning of a new phase in the investigation and a new cause for concern for President Trump .	-4.4559
Amid the new revelations , the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portray the Russian affair as a campaign of his political opponents .	-3.0393
" Russia 's history is a total invention , " Trump said .	-2.5792
The subject gives democrats a chance to feel good because they have nothing else they can talk about .	-4.4753
His Special Adviser Ty Cobb stated in a statement that he did not know anything about setting up a Grand Jury .	-3.8568
But he also usually works in secret , he emphasized .	-5.5552
The White House is in favour of any measures that ' fair ' accelerated the work of the special investigator .	-4.5574
The former FBI boss James Comey has said three times that the president is not being investigated .	-3.5400
There is no reason to believe that this has changed , as the statement said .	-5.1494
But Mueller had only been deployed after Trump fired Comey .	-2.3475
Because of this accusation , accusations against Trump had been levelled that he wanted to obstruct the judiciary .	-6.3154
Comey told a Senate committee in June that Trump asked him to stop investigating the then-national security adviser Michael Flynn .	-3.8347
The President is under great pressure for the investigation .	-2.5492
Following the presentation of US media , the White House collected material against the special investigator and his staff .	-4.4323
This triggered speculation about whether Trump wanted to release Mueller .	-3.4168
Unlike an independent Special Advisor of Congress , such as the Watergate affair surrounding later resigned President Richard Nixon , Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired by the Ministry of Justice at the President ’ s insistence .	-4.9760
Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a move .	-2.8914
On Thursday , two groups of Republican and Democratic senators presented draft laws that would make it impossible to dismiss the special investigator so easily .	-5.9314
Antarctica : Gigantic Eisberg Drives Antarctica	-2.7970
In the Western Antarctic , a gigantic iceberg has dissolved itself from the shepherd of Berlin , just under seven times the size of Berlin .	-7.0803
This was announced by the Bremerhavener Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .	-2.9803
The colossus , weighing more than one trillion tons and 5800 square kilometres , is now going north and will probably take two or three years to melt .	-5.9336
With a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered over the past three decades .	-4.0948
It does not pose a threat to people .	-3.5555
The extent to which climate change has played a part in the collapse of the iceberg is unclear , according to research .	-9.0847
However , for about 30 years there has been a series of unusual breakdowns in the region , writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice ( NSIDC ) in a factual background .	-5.8314
Many researchers believe that this can be linked to global warming .	-2.9221
The now broken colossus has been part of the Larsen-C shelf so far . are . are . .	-11.1005
Schelfeis floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers .	-3.5554
As a result , it continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly .	-5.1068
The Larsen-C Shelf is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula .	-3.7103
North of this slap , the balance of growth and breakdowns was disrupted a few years ago .	-4.5603
AWI researcher Daniela Jansen writes a complete skeleton was broken .	-5.8189
There is much to be said in favour of the risk of the Larsen-C Shelf , because the front edge has never withdrew as far as it is now .	-7.9234
In addition , the ice plate is under tension and can be broken if a piece breaks down at a key point .	-7.1158
The melting of Schelfeis and Eisberg does not increase the sea level , as they swim on the water and water as much water as it does after melting .	-6.3985
However , the loss of the shepherd leads to glaciers being able to flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before .	-6.3199
This may increase sea levels , but only to a small extent , writes the British research project to monitor the Antarctic ( Midas ) .	-4.6904
According to AWI , the Larsen-C Shelf is the fourth largest Shelf of the Antarctic .	-5.1955
At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the open ocean about 200 meters .	-5.0259
It regularly breaks down there .	-3.2884
" Although it is natural and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change , the ice sheet is now entering a more vulnerable position , " said Martin O 'Leary of the British Swansea University .	-4.8602
" This is the most extensive withdrawal since the beginning of the records , " he also confirmed .	-4.8174
Among scientists , it is controversial whether the Larsen-C Shelf will now grow again or go back in the long term and possibly coincide , said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added : ' Our models say that it will be less stable ' .	-7.3218
But this will take decades .	-2.1799
Although these researchers do not attribute the demise of this gigantic iceberg to climate change , a great many ice creeks of the Antarctic Peninsula have collapsed in recent decades .	-5.4763
This long tip of the Antarctic extends to South America .	-3.4187
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey research programme , the Antarctic Peninsula 's ice surface has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s .	-3.5497
The temperature increase contributed to the decline .	-3.0027
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed around three degrees over the last 50 years , making it one of the areas where temperature rises the fastest .	-4.8693
CDU ’ s Personal Pet	-2.8721
As it becomes more and more difficult to fill vacant jobs , the CDU is asking to leave the employers ' association in order to become more attractive .	-5.0659
Just before the summer break , the circle day has opened 41 new posts in the administration .	-5.9334
More than 1100 employees and civil servants work for the district administration in Mettmann .	-7.8543
Now 17 trainees have their first working day behind them .	-3.6636
Apprentices in the circle are obviously very much in demand .	-5.7794
Approximately 620 applications were submitted for the places to be awarded this year .	-4.6631
However , the group still lacks staff to cope with the increased requirements and tasks .	-4.8352
At present , there are still 50 unfilled jobs in Mettmann County .	-4.2014
Among other things , we are looking for doctors and engineers as well as general administration .	-5.8722
The CDU now wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG in the Kreistag and confront the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .	-6.3519
In accordance with the wishes of the parties , the administration shall " develop a concept for personnel recruitment and development " .	-6.2253
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs of skilled workers , but also to counteract the shortage of candidates in a future-oriented manner , it .	-5.4835
The overall concept should be orientated internally and externally , concrete measures should be taken for the newcomers and include a training offensive , demanding CDU , FDP and UWG .	-7.1929
That sounds like a good approach .	-1.9907
Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that were previously unknown .	-5.4336
Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive terms .	-2.5447
We are talking about a real ' competition of public employers ' .	-3.7412
In addition , a large number of employees who leave the service due to illness or age .	-4.3750
So it is high time to act so that more jobs do not remain vacant .	-4.6133
But Klaus-Dieter Peoples , leader of the CDU , goes beyond the joint motion with his party .	-3.6277
He recently brought a fateful surprise to the circle day when he publicly questioned the staffing costs and puzzled the other parties .	-8.0550
Peoples want to see all the opportunities to leave the local employers ' association reviewed .	-5.6711
" If we do not come to a satisfactory solution in the short term , the district administration with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the surrounding cities - should strive for a pet fare , " according to peoples .	-7.3850
In doing so , the CDU is trying to pay employees and officials better than the public service collective bargaining authority actually does .	-5.9046
At present , salaries are precisely prescribed , increases or more money are only available if you change to a higher level that is geared towards years of work .	-7.0730
But the circle ’ s tasks have grown more and more in recent years .	-3.6798
Only a few weeks ago , new spaces had to be set up in which employees took care of the provisions of the new law on prostitution .	-5.0056
Not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers , Landrat Thomas Hendele and district director Martin Richter have a problem : they have too few staff .	-4.1862
Italy ’ s Tone to NGO Migrant Rescue Boats	-4.5485
Italy has warned NGOs that deploy bailouts for migrants in the Mediterranean that they cannot continue to do so unless they comply with new rules for their operations .	-5.2583
" If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , " said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa .	-3.2441
Minniti 's warning came one day after the Italian authorities seized a boat from the German aid organisation ' Youth Save ' , because their team had effectively cooperated with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration . were . were , . were .	-14.1590
The aid organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to comment on detailed allegations by the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio .	-4.3695
" For us , saving human life is and remains our top priority , so we are very sorry that we cannot currently operate in the search and rescue zone , " said the organization in an opinion on social media .	-5.2042
'We can only judge all the accusations currently made after we have collected all the information and can assess the situation ' .	-5.1171
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the boat of ' Youth Save ' , the Iuventa , since October .	-3.5039
It is suspected that his crew will take hose boat migrants on board , who are delivered directly to them by traffickers , and that smugglers can depart so that the ships can be used again .	-6.2860
At least such a meeting supposedly took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the act of the prosecutor whose content was published by Italian media .	-4.1164
The crew is suspected of overcoming the authority of the Italian coastguard to monitor the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other reason .	-4.9142
Under the Code of Conduct , boats such as the Iuventa must have , above all , an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities .	-3.5971
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the code : Save the Children , MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain .	-3.4443
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable , as they would not bring with them " substantial changes or obstacles " to their bailouts .	-4.6349
Among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel laureate organisation , MSF , is Doctors Without Borders .	-8.5176
Minniti has now said that the number of migrants arriving after the rescue in Italy has fallen sharply in recent weeks , indicating that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and to cooperate with local mayors have borne fruit .	-4.9545
" In the last few days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , " said the Minister .	-8.1698
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives , and with Chad , Niger , and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants that leave these countries in the hope of reaching Europe .	-3.4538
Rising and Trials	-1.8379
Nine Weilermer Biker , the " Berlin outpost " and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the Nordpfalz to enjoy four days of trials and sights .	-4.3046
Three friendly guides were available for this purpose .	-3.0166
The accommodation in the Wachenheimer Valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .	-2.7831
The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra .	-2.2133
The first tour led to the Michaels Chapel above Deidesheim at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards .	-8.1649
It was followed by lookout points , partly on towers , from which one could look far above the Palatinate forest and the upstream plains .	-7.2070
In between , there were always longer increases for which long trials rewarded .	-5.3553
On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and the Volksfest Wurstmarkt .	-4.0324
Again the lookout point was connected by " flowing " trials and moderate ascents .	-5.2738
On the last two days many meters of altitude were announced again .	-4.5684
Caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and horseback huts brought welcome breaks .	-3.9322
In Bad Dürkheim the bikers breathed in a salvage salvage in the open-air restaurant .	-5.3076
Neustadt was also steered in .	-5.2156
After 173 kilometres and almost 4500 metres of altitude , the group had got to know the Pfälzer Wald from its best side - sporting and cultural .	-10.1054
Console instead of Race - Bundesliga Arms for E-Sport	-4.0535
Are the sports stars in the future sitting in front of computer consoles instead of fighting over the stadium turf in wind and weather ?	-6.6737
The fact is that e-sport has long since become a serious industry , a lucrative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge high-performance tournaments included .	-4.9729
The first Bundesliga leagues , which are increasingly involved in this area , have also recognised this .	-5.5687
The VfL Wolfsburg started in 2015 , later the FC Schalke 04 followed , and last but not least the VfB Stuttgart , which founded an e-sports department in mid-July and contracted two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 .	-6.0972
" We hope to inspire completely new target groups for the VfB , " says Executive Board Jochen Röttgermann .	-3.8874
He is sure " that there are still several clubs on this train " .	-4.6239
Next weekend , the FIFA World Football Federation in London is organising the first " Interactive Club World Cup " , in which players from different clubs compete against each other .	-6.4828
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint-Germain or the PSV Eindhoven qualified .	-7.4335
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sports .	-1.6906
The former trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players .	-2.4411
" Real football has to deal in particular with the 14 to 30 years old , that young people are still going to the stadium in the future , " says the 52 year old .	-5.9453
And : The clubs tried to conquer all kinds of markets , especially Asian ones .	-8.5061
With prominent e-sportsmen under contract , you could be present in these markets more often online than just sending the Bundesliga to Asia once a year .	-6.3667
What exactly is this about ?	-2.0770
In e-sports , computer games such as " League of Legends " , " Dota 2 " , " Counterstrike " or even football simulation FIFA are played at competitive level .	-4.8327
For a long time , as in normal sport , leagues have become established in which the professionals compete against each other .	-5.0045
And in Asia games 2022 , e-sport is already part of the official program .	-3.3018
But is this a real sport ?	-2.8356
For many people , the idea is surely getting used to .	-4.9469
Ingo Frobous , too , has long considered the issue .	-5.0301
For the professor at the German Sports Academy in Cologne , E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in classical sports - for example , increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormonal changes .	-5.6955
It also needs cognitive skills , technical and tactical understanding and rapid response .	-3.4771
Professional gamers should not only train at the console but also their body and pay attention to nutrition .	-4.1402
'The fit player is a good player ' .	-2.1277
Frobous also sees problems : " Doping is becoming more and more a topic " .	-3.6554
Controls were difficult to carry out in online games , and the scene lacked the structures of classical sport .	-5.0863
On a positive note , the scientist highlights the high integrative effect of e-sports .	-3.5780
Players are travelling internationally , like a large global family , there are no intercultural barriers .	-4.8608
A study by the Deloitte management consultancy and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software ( BIU ) predicts rapid growth for E-Sport .	-4.0815
In 2016 , this meant EUR 50 million in Germany , mainly through advertising , sponsorship and major tournaments .	-5.2050
In three years , sales are expected to reach 130 million .	-2.8463
This is little against the almost EUR 2.4 billion of the football Bundesliga .	-5.4378
However , e-sport is " no longer far from other established sports like handball , basketball or ice hockey " , the Deloitte consultants write .	-4.5298
Many countries are already on the international stage . . are . , , . , , , , , ,	-7.7901
Major markets are Asia and the USA , where former basketball players Shaquille O<unk>Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez participate in the US Team NRG eSports .	-2.9372
Hollywood actress Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSports betting provider Unikrn .	-2.5180
There are also a lot of things happening in Europe .	-3.6719
In a Norwegian school , e-sport was introduced as a teaching subject , says Frobrous .	-4.5997
In the Netherlands and France , according to Dutt , football clubs are now obliged to set up an e-sports department .	-3.6207
" In European comparison , Germany lags behind " , explains VfB CEO Röttgermann .	-3.8230
It is no longer enough to fall into nostalgia , and to clarify the old times .	-5.6451
The aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but also to align the company with the modern market .	-4.0180
" We live in a digitized world , " says Dutt .	-2.1142
'It is impossible to maintain that everything is as it always was in football ' .	-6.5345
Poison eggs - The egg alternatives to cooking and baking	-8.0762
The poisonous egg scandal now affects almost all the Länder .	-4.2728
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord have reacted and taken all eggs out of sale throughout Germany .	-3.5748
The shelves are only meant to contain eggs that are not shown to contain fipronil .	-6.5116
Michelle Carter condemns the texts that force Conrad Roy to suicide .	-2.8761
A Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend to suicide by means of texts and calls .	-3.8490
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years have been suspended on trial .	-3.1612
Carter was sentenced in June for negligent killing of Conrad Roy , who died on 13 July 2014 .	-2.6258
The father of Roy said at the hearing on Thursday : " My family is insuperable .	-4.3143
My son was my best friend . '	-1.1214
Carter was allowed to remain free until the appeal .	-2.3088
She had been faced with a maximum sentence of 20 years , but her lawmakers argued that both she and Mr Roy had a mental illness .	-4.0772
Carter dressed in red pants and a creamy blouse , stood there with tears in the eyes , with folded hands and downward eyes when she was convicted .	-5.4536
" Their actions have killed Conrad Roy , " the prosecutor said to the court .	-2.7669
" She finished his life to make her own better .	-2.5477
She took no responsibility , " she said .	-2.6791
'She has shown no remorse ' .	-2.1431
But Carter 's lawyer said it was a ' terrible circumstance that she totally regretted ' .	-4.1773
Judge Lawrence Moniz , however , said that he did not find out that her " age or maturity or even her mental illness had a significant impact on her actions " .	-4.3190
A prosecutor read a statement by Roy 's mother Lynn Roy , saying that there is ' no day when I am not mourning the loss of my beloved son .	-3.8111
I would like him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything , and I try to be there for his sisters , despite all the pain we will have for eternity with us , " it says .	-6.9081
Roy 's sister , Camdyn Roy , said that she would be " persecuted " by the realization that she would never attend the wedding of her brother or be a aunt for his children .	-4.1084
" Not having this single person with whom I have been together since I was born every day is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , " she said .	-8.9352
The case seems to set a legal precedent , because there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide .	-3.2177
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014 .	-1.9794
The case attracted national attention after Carter ’ s text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life .	-3.5004
" Hang up , jumping from a building , create yourself , I do not know there are many ways , " she said in several messages that she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on holiday with his family .	-5.3523
In the moments before his suicide she wrote : ' You must do it , Conrad ' and ' Everything you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy ' .	-4.1454
Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention by the death of Roy and ordered that it should benefit from the case by any press .	-3.0166
The case has divided legal opinion .	-2.1818
Among the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox , who was sentenced in 2007 for murder of her fellow British woman in Italy before being released two years ago .	-4.4636
Mrs Knox , 30 years old , made a comment in Los Angeles Times : ' Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not prison ' .	-3.3523
Joshua Kimmich : Learning from the FC Bayern ’ s new mini-lamb	-3.4766
It is no coincidence that Joshua Kimmich was allowed to be captain at the Audi Cup .	-4.1192
FC Bayern dares to win the Confeder Cup for a great season - extra motivation doesn 't hurt that .	-6.4760
Something else there was on his place in the cabin that Joshua Kimmich immediately saw , even though the additional garment was very , very small .	-4.5732
But since there was no Philipp Lahm or Manuel Neuer on the second day of the Audi Cup , of course , he kept the binding on his arm .	-7.2721
" The coach did not announce it , " the Confeder Cup winner later told , after his first assignment as Bavaria captain .	-5.9945
Well , the unity could have been better than the 0 : 2 against the SSC of Naples .	-4.1932
But the character of the coach could also interpret Kimmich .	-3.9663
It was not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal who had been chosen as a leader in the C-Elf , made up of youth players , debutants and just from the holiday , but he .	-7.0558
After all , sugar is best distributed to those who are trusted to be happy .	-7.3374
Those who have been chosen to enter the heritage of Lahm can only use a small extra motivation .	-5.7929
Kimmich confirmed : " This is what you want as a player : take responsibility " .	-3.8870
On Wednesday , the 22-year-old flew over the field as a mini-lamb .	-3.7595
Right at the back , this is his position , the white binding on the arm did the rest .	-5.2154
Kimmich even looked like the one who can take the rudder in his hand .	-6.9843
He gave instructions , tried to steer the unplayed force .	-3.1671
He looked at the whole thing while many others were busy with themselves .	-7.8983
Vidal was able to overplay his lack of fitness ( barely folded ) ; Renato Sanches was able to get out of the performance of the Asia-Trikot on devil ( even only partially folded ) ; and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle were not able to be negative in their first appearance in the Bavarian trikot .	-11.6939
That , after all , worked very well .	-2.9151
Süle ran alongside Kimmich , Rudy before the defense , both acting sovereign .	-4.2928
The famous Napoli storm was often difficult , and Süle also tried to build up the game a few times .	-7.5984
His colleague , Mr Rudy , admitted that the result was ' not the way we hoped it would be ' .	-9.1482
But he also showed a good performance on the debut .	-3.6411
Play relocation , Tempowechsel : " I was also brought for this style " .	-5.6904
How unusual this Bavarian world is for the new entrances , was seen after the match .	-6.6092
Rudy , for example , did not give one or two interviews in the catacombs , but certainly six or seven interviews .	-2.8276
Kimmich passed away after a few brief statements in the back of his new players .	-5.3332
There he heard an interesting sentence from Süle : " What is going on here I have already noticed .	-4.5297
In Bavaria you simply have to win every game " .	-3.1171
After all , he no longer has to teach the new .	-2.8059
Alaba Motivated OFB Ladies	-2.3871
David Alaba believes in the success of our <unk>FB ladies	-2.1521
Austria ’ s most famous football player announced his intention to play on Twitter just before the match and wanted the <unk>FB ladies well .	-8.3909
After all , the Bavarian Legionaire is a club mate from <unk>FB captain Schnaderbeck and is fucking with our ladys .	-6.7939
The tweet of the Austrian football player of the year and championship league winner should be a special motivational injection .	-4.1879
Our ladies might also need the famous Bavarian Dusel .	-4.5873
Enterprises content with Rhineland-Palatinate Minister : Economy praises Wissing ’ s Tempo	-4.2127
It was often irreconcilable that the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when Eveline Lemke ( Greens ) was still Minister of Economics of Rhineland-Palatinate .	-3.7599
This is evident after more than a year in which the new Economics Minister Volker Wissing ( FDP ) is in office .	-3.6396
Chambers and companies from the region speak at T V request of a change in economic policy - and at the same time complain of the old minister .	-5.0584
Frank Natus , Chairman of the Trierer Unternehmen Association ( VTU ) , says : " Wissing takes up the wishes of the economy that Lemke has all blocked " .	-4.1187
Natus sees the biggest turnaround in infrastructure policy : the loophole of highway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country ’ s list of priorities .	-4.3903
This year , the ministry is hoping for a planning process for the construction of buildings by 2021 .	-7.0015
The West Circuit Trier plays a role in the country ’ s plans , which is in the urgent need of the Federal Traffic Plan .	-6.8579
The aim is to launch the route in December 2020 , says Minister Cornelia Holtmann .	-3.8167
Natus sees it as a guide to supporting regional but internationally competing companies .	-3.4690
The Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( IHK ) Trier , as suggested by Wissing , is seeking a Rhineland-Palatinate label for wine in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports , which have been declining for ten years .	-6.4923
In addition , Wissing has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company , praises the IHK .	-3.6972
The Trier Chamber of Commerce sees the new Master Bonus as an additional incentive for young trainees , says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach .	-4.0314
There is a premium of 1000 euros for the master exam and 2500 euros if graduates make themselves independent within ten years of the master training .	-7.6713
But the country ’ s homework list remains long .	-3.2059
In the planned road construction , facts are quickly to be created , while the country lacks the necessary staff , says Jan Glockauer , head of the IHK Trier .	-6.1972
Of the 56 new engineers who want to hire Wissing at the national enterprise mobility , only 29 have been occupied .	-7.5458
The IHK calls for more orders to be placed at external offices .	-3.4355
Christian Baldauf ’ s CDU group vize refers to the Court of Auditors ’ calculations that , in 2017 and 2018 , the country invests more than EUR 20 million less in the maintenance of national roads than proposed .	-5.5731
Frank Natus also expects a country ’ s concept of how to address the region ’ s shortage of skilled workers .	-5.2579
It is also sobering to see the country ’ s broadband expansion so far .	-6.1118
In 2016 , regional companies had only assessed net supply in an IHK survey with the note 3.4 .	-5.1829
They complained about stalling Internet connections and breakdowns .	-3.5666
By contrast , former Minister of Economics , Eveline Lemke , is currently out of politics and is still on the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind .	-4.9820
The Green Group left Lemke in April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe - where after four months of disagreement , she already cleared the field again .	-5.5605
Audi is supposed to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers are facing a backlash .	-2.8569
One day before Audi announced that it would offer to upgrade the software in more than 350,000 vehicles .	-2.8818
The Chairman of the BMW said that the company believed that ' there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions ' , and thus referred to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles .	-5.6748
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe modified to reduce its diesel emissions .	-2.8523
None of the companies described the companies as a callback .	-2.9696
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to support compliance with rules on carbon dioxide emissions .	-3.4579
But the nitrogen oxides emitting diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma .	-1.9638
Costs for car manufacturers to install systems to neutralize diesel exhaust gases are also increasing , making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .	-4.4179
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of coddling powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem .	-3.3165
Businesses are trying to avoid the errors of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so-called switch-off equipment , which could regulate emissions in order to comply with the rules when a car has been tested , but which are reduced in normal driving conditions .	-7.0207
In the United States , several Volkswagen employees have been charged , while others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic .	-3.5851
Last month , the former leader of thermodynamics in the engine development of Audi was arrested in Germany .	-2.6361
Former manager , Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio , is an Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be tried in the United States .	-2.9441
At the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen , after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circumvent emissions regulations in Europe , and a request focused on the United States was extended .	-4.5175
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could put a heavy burden on Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to the profit of Volkswagen .	-4.5347
The Flood on Saturday ’ s Isar Embassy	-4.9272
The city wants to protect the Isar .	-1.8982
In order to ensure that Isar visitors also participate , a raft passes through Munich tomorrow Saturday , which has a special message .	-7.0008
If it moves to the Isar again on Saturday , it will see a large raft between Flaucher and Reichenbachbrücke .	-5.3112
And this is not a common float , with Isar tourists .	-3.9357
On the other hand , the building council wants to clarify matters .	-6.2021
On the river you see a big infotransparent .	-4.4768
It shows a waste mountain .	-2.1459
The launch of a publicity campaign to appeal to Isar visitors .	-2.8218
The motto " True Love is ... " is to sharpen the understanding of the Isar as a wildlife that is worth protecting .	-5.8306
Last summer the river crossed the Isar and this year there are other actions and measures to achieve a respectful and environmentally conscious behaviour .	-6.6112
Mordillo ’ s Bones and Laughter Against the Sorrow	-4.4433
Mordillo was at times one of the most widely published cartoon artists , the cartoons of his figures are his trademark .	-5.9355
Even at 85 the Argentine still draws and works on a film .	-3.8588
His message : laugh , ' because there is too much suffering in the world ' .	-2.3022
Guillermo Mordillo was born on August 4 , 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .	-2.4666
In his first years as an artist , he worked as a drawing for greeting cards , which frustrated him .	-6.3642
" The happiest day in my professional life was the day when lost in my job , " he once said .	-2.3724
After stations in Lima , New York and Paris , he achieved his breakthrough in the late 1960s : with the publication of his cartoons in " Paris Match " and then also in " Stern " and other leading magazines around the world .	-4.9863
Even in China Mordillo found many fans .	-1.3262
The artist was always inspired by cities .	-3.2068
Large , round Mordillo figures tumble in drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and Red Square in Moscow .	-4.9007
In the early morning , according to his own account , he is still sitting at the drawing table today , working almost ten hours a day .	-5.5862
With calendars , puzzles , books for adults and children , t-shirts , plush animals and watches , his drully figures continue to be widely spread around the world .	-6.5736
For six years he has also worked on a cartoon film and a TV series with his figures .	-4.1182
The main character in the movie " Crazy Island " is a giraffe - Mordillos 's most popular animal in his drawings - who has a thousand feet as an opponent .	-4.2117
For the first time , his figures speak in the 3D movie , which is supposed to come to the cinema in 2019 .	-4.9531
" I don 't know exactly what they will say , it 's strange for me , " Mordillo says .	-2.7597
The script is not written by him .	-1.4431
That is why he is more focused on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced without wordless .	-5.5960
Provence ’ s Climate Change Lavender	-2.9642
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .	-2.1398
The lavender is falling because of drought conditions and insects transmitted by disease , which gives great headaches to scientists and farmers trying to find solutions .	-5.0744
Eric Chaisse , expert of the Agricultural Research Institute CRIEPPAM in Provence , said : " The lavender in Provence is effectively at risk because in recent years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change , which brought much less rain in spring and much more in autumn .	-5.3261
This affects the life of lavender .	-7.8109
There is also a small cicade , a microbacterium that transmits dwarf cicades , and in very dry weather there are many of them . '	-3.8509
And the stakes are high .	-1.7240
Lavender oil not only attracts tourists , it is also very popular for perfumes and cosmetics .	-4.8497
Eric Chaisse said : " Instead of having very long vegetable ears with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , underdeveloped and either missing or weakened .	-2.9954
So we have fewer essential oil parts . '	-2.5847
The solutions that are being considered include better distribution of water and slowing down evaporation from the soil , but also spraying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and developing varieties that are more resistant to dryness .	-5.2900
The small town of Geisa in the Rhön region of Thuringia is celebrating its 1200 year anniversary this year .	-4.1889

A journalist ’ s assassination highlights the growing threat in Mexico	-2.9976
The workers of the Riodoce weekly usually meet on Wednesday to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the Sinaloa state through organised crime , corrupt officials , and constant drug wars .	-5.4984
But on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .	-2.4406
They were told that it is important to change their routines .	-2.1757
Two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels safer : to take their children to the office , who were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009 , or leave them at home .	-5.4575
Security experts have written three words on a board at the front of the room : opponents , neutrals , allies .	-3.5009
They ask reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is needed , perceptions and feelings of belly .	-3.7704
There are drug smugglers , politicians , businessmen , journalists suspected of being on the government or cartels ’ pay list , a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .	-4.2602
There is no respite from violence , and as corpses accumulate throughout the country , there are more and more journalists : at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012 , 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats , and so far there have been at least seven deaths in seven states this year .	-5.2603
Among the latter is her editor and her inspiration from Riodoce , co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas .	-3.9928
" The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , " Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs .	-2.9963
His absence is deeply felt , although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez showing his middle finger with the word " Justice " hanging on the facade of the Riodoce building .	-6.4490
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the reporters discuss their shared topics , the trauma , their nightmares , insomnia , paranoia .	-2.9417
Although a special law firm was set up in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists , according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists , it has only initiated two criminal proceedings .	-4.7740
As with most of the thousands of murders involved in drug trafficking and organised crime every year , journalists ' murderers are rarely brought to justice .	-3.9158
In Riodoce , they are still insisting on treating the violence of Sinaloa , although they are uncomforting and even though the terrain is now more treacherous .	-5.3906
Without information about the murderers , without justice , the meeting to discuss security has little benefit , says Ibarra .	-2.7665
" It is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , " he says .	-1.9986
'As long as we do not know why , we all distrust . '	-3.2235
On the morning of 15 May Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the provincial capital of Culiacan .	-3.3011
He only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men , he was forced out of his car and was shot on him 12 times , probably due to the name of the newspaper , which is translated with " Twelve River " .	-6.3106
The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .	-2.5097
Valdez was 50 years old .	-0.8734
He left a woman and two adult children .	-1.5659
Rumours tend to fly around Culiacan freely .	-2.5340
But there is virtually nothing but silence about Valdez .	-2.3936
Since Guzman ’ s arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January , Sinaloa had become one of the country ’ s bloodiest battlefields , with rival factions fighting to fill the vacuum .	-3.1060
It is no matter that in Sinaloa , every day someone or several people are shot in the street , or that the cemetery is full of decorated , two-storey mausoleums for drug kings larger than many houses for the living .	-11.7961
Forget for a minute that there is a state of calm when only one cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States .	-3.7771
Nevertheless , and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work , Ismail Bojorquez ( 60 ) , a co-founder and director of Riodoce , is at fault because he could not protect his friend .	-4.5033
He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder .	-1.6628
First , in February , there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez , a leader of one of the rival cartel groups in the war with Guzman ’ s sons .	-3.7272
This publication may have annoyed the sons , suspected Gang members bought every copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks .	-4.5570
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own security after the confiscation of another newspaper that had published the same story .	-3.5448
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .	-2.6093
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues thought he would always be there .	-2.6964
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 , when he joined five colleagues to establish Riodoce and sold USD 50 .	-5.5771
In Sinaloa , " it was impossible to conduct journalism without encountering the problem of drugs , " said Bojorquez .	-2.9956
Over time , the newspaper earned a reputation for bold and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .	-3.4893
Reporters loved being able to publish hard-hitting investigations without fear of censorship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat .	-4.2578
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce , she received the prestigious " Maria-Moors Cabot Prize " for her coverage in Latin America .	-3.4669
In the same year , Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee on the Protection of Journalists for his courage in pursuing Mexico 's narcotics history , wherever it was .	-5.3268
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid .	-1.3174
" I want to live on , " he said at the time of the CPJ award .	-2.7275
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa " is a way of life , " he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV .	-2.0199
" You have to take on the task that is up to you as a journalist - either that or you are playing the stupid game . , , , , , , , . , , , , , ,	-9.0789
I do not want to be asked : ' What did you do in the face of so many dead ... why did you not say what was going on ? '	-3.2756
The Riodore team missed Valdez , the fun bird that could escape like a dock worker , the friend who was generous with hugs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .	-5.0291
They trusted in his routine .	-1.9174
He would always wear his hat .	-1.2664
He would always go to El Guayabo , the bar opposite the office , and always sit there at the same table .	-2.4860
Now they ask : was his love of routine his corruption ?	-3.1214
His death has also forced them to question their own assumptions about how they can best do their work and stay alive .	-4.0361
" You don 't like it if you are dealing with their women , their children , their clean shops , their secret runways " to move drugs .	-5.2616
" These things were not allowed , " said Bojorquez .	-1.4350
The result , even in the best times , is a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation .	-2.2049
Trust your own instincts .	-1.3108
If it smells wrong , stay away from it .	-2.0755
The anger is , the editor of Riodore Andres Villarreal said that ' smell a sense that can be deceived ... and then the matter happened to Javier ' .	-4.1652
The old rules , as he and others say , no longer apply in Sinaloa , as they do in Tamaulipas , Veracruz , Guerrero , and other countries where a poisonous mix of lucrative smuggling routes , weak institutions , and corrupt government officials is at home .	-4.5554
The landscape is constantly changing .	-1.3398
In the space in which Riodoce ’ s staff met for security training , mobile phones were suddenly not allowed ; days earlier , it was known that spyware , sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico . were . , , , , , , , , and . were . , , ,	-12.4618
Outside , two policemen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 <unk> C ) in the shadow of a tree .	-3.1477
They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a middle class district of Culiacan .	-4.3931
Half in joke , some of the reporters wondered whether these officers were among the 50 % of the police who the governor himself described as untrustworthy .	-4.1341
It has been months since the reporters went to the mountain landscape , where the drug gangs are de facto under control .	-3.8008
For this week 's edition , Riodoce has clicked on three main stories .	-4.1908
There was the murder of the brother of former well-known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa .	-2.6277
They also had an exposé to government spending focused on the governor ’ s home town .	-3.4413
And there was a group that carried out kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan , one block from the prosecutor ’ s office .	-8.5964
There was no official word about who was abducted or how it happened , so caution was needed when it became time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite place for drug traffickers and authorities . is . is . is . is . is . is , , , ,	-12.3383
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party ( PRI ) , which dominated all political levels almost throughout the century .	-3.9878
Recently , several PRI governors were accused of high-profile corruption .	-2.5173
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this place , including one in which a son of " El Chapo " Guzman escaped a military attack .	-3.7630
Only a few months earlier , readers would have seen the column of Valdez as the best informed source of abduction .	-3.5972
" In the past we knew what happened , " said Villarreal , 46 , with the nickname " El Flaco " because of its slim body stature .	-9.2566
'Now all channels of communication with our sources have broken down ' .	-2.4210
The Valdez office has been turned into a storage room for signs and stickers protesting against the murders of journalists , because employees have become something they would never have expected : activists on behalf of the press .	-4.9690
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few characters and went to a demonstration next morning for another journalist to the Public Prosecutor 's office .	-4.2391
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan .	-2.0256
A burnt body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests that it is his .	-2.0717
Journalists throughout the country have become more vocal by writing down " SOS Press " on walking paths and buildings in organized protests .	-5.2841
On that day , the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and is trying to gather international support for the judiciary in the Valdez case .	-4.8587
At a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa the day after the assassination of Valdez , Ramirez accused the authorities of spying journalists and killing them because they told the truth .	-4.6000
She has since asked that it be re-divided by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity .	-5.0185
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were " surrounded " by organized crime , government officials involved in it , and an indifferent society . were . were , were .	-8.5983
In his last book , Narco-Journalism , he wrote that reporters are being killed not only by drug gangs , but also by orders from politicians and security forces , who were under a blanket with organised crime .	-5.7997
The " Articulo 19 " media Guardian group last year assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists to the police and officials .	-4.2952
" In Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth , " said Ramirez .	-2.9279
Obviously , the murders have a deterrent effect .	-2.6371
No one forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago .	-2.2690
Your body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Zeta cartel : ' Here I am because of my reports ' .	-3.3747
A computer keyboard and headphones stood next to their separated head .	-3.2797
Some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua following the assassination of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March .	-9.3768
Others continue , as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of her director in 2004 .	-2.6233
In 2010 , the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the front page entitled " What do you want from us ? " .	-3.9197
Some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country .	-2.8990
It is a painful decision .	-0.8548
It is hard to find work in exile , and they are still watching the streets and looking for dangers .	-2.3913
And sometimes they are hunted , as evidently the photographer Ruben Espinosa , who was murdered in 2015 in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the flight from Veracruz , together with four women .	-4.1339
For those who remain behind and continue working , it is a daily dance with risky decisions .	-3.7458
Ibarra , who once wanted to be a poet , admits that drug trafficking scares him .	-2.2779
" Mexico goes to hell , and therefore I became reporter , " he said .	-2.6635
At midnight last Friday , when the last issue had already ended , the editors of Riodoce sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and drank beer when all their phones started to bump .	-5.7606
A number of shootings with rivals and security forces near the seaside resort of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed deaths .	-3.4250
The war continued to escalate , as promised by a number of cartels in the region .	-2.3012
From the border stone edge they have published the news on the Riodoce website via mobile phone .	-4.9240
The title page had to be changed the next day .	-1.8440
Sirenen hired nearby - another shooter in the area .	-4.3675
Bojorquez looked at the police who kept guards to see if they were willing .	-3.2695
If they were afraid at all , they did not show it .	-2.6759
Under the enormous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible throughout Sinaloa , the staff of Riodoce followed his footsteps .	-5.4763
'How can you just think of closing it , ' said Bojorquez , ' when on the same day that Javier was murdered , the intern asked me to send her to the streets to report . '	-5.9580
Dinosaurs used camouflage to evade their enemies .	-3.0857
At first glance it looks like a statue , albeit a frightening one .	-2.1238
Researchers have now found that the first insights of a Canadian miner 's incredible nashorn were so well received that experts described it as " the Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs " .	-5.3583
It was so well received that they could even find that his scaly skin was reddish brown - and they said that she had had something of a " troubled past " .	-5.8024
The report in the magazine " Current Biology " described him as " the best armored dinosaurs ever found , and one of the best dinosaurs in the world " .	-3.6552
Fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosaurs that lived between 110 million and 112 million years ago in the middle of the Crete .	-4.3786
His incredibly well preserved state of affairs has astounded researchers who describe it as ' truly remarkable ' .	-4.9741
According to reports in National Geographic , the armored herbivore is the best preserved fossil of its kind .	-2.4352
It was found by Shawn Funk when he grub on March 21 , 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta , Canada .	-2.6709
He met something that seemed out of place from the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely .	-3.8334
The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology .	-2.9245
They spent the next six years exposing the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,100 kg ) of earth clump. are , , , , and . are . are . . are . , are . ,	-9.0923
After all this hard work , the final result is now ready to be revealed .	-2.7228
" If you blink a little with your eyes , you might almost believe that it has slept , " said the main author Caleb Brown , scientist in the Royal Tyrrell Museum , where the creature can be seen .	-8.9955
'It will go down in science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa of the Dinosauriere . '	-3.6064
Researchers have found that although this herbivore is covered with armor and resembles a wandering tank , it is likely that meat eating dinosaurs were threatened .	-5.1882
The heavily armored dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators and used a shielding technique known as countershade , which is also used by many modern animals .	-3.9939
This would have allowed him to mix better into his surroundings and evade his enemies , experts say , suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs .	-5.1572
The 110 million year old creature from the Nodosaur family made the first headlines in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology .	-4.3840
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell , one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours carefully uncovering it .	-4.0672
The amazing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armor over his body .	-3.9654
They discovered Conter Shattering , a common defense method in the Tier Kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was darker than its bottom .	-10.2618
Although contour shattering is common , the results are surprising , as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of the animals living today .	-5.4765
It suggests that the dinosaur was driven by enough pressure from meat-eating dinosaurs , that evolution encouraged the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival .	-3.9802
But most contemporary animals that use countershade - think of deer , zebra , or belt animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey , signaling that this nodosaur was subjected to a real struggle for survival .	-6.4503
" Strong predator behavior on a massive , heavily armored dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the Crete era must have been , " said Brown .	-4.9240
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was red-brown .	-2.1370
Scientists continue to examine the animal for indications of its life , including its conserved intestinal content , to find out what it had eaten as its last meal .	-4.4666
They believe that the dinosaur , when he died , was plunged into a river and pushed into the sea , where he sank on his back to the sea bed .	-4.8965
At that time , Alberta was as warm as South Florida today , and rivers and oceans are probably much more inland than they are today .	-3.7626
" This nodosaur is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin , but also remains in three dimensions and maintains the original shape of the animal , " said Brown .	-5.6597
" The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as in the early Creation Age .	-5.0596
You don 't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it ; if you look a little with your eyes , you might almost believe that it is sleeping . "	-6.1411
The period of Creation was a time when huge theropods , carnivorous dinosaurs , standing on two legs , passed through the earth .	-5.9326
Although the king of them , the Tyrannosaurus Rex , lived millions of years after Borealopelta , the armored dinosaur was driven by some of his frightening ancestors .	-2.6661
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus , a 38 foot ( 11.5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monster .	-3.5055
Scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology , believe that Borealopelta was sink in the sea after death and mummified in mud .	-4.1286
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he grub on March 21 , 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta , Canada .	-2.5699
According to the museum it is the best preserved armored dinosaur in the world , including skin and armor , and is completely from the muzzle to the hip .	-3.3206
On average , the creatures were about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,300 kg ) .	-3.1796
It contained two 20-inch laces that took off its shoulders .	-4.6132
Researchers believe that the armored herbivore was swamped by Western Canada until an flooded river flooded it into the open sea .	-3.7657
But the underwater view of the dinosaur kept its armor in exquisite detail .	-4.1359
The fossilized remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the remains of the skin still cover bumpy tank plates along the dinosaur .	-5.2005
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic , such a level of conservation is as ' rare as a gain in the lottery .	-2.4020
The more I see it , the more confusing it becomes .	-1.7028
Petrified remains of the skin still cover the bumpy tank plates that carry the animal 's skull .	-10.1774
His right front foot is on his side , his five fingers are stretched upwards .	-4.5982
I can count the scales on his sole ' .	-1.4835
In the Storm : Mass Caramboliage on A8 : Many injured	-4.4340
Hefty accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : Almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass caramboliage .	-4.5990
There are many injured , kilometres of jams and gaffers .	-3.6505
On the Autobahn Stuttgart-München ( A8 ) around 20 people were injured in mass caramboliage on late Thursday afternoon .	-4.4412
According to the first data from the police , about 5 p.m. between Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen ( district of Aichach-Friedberg ) , during a thunderstorm , almost 30 vehicles , including probably trucks , were interconnected .	-7.6800
At first there was no information about the exact number of injured .	-4.8200
It is a matter of slight to medium serious injuries , said a police spokesman .	-4.9393
A huge surge in rescue vehicles was at the accident site .	-5.3060
The A8 was completely blocked in the direction of Munich .	-3.9961
In the direction of Munich a backlog was formed about ten kilometres long .	-5.5609
As an AZ reporter reports , there were also massive obstacles on the counterroad - through numerous gaffers .	-6.2065
The fire brigade noted the characteristics of the vehicle drivers , who now face severe penalties .	-5.8229
Shortly after 18 : 45 a second accident occurred on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and Dasing .	-3.4015
There had been a collision between a car transporter and a passenger car .	-9.2527
A rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .	-2.6649
Deutsche Bahn : Group tests ' Comfort Check-in '	-3.0121
It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced before : nothing to be imagined is sitting in the train and sleeping .	-6.0449
Or one is deeper into his work and has just a brilliant idea .	-4.1306
And then : pufff .	-1.2355
Come and wake up an insane or tear the passenger out of the workflow .	-6.4273
Passport control .	-2.0075
But the times of interruptions are soon over .	-2.9577
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing its faultless ticket control .	-4.0057
You simply confirm by mobile that you take your seat and thereby devalue your ticket .	-4.3921
Currently , a test operation runs on two routes .	-3.7303
" If the offer arrives , we extend it .	-3.4388
It is expected to be available on many other long-distance routes in Germany at the beginning of next year , " said a railway spokesman .	-4.5076
" Comfort Check-in " is the name of the train as a ticket devaluation without a conductor .	-5.4745
However , in order to be able to use them , some requirements must be met : a smartphone or tablet is needed .	-5.9211
And you have to have booked an online ticket - which is what most passengers already do .	-4.2400
You also have to buy it via the app of the train , the DB Navigator , which is the most convenient way to book your ticket .	-5.2658
Last but not least , a seat reservation is required .	-3.2468
The " Comfort Check-in " works like this : you get into the train , call your ticket under " My Tickets " .	-4.9967
A button for electronic devaluation will appear for test customers .	-10.7232
The train attendants receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and has taken the booked seat Y .	-5.0923
When the train attendant arrives at the ticket control in place Y , he knows that there is a passenger with already devalued online ticket .	-6.8930
So you can continue to sleep , work , remain silent .	-4.1383
The " check-in " has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should benefit passengers .	-4.8007
" If you want to travel without ticket control by our train attendants , just check in at the DB Navigator .	-5.2976
This allows passengers to make their travel time more personal in the train , " says Michael Peterson , marketing director of DB Fernverkehrs .	-10.0877
Second plus : " And our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs " .	-3.7894
Those who often travel by train know that , in addition to delays and missing trains , ticket controls are one of the biggest problems .	-5.9462
Because often you do not have all the documents you need to validate online-tickets yourself , but in one .	-12.8184
Either the credit card or the identity card or any other document you need to present .	-5.4438
The result is endless discussions between train attendants and passengers , which leads to bad mood in the compartment or large area and delays in controlling your own ticket , and ultimately takes the time for the conductor to take care of other concerns .	-7.8536
Only a small number of test customers can use the new service .	-2.4875
And this only applies to the ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen connections .	-3.3196
Further train numbers on the same route are not yet activated .	-3.1781
How an activist learned the answer to the question : ' Why Streets ? '	-2.8087
On 9 August 2014 , Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core .	-2.1778
Just one day after she arrived in New York City , the born in St. Louis sat on the bed of an airbnb apartment that she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone .	-4.0603
She stumbled upon a post from someone from high school .	-2.1053
" The police have just killed an 18-year-old child , and it is still on the street , " it said .	-4.0012
Confused because no one else posted the information on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .	-3.5442
A user with the handle <unk> TheePharoah was permanently reset on their timeline .	-8.6377
The rapper from St. Louis was about to tweet live the death of Michael Brown , an unarmed black 18-year-old killed by a white policeman in Ferguson , Mo .	-3.7860
He posted an image of Brown ’ s lifeless body that was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours .	-4.3117
" That 's wild , " Ferrell thought .	-2.7930
But death was nothing new for them and their community .	-1.8960
She put her mobile to return later in the evening to tweets about people on the Canfield drive .	-3.9495
There were photos of the police band and people who shouted , and of a man who claimed to be Brown 's father , who had a sign saying : ' Ferguson 's police just killed my unarmed son ! '	-4.5813
She watched a live feed where a policeman stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a belling dog .	-3.2906
In another video , she said , another policeman unleashed his gun and shouted : " I will kill you ... animals all " .	-3.8092
" This is not common " , Ferrell recalled her statement .	-3.4688
'This is not the kind of murder to which we have become accustomed and which we can call typical ' .	-3.4925
At this moment I felt chill .	-2.3685
I was angry and crying . '	-1.4360
She booked a return flight and went home the next day .	-1.5502
After landing at 11 : 00 , she picked her 6-year-old daughter out of her father ’ s house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning .	-9.0659
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the following three years is the theme of a new documentary film , " Why Streets ? " , in the cinemas from the 11th century onwards .	-4.8608
It is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resilience that exists from the point of view of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers .	-4.2217
When Ferrell went to Ferguson with her daughter , wearing a flower dress and a suitable crown , the two discussed a conversation that they had many times before this morning » about the black experience and the black state <unk> .	-5.4508
" You remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe in ? " she remembered what she said .	-3.1162
" We are now going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that was not right .	-3.2550
I could not take them with me , " said Ferrell later .	-2.5410
" What happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .	-2.3148
It must know it and see it and be brought up in it .	-3.6180
It must be well developed , not only activism and organization , but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution , and what we must do to be free to liberate ourselves .	-4.2205
Although I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience blatant racism , she is no different from the next black female child .	-4.9653
I have the feeling that I would do her a disservice to keep her away from it . '	-4.4466
The first station when it arrived in Ferguson was on South Florissant Road , a site opposite the police authority , which became a camp site when the activists were waiting for the possible non-charge of Officer Darren Wilson .	-11.4543
There , Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch .	-4.7135
They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators .	-2.4500
Slowly a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell .	-2.5152
" My activism changed completely after August 9 , " she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities .	-4.3528
" I had no experience in organizing .	-1.5796
Everything has come . '	-2.5259
Weeks later , Ferrell met during an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan , one of the co-directors of the movie .	-6.9590
Folayan said that she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar only wanted to " document " what happened .	-2.2760
Ferrell put a question in mind : ' Do you want to document or try to find a story you can use ? '	-4.3672
This skepticism was fueled by countless cases of people , often white people , in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience .	-3.7054
As Folayan recently stated in an interview , ' We heard that people born and raised in Ferguson did not center their votes and we wanted to do it differently ' .	-4.3774
Folayan had already cooperated with the then co-director Damon Davis , an artist from the field known for his activism around death row passengers .	-4.6061
His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project , together with six other locals , followed the team of " Why Streets ? " in the years following Brown 's shooting .	-5.5371
" This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us .	-2.9019
'That was the main thing for me as these people are presented , for that is how I will be presented . '	-4.7554
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell 's experience - to show that the movement " is not a messiah leader , but a community that comes together , " said Folayan - she proved to be the most open participant in the film .	-4.5230
As a result , documents of " Whose Streets ? " show surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell 's life as she falls in love and marries her wife .	-3.7168
" I felt like naked , " said Ferrell , and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time .	-2.4277
'But I understood that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanisation of black people . '	-3.8736
In addition , Ferrell ’ s story repeats the role of black gay women in the broader black-live matter movement .	-3.7196
Two of the three founders of the movement who , after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 , marked the film " BlacklivesMatter " in social media identify themselves as gay .	-3.7334
" Black , gay women in leadership positions have worn the movement as a whole , " said Ferrell , " and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts .	-4.5384
Black , gay women must bear the brunt of everything . '	-2.3824
Folayan agreed to note that " the movement really is maintained by black women and many black women " .	-2.6264
However , she insists that " this is not an affirmative type of action " , where Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity .	-3.9568
" She was the person who shaken this energy , " she said .	-2.7336
" It 's not a coincidence , although she was at the front line , because in a life at these crossings as a black , gay woman is so much at stake .	-5.4490
You can feel your energy through the screen . '	-2.2900
In the meantime , the news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared , but the racial links between the community and the police remain .	-3.8072
Ferrell is on trial for 2 <unk> years because of the blocking of a motorway at a demonstration .	-3.1845
She describes the sociopolitical atmosphere of the area she calls her home : " A Chaos " .	-3.1552
However , she clings to a song and feels committed to this memory since she took to the streets of Ferguson three years ago .	-5.1376
" It is our duty to fight for our freedom .	-1.0106
It is our duty to win .	-0.9254
We must love and support each other .	-1.3350
We have nothing to lose - except our chains . '	-1.8599
From ' Dream ' to ' Size Delusion ' : Television readers discuss Bit Gallery	-6.5233
The Bit Gallery moves people even though it is far from being built .	-3.6882
But the idea of a shopping centre on the southern end of the pedestrian zone has split the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .	-4.3836
Cold leaves the subject scarcely any one .	-5.2483
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page " Volksfreund Bitburg " .	-2.8382
While some say to the Bit Gallery : " That would be a dream " ( Anja Becker ) or " That would be really great " ( Nicole Schasten ) , comes from the other side : " Do not need a person " ( Siggi Betzen ) or quite simply : " greatness mad ! " ( Lars Scholz ) .	-6.2577
While proponents rely on a gallery to attract more customers to the city , which also benefits the rest of the shops , opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will then bleed .	-6.7431
In addition , the gallery is planned precisely on the site of the farmer ’ s market hall , where 13 direct marketers offer their products .	-5.9180
The construction work will stop there .	-4.0472
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Beda Square with possibility to sit outside .	-4.7751
Simone Rooms : " We have been buying in the farmhouse for many years almost weekly .	-5.0200
Especially our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the farmers , are always very happy .	-6.3907
We have also discovered the butcher 's shop for us . .	-7.9458
We would like to see this offer maintained during and above all after the construction of the gallery .	-4.4715
There are other cities .	-3.3730
The Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt in particular is interesting . '	-7.2961
Gerd Densing : " Whether direct marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery depends on the amount of rent .	-9.2636
This is not likely to be very low in the new project . '	-4.9012
Eva Kilic : " Why shopping palaces in Bitburg ?	-2.8724
Whether clothing , shoes , drugstores or supermarkets : I think that is superfluous . , , , , , or . are .	-6.5978
There is enough of that in our city .	-2.9779
You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .	-3.3569
However , since we do not even have a proper weekly market here , it is all the more important that we at least have the market hall preserved .	-5.0261
After all , the goods offered there are fresh , mostly offered directly by the producer and are also inexpensive .	-8.6750
As you can see , retail outlets in a shopping centre are only rented by larger companies , because the rents there are often unsustainable for a retailer .	-6.2326
It is a pity , there are almost no more special shops and what remains of them will disappear . '	-7.1930
Wolf Fandel : " A shopping centre with a market hall does not fit together for me .	-2.9541
And the gallery does not fit into Bitburg .	-2.2629
Above all , where should the farmer 's market hall go during the construction period ?	-5.4037
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run , if the Bit Gallery actually comes at some point .	-8.8077
Or does the ghost Bit Gallery already manage to drive all shops out of Bitburg ? "	-4.7517
George Marquet : " This will simply not work .	-2.1642
And no one needs a shopping center that is empty .	-2.7871
In my opinion , it would have been better to promote a real farm market rather than this gallery .	-3.6842
But thanks to the insane number of construction projects in Bitburg , there is no place for a farmer 's market hall .	-5.8550
If the farmhouse is destroyed , a piece of culture will disappear again . '	-4.2656
A Suitable Similarity : Artist Creates Portraits with Chelsea Manning ’ s DNA	-3.3210
In the center of the Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces to be seen - white , black and brown , which are almost unnoticeably the same - hanging on cables from the ceiling .	-5.0077
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheeks and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning .	-3.4814
Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison , where the former intelligence analyst served a 35-year prison sentence after publishing classified diplomatic messages on the site WikiLeaks .	-4.2871
The new exhibition opened on 2 August is called A Becoming Resemblance ( A suitable ) .	-3.5932
She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg , whose discipline united her expertise in technology , computer science , and art , and Manning , a trans-woman and pioneering dissident , whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in office .	-5.2216
Dewey-Hagborg , through the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted by Manning , which created 30 portraits of how someone could look with these genomic data , has created a sharp , if some intellectual commentary not only on the formability of DNA data - the many ways in which they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also on identity .	-5.4773
Manning , born as Bradley Edward , but already openly speaking about female identification since her puberty , was sentenced in 2013 for 20 charges , including six violations of the law on espionage , computer fraud , and theft .	-5.0512
Her image was suppressed by the prison , so much so that there was only one photo - a grainy black and white selfie , in which Manning apparently sits on a driver 's seat and carries a platinum blond wig - with which she was associated .	-6.0552
In 2015 , Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of her 2012 Stranger Visions project .	-2.9365
In it , the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artefacts such as cigarette stumbling and chewing gum by extracting DNA from the waste to create an image of what these people might look like .	-9.8789
That was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine .	-7.2313
" They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , " Dewey-Hagborg explained in a press preview of the new exhibition .	-3.5677
And she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed , so she contacted Chelsea and asked if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .	-4.0597
The artist and her imprisoned muse became unequal correspondents who exchanged several letters over the course of two years .	-3.7140
They even created a comic , illustrated by Shoili Kanungo , " Suppressed Images " , which foresaw a future in which President Chelsea 's judgment would be transformed and able to see the exhibition in person .	-5.1883
Indeed , just a few days after the book was published , Obama would demand Manning ’ s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome kind of happy meeting .	-3.8851
There is something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Trump is waging a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender forces to find new , tweeter-capable ways to further unravel the rigid divisions that he should fix .	-7.0958
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said that " things happen for a certain reason " .	-2.4248
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Manning called for an end to the " automatic fragmentation based on gender , race , sexuality and culture " with her oversized signature ( the " i " in her family name is carved with a heart ) .	-10.7186
On the opposite wall is her mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand feet of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .	-3.6560
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show how astonishingly similar , at least in biological terms , we are all by including the 200 letters ( or nucleotides after the highly developed scientific lexicon of the artist ) .	-4.4771
" What people will hopefully take away from it is that our genome does not care about who we are and how open genetic data are for an interpretation and how subjective they are , " said Dewey-Hagborg , whose 2007 video work , Spurious Memories , is also to be seen .	-4.7657
" DNA data can tell so many different stories , so these are 30 of these stories . "	-3.4792
The last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in its own room , is a page from the aforementioned comic novel .	-4.4765
She shows Manning how she appears in the hands of the disciplinary barracks of the United States , such as King-Kong , with a hands-free phone .	-6.0852
" When they turn off your speech , they have won , " it says .	-4.6773
" So never stop your mouth " .	-2.6054
" It came directly from a letter she wrote to me , " said the artist who greets from Philadelphia .	-2.6747
'I still get goosebump when I talk about it ' .	-3.1754
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition in person - as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if it were to do so , it will be greeted in the middle of the space by the masks , by their own genomic simulacres , which , like hordes of protesters , are raging together .	-7.1120
This was also targeted , like everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 " 2 , Manning 's stature ) , where their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil .	-5.3163
" In the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , " said Dewey-Hagborg of the portraits .	-2.4604
" I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement that was also behind its liberation . "	-3.6321
Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of the University of Oxford sought for kil.	-4.1679

The police described the scene as very cruel .	-0.9807
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July .	-2.9356

'We will conclude the WADA roadmap in the near future ' - Russian Vice Prime Minister Mutko	-3.2048
Russian Vice Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that it will not take long for the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) to be implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency ( RUSADA ) .	-3.7238
" At a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap , RUSADA has been given the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD ( UK Anti-Doping ) .	-3.7748
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this regard , " said Mutko on Thursday .	-2.5539
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA ’ s roadmap for compliance with the code that describes the criteria for the reinstatement of RUSADA and was recently published on the organization ’ s website .	-8.2093
According to Mutko , it contains nothing that could give Russia cause for concern .	-3.0680
" Everything has been announced , everything is being implemented .	-2.3797
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and WADA in the near future , " he added .	-1.8455
One of the criteria mentioned in the list , however , states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the WADA approved investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport .	-4.2551
On the matter , Mutko said : " We are conducting the investigation because our anti-doping system has admitted a mistake .	-4.1726
All the measures have been implemented .	-1.3693
But there were no government programmes and we will not admit anything that does not exist . '	-3.6057
Mutko ’ s words coincided with those of Vitaly Smirnov , the head of the independent Russian anti-doping commission .	-3.0165
In talks with the Russian Rsport sales office at the beginning of the day , Smirnov admitted past problems in Russian anti-doping organizations , but then added : " We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .	-4.7544
Nobody wants to accept this report unconditionally , " added Smirnov .	-2.4851
RUSADA was excluded from carrying out doping controls in Russia in November 2015 in the wake of the doping scandal .	-3.4444
However , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping ( UKAD ) .	-2.3955
After a visit to the headquarters of the organization in Moscow in July , WADA Director-General Olivier Niggli declared that RUSADA was " moving in the right direction " to be reinstated .	-4.1923

The startups that will help your business not become the next Uber .	-3.8637
Amy Erritt wanted to measure the happiness of your employees in your e-commerce start-up , but the polls did not work .	-4.6913
Answers were often vague , unhelpful or - even worse - fraudulent .	-2.3889
And even if you promised anonymity , some workers did not trust the process .	-1.5838
" There was simply never consistency and objectivity , " said Erritt , who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care company Madison Reed .	-3.0336
She called people from outside for help .	-2.4893
A new race of Human Resources startups is growing to help businesses find out how their employees feel .	-3.4720
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee involvement , it enables companies to conduct surveys , to address specific groups and demographic groups , to provide employees with anonymity and complaints hotlines , and , in some cases , to allow whistleblowers to bypass the C-Suite managers and directly contact the board of directors .	-6.0742
" You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit to track their health , but where is the fit for your company ? " said Jim Barnett , co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement .	-3.6453
Erritt said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint .	-3.6152
In addition to snap surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat card of the company , which at a glance shows which units have most complaints and which executives have low approval results - so you can bore why .	-5.3210
Companies come to realize that they must remain at the top of the workplace culture , so that they do not become the next uber involved in scandals since a former employee published a blog post describing an environment of harassment in which those who spoke were punished .	-5.6575
For startups like Glint , this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity .	-3.3258
The global governance , regulation , and compliance industry could have more than $ 118.7 billion worth in 2020 , according to the financial website Let 's Talk Payments .	-3.0368
Denver , Colorado , start-up Convercent , which helps companies prevent and recognize bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity earlier this year in the middle of Uber everything in discredit .	-3.8886
Convercent has almost 600 clients , including Airbnb , Microsoft and Tesla .	-1.3189
Uber has recently registered as a client .	-2.1192
Like Glint , Convercent lets companies send customized " pulse " surveys , collect confidential answers in real time and view the heat cards of your problem areas .	-4.0153
It also provides an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior .	-3.2868
And when the chief executive is included , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .	-2.9251
" The court of public opinion has captured the regulators , " said Patrick Quinlan , the founder and managing director of Convercent .	-3.2173
When a company is found that treats its employees badly or behaves unethical , it can experience costly consequences from consumer boycotts , workers ’ flight and complaints , said Quinlan .	-5.2199
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations , has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of policy and procedures and have an easy way to reach their headquarters .	-9.6919
Previously , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .	-4.2892
It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vitrano , Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel , who said that there was no good way to follow the complaints of staff .	-3.0203
Now that the Convercent company is using , problems previously identified and addressed by executives in cities or states , such as discrimination , harassment or unfair internships , can be addressed more quickly .	-6.4500
" I can get closer to this holistic , 360-degree view of employment experience , " said Vitrano , who heads the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday .	-4.2590
'And we protect our shareholders from employment disputes ' .	-3.2846
Companies began to take ethics , values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 , after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations by the Enron scandal , Quinlan said .	-3.7141
But it took until the " social media came to their right " that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry going online .	-4.1442
" Before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , " he said .	-1.3640
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service and charge companies with recurring fees for the use of their products .	-3.6959
It is a business model and an opportunity that has the support of venture capital investors who have supported both start-ups .	-4.0275
Convercent received $ 10 million in February funding from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital , raising all capital to $ 47 million .	-3.2305
Glitzern secured $ 10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners , bringing all its funding to $ 60 million .	-3.9021
These investments are hardly surprising , given the interconnected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .	-2.7822
There is a growing complex of research that shows that today ’ s employees expect more from their jobs than they have been in the past .	-4.6208
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley , high salaries and interesting projects are only stakes .	-2.5520
The staff want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .	-3.3563
" If people are happy to be in a company that belongs to their voices , and that the work you do is worthwhile , then they feel more committed to making this company successful , " said Nina McQueen , Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn , who uses both Convercent and Glint .	-4.2795
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies run well , and businesses run well when employees are engaged and committed .	-5.9536
If third party analytics tools promise to increase the commitment and commitment of the employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .	-7.8524
The data on employee involvement according to the experts of the workplace culture is important .	-3.5526
But the data is useless if a company ’ s managers do not take action .	-3.7539
Indeed , when a company asks staff for your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way .	-3.2879
And , if change does not come quickly enough , or at all , it can create disappointments and discourage employees .	-5.0772
" If you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be ready to have 4,000 conversations , " said Russell Raath , President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kotter International , who has seen companies that have relied too much on data collection .	-4.6301
" Because if you do not follow staff will ask themselves , " Have you really heard me ?	-6.9104
Do you care ?	-5.5668
And who do not care , why should I ? '	-6.0716
Madison Reed , who is now conducting monthly employee surveys , was able to take action the same day when a problem is reported about Glint , according to Erritt .	-4.8419
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees , through the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication , she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems .	-4.5665
At Ruby Tuesday , the company is getting new insights into the employees , and it hopes that in the long term , this will lead to a better bond of workers in an industry known for high sales .	-6.3774
" If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , " said Vitrano .	-1.9465
" And if you lose people , you also lose customers .	-1.9867
And if you lose customers , you will lose companies .	-2.2098
The NCAA Removes the Two Day Practices and Make a Long Day for the Bruins	-5.1698
It ’ s up to 11 p.m. when a lot of UCLA football players chat on one side of the new training fields of the team on the campus .	-6.6246
Some have pulled out their tricoto parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .	-4.3708
For a good part of the team , these idle minutes are a lunch break .	-3.1947
Players who are enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final exams after the three-hour exercise before returning to the Wasserman Football Center at 6 : 30 the next morning .	-4.9294
" This is a real tread mill for the guys the next three days , " said Bruin trainer Jim Mora shortly before Monday became Tuesday .	-4.1974
The NCAA eliminates two day exercises to ease the load of players , and it has actually extended its days - at least until the final on Friday .	-4.0776
Therefore , the first three UCLA training sessions should start at 19 : 15 to meet the players ' already packed time schedule .	-6.2976
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins postponed the start of the camp almost a week after the last season , and during the summer school for the first time during Moras six seasons in Westwood practice exercises .	-5.6672
They are supposed to hold 18 exercises during August , 20 before the formal preparation for their start against Texas A & M in September .	-5.5578
Mora said that he supports the NCAA ’ s rule change , even if it adds another point to the players ’ busy routes .	-5.3724
" We put this enormous burden on them three or four days , and it is very challenging , " Mora said .	-3.0432
" And they just pushed it through , they keep on plotting , they are great people .	-5.5037
I think that as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will really be great . '	-3.9233
The UCLA will end its practices once the camp has finished , which will not be an easy task , given the clear lines of view of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center , a high-class hotel that has already been run with footballs that cleared a protective net behind a gate post .	-7.9729
Bruins players are supposed to occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mora admitted that there might be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .	-3.5614
" We will use our security , " Mora said .	-2.0057
" This is a real problem , and it is not far-fetched to think that people there rent a room and then prepare to record an exercise .	-4.3275
If you have the video tape of an exercise , it is quite a good deal .	-2.6056
But we have security forces there , and we have security forces in parking 8 .	-2.7117
We will do the best with what we have .	-1.4351
I am not very concerned about this . . . are . . are .	-8.5130
We have a plan . '	-0.8922
Facebook wants to intensify factual scrutiny in the fight against counterfeit news	-3.5279
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false messages to factual auditors from third parties and then display their results under the original paper , said the world 's largest online social network on Thursday .	-5.5084
In an opinion on its website , the company said that it will begin to use updated machine learning methods to identify possible false reports and send them to factual auditors who may display the results of the fact-checking in the original article .	-7.0012
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main distributions of so-called fake news , many of which believe that they have also influenced the 2016 US presidential election .	-3.6436
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with French voters flooded with false stories in the run-up to the presidential election in May , and Germany supports a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to quickly eliminate hateful postings there , as they did before the elections in September . will be . will . will be .	-11.4920
On Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new factual review will be launched in the US , France , the Netherlands and Germany .	-4.0057
" In addition to recognizing what stories are being contested by factual auditors of third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , " said Sara Su , product manager for Facebook news in a blog .	-12.7421
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature to the " related article " and work on other changes to its message feed to reduce false messages .	-3.7899
Creating a Comic Romance : A Castle in the History of England	-2.4671
In his recent past , Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s .	-4.0970
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cosy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent , and has now become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes , a mophaarized Yorkshire with a preference for historical documents .	-5.1631
" I think it is so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years , " he says sorry .	-4.5997
'What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand ' .	-1.9390
'A Castle in England ' spans the period from the Middle Ages to the Age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotland .	-4.9599
It is not Rhodes ’ first book based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 ' Dead Men 's Teeth and Other Stories ' , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly emotional .	-3.7381
" I only responded to the thumbnails on the page of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700s who worked for the Jacobins , " he says .	-3.9643
" That is his thumb print !	-2.6805
And letters always smelt of smoke , because at that time a fire was ignited because of the light .	-4.9941
For someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if it were there .	-4.3553
Oh , I love archives ! "	-1.4711
For someone who has been beaten with old papers so that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council of England and lived in a castle for almost four months ( " To be honest : I have a little overvalued my welcome greeting " ) , this seems all too good to be true .	-11.1207
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian " new " castle , looking through the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle , such as the mounted hyäne heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch .	-5.5785
He walked through the grounds and ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape carers , gardeners and sometimes with artists working on the illustrations of his book .	-5.0836
Then , at night he drank " Whiskey and began to write " .	-2.1475
The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown , as the National Trust only gained full access in 2006 , when the last heir , Elizabeth Hussey , died .	-3.7029
When Rhodes arrived a decade later , employees just started to look after the archive , which he described as " hundreds of years in which aristocrats said " Oh , throw it on the attic " .	-4.9678
Daily books , letters from the time of English Empire , maps that depict who possessed what : " You might think that land conflicts would be boring , " says Rhodes , " but there was a birch to fight two families .	-5.7305
Young people , let everything go ! '	-8.3807
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point for exploring English history on a broader basis , including ' The Labourer ' , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the farm uprising of 1381 .	-9.9040
" There is a record of a turmoil that occurred in 1380 in the castle , in this book entitled ' Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex ' , says Rhodes .	-3.4277
" The peasant uprising began in this area and I thought a uprising was a good start . was . , , , , , , , , , , .	-7.9220
Perhaps the two are connected ? '	-2.7400
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle , such as ' The Priest ' , which tells the story of the Jesuit Father , which the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation .	-4.7414
Or ' The Smuggler ' , in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell from the 18th century is portrayed , who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones ( a discovery made years later when his coffin was excavated ) .	-4.1541
The Darrells are Rhodes ' favourite family of Scotney : " The lords seemed to be pretty crooks , keep making debt and spending money on things they could not afford .	-5.8754
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good looking boys , with a talent to promote heirs . "	-4.1570
After the end of his work in the castle , Rhodes is searching for other unique writing experiences .	-4.3107
He has spent two weeks in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämäki , the site of an early 20th century sanatorium , which has since been reclaimed by nature .	-4.2680
But Scotney has a special place for him .	-1.8545
" I was sad to go again , " he says .	-1.2680
It was like : ' Oh , now I have to deal with the damned life again ' .	-3.9407
Campaign : More than 300 years old Marian Chapel in Rhöndorf is hidden .	-5.0015
On Friday , the town of Bad Honnef launched its campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand on the occasion of the 301 year old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf .	-5.7943
Until Thursday Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and slogan secret .	-2.7092
At the end of August there will be a festival on the island Grafenwerth as the highlight of the campaign .	-9.0906
" Too good for us .	-2.1175
The creators of the action have been asking the posters at the Rhöndorfer Chapel since yesterday .	-6.2434
" We don 't really think this ( of course ! ) , " they write on their website that was released yesterday .	-4.7247
" But we use this measure to attract your attention .	-1.7857
And to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .	-2.1639
Basically , we firmly believe that as a Bad Honnefer citizen we know very well about the beauty and attractiveness of our city . '	-4.3899
The action is about more than " just " a logo and a slogan , it goes on .	-3.7306
" It is necessary to formulate a single promise , one that gives the city a unique unique unique feature " .	-5.2061
After all , it is competing with other municipalities .	-2.6311
The city of Bad Honnef can cost an average five-digit amount of its new umbrella brand and campaign . are . are . are , , , , , , , , ,	-9.6200
Turkey ’ s Military Reforms - Erdogan ’ s Fear of the Army	-7.0581
Every year in early August , the Supreme Military Council ( YAS ) advises in Ankara on retirements and promotions in the officer corps .	-4.8708
This week too .	-2.1396
At first glance a normal procedure .	-2.1566
But nothing is routine with the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt .	-2.7774
The meeting was no longer held in the General Staff Building , as it used to be , but in the Prime Minister ’ s office .	-4.7733
The discussions under the Presidency of the Heads of Government were also attended by the five vice-premiers , as well as the Ministers for Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs .	-6.5881
In this way , the civilians in the YAS were in .	-5.1851
The government is attracting reins in the military .	-3.3472
General Chief of Staff Hulusi Akar may remain in office , but the commanders of the army , the air forces , and the navy have been deposed .	-5.0823
Since the failed coup , Head of State Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals .	-3.1955
More than 10,000 soldiers have been removed from the army 's ranks , mostly because of alleged links to Fethullah Gülen 's exile preacher 's movement , whom Erdogan sees as the wielder of the coup attempt .	-6.5186
There have been negotiations in Ankara this week against 486 people who have been directly involved in the coup attempt .	-4.8027
The day after the coup , Erdogan had already described the attempt to overthrow as a " gift of God " , giving him the opportunity to " completely clean up " the armed forces .	-6.2172
But does Erdogan really have a grip on the army ?	-2.4502
At the end of February , the newspaper " Hürriyet " published an article entitled " Unease in the Military Headquarters " .	-8.0386
The newspaper wrote that there were concerns at the General Staff about an increasing " Islamization " of the army , which manifested itself in the lifting of the ban on female soldiers ' headscarves .	-7.5280
In any case , the army and the security forces are continuing to do so .	-6.4669
In mid-July , Erdogan had another 7395 officials fire by decree , including 2303 police officers and 546 soldiers .	-3.9869
Erdogan seemed to have tamed the military .	-2.2589
The generals used to be considered the real lords of the country .	-3.1661
Three times they pumped on their role as guardians of the secular state order .	-3.7335
After his victory in 2002 , Erdogan pushed the military ’ s power back step by step , not least by invoking the European Union ’ s reform requirements .	-5.5967
Former officers say that Erdogan is specifically promoting Islamisation of the armed forces .	-4.2934
In the magazine " Vocal Europe " , a not-so-named officer who sought asylum after the coup attempt for fear of persecution abroad , warned that in a few years ' time the Turkish army would be ' full of extremists and salafists ' .	-5.1859
If so , such a development could not leave NATO cold .	-3.5699
In any case , after the purges , there are doubts in the alliance about the willingness of the Turkish army to act .	-4.8416
Leadership structures and operational capabilities are " weakened , " NATO diplomats say .	-3.6054
Washington Changes Green Card Rules	-1.5797
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Trump , quoted by the media .	-1.9187
It proposes to reduce legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stricter rules for obtaining visas for temporary work permits and restrictions on family visas .	-4.1333
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President .	-1.8997
The draft law is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .	-2.9413
'This law will reduce poverty , increase wages , and save billions of dollars for taxpayers , and will do so by changing the way in which citizens from other countries spend Green Cards . '	-4.1437
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .	-1.3675
This new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English , who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , " said Trump , quoted by the American media .	-4.7602
Ministry of Rebuilding Race Huttle	-4.6751
Over the past few months , the future of the racetrack huttle has been contested - now it 's about to go fast .	-7.4298
Before the end of the year , it is planned to be built on the runway .	-6.6293
In order to secure the future of the racing hut in the long term , according to the Ministry of Transport , construction work on the track will begin this year .	-6.3786
" With the decision to continue to order and rehabilitate the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route , the country is committed to this link , which is particularly important for tourism , " said traffic secretary Klaus Sühl in Erfurt on Friday .	-7.0717
The cost of repairing the route was approximately EUR 2.5 million .	-4.1907
The country accounts for 75 % of this .	-3.9301
The contract , on the basis of which the shuttle will continue to be ordered by the country in the future , is currently being finalised , declared Sühl .	-5.1226
The ministry and the Südthuringen Bahn as operators are already in agreement on the technical details .	-4.4918
" This negotiated the roadmap , the vehicles used and the quality standards , " said Sühl .	-3.6044
The planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be concluded for a period of eleven years .	-2.9523
The race shuttle should be ordered regularly on December 2017 .	-3.7097
The Race Shuttle is a popular railway connection between the railway stations Ilmenau and Rennsteig .	-4.5312
In the past few months , a pilot operation had been conducted to test whether the route was used by enough people to order it again regularly in the future .	-7.1824

Just when you thought that it could not become even more crazy in 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots comes . . is . , , , , , and .	-10.8245
Yes , indeed .	-1.4005
Sex robots are a big thing at the moment .	-2.3479
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics ( FRR ) recently published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years .	-2.3480
According to Noel Sharkey , professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR , we must start to take their rise seriously .	-3.4388
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernails .	-4.1699
" People are making fun of them , but companies are making a lot of them out and we will see them much more often , " said Mr Sharkey when he published his new report .	-6.4243
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners into robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions , which are achieved by artificial intelligence .	-4.7336
The user can " customize " his robot according to his beliefs , choosing everything from the eye color of the robot to the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails .	-5.5189
But it becomes even more worrying because many robots have the " personalities " who would make a Stepford woman look progressive .	-4.0060
Modern sex dolls have become robots with a silicone skin .	-2.0528
For example , the RealBotix robot allows users to adapt their robots to the characteristics they find attractive , such as shyness .	-4.3012
And then there is the Roxxxy Gold Sex Robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as " Frigid Farrah " , which gives the impression of shyness and " Wild Wendy " with an " adventurous " personality .	-5.0023
" Roxxxxy Gold has a personality that is as much adapted to your personality as possible " , says True Companion 's website .	-4.7670
So she likes what you like , and she doesn 't like what you don 't like , etc .	-2.5018
She also has her moods during the day - just like real people !	-3.5499
It can be tired , fixed to conversation , or it can be ' in mood ' ! '	-3.8897
There are many worrying aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female characteristics , the allusions to rape , when one takes a step on Frigid ( which is called reluctant ) Farrah , worry one most .	-6.3597
On his website , True Companion Roxxxy compared with a vibrator , but for men .	-3.0526
" If women ( sic ) can have a vibrator , why can men not have Roxxxy ? " says the website .	-4.2963
But these sex-robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy .	-3.3345
Their emergence and their increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with subjugation as an optional addition .	-4.2988
Most men , of course , will not keep sex robots , and while FRR notes its growing popularity , they remain at the edge of consumer culture for the time being .	-5.2247
But what leaks from the peripheral areas can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time we live in .	-4.1804
And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission to do so .	-2.2888
There is a certain overlap that these advanced sex robots are emerging at a time when the rights of women are at risk worldwide , when there is a president in the White House who has boasted to have sexually attacked women .	-5.2728
The most dissuasive aspect of the TV series ' The Handmaid 's Tale ' ( ' The Report of the Magd ' ) is not the graphic images , the swallowed bodies and the stolen eyes , but how realistic this vision works .	-5.3444
The Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment this does not feel like a big leap .	-2.9267
The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as possible ( albeit with porn star proportions ) .	-3.6145
Their builders want them to feel human , to imitate the movement of a real body .	-3.1882
But , to the point , when it comes to their " personalities " , robots are not real women .	-3.4779
You cannot separate yourself from your companion or simply go away .	-3.9708
They have no mediation or background history , nothing to indicate independence or anything that could disrupt the imagination of total subjugation .	-4.8711
In other words , they are good slaves .	-2.2953
Or , to put it another way , in 2017 : maids of service	-3.7734
Trump ’ s Great Performance ?	-0.7241
He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense .	-2.9842
It has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarized the US electorate have also divided small families .	-3.1309
Around Christmas and the Harvest Festival , the United States had newspapers with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump ’ s elected relatives .	-5.3739
We are all supposed to make our filter bubbles burst .	-3.7027
Trump ’ s power to bring families together has been less noted .	-2.5927
I mention this because my cousin , a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Republicans in our family , visited me in New York this week .	-3.6048
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .	-1.8233
With Trump in the White House , anyone who knows him , including the Republican family with whom she had fought for decades for politics , is suddenly and very odd on the same side .	-5.2672
It is certainly a good thing to do with the table , but it strikes me in another context that this also entails considerable risks .	-6.1316
Trump has strengthened the left , but his presidency ’ s disfiguring effect has the power to push us all to the right .	-4.4071
When we talk about " normalization " and Trump , we are referring to the grim possibility that one day his mouths will no longer leave us .	-5.4710
But there is an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump “ normalizes ” right-wing Republicans , who suddenly appear to be the epitome of reason relative to his standards .	-4.8300
I find myself today struck by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney 's original version of the madman - the dog on the roof of the car , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew what his tax statement was ) - both of which , in fact , are a very mild offence compared to Trump .	-6.9422
If Trump goes , the Republicans ’ next candidate must be mentally healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement .	-4.1053
When my cousin was in the city , we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park , the largest carousel in New York 's parking department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don 't need a caffeine .	-4.8979
The horses are enormous , the fibreglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are crisp and the animals turn out to look over their own shoulders with fear - extremely dark and the climbing music conveys this in an odd way .	-7.3054
So many clichés of a city disappoint : the views of high buildings become old , the skylines become too familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city does not live up to the dream .	-4.0719
Thirty-five years later , and I am still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a major roundabout in northern London .	-4.3323
The Central Park-Karussell , however , is still a strange magical experience , as it can be two years old , one 11-year-old and two women in the 40s , and everyone has a great time .	-7.2966
If I could have assessed the carousel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately nobody asked for it .	-3.9202
On the other hand , this week in a department store I was forced to evaluate my " experience " of transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card .	-3.8431
In the coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to match the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something over the counter .	-4.2757
This not only slows down what should be a neutral exchange , but also puts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no one is needed .	-3.9198
The poor woman in the department store apologized grinning while I was tired of the experience of reaching her five star credit card .	-5.7608
Oscar Pistorius Relocated from Prison to Hospital	-3.5228
Pistorius left prison for a hospital visit for the second time .	-2.8074
Last year , he was brought to hospital for the treatment of cuts on his wrists , which he suffered in his cell following a case in prison .	-5.8200
Pistorius was convicted of murder following an appeal from prosecutors against a first sentence of death .	-4.4164
He killed Steenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine 's day in 2013 by shooting her several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria .	-5.2720
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a nightly intruder hiding in the cabin .	-4.1130
The prosecutors have announced their intention this time to appeal against the six-year sentence of Pistorius , which they say is too lenient .	-4.6710
The National Law Prosecutor said that it would appeal to the South African Supreme Court , and the appeal could be heard this year .	-4.7351
Pistorius runs the risk of his punishment being increased to 15 years if prosecutors succeed .	-3.3690
There is no death penalty in South Africa .	-0.7928
When Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg	-2.5108
As the last of the Blumberg schools , the four-klässler from Fützen and Epfenhofen were made redundant in the holidays and in the secondary schools .	-5.7928
Three of the redundancies will go to the Gymnasium , four to the Realschule .	-4.4550
On Tuesday evening , head of school Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürgerhaus Biesental in Epfenhofen .	-4.0450
As a symbol of school dismissal , the 29 students of the four classes led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder chose a young eagle who grows up in the chicken farm but is then released into freedom .	-5.1345
In addition , the mutter Schar performed a musical entitled " Der Adler im Hühnerhof auf " .	-5.3568
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg , and let it break out of his chickens .	-3.3664
Instead of a chicken cake , a small eagle came out .	-3.0602
But the hope to make him a chicken broke , the eagle spread on a high mountain and dissolved his wings .	-5.9529
Afterwards , the classes three and four showed a chicken dance in the class of Yvonne Frank .	-4.0368
The hens danced with the young gockles who carried cylinders to the bet .	-2.8771
The eagle stands for integration , said schoolchief Angelika Sitte .	-3.0145
The kitten is different from the other kitten , but is part of it .	-5.8181
But he will never be like a chicken .	-1.8241
Its purpose is to be free .	-2.5527
She wanted every four plaintiff to feel accepted in his new school .	-4.3786
I would like to thank my colleagues , former head of the school Michael Müller , who is always coming in at school bottlenecks , and the parents .	-8.5052
The chicken season is over , explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher .	-4.0697
They are very reluctant to leave their students after two years of teaching , because it was a really great time .	-4.8305
In the end , they have been able to rely on the four plaintiffs .	-4.8212
At the end , all students had a song of summer time and holiday time .	-5.4433
It was a great pleasure for the children .	-4.5665
Eight first students are already registered for the new school year .	-3.6963
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece	-1.1130
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece , informed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , cited by television .	-3.2870
On the morning of 1 August , the police arrested a group of illegally camping people in Sithonia , including the two Bulgarians .	-3.7149
The same day they were released while an investigation is under way .	-2.7550
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported that the Bulgarians were released later .	-2.4698
The Greek authorities have tightened control of free camping and impose considerable fines on anyone found to stay in a place not intended for that purpose .	-5.0601
The controls will continue throughout the season .	-2.9951
The ministry said that the court can impose a fine .	-2.5115
Software Update for Diesel Vehicles : What Those affected must now	-4.5162
How exactly does the software update take place ?	-1.6201
Do diesel drivers need to participate in the action ?	-2.9482
The most important questions and answers in overview .	-1.8338
At the Diesel Summit BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of 5.3 million cars .	-7.3259
They are intended to improve the exhaust performance of cars in emission classes Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 .	-5.1126
Euro-4 diesel or worse are exempt from this .	-2.8007
Anja Smetanin of the ACE Auto Club Europa estimates :	-2.7690
Is the new action mandatory ?	-1.4540
No , the software updates negotiated are voluntary .	-1.4633
" The mandatory updates previously only apply to the vehicles that have rogue software , " says Anja Smetanin .	-3.9533
Their retrofit has been ordered by the KBA . .	-9.0812
How and when will customers be informed about updates ?	-2.6611
Manufacturers have announced rapid implementation in the coming months , but have not yet set a precise date .	-3.8689
Daimler has announced that he will write to everyone concerned .	-5.0975
If an inspection is due in any case , it will be done within its framework .	-8.7733
How long should the overall changeover take ?	-3.9644
" Hard to say " , says Smetanin .	-2.9702
This depends on the commitment of manufacturers and on political pressure .	-3.4389
'We have seen that car manufacturers have not yet acted voluntarily on the environment ' .	-8.0053
How long should the update take ?	-1.5880
The conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .	-3.5156
It may be more time consuming to get an appointment .	-3.5412
What do drivers who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group do ?	-2.7645
The ACE advises you to wait .	-1.9570
Probably foreign manufacturers would follow suit , Smetanin said .	-3.6832
Is there a massive fall in the price of Euro 4 cars ?	-3.2294
ACE fears this .	-1.9460
But it is precisely in the regions where driving bans are at risk .	-3.9423
In rural areas there has been no loss of value for older diesel .	-3.9456
ACE advises you to wait for a sale .	-3.2140
LL Cool J Kennedy Center Award	-2.0246
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington .	-1.5066
The first award ceremony under President Trump promises to be political .	-2.2897
One of the winners does not want to come - out of protest .	-2.2881
LL Cool J ( 49 ) is the first rapper to receive one of the acclaimed awards from the renowned Kennedy Center .	-2.8757
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday , singer Gloria Estefan ( 59 ) , Lionel Richie ( 68 ) and choreographer Carmen de Lavallade ( 86 ) and TV producer Norman Lear ( 95 ) are among the honors this year .	-3.3651
The awards will be handed over at the beginning of December .	-1.8632
Traditionally , US President Donald Trump will host a reception and join his wife Melania in the award .	-3.5168
For this reason , Lear has already announced that he would not participate in the gala . , , , , , , . , , , , . , , , ,	-9.9403
He said to the New York Times : ' This presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even depriving them of the means - and this is a burden on me ' .	-5.6006
The 59-year-old Estefan stressed that she would use the conversation with Trump to clarify her point of view .	-3.1854
The Kennedy Centre , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital .	-2.3544
Among the previous winners are Meryl Streep , Aretha Franklin , Robert De Niro , George Lucas , Tom Hanks and Sting .	-3.2075
We Make the City Lifetime	-3.6009
Roland Wacker , Haslach ’ s city builder , retires next year .	-2.7392
The position is already advertised - suitable candidates are rare .	-4.5817
Wacker has been a city builder for 31 years .	-2.5201
And the work is still great fun , as he mediates in the press conference .	-4.7350
He reports about varied but also demanding tasks that await his successor .	-3.6589
At the same time , he is surprised that no application has yet fulfilled the requirements profile .	-4.6764
The city is looking for an architect or construction engineer at the earliest possible time .	-4.2987
Thus , while observing the regular termination periods , there is still enough time to get involved .	-6.6309
Since Haslach acts as the Lower Building Law Authority for the Administrative Community , the Applicant must present such qualifications .	-4.9448
This function is what the city wants to retain .	-4.5014
If they were no longer able to fill them out , citizens would have to go to Offenburg for consultation .	-4.8374
But proximity to the people is important to the city and to it itself , says Wacker , who reports about a good working climate and a good mood between the public and the public .	-5.2412
In more than 30 years in office , some important projects have accumulated , which Wacker looks back with pride .	-4.8950
" We make the city worth living " , he is sure of the Bauamt and its employees .	-4.3297
In the future , however , various projects will continue to be on the agenda : the transformation of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofen parking lot , for example , have been initiated .	-6.5261
The Kinzigbrücke between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renewed , the stadium is still a topic .	-4.5686
Wacker estimates that the latter alone will make a difference with around EUR 1.5 million .	-6.3190
" All in all , great tasks await my successor .	-2.2669
The work here is fun . '	-1.8730
There is plenty of room for a builder to design .	-5.6018
With Haslach ’ s own building farm and gardening plant , a lot of flexibility can be reacted to .	-6.2563
" You can move a lot , " says Wacker , and the design of green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors .	-4.6185
Since the old town as an ensemble is under protection of monuments , it is important to " keep an eye on what fits well " when new buildings are approved , the outgoing builder stresses .	-6.6704
In any case , the builder bears a high responsibility .	-4.5458
He is a builder , " in the end everything runs over my table " .	-3.8767
He can count on long-term employees in the field of care and coordination : Markus Neumaier ( Hochbau ) has been with us for ten years , Manfred Schöner ( Lower Building ) for 15 years .	-6.9025
Wacker also wants his successor to stay a long way : " We are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the site " .	-6.3527
Continuity is important not only for a good working climate , but also for the further development of the city .	-4.1112
If you would like to inherit Roland Wacker , you should have a degree in engineering or a Bachelor of Architecture and have a good knowledge of construction regulations and planning law .	-9.0537
The City Building Office is responsible for high- and low-rise construction , construction planning , basic employment issues , administration of urban properties , a municipal farm with a building yard and a municipal garden , as well as the Lower Building Law Authority , including monument protection .	-12.3092
Killing Bikes on Lines : Südbahnbahn Geldert	-7.7848
According to the police , the previously unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway transfer in the area of Leoben Strasse ( B116 ) onto the lines .	-5.0162
These were so badly damaged that the goods had to be stopped .	-4.5954
The investigators are from two male perpetrators and have been looking for them since night hours .	-4.3122
A pink scooter and a bicycle driver had been watched by witnesses near .	-5.1856
" This goes far beyond a bush , " said OBB spokesman Christoph Posch on APA .	-4.8339
The perpetrators would have put themselves at great risk and would also have endangered rail transport .	-4.7422
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and the facility , as well as the delay and the cost of rail replacement transport , passengers ' tycoons could also be charged to the perpetrators .	-8.3785
Overall , the speaker said , it would be a ' substantial ' sum .	-5.7516
The damage was fixed again on Friday afternoon and rail traffic on the southern railway line could be carried out without disabilities .	-6.7187
Nearly ten trains were on Friday morning and two of them were on long-distance transport .	-6.0328
Freight trains were not out , but they were late .	-4.1619
According to <unk>BB spokesman Christoph Posch , about 200 meters of overhead lines had to be replaced .	-3.8123
Isolators and masts were also damaged .	-1.5467
Red meat , dairy products , and chocolate could help relieve IBD ( inflammatory disease )	-3.1539
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system .	-1.4690
But a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet rich in meat based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of inflammatory intestinal diseases .	-4.1524
The incurable state of affairs , which affects about 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the UK , causes stomach cramps and blows , recurring or bloody diarrhea , weight loss , and extreme fatigue .	-4.4615
While those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms , researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid Tryptophan of proteins helps develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine .	-4.3095
The chief researcher , Dr. Marco Colonna , explained that immune cells in the intestines patrol to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in the food do not penetrate into the body .	-4.3048
Cells capable of inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues .	-3.5420
If the balance tends too far towards inflammation , an inflammatory disease can result .	-3.9746
In experiments it was found that a kind of tolerant immune cell occurs in mice that carry a certain bacterium in their infants .	-6.0372
And the bacterium needs Tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .	-8.2601
Professor Colonna said : " We have established a connection between a bacterial type - lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbiome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .	-4.0190
The more Tryptophan the mice had in their food , the more they had from these immune cells " .	-2.6875
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promote more tolerant , less inflammatory intestines , if the same system also affects humans .	-6.8589
The post-doctoral student Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan studied a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found that a group of study mice had such cells , but a different group of the same tribe , which was separated , did not .	-6.6117
She assumed that the difference was with the intestinal drugs of the mice - the community of bacteria , viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract .	-4.8587
The mice ’ s roofs were DNA sequenced and six types of bacteria were found that were present in mice with immune cells , but without them they were missing in mice .	-5.7929
mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they lacked an intestinal drug and did not develop this type of immune cells , and they were given the L. reuteri and the immune cells .	-5.8897
In order to understand how the bacteria worked on the immune system , the researchers L. reuteri grew in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - to immunological cells isolated from mice .	-6.2793
The immune cells developed into the tolerant cells .	-2.9320
When the active component was purified from the liquid , it proved to be a by-product of Tryptophan metabolism known as Indol-3 lactic acid .	-3.5857
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in mice feed , the number of such cells increased by about 50 % , but when the tryptophan values were halved , the number of cells fell by half .	-3.9033
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells as mice , and that most of us L. reuteri protect in our gastrointestinal tracts .	-2.3652
It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory drought . are . .	-12.8171
She said : " The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote , since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine .	-3.1963
Potentially , high tryptophan levels in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population . "	-4.0821
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has committed a ' genius ' to Nemanja Matic .	-2.4814
At Manchester United , Nemanja Matic signed a " genius " , Jose Mourinho believes , after the midfielder had his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening .	-3.7697
The <unk> 40 million signature from Chelsea began with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid begins on Tuesday , and impressed in the holding role when people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marched at will .	-5.5066
Matic , however , had been excluded from the blues preparation Asia tour and managed only 45 minutes , which Mourinho admitted he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season .	-4.7978
" He needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , " said Mourinho .	-1.9985
'We will help him to be ready sooner than later ' .	-2.0877
In addition to Matic , Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started in the Aviva Stadium , when Mourinho formed his start XI for the beginning of the season .	-4.3405
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three more commitments , but he insisted that the club had already done a " fantastic job " of fulfilling three of its four priority new commitments .	-4.4782
" To get three of four , for which I thank the club " , he added .	-3.6267
'I will be happier if they get four out of four for me , but they have made great effort ' .	-4.0792
Boeing " Painted " Dreamliners to Heaven	-3.4612
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner into the sky .	-2.8595
The pilots flew from Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington , but the drawing began in Marquette in the U.S. state of Michigan and moved in the form of a Dreamliner over the US , which are several thousand kilometers .	-5.8284
The action lasted 18 hours and one minute .	-1.7389
On the radar screens was the form of a Dreamliner .	-2.8747
The whole thing was an endurance test for new engines .	-2.0983
Boeing had previously made such advertising .	-2.9242
So the number " 787 " and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky .	-2.8449
A New Deal for Martin Schulz - Hannover	-3.9162
As the wind turns , when Sigmar Gabriel was SPD ’ s leader , socialist prime ministers always looked to Berlin with some concern before elections .	-4.7786
If there were no fires from the party headquarters , no headwinds from the federal government - that was the most important wish of the campaigners .	-8.6770
Since Martin Schulz led the party , this has changed fundamentally .	-2.7094
Since then , employees from the Willy-Brandt House have been watching the events in the SPD-controlled state capitals with growing horror .	-5.2874
What Schulz got from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in the approach with headwinds .	-4.1562
They were deep strikes .	-3.2050
One by one .	-1.7686
After the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CDU sees a general signal against SPD and Green coalitions .	-4.1210
" This shows once again : Rot-Grün simply cannot govern reliably , " said CDU Secretary General Peter Tauber of the German editorial network ( RND ) .	-3.5671
The surprising exit of a Green MEP has plunged Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) ’ s government into a severe crisis .	-3.7143
Five months before the election , his red-green coalition lost its one-vote majority to the CDU and FDP opposition .	-3.3124
Green Federal Managing Director Michael Kellner has called on the breakaway Lower Saxony Green MEP Elke Twelen to return their mandate .	-5.4558
Transition to the CDU clearly distorts the will of the electorate .	-4.5786
Elke Twelen must immediately return her mandate , " said the federal leader and campaign leader of the Greens to the editorial network Germany ( RND ) .	-4.9334
" This must not be true at all , " a SPD election campaigner seizes when the new Hiobs message reaches the Party headquarters on Friday morning .	-7.1196
Stephan Weil , the Prime Minister of the SPD in Lower Saxony , is without a government majority after Elke Twelen ’ s resignation to the CDU .	-6.4802
It is the provisional culmination of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD national associations .	-4.3925
And no one knows what comes next .	-2.1195
The plight began with the unexpected clear defeat in the Saarland election in March .	-3.7687
A blue eye , no more , reassured the comrades at the time .	-3.1678
After the provincial elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia , everything will be different .	-2.8584
That was what happened - and everything became much worse .	-4.9019
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into taunting , and the Dusseldorf bankruptcy swept the party smoothly .	-5.7926
The comrades stubbornly picked up in the weeks after that .	-5.4997
Then , when they had just created new courage , the G-20 summit in Hamburg came .	-3.8818
And with him came the next deep strike .	-1.9104
Mayor Olaf Scholz , the last strong SPD leader , lost his nimboo that weekend because he sat in the Elbphilharmonie while his city burnt .	-3.6683
And because he then misled almost everything that can be done wrong in crisis communication .	-4.9139
Since then , Scholz has struggled for his political survival .	-2.0161
Now also Stephan Weil .	-1.2625
Because of the VW exhaust affair and its role in the supervisory board , the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been in criticism for a long time .	-4.8355
Miese survey values were added .	-2.6671
Nevertheless , or perhaps precisely because of this , in recent weeks , Weil has been trying more and more to put emphasis in the covenant .	-8.0267
The former mayor of Hanover ’ s desire to expand his power in Berlin was not concealed by comrades around Martin Schulz .	-5.5291
They granted him because they promised to stabilize the party by Weil .	-3.6725
Now the exact opposite could happen .	-3.2569
Because the party internal dispute between the Lower Saxon Greens is basically not to blame .	-5.6090
And Schulz certainly not .	-3.3084
For the time being , the comrades are therefore trying to keep their own ranks closed .	-3.8196
Their anger is directed at the Greens , and here , in particular , the dissident parliamentarian Twelve .	-5.9425
" It is intolerable and damaging to democracy , as Mrs Twelen puts her own career interests above the interests of everyone else , " says Matthias Miersch , leader of the party leftists in the SPD Bundestag , the editorial network Germany ( RND ) .	-6.0374
Mrs Twelen was elected to Parliament not because of her person as a direct candidate but because of the list of countries of the Lower Saxon Greens , the Lower Saxon Member continues .	-6.6771
The logical consequence would be to return its mandate .	-2.7768
Thomas Oppermann , head of the SPD Bundestag , laments an " undemocratic manoeuvre " .	-3.8552
" The will to vote four years ago was clear : people made Stephan Weil the prime minister , " says Oppermann , who leads the Lower Saxon SPD as a leader in the federal election , the RND .	-4.7916
" Now the personal career of a future CDU member falsifies the election result , " said Oppermann .	-3.6420
He called for the background to be clarified .	-2.2499
I would like to know whether there has been more or whether there have been further commitments from the CDU in Lower Saxony .	-4.1901
Funding for Oracle III	-3.8651
If you want to renovate your house over the years , you will soon be able to get support from the country .	-5.9406
The mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG Stadtwicklung informed about this on Wednesday in Gegeningen .	-5.1948
At the beginning of the information event Schindler once again gave a glimpse of what happened so far .	-4.7113
Since 1991 there have been rehabilitation areas in the area of reception .	-5.4977
At that time , in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the country of Baden-Württemberg took over two-thirds of the funding .	-4.9776
In the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the grant was still 60 % .	-4.3147
For Schindler , the previous renovations are a " success project " - after all , it is important to promote internal development as well , and not only to develop new construction areas .	-6.5523
On April 4 , the Karlsruhe administration administration announced that there will be a rehabilitation area III .	-5.3670
The funding amount is EUR 833 333 , of which EUR 500 000 would come from the country , the rest of the municipality of Senegingen .	-5.5407
How does a rehabilitation area emerge ?	-3.6423
As Schindler pointed out , we will examine where the " really old " houses are .	-5.4155
There is also a role to play , however , as to whether there is any interest in the area to be redeveloped .	-5.9080
If necessary , the territorial boundaries could also be shifted again .	-5.7376
The STEG represented Martin Keller , Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening .	-1.9070
Keller presented the contents of the Federal State Programme " Social City " , in which the remediations would then be carried out .	-5.1130
The core of the programme is the revitalisation of inner cities , the improvement of living and working conditions and the maintenance and development of infrastructure .	-4.7738
The measures would be carried out on an object basis , that is to say per plot .	-4.9384
The rehabilitation area would then finally be defined as a statute .	-4.5550
The grant period for the funds has run from 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026 .	-4.3744
Until September this year , however , the inventory would be carried out , in which those involved in the rehabilitation area would receive a questionnaire to fill in .	-6.7973
In November or December , as far as possible , the decision on the Statute is to be taken , so that remedies can begin next year .	-7.6087
Pietzschmann then explained that every municipality must carry out the aforementioned preliminary investigations .	-8.6542
It is a question of assessing urban planning abuses and deciding when to repair and to what extent .	-6.2016
There will then be a reconditioning notice in the Land Registry for each property .	-8.1425
Pietzschmann himself will come to receive again and take a picture of the situation , she promised .	-4.7712
Gotzel stressed that the participation of the participants was an essential success factor for the project .	-3.9076
There will therefore be questionnaires which will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and which can be filled in until the end of the summer holidays .	-5.2780
The yellow questionnaire is the " building and property sheet " , which deals , among other things , with the construction condition and the recovery plans .	-5.7202
In the grey questionnaire , the " Household and Housing Arch " , information on the size , distribution and inhabitants of a living room can be provided .	-5.6505
The blue " operating sheet " is only to be filled in if the building has business premises .	-6.0638
However , it should be noted that Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not a request for funding at the same time .	-3.8010
Moreover , new construction measures would not be eligible .	-3.3959
Schindler stressed that the distribution of the aid works according to the " greyhound principle " - who comes first is first served .	-6.2191
You cannot ' reserve ' funding later .	-4.6353
At the end , photos of the project " Ortskern II " were shown to make the present guests " tasty " .	-7.6097
British inventor is using a microchip to get home and car by hand .	-5.4212
A British inventor is the first in the country to be equipped with a microchip so that he can open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .	-4.7232
Steven Northam , 33 , had implanted the tiny chip between thumb and point finger and now offers the service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his BioTeq company .	-4.7237
He has joined forces with Dr. Geoff Watson , a consultative anaesthetist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester , Hants , to ensure that the implant procedure is performed according to medical standards .	-4.2737
The technology resembles a cat and dog implanted microchip and takes only 30 seconds .	-2.0600
The company of Mr. Northam also wants to change the locks on houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip , all for an extra charge of $ 300 per lock .	-5.1675
The married father of one has now installed both at home and in his BMW Z4 technology , which starts when his hand is at the wheel .	-3.7645
The White House ’ s Advertising Costs Tax Thousands	-2.4901
The White House ’ s decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month costs taxpayers up to $ 24,000 , according to the military ’ s data , handed over to the TIME magazine .	-5.3053
The green and white Sikorsky VH-3D , known as Marine One when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on 17 July in the White House with American construction programs .	-4.2126
President Donald Trump , Vice President Mike Pence , and senior White House officials made a tour of products from all 50 countries .	-2.5750
The Connecticut helicopter was issued alongside a Maine yacht , a Wisconsin fire service and a Mississippi forklift .	-4.3217
The White House Military Office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn , following the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One ( HMX-1 ) , the unit responsible for operating the helicopter .	-4.1595
" I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , " wrote the commander of HMX-1 on the eve of the event to his superiors , the deputy naval commander for aviation .	-4.4221
The news showed that the helicopter arrived at the South Lawn on 17 July at around 7 a.m. for the event at 3 p.m. , and that it remained until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 this evening .	-6.3612
The note adds that if departures from the White House were to be delayed , a second team would be required for the return flight because of the restrictions on hours of service .	-5.6500
The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event , while the unit ’ s security personnel remained on the ground .	-5.1285
From the records provided by TIME it was not clear whether a second flight crew was ultimately required .	-4.4158
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes .	-2.4873
rows indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could violate the rule .	-3.6884
" One question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case , " the commander wrote .	-3.1375
" Sounds like you are locked , " replied the deputy commander .	-3.5551
The event " Made in America " was called an official event by the White House and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act .	-2.7784
But official events also have political overtones .	-1.2944
At the event , the President gave impetus to the reform of the health reform that was underway in the Senate , and he promoted efforts to curb government rules .	-5.4334
The use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically beneficial purposes is hardly a new phenomenon .	-2.5930
Presidents are obliged to use them for the journey .	-2.6979
But requesting their use only for a photo OP is unusual .	-2.3484
Trump conducted an investigation in February , when the presidential airliner was doing taxi services against the backdrop of his first campaign rally in Melbourne , Florida , and his Twitter account is full of reports that complained about his predecessor ’ s use of the presidential airliner .	-5.2768
" The White House is enthusiastic about the show " Made In America " - which shows products from all 50 countries manufactured by American workers using American materials , " said the Deputy Secretary of the White House , Lindsay Walters .	-4.1906
HMX-1 crews often carry out training flights in the Washington and South Lawn areas to sell the US president in the White House with precise centimetres .	-5.7291
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July , HMX-1 conducted 58 practice landings in the White House .	-2.9511
The flight for the " Made in America " event counted at the training needs of the flight crew for the month , said an official .	-3.1146
Helicopter units flew an additional 11 hours on that day for " non-presidential support missions " .	-4.1954
The White House said that taxpayers took the burden on none of the other props presented at the event .	-3.3980
A Sikorsky spokesman said that the company was not involved in issuing the helicopter on the South Lawn .	-3.1472
HMX-1 has no budget records for presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .	-3.3528
However , according to the US Department of Defense ’ s hourly rates for the 2017 financial year , the DoD refund rate for the VH-3D is $ 24,380 per flight hour .	-5.0215
Records of the unit record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia .	-9.4229
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is well below that rate .	-2.2884
" Setting taxpayers ' costs on the basis of the estimates for the rates of reimbursement is highly misleading , " said Walters .	-5.4982
'These estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual budget ' .	-3.3372
According to a 2015 RAND study , the rates for refunds for DoD do not include personnel costs , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance , and contract completion .	-4.1354
At that time , the former White House press spokesman , Sean Spicer , defended the use of the helicopter for the event .	-3.5053
" The idea is to present things that are made in America this week , " said Spicer .	-2.6602
" And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not thousands , of people depend on it .	-3.2569
And I think , like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly .	-2.0050
It is , of course , appropriate to highlight this . '	-2.9449
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event , but he sat in the driver ’ s seat of a fire-fighter car .	-4.4981
In the White House , Trump spoke to Sikorsky ’ s representatives , joking with the media about his own fleet of corporate products .	-3.3633
'I know Sikorsky very well ' , the President said , ' I have three of them . '	-2.6236
TC BW Neuss	-3.1911
Top rider of the second tennis Bundesliga will compete at the third SV table .	-8.9242
The TC Blau-Weiss Neuss will be in Kiel tomorrow from 11 a.m. at the third row in Suchsdorfer SV .	-6.6580
In spite of five matches , the leading player of the Second Tennis League still has the sense of reality .	-7.7728
Team leader Marius Zay has respect for the opponent .	-3.5792
" This is a compact team that always plays in a very similar formation .	-7.6781
I find the team very good on the back . '	-4.5865
Suchsdorfer SV ’ s imports from the high north provide class and stability .	-10.0077
" Their Danes and Finns can even point to bets in the Davis Cup .	-2.8657
And they are also strong in double , " says Zay looking at Harri Heliovaara ( Finland ) , Andre Göransson ( Sweden ) , Sören and Esben Olesen , Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus ( all Denmark ) .	-2.6591
" As always , this will be difficult for us .	-2.4073
You also need a good portion of luck . '	-2.5741
The Neusser team for the trip to the high north is practical .	-3.8031
His debut for blue-white could be Maxime Janvier .	-2.2492
If the French currently active at the Challenger Tournament in Biella , in Italy , does not win the Bundesliga match , Zdenek Kolar ( Czech Republic ) , playing in the Czech Liberec Tournament , will be his first bet this season .	-8.0930
The so far unbeaten Chilene Hans Podlipnik Castillo was on the ball yesterday with the Belarusian Andrei Vasilevski at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel . . was , . . , were . were , . were . , ,	-11.6680
However , he should be in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschulp , Niels Lootsma ( both Netherlands ) and Belgian Julien Cagnina .	-4.0186
After his two victories last Sunday against the Alster club , Máté Valkusz could once again join the team .	-4.7384
If it is not enough for the 18-year-old Hungarian , who was the number one in the Junior World Ranking in January 2016 , someone from the trainer 's bar around Marius Zay fills the cadre .	-7.1710
How America Can Shake OMV	-2.5298
Donald Trump was not really happy when he signed his signature on Wednesday evening under the law to tighten sanctions against Russia .	-4.1487
" In his haste to enact the law , " Congress wrapped in a few " unconstitutional rules , " he etched .	-4.1301
The reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels was ashamed of the US move .	-3.8532
After all , the proposal envisages penalising European companies that help Russians build gas pipelines into the EU .	-3.5404
As a result , investors from the domestic OMV have been worried since then , who , together with other European companies , are co-financing the construction of Russia ’ s East Zeal Nord Stream 2 .	-7.5479
The drought is enormous .	-4.1306
Yet it is too early to assess the consequences , according to the oil company ’ s official statement .	-3.5452
Indeed , Donald Trump himself would have to bring the sanctions to life by an executive order .	-3.4348
He has twelve weapons to choose from .	-3.1522
" The press " looked at which of the Group could defend itself and which could really hurt him .	-4.7250
Narcos season 3 trailer : Without Pablo Escobar , the Cali Cartel in the Netflix hit series will be put at the centre .	-5.2294
Despite the second season of Narcos , which unveils Pablo Escobars Killer , the series of Netflix is far from over .	-4.1393
The seasons three and four were already confirmed by the streaming service , the first received their first trailer and showed the latest villains of the show .	-3.1426
With the third season , the DEA has focused its attention on the richest organisation of drug trafficking in the world : the Cali Cartel .	-3.8808
Led by four powerful sponsors , they operate " like a Fortune 500 company " only with more state bribes and violent actions .	-2.9263
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela ( Damian Alcazar ) is the leader of the cartel , Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , Pacho Herrera ( Alberto Ammann ) commands the Mexican connection , and Chepe Santacruz Londono ( Pepe Rapazote ) is located in New York .	-2.5196
In the newly released trailer , Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Pe<unk>a , the type that invites American and Colombian law enforcement agencies to support the war on drugs .	-3.0978
Other new actors are Matias Varela , Michael Steel-David , Matt Whelan , Miguel Angel Silvestre , Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro .	-2.5140
The third season of Narcos will begin on September 1 .	-2.1218
Reverse Role : The City of 46 Kitchen Aid	-4.6359
The city organizes the Kita lunch table itself .	-3.9309
With fixed contact partners for the children and a team allocation .	-4.8507
The clock is turned back in the city ’ s daycare centres .	-4.7082
As of September 1 , the city of Krefeld will again take care of the food supply in the urban children ’ s day facilities ( Kitas ) .	-6.0116
For Sonja Pommeranz , deputy director of youth assistance , this is good news : " We were all very pleased " .	-4.1116
A caterer takes over this task and supplies freshly cooked meals .	-6.0114
The city operates 46 daycare centres in the Krefeld area , and in 44 children receive a warm meal at midday .	-5.4002
In the past kite year 2800 children were sitting at the tables , and demand is growing steadily .	-5.8293
" In the meantime , not only children who are cared for 45 hours a week are eating in the Kita for lunch " , explains Pommeranz .	-5.8853
'The offer is also valid in 35-hour care if children stay until 2 p.m. ' .	-5.1105
46 part-time employees have kitchen service from 1 September : they warm up the food delivered , supplement it with salad , raw food and fruit , carry out the meal individually , give off the meal , clean , rinse and clean the kitchen .	-8.1711
" The employees are firmly assigned to a kite " , says Pommeranz .	-3.7844
The size - there are two groups as well as seven groups - determines the amount of hours .	-3.9857
" The kitchen helpers are now firmly part of the Kita team " , says Pommeranz satisfied .	-3.4917
" So they are much more involved and it is easier for the kite crew to implement pedagogical concepts " .	-5.0818
It is also about healthy nutrition and cooking lessons .	-3.6267
" The children should help prepare the food " .	-2.7026
The staff were very friendly and helpful .	-5.0640
Also for the children .	-2.5046
" They have a known force in the kita , a person who is familiar to them and not constantly changing people " .	-3.3868
This continuity is important for children .	-1.5530
The cleaning of the Kita rooms - until now also the task of the kitchen staff - will be done by special cleaning staff .	-5.4678
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has not only improved the quality of the kitchen service , but also the charm that it has proven to be the most economical for the city in terms of cost comparison between self-government and foreign procurement , it is said from the press office .	-8.9793
And that , though 46 part-time workers are reset .	-3.7233
" But these hours don 't matter so much for some 750 people in the educational field , " says Sonja Pommeranz .	-5.4606
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN	-2.0342
Elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .	-2.4290
Nicholas Haysom , President-in-Office of the United Nations Mission , said that hundreds of women will stand in the provincial Council elections , with three women standing for the role of Vice-President and more than 30 % of newly registered voters being women .	-4.8366
" The role of women cannot be overestimated , " he said in a statement on Wednesday .	-1.8377
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women are fully involved and involved in all parts of the electoral process .	-2.5520
Afghan elections for the provincial council and presidential elections will take place on 5 April .	-2.3526
The Taliban have published threats against an electoral process that coincide with the transition from international fighting to an advisory role .	-3.3419
This year , for the first time , the elections will hand over power peacefully from a democratically elected government to another .	-7.3403
Haysom said that a strong role for women will reinforce Afghanistan 's democratic success .	-2.5182
The Afghan independent electoral commission reports that 1.2 million women are registered by a total registered 3.6 million voters .	-2.2605
Moving to the TV Jubilee	-2.2430
On the occasion of its 110-year existence , TV Kaiseringen invites you to a short walk with a coffee and cake .	-5.1024
The hike starts on Sunday , July 9 , at 1pm in Frohnstetten near the water reservoir in the American Road .	-4.9711
From there it goes to the airfield , to the Natter and over the Waldhof back to the water reservoir .	-3.9410
The hike takes about one and a half hours .	-2.6547
Afterwards , in Kaiseringen at the school house , you will find coffee , cakes , cool drinks , string sausages and cheeses .	-6.5709
If you need a shared car from Kaiseringen to Frohnstetten , the meeting point is in Kaiseringen at the school .	-8.8768
Men trying to rob 13-year-old girls	-3.8336
Two young men aged 19 and 23 should have tried on Thursday to rob a 13-year-old girl .	-2.9098
According to information from the police , the men spoke to the 13-year-old , who was on the Kolpingstra<unk>e with friends , around 14.55 , because they wanted to call the girl 's mobile phone .	-7.1171
The 13-year-old rejected the request and continued with their friends .	-3.7614
In response , one of the perpetrators tried to grab the girl ’ s mobile phone and necklace , which was missing .	-6.2915
Without prey , the duo fled .	-2.0731
The two young men were later arrested by the police .	-1.8332
The investigation is under way .	-1.7558
GMB concerns about investment in the McVitie factory in Glasgow	-2.3176
A union would like to make sure that managers of the biscuit manufacturer McVitie have a long-term commitment to production at their plant in Glasgow .	-5.2639
GMB Scotland said that the company has been silent about the future of investment at the Tollcross site .	-3.9317
More than 500 employees work at the plant , which manufactures Hobnobs and Rich Tea Kekse among other products .	-3.8859
McVitie ’ s owner , Pladis , said that he has invested more than <unk> 5 million in recent years .	-10.6902
He added that employees and trade union representatives would be " first experienced " if their activities changed .	-3.5900
In a letter to the company ’ s subsidiary , GMB Scotland McVitie ’ s called for ' concern that funding for the modernisation of production lines will not be promoted ' .	-5.5890
GMB-Senior Organiser Drew Duffy , said : " The fact that we cannot gain clarity from the General Site Manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross is deeply affecting our members .	-4.8121
Generations of families have worked here , and the workforce is heavily focused on the local community and Glasgow , an important pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage .	-4.7687
So , from the perspective of jobs , wages , and prosperity , and against the background of Brexit , rising cost of living , and chronic production decline , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a thriving McVitie production presence .	-5.1432
A Pladis spokesperson said : " The Tollcross branch owner received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday , and the company will respond directly to it , as we appreciate the continuous commitment of employees and trade union representatives .	-6.5694
Two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross , where some issues were discussed openly .	-3.4543
We discussed with the employees that , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , we are constantly reviewing our business - and this applies to all our divisions and sites - in order to remain competitive .	-5.6822
She added : " In recent years we have invested more than <unk> 5 million in our Tollcross site , especially in production lines and operational improvements .	-3.3554
We fully recognise the heritage of Tollcross as a production site , and if our operations change at the site , the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to know . '	-5.7200
Did the PSG alert Barcelona three years ago to Neymar ?	-2.6050
La League ’ s Party may regret its interest in Marco Verratti .	-3.4961
Paris Saint-Germain will not relax in her persecution of Neymar after giving an offer of $ 189 million to trigger his release clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago of the world record attack ?	-5.3506
The sensational approach fueled the transfer window in the summer , because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous mark , with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United last season for <unk> 89 million .	-4.1307
After finishing , Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athlete in the world .	-3.9592
Barcelona is angry about the way Neymar has forced his way out , even though a source near the Catalan Board insists that the club has always done its best to deal with him since his arrival in Santos in 2013 .	-5.3160
But was the football world warned three years ago by the PSG president of this prospect ?	-8.9141
When Manchester City expressed interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014 , Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for any club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PSG .	-3.4102
" I 'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players , we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact their players , " said Al-Khelaifi .	-3.2255
" We respect all clubs .	-0.8531
But if you try to sign one of our players , that will have consequences . '	-3.9094
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish club expressing interest in the PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer .	-3.7835
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for Neymar .	-3.8695
Reverse and Damaged Rollers	-4.0511
On the night of Friday on Saturday , an unknown perpetrator deliberately reversed a scooter placed in Königsfelder Stra<unk>e in front of the property number 30 , causing material damage of over 200 euros on the fairing of the vehicle .	-7.1826
Police Schramberg , phone 07422 / 27 01-0 , asks for information .	-3.0228
In an accident on the B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese the police is looking for witnesses .	-3.4676
Because a car arrived in his lane , the driver of a VW Touran had to evade and touched the circuit board .	-7.5973
On Thursday evening , the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum with his VW was on the B 215 from Stolzenau to Leese .	-4.7056
In the area of Stolzenau ’ s circumnavigation , a car arrived at him on his journey so that he had to move to the right .	-7.0757
The tour driver touched the roadmap .	-5.4394
The car caused material damage .	-3.8661
The driver of the accommodating car , a Mercedes Benz , had overtaken a lorry and continued his journey without worrying about the traffic accident .	-4.4080
It may be good , according to the accident victim , that the Mercedes driver had not noticed the accident .	-5.3420
The police are now asking for evidence of the incident and the driver of the ' polluter pays ' to contact the Commissioner in Stolzenau by phone 05761 / 92060 .	-5.5831
Interview : ' Domspatzen report relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger '	-3.1003
The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the abuses relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger .	-2.9139
This means author and historian Michael Hesemann .	-1.6137
The final report on the abusive scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen continues to hold discussions .	-4.9481
Christian Weisnder , spokesman of the reform movement " We are Church " , explained after publication to the German press agency , he expects an apology from the former Regensburg bishop and today 's Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the master master of the cathedral , Georg Ratzinger , the 93-year-old brother of the Emerged Pope Benedict XVI .	-6.8739
It would be very useful to the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger were to express their deep regret at their own omissions or at that time their misjudgement of what happened .	-6.1907
The Vatican newspaper " Osservatore Romano " , on the other hand , criticized the fact that " double standards " were applied in the reporting of violence in the Cathedral squares .	-5.9902
With regard to the attacks in Regensburg , no one doubts that these are ' shameful and shameful acts ' that should be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the ' degree of media manipulation ' , according to the author Lucetta Scaraffia , historian and member of the Italian National Committee on Bioethics , is striking .	-5.9350
" The habit of describing the Catholic Church as the source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to consider it normal , " writes Scaraffia .	-4.7192
Fürstin Gloria von Thurn und Taxis also said in the interview with Bayerische Rundfunk : " You like to go to the church and this is a found meal " .	-5.4873
She also pointed out that in her youth , " strokes were a normal pedagogical means " to deal with cheeky children , as I was one . "	-6.4827
They would find it unfair to apply today ’ s standards to previous decades , because the world has changed .	-2.8376
In connection with the reports of abuses , Pope brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared .	-4.4663
The author and historian Michael Hesemann , who wrote with Ratzinger the book " My brother of the Pope " ( translated into 12 languages ) , is completely wrong .	-5.3393
" I must protect Georg Ratzinger , " Hesemann says , " because all this had nothing to do with him , " he values the results of the final report .	-3.8639
What exactly is in the 440-page report presented by the lawyer Ulrich Weber , charged with the Enlightenment by the Bishopric Regensburg ?	-4.5860
A total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s " with high plausibility " victims of attacks , 67 Domspatzen .	-4.6073
The final report refers to Georg Ratzinger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : " In summary , it can be said that in many cases forms of physical and mental violence were used by Domkapellmeister R.	-5.0670
Particularly in the case of high emotionality , the punishment could also be more severe for the students .	-6.2852
However , unlike many others , it is striking that many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and that in many cases , despite violence , they even associate positive memories with him " .	-7.5808
In the interview Hesemann explains why he believes that the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger relieves .	-5.3190
Mr Hesemann , the 440 page report on the ' incidents of violence against defenders in the Regensburger Domspatzen ' gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger .	-5.9070
On the one hand , many students emphasize his " humanity " .	-3.0741
On the other hand , he also appears as a cholerian and perfectionist , who often became easy to grasp when a Domspatz musically did not bring top performance .	-6.4328
How do you , as his biographer , assess this final report ?	-3.2781
Michael Hesemann : If you take the trouble and read the entire 440-page report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger actually comes from it .	-6.0153
He has just eight pages dedicated to him , and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of mediation or coexistence in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .	-6.5854
The pre-school violence also took place outside its sphere of action .	-3.9271
At best , he can be accused of being too late or of not taking the first suggestions seriously enough .	-6.1793
The Cathedral Palace gymnasium , on which he acted , was perceived by virtually all respondents as " redemption " , " heaven " and " better world " .	-5.5255
Thus , the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger also presents an excellent testimony , describing him as " warm-hearted " , " beloved " , " sincere " , " competent " and " understanding " , as a very good-hearted teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes , biscuits and sweets and " always surrounded by grapes from children " .	-7.8574
Only a minority complains about its perfectionism and high emotionality , which has led to outbreaks .	-4.2455
He himself admitted years ago , deeply regretted and apologized for the fact that he was not only knocking down with stools and throwing the keyrings on the floor , but also ringing the slap of the earrings and pulling the .	-11.2639
In his honor rescue , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the time in question , in the 1960s and 1970s , among parents and teachers .	-5.7084
Do you still know such breeding methods ?	-2.4985
Of course , I think each of us who was born before 1968 .	-2.1098
I , too , have experienced this in a secular school , a state gymnasium .	-3.5350
Compared to what this report is actually about , namely the appalling sexual abuse and pre-school violence , these are , of course , trivial .	-6.2603
One wonders if it is not more to do with his fame and role as brother of Benedict XVI that many media just crashed on him .	-6.3677
Many people who have never understood him are still working diligently on the Bavarian Pope .	-3.5294
The truth is , however , that the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect .	-4.5420
A great deal has been reported in the media on the subject of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen .	-4.9029
Will Georg Ratzinger be charged in the final report with any involvement or coexistence with regard to sexual abuse ?	-4.0142
Michael Hesemann : quite clearly no .	-2.4393
None of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claims to have entrusted themselves to the master of the cathedral .	-3.6062
Not even the parents were inaugurated .	-1.7576
" I never dared to talk to my father or mother about this , " one of the people concerned said , on behalf of the others , " I was very embarrassed . "	-6.3894
The real problem with investigating sexual abuse was , and still is , that most victims remain silent out of shame . are , . , , , or are . are .	-8.0622
If they did not even entrust themselves to parents and siblings , then certainly not to a choir leader who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators professionally .	-5.7106
How do the Domspatzen students assess Ratzinger ’ s role in the case of abuse ?	-5.0202
Michael Hesemann : An interviewed student put it like this : " With regard to sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he ( Georg Ratzinger ) would have had timely insights and could have stopped the respective perpetrator .	-9.4904
I also think it is absurd to assume that Jacks have opened up more forcefully or more clearly than to their parents , boarders , trustees etc .	-8.3635
That you talk about sex with him ... - unthinkable . '	-3.6247
The report therefore comes to the very clear conclusion : ' The fact that pupils and / or their surroundings were entrusted to him in advance could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation ' .	-6.5932
As far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg Ratzinger must therefore be exempt from any coexistence .	-4.4196
Nor can he be accused of not preventing him or bringing him to the attention .	-9.1073
There is therefore no reason to associate his good name with these reprehensible crimes , as has unfortunately happened in some cases .	-4.2235
In the media , there was much to be read about " violence processes " at the Regensburger Domspatzen .	-5.1915
The former master of the cathedral Georg Ratzinger is accused in the report " Weggen " .	-4.9448
Do he have to live with this accusation ?	-2.9534
Michael Hesemann : This is the big problem that in the reporting everything has been mixed and mixed into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg Ratzinger .	-5.1183
But that is again an abuse of the report .	-3.0632
There is a clean separation : between the pre-school and the grammar school of the Cathedral chapels , between sexual abuse and violence and , let us say , other charges .	-7.0927
In addition , the report deals with incidents since 1945 , including four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choir leader of the Cathedral Chapels .	-6.2236
All the horrendous pedagogy of beating , the cases in which boys from sadist teachers were actually harassed and maltreated and suffered horribly , all occurred at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen , where truly scandalous conditions had to be ruled out .	-8.0069
But Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with them , because he only got the boys to face when they were already on the Domspatzgymnasium .	-4.8003
On that , as most witnesses emphasize , was the subject of " pre-school " taboo .	-3.3272
One was only happy to have escaped her and enjoyed so much better treatment and for many even " paradise " conditions .	-4.0240
What else was there on the Domspatzgymnasium ?	-3.9680
Michael Hesemann : There was discipline , but no sadistic violence .	-2.9342
This also applies to Georg Ratzinger , in which the report concludes that ' many victims appreciate the general humanity of R. and therefore , in many cases , even positive memories are associated with him despite violence ' .	-6.8808
At the very most , the accusation remains of having looked away .	-5.6642
Despite all the efforts , however , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported on pre-school conditions .	-4.7813
The first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish himself and did not want to hear anything about what happened at a school in which he was not acting and responsible ( according to the witness ) , and then again around 1993 .	-7.0176
Georg Ratzinger consistently closed his ears before the conditions ?	-3.6394
Michael Hesemann : No , because as early as 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzgymnasium , which the report even reproduces .	-3.7752
In this he points out to him that ' caning continues in pre-school ' .	-5.7908
In view of the risk of negative press releases , he recommended urgent intervention .	-9.2849
This was , of course , at a time when there was legal clarity , when caning sentences were also banned in Bavaria long ago .	-4.6083
Prior to that , they took place in a grey legal area , as we all know .	-4.0729
It was also difficult for him to assess where the people concerned were perhaps exaggerated or dramatised and where the admissible limit had really been exceeded .	-6.1186
Nor can we say that he has always looked away .	-4.0572
That is simply not true .	-1.3834
Only in 1980 was caning officially abolished in schools in Bavaria .	-3.4228
Prince Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today ’ s educational standards to that time .	-3.5307
What do you see ?	-1.8956
Michael Hesemann : We historians talk about the " fallacy of anachronism " , that is , the danger of assessing the past according to today 's moral standards .	-4.8961
The prince is right .	-5.5127
But that does not , of course , apply to sexual abuse , which was abominable at all times , nor to what was banned in pre-school by the use of violence and resistance to innocent children ’ s souls , which goes far beyond what was normal at the time .	-9.6754
That is all very terrible and I am glad that it is finally being dealt with .	-4.4052
At the same time , however , I must protect Georg Ratzinger , because all this had nothing to do with him .	-3.6900
His means of disciplining and punishing , that is to say , strings of the ear and hair , were widely used in the 1970s .	-10.6504
When physical punishment was banned , he also adhered strictly to it .	-3.8953
What picture of his time in Regensburg did Georg Ratzinger show in the conversations with you for the book " My brother of the Pope " ?	-4.5171
Was the subject of caning also raised ?	-4.1815
Michael Hesemann : Well , the book is about the life of his brother Joseph , that is , Pope Benedict XVI , tells from his perspective , since the Cathedral Chapels played only a minor role .	-5.8390
Nevertheless , I do not conceal the fact that he had a strict regime there .	-5.2769
But this must also be said once again : without this perfectionism , without calling for unconditional discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form a world-class institution from the hitherto rather nationally known Regensburg Cathedral treasures , true cultural ambassadors of Europe and its musical tradition , which went on twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .	-7.6975
With biscuits and bonbones alone , one does not make loathsome boys a great singer and stand before every success , no matter which field , but always discipline , passion and self-overcoming .	-8.3789
As to what kind of person did you experience Georg Ratzinger in the conversations on her book ?	-4.6951
Michael Hesemann : Through the work on the book and beyond , I really got to know Georg Ratzinger very well and experienced him time and again as wonderful , humorous , primordial , deeply believing and heartfelt people , who cannot be imagined that he could suffer from any fly .	-8.9354
I regularly get to know how many former treasures of the Duchy still today , 23 years after his exile , keep in regular contact with him , visit him , read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family .	-7.2962
Those who have not so far forgiven him for being strict with them are clearly in the minority .	-4.9757
Most Cathedral treasures are grateful to him today for enriching their lives and bringing the world of music to them .	-4.7530
And that he was always a good , paternal teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a kind of affectionate supporter , to whom they still look up today and who worship them .	-8.2221
I would like to make it quite clear once again that all the accusations made against him are educational methods that were on the agenda at the time .	-6.7863
We can be glad that we have long since overcome this time .	-3.4480
But it is highly unfair to turn a man into a media scapegoat just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother .	-3.3335
The evil intent behind this is all too obvious .	-2.9706
The report that has just been published relieves it .	-2.5277
Now the decency would require that a 93-year-old man who has earned a great deal of merit and who would not be familiar with the Regensburger Domspatzen outside Bavaria and perhaps even Germany , finally leave him in peace .	-7.8313
