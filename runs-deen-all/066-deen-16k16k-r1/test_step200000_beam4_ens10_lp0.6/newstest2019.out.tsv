The reason was plans to change the name of the National Assembly in the Welsh Parliament .	-6.7185
Members of all parties to the National Assembly are concerned that they may be exposed to mockery .	-4.9048
A Labour Member said that his group is ' ringing with twp and pwp ' .	-3.8543
Note for the reader : “ twp ” in Welsh means “ coated ” and “ pwp ” means “ cake ” .	-3.9949
A meeting member of Plaid Cymru said that the group as a whole was " unhappy " and proposed alternatives .	-2.7333
A Welsh Conservative said that his group would be “ open ” to a change of name , but pointed out that it is only a short verbal leap from “ MWP ” ( a member of the Welsh Parliament ) to “ Muppet . ”	-4.6496
Note : The Welsh letter W is pronounced like the U in English .	-2.8049
The Commission of the National Assembly , which is currently working on a bill for name changes , said : ‘ The final decision on the name of the members of the National Assembly is , of course , up to the members themselves . ’	-5.7354
With the Government of Wales Act 2017 , the Welsh Parliament was given the opportunity to change its name .	-2.7730
In June last year , the Commission published the results of a public hearing on the proposals which gave broad support to the change in names in the Welsh Parliament .	-4.4527
On the issue of the title of the meeting members , the Commission preferred Welsh MPs or WMPs , but the MWP option received the most support in a public consultation .	-5.4300
Members of the Welsh Parliament seem to be proposing alternative options , but the fight to reach a consensus could be a headache for Chairman Elin JONES , who is expected to present a bill for these changes in the coming weeks .	-5.8402
The reform legislation will include changes to the way the Assembly operates , including rules for disqualification of members of the Welsh Parliament and the design of the Auschuss system .	-5.0313

Macedonians hold a referendum on changing the name of the country .	-2.4080
On Sunday , voters will vote to change the country ’ s name to “ Republic of Northern Macedonia . ”	-4.2355
The referendum will be held to resolve a decade-long dispute with neighbouring Greece , in which a province bears the name of Macedonia .	-3.3637
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim to its territory and has repeatedly objected to its application for membership of the EU and NATO .	-3.7149
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov , an opponent of the referendum on the change of name , said that he would ignore the vote .	-9.1473
But advocates of the referendum , including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev , argue that the change in name is simply the price to pay for accession to the EU and NATO .	-3.9114
The bells of St. Martin are mutilating as churches in Harlem have problems .	-4.6722
" Historically , the old people I spoke to said that there was a bar and a church at every corner , " said Mr Adams .	-3.5250
'There is neither today nor today ' .	-3.7517
He said that the disappearance of pubs was understandable .	-1.6231
" People make comtacts in a different way , " he said today .	-3.8120
'Pubs are no longer living rooms in the neighbourhood where you meet regularly ' .	-4.6681
As for churches , he fears that the money from asset sales will not last as long as the leaders expect .	-3.5080
Churches could be replaced by multi-family houses with condominiums filled with the kind of people who will not help the remaining sanctuaries of the district .	-4.2366
The overwhelming majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will know , he said , ' and will therefore speed up the day when these churches are completely closed , as it is unlikely that most of those people who enter these condominiums will become members of these churches ' .	-5.6160
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis in 1870 – Metropolitan Community , St. Martin 's a decade later .	-2.3583
The original white methodological community withdrew in the 1930s .	-3.4083
A black community that practised a religion nearby acquired the building .	-3.6785
St. Martin 's was taken over by a black community under the priest John Howard Johnson , who led a boycott of retailers on the 125th Street , a main street for shopping in Harlem , who opposed the recruitment or promotion of blacks .	-4.6948
A fire in 1939 left the building badly damaged , but when the members of the parish of Father Johnson made plans for reconstruction , they abandoned the bell game .	-5.1996
Parish David Johnson , son of Father Johnson and successor to St. Martin 's , proudly called the bell game " the bells of the poor . "	-3.1412
The expert who played the bell game in July called it another thing : " A cultural treasure " and " an irreplaceable historical instrument " .	-2.8967
The expert , Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan , also noted that it was the first bell game in the world played by a black musician , Dionisio A. Lind , who 18 years ago moved to the larger bell game at the Riverside Church .	-4.0833
Mr Merriweather said that St. Martin 's did not replace him .	-1.8001
What has happened to St. Martin in the last few months has been a complicated history of architects and builders , some of whom have been brought by the church leaders , others by the bishop 's diocese .	-10.6644
The sacristy – the head of the parish made up of guides – wrote to the diocese in July with the concern that the diocese would " try to pass the costs on to the sacristy " , even though the sacristy was not involved in commissioning the architects and contractors of the diocese .	-6.6129
Some members of the community complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese .	-2.5633

On Saturday , a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and hurt him , while in California , on the opening day of the Hummer Season , officials said .	-4.4379
The attack took place just before seven o 'clock in the morning near the beach of Beacon in Encinit.	-3.4932
Chad Hammel said KSWB TV in San Diego that he had dived with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy crying for help , and he was paddled with the others to save him from the water .	-5.9862
“ First I thought someone was happy because he caught a lobster , ” Hammel said , but then I noticed that someone wrote : “ I was bitten ! ”	-4.7366
I was bitten !	-2.3357
His whole key leg was broken up , Hammel said , he found it when he came to the boy .	-5.5247
I shouted to everyone to get out of the water : ' There is a shark in the water ! ' said Hammel .	-9.0475
The boy was brought to the Rady Children 's Hospital in San Diego , where his condition was documented as critical .	-2.8038
Haiart , responsible for the attack , is unknown .	-2.5301
Rescue swimmer Captain Larry Giles said at a media meeting that a shark had been spotted a few weeks earlier in the area , but it was found that it was not a dangerous shark .	-5.1952
Giles added traumatic injuries to the upper body of his victim .	-5.7696
Officials closed access to the beach of Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami 's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for security .	-8.4671
Giles found that there are more than 135 sharks in the area , but most are not considered dangerous .	-2.6251
Sainsbury Plans to conquer the UK Beauty Market	-3.1508
Sainsbury 's takes over Boots , Superdrug and Debenhams with stores style beauty products filled with specialist assistants .	-5.8103
As part of an extensive push into the UK beauty market , which continues to grow and is worth $ 2.8bn , fashion and homeware sales will fall , with the larger 11 branches that tested the country and brought it back to more stores next year to show success .	-7.4933
The idea of investing in the beauty market stems from the fact that supermarkets are looking for ways to use the shelf space used for television , microwaves and household goods for new products .	-5.5804
Sainsbury announced that the range of beauty products will be doubled to 3000 products , including brand names such as Revlon , Essie , Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw .	-4.2040
Existing L 'Oreal , Maybelline , and Burt 's Bees assortment will also gain more space in brand-name areas , similar to those found in stores like Boots .	-6.0906
The supermarket chain is also reviving its own boutique makeup brand , which offers many vegan products that are popular among young buyers .	-6.0614
In addition , Fragrance Shop is testing concessions in two Sainsbury stores , the first of which was opened last week in Croydon , South London , while the second is opened at Selly Oak , Birmingham , at the end of this year .	-5.3048
Online shopping and a shift to the daily shopping of small quantities of food in neighboring shops mean that supermarkets need to do more to get people to visit .	-4.8314
Mike Coupe , the head of Sainsbury 's , has said that the outlets will increasingly look like department stores , as the supermarket chain is trying to fight discounters like Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food .	-4.4700
Sainsbury 's has placed Argos Outlets in hundreds of shops and has also introduced a number of habitats since it bought both chains two years ago , which allegedly strengthened food sales and made the acquisitions more profitable .	-4.7300
The supermarket ’ s earlier attempt to revise its beauty and pharmacy departments ended with a failure .	-3.2408
Sainsbury has tested a joint venture with boats in the early 2000 ’ s , but it ended up squabbling , and revenues from the shops of pharmacies could not be shared .	-5.1749
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury 's sold its 281 branch pharmacy store three years ago for <unk> 125 million to Celesio , the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain .	-2.9924
Lloyds is said to be involved as well , with four Lloyds-Stores seeking to expand the range of luxury skin care products from brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy .	-7.0082
Paul Mills-Hicks , Sainsbury ’ s head of advertising , said : “ We have changed the appearance of our beauty product shelves to improve the equipment for our customers .	-8.6055
In addition , we have invested in the training of employees who are supposed to provide advice to the customer .	-5.1945
Our brand portfolio leaves nothing to be desired .	-3.1464

The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow ’ s Goop brand , and it was assumed that it would double Willoughby ’ s assets of an estimated GBP 11 million .	-3.6979
When Willoughby , 37 , announced on Instagram that she would leave Truly , Jones left Britain and flew to one of his cotta.	-8.4573
One source said , ' It was really high on Holly 's list of priorities ' .	-3.1029
It should be their long-term future and secure it for the coming decades .	-2.8418
Their decision to withdraw left all the parties totally dismayed .	-5.3172
Nobody could believe what happened on Tuesday – so close to the start .	-2.4923
“ Marlow HQ has a warehouse full of goods that can be sold . ”	-2.9094
Experts believe that the departure of the " This Morning " moderator , one of Britain 's most bankable stars , could cost the company millions because they have invested heavily in products such as cushions , candles , clothing , and homewear , and because of the potential for further delays in market introduction .	-5.5091
And it could mean the end of a long friendship .	-1.9598
For ten years , Willoughby and his husband , Dan Baldwin , Jones and his wife Tara Capp have been close .	-2.3953
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones , 52 , joined in March as chairman .	-2.9261
The couples go together and Jones has a 40 % share of Baldwin 's TV production company .	-4.2664
Willoughby is to become a M & S trademark and replace Ant McPartlin as the host of ITV 's I 'm A Celebrity .	-3.4936
A source of information around Jones said yesterday evening : ' We would not comment on his business . '	-4.4586
Tough Talk , and then we fell in love .	-1.1818
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the news media because he would have made a comment that some would regard as " unprivileged " and because he so positively judged the North Korean leader .	-6.6312
Why has President Trump made so many compromises ?	-1.4519
Trump said so in his mocked “ news spokesman . ”	-3.7406
“ I have made no compromises . ”	-1.8707
He noted that Kim is interested in a second meeting after Trump welcomed his first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step toward North Korea ’ s denuclearization .	-3.1985
But denuclearization negotiations are blocked .	-2.6311
More than three months after the Singapore summit in June , Ri Yong Ho , North Korea ’ s leading diplomat , said to United Nations leaders . Saturday ’ s General Assembly said that the North does not see a “ corresponding response ” from the US to North Korea ’ s early disarmament measures .	-4.8741
Instead , he noted , the US is continuing the sanctions to maintain pressure .	-3.6861
Trump took a much more optimistic stance in his rally speech .	-2.1501
“ We are making good progress with North Korea , ” he said .	-1.2583
“ We wanted to wage war with North Korea .	-1.4467
Millions of people would have been killed .	-0.7652
Now we have this great relationship . ”	-2.3369
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have produced positive results , such as ending missile tests , liberating hostages , and transferring the mortal remains of American soldiers home .	-3.7413
And he defended his unusual behavior when he talked about relations with Kim .	-2.4632
" It 's so easy to be presidential , but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this packed arena , about 200 people would be exactly there , " Trump said , pointing to the crowd right before him .	-5.7378
In Indonesia , a tsunami and an earthquake kill hundreds and devastate an island .	-1.3653
After the Lombok earthquake , for example , foreign non-governmental organisations were told that they were not needed .	-2.6732
Although more than 10 % of Lombok ’ s population has been resettled , no national disaster has been declared , a precondition for catalyzing international aid .	-4.0645
Summoning said : ' Unfortunately , in many cases they have made it very clear that they are not asking for international aid , so it is a small challenge ' ,	-4.8463
While Save the Children teams up a team to travel to Palu , it is not yet certain whether foreign staff can work on the spot .	-5.0190

Unfortunately , in the face of the earthquakes that Indonesia is enduring , the country is not well prepared for the forces of nature .	-4.5435
While the tsunami shelters were built in Aceh , what is not customary for other coastal lines .	-4.6966
The obvious absence of a tsunami warning in Palu , although a warning has already been in force , may have contributed to the loss of life .	-4.0391
Even under favourable conditions , travelling between the many islands of Indonesia is difficult .	-3.2973
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated .	-1.2609

The Cromwell Parliament ’ s statue will be rewritten to the recent historic success of the History series .	-5.3056
His banishment would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many British cultural and religious artifacts by his fanatical Puritan followers .	-3.9256
However , the Cromwell Society described Mr Crick 's proposal as ' folly ' and as ' an attempt to rewrite history ' .	-2.8150
John Goldsmith , Chairman of the Cromwell Society , said : “ Given the current debate on the removal of statues , it was inevitable that the figure of Oliver Cromwell would be targeted at Westminster Palace . ”	-3.9083

Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the last century .	-2.8937
Sir William Hamo Thornycroft ’ s magnificent portrayal of Cromwell testifies to the opinion that prevailed in the 19th century and is still prevalent in parts of history : that Cromwell is worth celebrating .	-5.6293
Mr Goldsmith said on Sunday Telegraph : ‘ Cromwell is seen by many , perhaps more in the late nineteenth century than today , as a defender of Parliament against external pressure , in his case of course monarchy .	-4.6614
Whether this is an absolutely correct representation is the subject of the ongoing historical debate .	-2.8897
To be sure , the conflict in the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation , and Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure that stands for one side of the divide .	-4.2456
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth remembering and celebrating them . ”	-2.3941

America Should Double Artificial Intelligence Spending	-2.2316
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence , the US should double its research investment , says Kai-Fu Lee , investor , and AI practitioner who worked for Google , Microsoft , and Apple .	-3.1109
These demands arose after US government officials made announcements about AI , even though the US lacks a formal AI strategy .	-3.8712
Meanwhile , China has presented its plan last year : by 2030 , it will be the number one in AI innovation .	-4.0427
“ doubling spending on AI research would be a good start , given that all the other countries are well behind the US , and a breakthrough in AI research is about to come , ” Lee said .	-4.5650
Doubling funding could double the chances that the next artificial intelligence achievement will be achieved in the US , Lee CNBC said in an interview this week .	-3.4919
Lee , whose book “ AI Superpowers : China , Silicon Valley and the New World Order ( KI superpowers : China , Silicon Valley and the New World Order ) ” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt , is CEO of Sinovation Ventures , a company that has invested in one of China ’ s most , Fac+ .	-3.4899
In the 1980 ’ s , he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on a AI system that defeated the highest American Othello player , later leading Microsoft Research and president of Google ’ s Chinese branch .	-4.9485
Lee has recognized the US government ’ s earlier technology competition , such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency , and asked when the next would take place to identify the next visionaries .	-4.2790
“ Researchers in the US often have to work very hard to obtain government subsidies , ” Lee said .	-3.2067
“ It is not China that is responsible for the outflow of high-ranking scientists , but companies , ” Lee noted .	-3.3931
Facebook , Google , and other technology companies have hired university coryphs to work on KI in recent years .	-3.6006
Lee said that a changed immigration policy could also help the US strengthen its AI efforts .	-3.3426
“ I think Green Cards should automatically be offered to PhD students in AI , ” he said .	-2.9244
In July 2017 , China ’ s Council of State presented its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan .	-2.5834
China ’ s National Natural Science Foundation provides funding for people in academic institutions similar to how the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to US researchers , but the quality of academic work in China is lower , Lee said .	-3.8732
Earlier this year , the US Department of Defense has established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to include partners from industry and science , and the White House has announced the creation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence .	-4.0937

Macedonia votes in a referendum on whether the country 's name should be changed .	-8.3014
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether their name should be changed to ' Republic of Northern Macedonia ' , a step that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece , which had blocked its accession offers to the European Union and NATO .	-4.9455
Greece , which has a province called Macedonia , insists that the name of its northern neighbour represents a territorial claim on the Greek territory , and has vetoed the country 's entry into NATO and the EU .	-3.6314
The two governments concluded an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name , but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority population of Macedonia .	-2.5534
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum , and in the face of a boycott campaign , there are doubts as to whether the outcome will create the 50 % threshold , which is a prerequisite for the validity of the referendum .	-4.7485
The question on the referendum ballot was : ' Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with the adoption of the agreement with Greece ? '	-3.1965
Advocates of the change in names , including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev , argue that it is worth continuing with admission to institutions such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia , one of the countries to emerge from the collapse of Yugoslavia .	-4.4801
“ I have come today to vote on the future of the country ; it is a decision for the young people of Macedonia to be able to live freely under the roof of the European Union , because that means a life in greater security for all of us , ” said Olivera Georgijevska , 79 , in Skopje .	-4.8605
Although not legally binding , enough Members have said that they will stick to the outcome of the vote so that it becomes crucial .	-3.8820
A two-thirds majority in Parliament is required to change the name .	-2.6096
The Landtag Election Committee said at 1 p.m. that there were no reports of irregularities .	-4.7340
But turnout was only 16 % – 34 % at the same time in the last parliamentary election in 2016 , and 66 % of registered voters ended up voting .	-4.0852
“ I voted for my children – our place is in Europe , ” said Gjose Tanevski , 62 , a voter in the capital Skopje .	-3.6074
Macedonia 's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev , his wife Zorica and his son Dushko , voted in favour of the referendum in Macedonia on the change of the name of the country , which would pave the way for him to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica , Macedonia , on 30 September 2018 .	-3.7448
In front of Parliament in Skopje , Vladimir Kavardarkov , 54 , prepared a small stage and put chairs before the tents set up by those who will boycott the referendum .	-3.2725
" We are in favour of NATO and the EU , but we want to participate with the heads up , not through the door of service , " said Kavadarkov .	-3.3178
“ We live in a poor country , but we too have our dignity .	-1.7169
If you do not want to welcome us as Macedonia , we can turn to others , such as China and Russia , to join in Euro-Asian integration . ”	-3.4359
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia , a country with an unemployment rate of more than 20 % .	-1.8973
“ I believe a large majority will vote in favour , because more than 80 % of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO , ” said Zaev after his vote .	-4.0345
According to him , the “ yes ” result would be a “ strengthening of our future . ”	-3.6066
Last Monday , the Macedonian Institute for Political Research published the results of a poll : between 30 and 43 % of voters would participate in the vote – less than necessary . will . will . will . will . will . will .	-8.9458
Another survey conducted by Macedonia ’ s Telma TV found that 57 % of respondents will vote on Sunday .	-2.6627
Of those who want to participate , 70 % agreed to vote ‘ yes ’ .	-3.6858
The referendum will only be adopted if the turnout is over 50 % .	-3.1028

Note : Sergio Aguero of Manchester City overcomes the entire Brighton defense on its way to the gate .	-3.8256
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling completed Brighton 's defense in Manchester City 2 0 victory on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester , England .	-3.1597
Aguero made his hit in the 65th minute look incredibly simple .	-2.6432
At the beginning of the game sequence , the Argentine stormer received a pass in the middle field .	-4.2860
He tricked three defenders of Brighton to free himself .	-3.1872
Then Aguero was surrounded by three green shirts .	-2.0938
He circumvented a defender before he ran several players on the brighton edge of the penalty area .	-4.5380
Then he made a pass to the left and gave to Sterling .	-3.9196
The English stormer used his first contact to play the ball back to Aguero , who then shot right – past Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan to the right side of the goal .	-5.3394
“ Aguero has foot problems , ” City-Manager Pep Guardiola told reporters .	-2.2639
" We talked about it ; he played 55 , 60 minutes .	-2.6240
That has happened .	-1.2185
Fortunately , he scored a goal at the moment . ”	-3.2013
But it was Sterling who first led the Sky Blues at the premier league duel :	-4.1202
The gate came in the 29th minute .	-2.4411
In the game Aguero was played the ball deep in the territory of Brighton .	-2.4008
with a nice steep pass to Leroy Sané along the left side .	-2.9455
Sane made a few touches before he led sterling to the distant post .	-3.3939

Scherzer is Playing Rockies	-4.0622
Since the national players were excluded from Playoff competition , there was little reason to force another start .	-4.3956
But the hard-fought Sherzer hopes to be able to climb the hill on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies , but only if there are still Playoff implications for the Rockies , which have a lead over a game in front of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West .	-5.8808
The Rockies won at least one place in the lead with a 5 : 2 victory over the national team on Friday evening , but the title win in the first league is still not secure .	-7.1900
" Even if we play for free , we can at least bear witness to this , because we know that the atmosphere here in Denver with the people and the other team will probably be the best we have to offer this year .	-5.1132
Why should I not try to do so ? '	-3.5766
The national have not yet announced a start for Sunday , but are supposedly inclined to let jockeys throw in such a situation .	-4.9856
Scherzer , who would start 34th , threw up on Thursday and threw his normal day of rest .	-5.5462

The Labour Party is no longer a broad community .	-1.6228
It is intolerant of those who say what they think .	-0.9892
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to criticize me , it was hardly a surprise .	-2.7175
Finally , I am the last in a number of Labour MEPs to say that we are not welcome - just because we have said our opinion .	-3.9177
My group colleague , Joan Ryan , has been treated similarly because she has been resolutely anti-Semitism .	-3.7710
In my case , I have been criticised by the motion of censure because I do not agree with Jeremy Corbyn .	-2.3261

The communication for the East Labour meeting in Nottingham on Friday states : ' We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive ' .	-3.3109
Most of my time in the eight years as a local Labour MEP was the same as the GC meetings on Friday evening .	-4.3938
Unfortunately , it is not the tone of many meetings today , and the promise of a ' more friendly , softer ' policy has long been forgotten , if it ever started .	-4.1050
It has become increasingly clear that different views in the Labour Party are not tolerated , and each opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to party leaders .	-4.0326
This began shortly after Jeremy took office , because the colleagues with whom I had previously thought I had a similar political attitude expected me to reverse and adopt positions with which I would never have agreed , whether in terms of national security or the EU internal market .	-6.5964
Whenever I express myself publicly – and it does not matter what I say – a tirade of abuse in the social media , which calls for diselection , denounces the policy of the centre , and tells me that I should not be in the Labour Party .	-5.1350
This experience has not only been my experience .	-3.4426
I know , in fact , that there is more luck than some of my colleagues , because the comments that are directed at me tend to be political .	-4.6247
I appreciate the professionalism and determination of my colleagues , who are subjected to a flood of sexist or racist abuse every day , but never shy away .	-4.2918
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the extent of abuse has normalized .	-2.2356
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance .	-1.2816
The reality is that we are no longer the broad church and , with every motion of censure or change of the selection rules , the party becomes smaller .	-4.9467
I have received plenty of advice over the last two years to pull my neck , not to be so vocal , and then I would be “ okay . ”	-5.4889
But that is why I did not come into politics .	-3.1290
32 years ago , I joined Labour as a student because of the Thatcher government ’ s neglect , and this neglect caused my classroom to literally collapse , and as a I have tried to provide better public services to those who need it most .	-13.3679
I have never hidden my political views , even at the last election .	-2.6614
As far as my political positions are concerned , no one in Nottingham East should have been confused in any way , the same applies to areas where I disagree with the current leadership .	-3.9533
To those who supported the motion on Friday , I just want to say that I do not understand why they waste time and energy to remain loyal to me and to the Labour Party when the country is heading for a Brexit that harms households , businesses , and our public services .	-4.5292
But the only message I have is not to Nottingham Momentum , but to my constituents , whether Labour members or not : I am proud to serve you , and I promise you that I will not be deterred by threats of diselection or political opportunism from work in what I believe to be the best interest of all of you .	-4.9690

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose : Ayr Unbeaten at the Top	-2.3206
Two late Tries may have somewhat distorted the end result , but there is no doubt that Ayr deserves to win in this wonderfully entertaining Tennent 's premiership match of the day .	-4.4011
They are now the only unbeaten of the ten teams to execute the table .	-3.6593
In the end , it was due to the outstanding defence of the host , but also to the better use of opportunities .	-6.8459
" We have been tested so far by our games and we are still unbeaten , so I must be happy , " he said .	-3.0183
Robyn Christie von Melrose said , “ Thanks to Ayr , they have made better use of their opportunities . ”	-2.9259
Grant Anderson ’ s attempt in the 14th minute , converted by Frazier Climo , brought Ayr forward , but a yellow card for Scotland ’ s captain Rory Hughes , who was given for the game of Warriors , allowed Melrose to speak numbers , and Jason Baggot to make an unturned attempt .	-5.4490
Climo stretched the leadership of Ayr with a punitive stroke , before he hit a half-time match and then made a solo search with which he managed to complete the 17 : 5 break for Ayr .	-10.5074
Melrose , however , began the second half well and Patrick Anderson 's attempt , transformed from Baggat , reduced the delay to five points .	-4.5935
After the reboot , Ayr started the lead when a try of Stafford McDowall-by Climo was turned .	-8.8855
Ayr 's current captain Blair Macpherson then got the yellow card , and again Melrose made the extra man pay with an unturned Bruce Colvine attempt at the end of a curse of fierce pressure .	-4.2889
The home page , however , came back , and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card from the punitive border for a flip without ball from Climo , MacPherson made a touchdown , the advancing Ayr in his back .	-7.6155
Climo converted , as almost after the reboot , after Kyle Rowe David Armstrong ’ s boxkick started and sent the wing stormer Gregor Henry by passport to try number five .	-6.9838

Throughout Bolivia , the memory of a coastline that was lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still alive - as is the desire to return to the Pacific .	-5.0080
These hopes may be at their peak for decades , as Bolivia waits for a ruling by the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of deliberations .	-4.4567
" Bolivia has the dynamism , the spirit of unity and serenity and , of course , expects the result with a positive view , " said Roberto Calzadilla , a Bolivian diplomat .	-3.8100
Many Bolivians will follow the International Court ’ s ruling on large screens throughout the country , and hope that the tribunal in The Hague will favor Bolivia ’ s claim that Chile must negotiate after decades of troubled talks to provide Bolivia with sovereign access to the sea .	-4.8132
For Evo Morales , Bolivia ’ s charismatic indigenous president – facing a contentious struggle for re-election next year – much depends on Monday ’ s decision .	-3.2964
“ We are about to regain access to the Pacific Ocean , ” he praised at the end of August .	-2.5342
However , some analysts consider it unlikely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia , and believe that even a positive decision for Bolivia will not change .	-4.0386
The Dutch UN body has no power to grant Chilean territory and has established that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks .	-3.7520
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice came about only six months after hearing the final arguments shows that the case was ' not complicated ' , said Paz Zárate , a Chilean expert on international law .	-4.5363
And far from advancing Bolivia ’ s cause , the last four years may have postponed it .	-3.5443
“ The question of sea access is being used by the current Bolivian Government for its purposes , ” Zárate said .	-3.2229
Moral warrior rhetoric has destroyed any remaining Chilean goodwill , it suggested .	-3.2043

The most outstanding piece of Valentino was an exaggerated beige hat decorated with a wide feathered edge that flooded the heads of the models .	-4.6776
Other oversized accessories were watermelons with jewellery , a sorcerer 's hat , and even an pineapple , but they are not intended to keep the head warm .	-5.3082
Thom Browne showed a number of bizarre masks - and just in time for halloween .	-1.5826
Many of the colorful masks had collected lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter rather than Haute Couture .	-3.5129

And if you like this incredible fashion trend , you are lucky .	-2.6807
Style observers predict that the huge hats could pave their way to the main roads near you .	-5.0829
The oversized hats have glued to the heels of " La Bomba " , the straw hat with a 60 cm wide edge that can be seen from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski .	-5.2191
The cult label behind the highly impractical hat injected via social media sent another great creation to the catwalk - a straw strand bag that was almost as large as the swimsuit model it wore .	-5.7465
The orange bast bag , filled with raffia hem and a white leather handle , was the outstanding piece in Jacquemus ' La Riviera SS19 collection on the Paris Fashion Week .	-5.9879
The famous stylist Luke Armitage said FEMAIL : " I expect large hats and beach bags to be seen in the main streets next summer , and because the designer has such an influence , it is hard to ignore the demand for the oversized accessories " .	-6.9604
John Edward : Language skills that are indispensable to global citizens	-3.1019
Independent schools in Scotland have a track record of top academic quality , which continued in 2018 with outstanding auditing results , as well as individual and group success in sport , art , music , and other joint ventures .	-6.3978
With over 30,000 students across Scotland , these schools , represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools ( SCIS ) , are striving to offer their students and parents the best level of service .	-3.5021
Independent schools are designed to prepare students – for further education , even at universities , for their professional careers , and for their role as global citizens .	-5.4082
In the education sector , we have the opportunity to develop and implement a tailor-made school curriculum , noting that modern languages are still popular and desirable in schools .	-4.5962
Nelson Mandela once said this : “ When you talk to a person in the language he understands , you reach his mind . ”	-3.8579
When you speak with him in his own language , he gets to his heart . ”	-3.3995
This impressively illustrates that we cannot rely only on the English language if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries .	-3.8009
This year ’ s test results show that languages are at the top of the tables with the highest levels of existence in independent schools .	-4.6602
68 percent of students who have studied foreign languages have reached the so-called “ Higher grade A ” higher class A .	-4.2161
The data collected by the SCIS ’ s 74 member schools showed that 72 % of students reached a “ Higher grade A ” in Mandarin , while the students who learned German , French , and Spanish were 72 , 69 , and 63 .	-6.3561
This shows that independent schools in Scotland promote foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future .	-2.9824
Language subjects have the same status in independent schools ’ curricula and elsewhere as MINT subjects ( mathematics , information technology , science , and technology ) .	-4.5355
A 2014 survey by the UK Employment and Qualifications Commission found that 17 % of the reasons why employers had difficulty filling vacancies are attributable to a lack of language skills .	-5.0790
Therefore , language skills are becoming increasingly necessary in order to prepare young people for their professional future .	-8.4954
With more promising employment opportunities that require languages , these skills are essential in a globalised world .	-3.7963
Regardless of the career that someone chooses when he has learned a second language , he will have a real advantage in the future with a lifelong ability like this .	-4.2782
With the ability to communicate directly with people from abroad , a multilingual person will automatically be ahead of competitors .	-3.8823
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013 , 75 % were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to talk , and French is the only language spoken with a two-digit percentage , 15 % .	-3.7285
That is why the current investment in language teaching is important for today 's children .	-3.9377
When children learn to speak several languages – particularly those of developing countries – they will later have better chances of finding meaningful employment in the labour market .	-4.2580
Schools in Scotland are different in terms of language .	-4.0614
Some schools focus on classical modern languages , while other languages that are most important to Britain in 2020 , such as Mandarin or Japanese .	-3.7730
Whatever your child is interested , there will always be a number of languages available in independent schools , with teachers specialized in this field .	-3.9821
Independent schools in Scotland want to provide a learning environment that prepares children well , and they should be given the necessary tools for their success , whatever the future may bring .	-5.3235
In today ’ s global business world , languages remain undeniably important for the country ’ s future , and this must also be reflected in education .	-3.5082
Indeed , modern languages should really be regarded as “ international communication skills . ”	-2.5005
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice , diversity and top quality to young people in Scotland .	-2.8848

It is the first of five planned election events next week , with Trump visiting the republican states of Tennessee and Mississippi on his tour .	-4.9568
While his candidate ’ s confirmation of the vacant Supreme Court position is still pending , Trump must mobilize his electorate for the upcoming midterm elections , otherwise it is to be feared that the Republicans will lose the majority in Congress when elected in November .	-6.0313

Trump will certainly respond to the hearings this week about allegations of sexual abuse against his Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh , whose confirmation in the Senate ’ s office was postponed by at least one week until the FBI investigation was completed .	-5.9900
But the main goal of these electoral events is to mobilize the Republicans , who face a crucial election in November .	-4.5981
According to Reuters , the goal of Trump ’ s campaign is to mobilize volunteers and supporters in the next week ’ s five electoral events to defend and expand the majority of Republicans in the Senate and House of Representatives .	-4.1641
“ The majority in Congress is on the president ’ s agenda , so he visits as many states as possible just before the start of the turbulent campaign season , ” a Trump campaign spokesman , who does not want to be named by name , said Reuters .	-5.8951
According to the West Virginia MetroNews radio network , this evening ’ s Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract Ohio and Pennsylvania supporters and attract the attention of Pittsburgher media .	-3.8376
On Saturday , Trump will visit West Virgina , the state he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016 , for the second time this month .	-2.2856

According to Reuters , Simon Haeder , a political scientist at the University of West Virginia , said that it is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must come to improve his polls .	-3.9208
Ryder Cup 2018 : Team USA is ready to fight to maintain hope for Sunday ’ s singles .	-4.1765
After three one-sided encounters , the four matches on Saturday afternoon were probably exactly what the Ryder Cup needed .	-3.5478
The vibrating pendulum is a freely invented sport concept that players have internalized , especially in competitions such as these .	-4.9662
So where would they say is the momentum now ?	-1.9712
“ They have had a six-point lead , and now there are four , so it gives us a bit of momentum , ” Jordan Spieth said when he retired for the day . ”	-5.3367
Europe is , of course , in an advantage of 4 points , and 12 others are still to be played .	-5.4070
The Americans , as Spieth says , feel a little wind in their sails , and there was much encouraging for them , not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas , who played together all day and each has three out of four points .	-5.5230
Spieth was superior from the beginning and set a good example .	-3.3903
These bogus jubilee screams became louder when his hand went on , he squeezed a decisive putt to win a draw in game 4 after he and Thomas lacked 2 points after 2 games . , , , . , , , , , , , . , ,	-13.5646
His joy at the putt on the 15th hole with which they won the game was such that they thought he still believed in the American victory .	-5.3942
" You really have to concentrate and only worry about your own game , " said Spieth .	-3.5539
This is all that remains for each of those players . . is , , , , , , and .	-7.2046
18 holes to leave an impression .	-2.7367
In the last two days , Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood were the only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas .	-3.2374
Europe ’ s strange but admirable couple plays flawlessly and simply does everything right .	-9.6096
" Moliwood " was the only couple who did not get a bogey on Saturday afternoon , but they also avoided it on Saturday morning , Friday afternoon and Friday morning the rear nine .	-5.2765
This race and the way their energy seems to flow to and from this missed crowd of spectators makes them the favourites on Sunday , and when the sun goes down over Le Golf National , there would be no more popular player who seals a possible European victory than Fleetwood or Molinari .	-10.3494
Probably both at the same time on different holes .	-2.0498
Talking about European victory now would be too hasty .	-3.3755
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short process with Sergio Garcia , who was victorious with his partner Alex Noren in the morning .	-2.4937
With a bogey and two doubles at the first nine , the Spaniards and the Swede entered a hole from which they never came out again .	-5.2051
On Sunday there is no one to help you out of your hole .	-3.1303
Because of the interactions between the pairs , the given advice , the non-given advice and the way in which a strategy can change in a matter of minutes , it is very fascinating to observe the Foursocks and Foursomes from close proximity .	-8.1413
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken a clear lead in the last day , but this Foursome-session has also shown that the US team has the desire to fight , something that some , particularly Stateside , have doubted .	-6.4695
Europe Leads 10-6 at Ryder Cup Final Day	-2.3207
Europe will use a solid advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after it emerged from the four and four matches on Saturday with a 10-6 lead over the United States .	-4.7018
The inspired Duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the group with two victories over a fighting Tiger Woods to score four points on their previous record in the Le Golf National .	-4.6886
The European team of Thomas Bjorn , who fought to preserve the trophy that she lost two years ago in Hazeltine , dominated an American team fighting with racers in the morning , and won the series with 3-1 .	-6.8331
The US offered more resistance in the four , winning two games , but it could not digest the deficit .	-3.0005
Jim Furyk 's team needs eight points from the 12 singles from Sunday to keep the trophy .	-4.1598
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four consecutive points , while he and Molinari , after a sensational weekend called " Molliwood " , are only the second pair who wins four points from their first four matches in the history of the Ryder Cup .	-3.2717
After destroying Woods and Patrick Reed in the Fourballs , it was considered certain that they would beat an even clearer Woods and the American Rookie Bryson Dechambeau through an even clearer 5 & 4 .	-4.7683
Woods , who ran through two matches on Saturday , occasionally showed brilliant actions , but he has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in four balls and four and seven in succession .	-5.6046
Justin Rose , rested for the morning football , returned to his partner Henrik Stenson in Foursomes and beat in a 2 & 1 defeat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – place one and three in the world .	-3.9544
On a pleasant , airy day southwest of Paris , however , Europe did not have it in its own way .	-2.4897
The three main winners , Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas , set the benchmark for Americans on Saturday with two points .	-3.7921
They won a brave 2 : 1 victory against the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-pack and returned later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 : 3 in the four-pack after losing the first two holes .	-3.9832
Just twice in the Ryder Cup history , a team returns from a four-point deficit to the singles , although Halter Furyk 's side only needs a draw to keep the trophy .	-3.6625
After two days of second time , however , a Sunday counterpart looks like it would go beyond it .	-5.7705
North Korea says that there will be “ no ” unilateral disarmament without confidence .	-3.2350
North Korea ’ s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions would deepen its mistrust of the United States , and that the country would under no circumstances unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons .	-3.7459
Ri Yong Ho said to the annual general assembly of the world body that North Korea last year took " significant goodwill measures " , such as the cessation of nuclear and missile tests , the dismantling of the nuclear test site , and the obligation not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology .	-5.7804
" There is no corresponding answer from the USA , " he said .	-3.1593
“ Without any confidence in the US , there will be no confidence in our national security , and in such circumstances , there is no way that we can disarm ourselves unilaterally first . ”	-7.8116
While Ri retreated the well-known North Korean complaints about Washington ’ s opposition to a “ gradual ” approach to denuclearization , in which North Korea would be rewarded with gradual steps , his explanation seemed significant in that it did not completely reject unilateral denuclearization , as Pyongyang did in the past .	-5.5380
Ri referred to a joint declaration by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a first summit between a US incumbent president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12 , when Kim pledged to work towards " denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula , " while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea 's security .	-4.9371
North Korea has sought a formal end to the Korean War in 1950-53 , but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons .	-3.1634
Washington has also resisted calls for a relaxation of the harsh international sanctions against North Korea .	-3.5992
The US insists on " denuclearization first " ( first denuclearization ) and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its purpose in a compelling manner , even rejecting the " declaration of the end of the war " , Ri said .	-5.5190
" The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a dream for the people who are ignorant of us .	-3.8695
But the problem is that continued sanctions are exacerbating our mistrust . ”	-2.8619
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump , which the US president emphasized at the United Nations earlier this week .	-3.7026
The minister instead highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the last five months and added : " If the party were South Korea and not the US on this issue of denuclearization , the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have reached such an impasse . "	-5.6094
Still , the tone of Ri ’ s speech was dramatically different from that of last year ’ s US administration . The General Assembly , which targeted the US mainland with North Korea ’ s missiles , was inevitable after “ Mr. Evil President ” Trump Kim called a “ rocket man ” on a suicide mission .	-5.5697
This year at the United Nations , Trump , who last year threatened to “ destroy ” North Korea , praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm , but he also said that much work had to be done , and sanctions must remain in place until North Korea destroyed denuclearization .	-4.6562
On Wednesday , Trump said that he did not have a timeframe for this , saying , " It does not matter whether it takes two years , three years or five months . "	-4.5052
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken .	-1.4667
However , in the United States Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday that : ' The enforcement of the Security Council sanctions must be continued vigorously and without defects until we realize the complete , final and verified denuclearization ' .	-5.6201
Since 2006 , the Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea in order to prevent the financing of Pyongyang ’ s nuclear and ballistic missile programs . have been . , , , and have been . , , , , and .	-9.6698
Pompeo met Ri on the margins of the UN General Assembly and then said that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit .	-3.0095
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year , but his last trip was not good .	-2.4375
He left Pyongyang in July , saying that progress had been made , and only a few hours later , North Korea condemned him to have made “ gang-like demands . ”	-5.4346
At a meeting with Moon this month , North Korea pledged to dismantle a rocket site and also a nuclear complex if the United States takes ' appropriate action ' .	-4.7915
He said Kim told him that the " appropriate measures " he sought were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore , and steps to normalize relations with Washington .	-3.6978
Harvard students take part in the course to find enough rest .	-3.0702
With a new course this year at Harvard University , all students get more sleep to fight against the growing macho culture of studying caffeine " spent nights " .	-4.9722
A scientist has found that students at a world-leading university are often unaware of helping themselves , even when it comes to very simple mechanisms .	-4.1329
Charles Czeisler , professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women 's Hospital , designed the course that he considered to be the first of its kind in the US .	-4.2838
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the impact of lack of sleep on learning .	-3.3198
In the end , a girl came to me and said : " Why is this only now , in my final year ?	-4.5552
She said that she never told anyone about the meaning of sleep – which surprised me , " he told the telegraph .	-3.7661
The course , which is being offered for the first time this year , explains to students the basics of how good sleeping habits promote academic and sporting performance and improve their general wellbeing . , , , , and , or , , , , , , , or .	-9.8091
Paul Barreira , Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Managing Director of the University ’ s Health Service , said that the university decided to introduce the course after finding that students had been sleeping extremely little during the week .	-5.2344
The 1-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks .	-2.7768
In a section , there is an image of a sleeping room where students click on coffee cups , curtains , coaches and books to be informed about the effects of caffeine and light and how the sporting performance is influenced by lack of sleep and the importance of a sleep time routine .	-5.9957
Another section explains how long-term sleep loss can increase the risk of heart attack , stroke , depression , and cancer .	-3.7178
A map of the campus with interactive symbols encourages participants to think about their daily lives .	-3.2176
We know that it will not change students ' behaviour immediately .	-2.7383
" But we believe that they have a right - just as you have a right to know the health effects of the decision to smoke cigarettes , " added Professor Czeisler .	-3.6407
The culture of pride to go through a " night " still exists , he said , and added that modern technology and increasing pressure on students and students makes sleep deprivation a growing problem .	-4.5580
To have enough sleep of good quality should be a student 's " secret weapon " to fight stress , exhaustion and fear , he said - also to not accept as sleep deprivation puts the brain into hunger mode and makes it constantly hungry .	-6.3736
Raymond So , a 19-year-old Californian who studied chemical and physical biology , helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes in his first year in Harvard last year .	-3.9465
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to push for a campus-wide course .	-2.7971
The next step , he hopes , is to call on all PhD students to undertake a similar study program before entering the competition college .	-4.6870
Prof. Czeisler recommended the students to set an alarm when they go to bed and when they should wake up , and to be aware of the harmful effects of the " blue light " broadcast by electronic screens and LED lighting , which can bring their circular rhythm out of the clock , causing problems during sleep .	-7.7200
Livingston 1-0 Rangers : Mengas Goal Erds Gerrard ’ s Men	-2.1428
Other Rangers Outside Problems : After a match by Dolly Menga , Livingston lost 1-to-0 for Steven Gerrard ’ s team .	-6.3646
The Ibrox team wanted to record their first victory since the 4 : 1 triumph in February in St. Johnstone , but Gary Holt ’ s team added Gerrard ’ s second defeat in 18 matches as a coach , leaving his team eight points behind the disappointing Ladbroke ’ s premiership chief Hearts .	-6.2074
Menga landed a hit seven minutes before the half-time , and an inspirational ranking did not look like it could strike a balance .	-6.1218
While the rangers now fall to sixth place , Livingston climbs to third place and lies only behind Hibernian because of the pitch difference .	-6.4884
New difficulties for the rangers are emerging , as liner Calum Spence had to provide a head wound after he was hit by a litter – apparently thrown out by the sector of foreign fans .	-8.2057
Gerrard made eight changes to the side , which passed to Ayr and swept directly into the semi-final of the Betfred Cup .	-6.5075
However , he set up the same Livi-Elf , who took the Hearts a point last week , and he should have been thrilled by how his well-trained team never left the opponents room for action .	-9.2920
The Rangers dominated ball ownership , but Livingston did better .	-5.5512
They should have met after only two minutes , when Menga ’ s first offender , Scott Pittman , sent him to Allan McGregor ’ s goal , but the midfielder abandoned his big change at the goal .	-6.1973
A deep blow from Keaghan Jacobs then went to Captain Craig Halkett , but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only shoot far behind the post .	-3.8627
The rangers took control , but there seemed to be more hope than getting into their own game , in the last third .	-4.8898
After the first quarter of an hour , Alfredo Morelos clearly thought he had earned an elfmeter after he and Steven Lawless collided , but Arbitrator Steven Thomson did not respond to the Colombian appeals .	-5.4896
The rangers only get two shots in the first half , but the former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was scarcely to get out of the rest of Lassana Coulibaly ’ s head jump and hit a bizarre Ovie Ejaria .	-11.4657
Although Livi ’ s opening match may have been contrary to the course of the game in the 34th minute , no one can deny that they deserved it alone for their efforts .	-5.0798
Again , the rangers failed to master a standard Jacobs situation .	-2.6772
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher Scott Robinson played the ball that kept the calm and picked Menga out for a simple finish .	-9.6259
Gerrard acted during the break when he swapped Coulibaly against Ryan Kent , and the change immediately affected the game when the wing player played to Morelos , but the impressive Kelly ran from his line to block .	-5.0989
But Livingston always moved guests to play the kind of game they like , with lithgow and necklace having long balls .	-5.3859
Holt ’ s team could have expanded its leadership in the final phase , but McGregor was well on to deny Jacobs before Lithgow was knocked over from the corner . were not .	-7.5776
The Rangers-Representative Glenn Middleton had another late claim to a penalty because he got married to Jacobs , but again he saw Thomson look away .	-6.3170

And now a page from our almanac “ Sunday morning ” : September 30 , 1882 , which was more than 136 years ago ... The day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm , called Hans , was born Geiger in Germany .	-4.1933
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity , an invention that eventually produced the device known as a violin counter .	-4.5846
Since then , the violinist has also become a mainstay of science , as in the 1950s of the film " Bells of Coronado " , the seemingly unlikely cowboy scientist Rogers and Dale Evans .	-6.8792
Man : ' What about everything in the world is this ? '	-2.9758
Rogers : “ It is a vulture counter used to find radioactive minerals like uranium .	-3.5222

New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to " see " and kill malignant cells .	-2.1541
Vaccine teaches the immune system to detect malignant cells as part of treatment .	-1.8895

A study vaccine shows promising results in patients with a range of cancers .	-2.9188
A woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to detect rogue cells saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months .	-2.4336
The method is to extract immune cells from a patient , modify them in the laboratory , so that a protein called HER2 becomes “ visible ” that occurs in many cancers , and then inject the cells again .	-3.9986
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda , Maryland , said : " Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine . "	-2.2697
HER2 “ promotes the growth of various types of cancer ” , including breast , egg , lung and intestinal cancer , explained Prof. Berzofsky .	-3.7521
A similar approach to removing immune cells from patients and teaching them how to attack cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukaemia .	-3.8059

The Saturday-Night-Live show began with a sketch in which Hollywood star Matt Damon made fun of Brett Kavanaugh ’ s statement before the Senate ’ s Judicial Committee on Christine Blasey Ford ’ s accusations that Kavanaugh had sexually coerced her .	-4.4665
Although it was not broadcast , the film material by Wests Geschwantz was divided into social media by the comedian Chris Rock .	-5.0766
It is unclear whether rock has tried to mock West with the contribution .	-3.8924
West , too , had complained to the audience that he had a hard time behind the stage because of his headgear .	-4.3373
" They harassed me behind the stage .	-1.7255
You said : ' Don 't go out with your hat ' .	-4.1521
You have annoyed me !	-2.2488
And then they say that I am in a abandoned place , " he said , according to the Washington Examiner .	-2.5752
West continued : " Do you want to see the sunken place ? " and said that he " my Superman cloak , because that means you cannot tell me what to do , you the world is ?	-6.1715

“ lies , lies , and even more disgusting lies , ” Waters said in a statement on Twitter .	-4.4328
According to reports , the private addresses and telephone numbers of US Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina , as well as US Senators Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch , both from Utah , were included .	-4.3961
The information appeared online Thursday , posted by an unknown person on the Capitol Hill during a hearing of the Senate on allegations of sexual misconduct against the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh .	-3.8124
The data of the three senators was published shortly after the Kavanaugh survey .	-2.4931
Conservative websites like Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with Waters ' office and published the information of an employee of Waters , reports Hill .	-4.4133
“ This unfounded charge is completely wrong and an absolute lie , ” Waters continued .	-3.4243
“ The employee among my employees – whose identity , personal information , personal data , and security were impaired as a result of these fraudulent and false claims – was in no way responsible for this information being concealed .	-4.3828
This unfounded claim is completely wrong and an absolute lie .	-3.6581
Waters statement quickly brought online criticism , including by the former press secretary of the White House Ari Fleisch.	-3.9047
“ It is extremely annoying that the matter is denied , ” says Fleischer .	-4.7043
“ This suggests that she is unsuitable as a congress member .	-3.1316
If someone is accused of doing something , he must not be evil .	-2.5613
They must not be upset .	-3.7529
You must not question the motives of the plaintiff .	-2.1238
They must be calm and calm ” .	-3.3431
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters ’ response with the Democrats ’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh , accused by critics of appearing too angry during the Thursday hearing .	-3.9801
Omar Navarro , a Republican candidate standing next to the sedentary Waters in the midterm elections , also expressed his thoughts on Twitter .	-4.6662
“ Big , if true , ” he bet .	-3.0488
In her statement , Waters said that her office " informed the competent authorities and law enforcement authorities about the fraudulent claims .	-3.5204
“ We will ensure that the perpetrators are captured and held accountable for their actions , which have a destructive and dangerous effect on my staff , ” she continued .	-4.5224
Review of " Johnny English – One Lives Only Three " – Poor Parody with Rowan Atkinson	-6.0412
It is a tradition to seek insights in every new film with a British tendency for Brexit , and this seems to be applicable to this revival of the Johnny English Action-Comedy Spoof franchise , which began in 2003 with Johnny Deutsch and was re-launched in 2011 with " Johnny English Reborn " .	-7.1009
Is the ironic self-satire about humanity ’ s abyss the new export possibility of the nation ?	-4.0101
In any case , the glossy , gummy and incompetent Johnny English has been granted the second license to recast things .	-14.0975
He is , of course , the stupid secret agent who , despite his bizarre claims to Smoothie-Glamour , got a bit of clouseau , a spritter Mr. Bean and a clack from this guy , and who contributed a single note to the fire-fighters ' melody at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics .	-7.4602
It is also based on the traveller and international , mysterious Atkinson , who once played a part in the now forgotten Barclaycard television ads , always leaving chaos behind .	-5.1781
There are one or two beautiful moments in this latest Johnny English comedy .	-1.9747
I loved Johnny English , who is approaching a helicopter in a medieval armour and beats the main rotor shortly against his helmet .	-4.5575
Atkinson 's talent for body comedy is to be seen , but the humor feels rather weak and strangely superfluous , especially since the " serious " film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible self-confident offer comedy as an ingredient .	-5.1126
The humour feels like it is directed at children rather than adults , and for me the crazy misgivings of Johnny English are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson 's Mr. Bean silent films .	-4.1043
The everlasting premise is that Britain is in great trouble .	-3.0655
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the highly secret British network of spies and revealed the identity of all British agents on the ground , to the horror of the serving agent – a unfortunately small role for Kevin Eldon .	-4.3184
Emma Thompson is doing her best with this quasi-teresa May figure , but there is not much in the script to work with .	-4.4257
Their intelligence advisers inform them that , as each active spy has been compromised , it has to get someone out of retirement .	-5.1310
And that means the great Johnny English himself , who is now employed as a schoolmaster in a noble institution , but gives unsurpassed lessons about how to operate as an undercover agent : some nice gags here , while English offers a School of Rock Academy on espionage .	-5.8568
English is returned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his former , long-suffering Kumpel Bough , played again by Ben Miller .	-4.1154
Bough is now a married man who meets a submarine commander , an overtired burschikosis , in which Vicki Pepperdine is not entirely applicable .	-5.9952
So the Batman and Robin of Chaos at the Secret Service of their Majesty are back in action and meet Olga Kurylenkos beautiful Femme Fatale Ophelia Bulletova .	-2.7742
Meanwhile , the Prime Minister is dangerously caught by the charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain ’ s computer problems : the dark Jason Volta , played by Jake Lacy .	-3.8334
English and Bough begin their Odyssey of the colourful Highjinks : as waiters , they ignite a French flash-restaurant ; they create chaos by smuggling on board Volta ’ s luxury yacht ; and English triggers anarchy as he tries to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta ’ s house with a virtual reality headset .	-6.1534
All the registers have certainly been drawn for this last sequence , but as amiable and omitted it is , the whole thing is reminiscent of child television .	-7.3100
Quite moderate .	-1.8182
And as with the other Johnny English-movies , I could not help thinking : can the British film industry Rowan Atkinson not give a role that really does justice to its talent ?	-5.2225
Labour denies having developed a plan for Britons for a four-day week for which five days are paid .	-3.4978
Jeremy Corbyn ’ s Labour Party is reviewing a radical plan in which Britons work only four days a week , but are paid for five .	-3.3798
According to reports , the party wants corporate leaders to pass on the savings made by the AI revolution to workers by giving them an extra day .	-4.4690
Staff would enjoy a three-day weekend - but still bring the same money back home .	-8.6821
Sources said that the idea would " fit " with the party 's economic agenda and plans to overturn the country for the benefit of workers .	-4.1465
The trade union congress approved the transition to a four-day week as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy .	-4.7304
A senior Labour source said the Sunday Times that a policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year .	-4.1939
A four-day week is an objective that is consistent with the party ’ s approach to restoring the economic balance for the benefit of workers and the party ’ s general industrial strategy , but that objective will not be achieved overnight .	-5.6987
The Labour Party would not be the first to advocate such an idea , as the Green Party promised a four-day working week during its 2017 campaign .	-2.7661
However , the Labour Party as a whole does not support this move .	-4.2722
A Labour spokesman said : ' A four-day week is not a party policy and is not intended by the party ' .	-3.3289
Chancellor of the Exchequer John McDonnell used the Labour Party Conference last week to flesh out his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy .	-3.5122
Mr McDonnell said that he was determined to regain the power of ' faceless directors ' and ' profit-makers ' in utilities .	-3.7733
The shadow chancellor ’ s plans also mean that the current shareholders of water companies may not get their full share back , as a Labour government could “ deduct ” due to alleged misconduct .	-7.0903
He also confirmed the plans to appoint employees in company management and to create inclusive ownership funds to distribute 10 % of the equity of private sector companies to employees who receive annual dividends of up to <unk> 500 .	-4.4549
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk in “ 60 minutes ” about whether the FBI investigation against Kavanaugh could change its mind .	-2.9619
Following an ongoing FBI investigation into charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh , the final vote to appeal the judge to the Supreme Court was postponed by at least a week , and the question is raised as to whether the FBI ’ s investigation results could lead Republican senators to abandon their support for Kavanaugh .	-5.7899
In an interview broadcast on Sunday , Scott Pelley , correspondent of “ 60 minutes ” , interviewed Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham on whether the FBI ’ s findings could encourage them to change their minds .	-4.6426
Kennedy appeared more open-minded than his colleague from South Carolina .	-2.1661
“ In any case , ” Kennedy said .	-1.6900
" I said at the beginning of the hearing that I have spoken with Judge Kavanaugh .	-1.9381
I called him after that happened after this claim came out , I said : ' Have you done it ? '	-3.7169
He was determined , targeted and unequivocal . '	-3.1128
Graham 's voice , however , seemed cast in stone .	-2.8059
" I have an opinion about board Kavanaugh and it would need a bomb charge , " he said .	-2.8140
" Dr. Ford , I don 't know what happened , but I know that Brett vehemently denied the charge , " added Graham with a reference to Christine Blasey Ford .	-4.2454
" No one she called could confirm it .	-2.7772
It was 36 years ago .	-1.1282
I see nothing new that is changing . '	-2.3048
'What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it ensured that poverty is reduced ? '	-2.3552
This Saturday , the Global Citizen Festival will be held in New York , an annual music event with an impressive selection of stars and an equally impressive mission to end poverty in the world .	-9.3324
This year ’ s Seventh Global Citizen Festival will bring tens of thousands of people together at the Great Lawn in Central Park to experience not only stars like Janet Jackson , Cardi B and Shawn Mendes , but also to draw attention to the true goal of the event : ending extreme poverty by 2030 .	-4.5229
The Global Citizen Festival , which took place in 2012 , is an extension of the Global Poverty Project , an international interest group aimed at combating poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it .	-3.6525
In order to obtain a free ticket for the event , concert visitors had a whole series of tasks or " actions " , such as volunteering , sending an email to a leader in the world , a telephone call or other useful ways to increase the goal of poverty reduction and raise awareness of it .	-7.3308
But how successful has Global Citizen been with 12 years left to achieve its goal ?	-2.6258
Is the idea to reward people with a free concert , a real way to convince people to call for action , or simply another case of so-called " clicktivism " - people who feel that sending a tweet by signing an online petition or application , or by sending a tweet , would make a real difference ?	-5.8425
Global Citizen says that it has recorded more than 19 million “ actions ” by its supporters since 2011 , pushing for a variety of goals .	-3.2654
It is said that these actions have motivated world leaders to make financial and political commitments worth more than $ 37 billion , which will affect the lives of more than $ 2.25 billion by 2030 .	-3.6778
In early 2018 , the Group launched 390 stakes and announcements from its actions , of which at least $ 10 billion has already been paid out or financed .	-3.3933
The group estimates that the funds provided so far have had a direct impact on almost 649 million people around the world .	-3.3570
Among the most important commitments , The Power of Nutrition , a UK based partnership of investors and executives committed to “ help children develop their full potential . ” The organization has pledged $ 35 million to help Rwanda end malnutrition in the country after more than 4,700 tweets have been received by Global Citizen .	-5.7766
“ With the support of the British government , donors , other state governments , and global citizens like you , we can make the social injustice of malnutrition one day history , ” The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman announced the crowd in a live concert in London in April 2018 .	-4.1744
The group also said that , after more than 5,000 actions in the UK aimed at improving maternal and child nutrition , the government will achieve the funding of the Power of Nutrition project for 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions .	-5.1495
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on their website , “ Why do you think that we can end extreme poverty ? ”	-2.6744
Global citizens responded : it will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will fall and fail .	-2.7177
Like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us , we will succeed , because we are more powerful together .	-3.1592
the stars Janet Jackson , Weeknd , Shawn Mendes , Cardi B and Janelle Monáe will perform at this year 's event in New York , hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman .	-3.6153
US could use the Navy to create a “ blockade ” to impede Russian energy exports – Interior Minister	-3.6991
Washington can use its navy “ if necessary ” to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets , including in the Middle East , US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke is quoted by the Washington Examiner .	-3.8896
Zinke claimed that Russia ’ s engagement in Syria was a pretext for exploration of new energy markets , especially in activities at the invitation of the legitimate government .	-5.0053
“ I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate energy , just as they do in Eastern Europe , the southern part of Europe , ” he said .	-3.1102
And , according to officials , there are ways and means to deal with it . is . , , , , , , , , , , ,	-7.1876
" The United States has this ability to use our navy to ensure that the sea routes are open and , if necessary , to block them in order to ensure that their energy does not come onto the market , " he said .	-4.7033
Zinke spoke to the participants of an Consumer Energy Alliance event , a non-profit organization that calls itself the “ voice of energy consumers ” in the US .	-3.7101
He compared Washington ’ s approaches to Russia and Iran , and found that they are indeed the same .	-3.1172
" The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less to use and replace fuels , " he said , while calling Russia a " one-trick pony " with an economy dependent on fossil fuels .	-6.1577
The opinions come while the Trump administration was on the mission of boosting the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe and replacing Russia , the much more favorable option for European consumers .	-4.5329
So members of the Trump administration – including US President Donald Trump himself – are trying to get Germany to stop the “ unreasonable ” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project that , according to Trump , would turn Berlin into Moscow ’ s “ prisoner . ”	-4.4202
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $ 11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline , which is supposed to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres , is a purely economic project .	-3.3119
The Kremlin argues that Washington ’ s opposition to the project is simply driven for economic reasons , and is an example of unfair competition .	-2.4267
“ I believe we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument to exert pressure , and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers , ” said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak , after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September .	-3.9426
The US ’ s stance has provoked a backlash from Germany , which has confirmed its commitment to the project .	-4.1713
Germany ’ s leading industrial organization , the Bundesverband Deutscher Industrien ( BDI ) , has called on the US to refrain from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow .	-3.7936

Sarah Palin quoted Track Palin ’ s PTSD at Donald Trump ’ s Campaign	-2.2150
Track Palin , 26 , spent a year in Iraq after being convened in September .	-1.7574
He was arrested and accused on Monday evening of an incident involving domestic violence .	-3.8120
“ Against the background of what my own son is going through after he has returned , I can understand other families who are feeling the impact of PTSD and some of the injuries our soldiers are going back with , ” she said to the audience in a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa , Oklahoma .	-6.5047
Palin described his arrest as “ the elephant in the room , ” and said about her son and other veterans : “ They return a little differently ; they return harder ; they come back and wonder if the work of their fellow soldiers and the air force and all the other members of the military is respected for the country . ”	-6.3637

18 states D. C. support the challenge of a new asylum policy .	-2.5118
18 states and Washington , DC support a legal challenge to a new US policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence .	-3.4095
According to NBC News , representatives from the 18 states and the district submitted an Amicus Curiae ( Friend of the Court ) in Washington on Friday to help an asylum seeker challenge the law .	-3.8752
The full name of the plaintiff in the lawsuit Grace vs. Sessions , filed in August by the American Civil Liberties Union against the Federal Law , is not known .	-4.7106
She said that her partner " and his violent sons of band members " had abused them , but on 20 July US officials refused to apply for asylum .	-3.8268
She was arrested in Texas .	-0.7303
The lawyers of the states that support Grace called El Salvador , Honduras , and Guatemala , which comprise a large number of asylum seekers in the US , as nations facing profound problems with ties and domestic violence .	-4.5925
The US ’ s new asylum policy reversed a decision by the 2014 complaints chamber for immigrants that undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence can apply for asylum .	-4.4158
The Secretary of Justice of the District of Columbia Karl Racine said in a Friday statement that the new law ignores decades of state , federal , and international law .	-3.1675
The Amicus Curiae states that , according to federal law , all asylum applications must be assessed in accordance with the circumstances of the respective complaint and such action violates this principle .	-5.2708
Lawyers continued to argue in the letter that the policies that deny immigrants entry damage the US economy , because it is more likely that these immigrants will become entrepreneurs and do “ necessary work . ”	-5.0703
Prosecutor General Jeff Sessions instructed immigration judges in June not to grant asylum to persons fleeing home or gang attorney .	-4.6048
“ Asylum is for those who have to leave their homeland because of race , religion , nationality or belonging to a particular social group or because of political opinion , ” said Sessions in his statement on the law on 11 June .	-5.5836

US ambassadors accuse China of “ bullying ” with “ propaganda advertising . ”	-2.9188
A week after an official Chinese newspaper had placed a four-page ad in a US daily on the mutual benefits of US-China trade , the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda .	-4.1695
U.S. President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to the paid addition of the China Daily in the Des Moines Register , the state with Iowa ’ s best-selling newspaper , after accusing China of meddling in the US Congressional elections of November 6 , which China disputes .	-5.7082
US officials claim to Reuters that Trump ’ s charge of trying to meddle in the US election is a new phase in an escalating Washington campaign to put pressure on China .	-3.6946
While it is normal for foreign states to advertise to promote trade , Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an escalating trade war , with several rounds of tariffs on imports .	-7.1334
In an early stage of the trade war , China ’ s retaliatory tariffs , according to Chinese and US experts , should meet exporters in US states like Iowa , where many supporters of Trump ’ s Republican Party live .	-3.3192
Terry Branstad , an American ambassador to China and former long-time governor of Iowa , a major exporter of agricultural products to China , said that Beijing had hurt American workers , farmers , and businesses .	-3.7210
China , wrote Branstad in an opinion article in the Des Moines register on Sunday , “ is now vigorously harassing this harassment through propaganda ads in our own free press .	-5.0866
“ By disseminating propaganda as a paid ad in the Des Moines Register , China ’ s government is taking advantage of the valued American tradition of freedom of expression and the press , ” Branstad wrote .	-8.5737
" By contrast , at the newspaper stand in Beijing ’ s streets , you will find only limited dissenting voices , and you will not see any real reflection of different opinions that the Chinese people might have about China ’ s troubling economic development , given that the media are firmly under the control of the Chinese Communist Party , ” he wrote .	-11.0305
He added that " one of the most prominent newspapers in China contradicted the offer to publish , " although he did not say which newspaper .	-3.5894
The Republicans grab the Kavanaugh debacle voters from the Midterm elections , warn analysts	-4.7168
Many of the top Republicans defended Brett Kavanaugh , a nominee who is elected to the Supreme Court , even though he was accused of sexual assault , and the analysts warn that they will see a counterstrike in the upcoming elections , especially women .	-5.9811
Emotions were high , most Republicans have already said they want to vote for him .	-2.9083
These things can not be returned , said Grant Reeher , Professor of Political Science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University , on Saturday in an article published by The Hill .	-2.7026
Reeher said that he doubted that last-minute support from Jeff Flake ( Republican MP for the state of Arizona ) for FBI investigations is sufficient to reconcile angry voters .	-5.2853
“ Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow , nor in November , ” said Karine Jean-Pierre , senior consultant and national spokesperson for the progressive MoveOn group on Friday , as a Washington newspaper reported .	-3.7628
On Friday morning , the protesters sang : “ November is coming ! ” while demonstrating in the corridor of the Senate , when the Republicans who control the Judicial Committee decided to continue with Kavanaugh ’ s nomination despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford ’ s statement , Mic reports .	-5.0453
“ Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be immeasurable , ” said Stu Rothenberg , an impartial political analyst , to journalists .	-2.6374
“ People say that it is quite advanced , that is true .	-3.9994
But the number could be higher , especially among suburban and younger voters , 18-29 years old , who may not suffer the president , but often do not vote . ”	-4.6499
Even before Ford ’ s public statement , in which she issued her allegations of sexual violence against the Supreme Court candidate , analysts noted that a backlash could follow if Republicans pushed the candidacy forward .	-4.6906
“ This has become a mess for the GOP , ” said Michael Steele , former chairman of the Republican National Committee , at the beginning of last week , according to NBC News .	-3.6682
“ It ’ s not just about the committee election or the final election , or whether Kavanaugh is put on the substitute bank ; it ’ s about how the Republicans handled it and how they treated it , ” Guy Cecil , director of US priorities , told a group to help the Democratic election to the news channel .	-6.8080
The Americans , however , are divided by the statements of Ford and Kavanaugh .	-3.1450
A new poll by YouGov shows that 41 % of respondents believed Ford ’ s testimony definitively or probably , while 35 % said that they definitely or probably believed Kavanaugh .	-4.3953
Moreover , 38 % said that they thought Kavanaugh lied probably or definitely during his statement , while only 30 % said the same about Ford .	-3.1743
At the initiative of Flake , the FBI is currently investigating the allegations of Ford and at least another prosecutor , Deborah Ramirez , reported The Guardian .	-3.2858
Ford said last week before the Senate Justice Committee under Eid that Kavanaugh had attacked them at the age of 17 .	-3.4840
Ramirez accuses the highest judge of having disclosed his genitals before her at a party in Yale in the 1980s .	-5.1874
The World Wide Web inventor is planning a new Internet to challenge Google and Facebook .	-2.5372
Tim Berners-Lee , the inventor of the Internet , is setting up a startup company to compete with Facebook , Amazon , and Google .	-2.6463
The current project of technology legend , Inrupt , is a company that builds on the open-source platform “ Solid ” by Berners-Lee .	-3.3111
Solid allows users to specify where their data is stored and which people may have access to what information . or . or are . . or . or . . or .	-11.2907
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company , Berners-Lee joked that the goal of Inrupt was to take over world domination .	-3.6046
“ We must do it now , ” he said about the startup .	-2.3671
“ It is an historic moment . ”	-1.2916
The app uses Solid technology to help users create their own personal online data storage or POD .	-3.4326
Data storage can contain contact lists , task lists , calendars , music libraries and other personal or professional tools .	-2.5680
It is available like Google Drive , Microsoft Outlook , Slack and Spotify all on a browser and all at the same time .	-1.9476
What is special about personal online data storage is that it is entirely up to the user to know what kind of information is possible .	-5.6674
The company calls it “ empowerment by data . ”	-3.8108
According to the CEO of John Bruce , Inrupt will provide resources , processes , and appropriate know-how to make solid available to a broad audience .	-3.8990
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee , Bruce , a security platform acquired by IBM , some employees involved in the project and a community of voluntary programmers .	-3.1121
As of this week , technology developers worldwide can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the interrupt website .	-4.2474
Berners-Lee said that neither his team nor he himself will talk to Facebook and Google about the major changes that all previous business models will face overnight .	-4.1393
“ We will not ask for permission ” .	-2.3434
In an article on Medium published on Saturday , Berners-Lee wrote that Inrits ' mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new Solid Web . '	-3.3801
In 1994 , Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .	-1.6335

Bernard Vann : World War I Victoria Crusader is honoured .	-3.3028
The only priest of the Church of England who received a Victoria Cross during World War I was celebrated 100 years later in his home town .	-4.2988
The Lieutenant and Reverend Bernard Vann earned the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack in Bellenglise and Lehaucourt .	-5.5623

A memorial stone was revealed on Saturday at a parade in Rushden , Northamtonshire , by his two grandchildren .	-3.1394
One of his grandchildren , Michael Vann , said that it was “ incredibly symbolic ” that the stone was exposed exactly 100 years after the heroism of his grandfather .	-3.1689
According to the London Gazette , Colonel Vann led his Bataillon in September 1918 over the Channel of Saint-Quentin “ in very dense fog and under heavy fire by field guards and machine guns . ”	-5.3954
Later , he stormed to the firing line , leading the line forward with the “ largest gallery ” , before pulling a field gun and pushing the withdrawal three times .	-8.0025
Colonel Vann was killed by a German shooter on October 4 , 1918 – just a month before the end of the war .	-3.2402
Michael Vann , 72 , said the actions of his grandfather were ' something I know I could never do justice to , something that humbles . '	-3.8177
He and his brother , Dr. James Vann , laid down a crane after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band .	-4.3576
Michael Vann said that he felt “ very honoured to participate in the parade , ” and added , “ The bravery of a real hero is reflected in the support he receives from many people . ”	-4.0130
MMA ’ s Fans stayed awake all night to see Bellator 206 , instead getting Peppa Pig .	-3.4478
Imagine you stayed awake all night to see the complete Bellator 206 event just to see the main event .	-4.7829
The plan in San Jose included 13 battles , including six major battles , and was shown live on Channel 5 at night in the UK .	-5.2104
At 6 o 'clock in the morning , just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to meet , the UK 's spectators were amazed to see how the coverage was switched to Peppa Pig .	-6.1376
Some were unprinted after they remained awake until the early hours of the morning , extra for the fight .	-5.2404
A fan on Twitter described the change to a children 's cartoon as " some sick joke " .	-3.7808
" It is a state rule that at 6 o 'clock in the morning these contents were not suitable for children 's programs , " said Dave Schwartz , Bellator Senior Vice President of Marketing and Communication , when he was asked for the transmission .	-4.9394
'Peppa the pig , ' yes ' .	-2.2872
Bellator ’ s Managing Director Scott Coker said that they will work on their planning in the future to involve British viewers .	-4.4761
" When I think about the repetition , we will somehow get it , " said Cocker .	-3.8955
" But it is 6 o 'clock in the morning on a Sunday there and we will not be able to fix it until Sunday of our time , Monday of their time .	-4.7018

But it was not , it was a government problem .	-2.3044
I can promise you that the next time it does not happen .	-2.7631

Desert Island Discs : Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality .	-1.6388
The Olympic diver Tom Daley says that he grew up with the feeling that his sexuality made him underfoot - but that gave him the motivation to be a success .	-6.0008
The 24-year-old said that he became aware only at secondary school that “ not everyone is like me . ”	-3.9829
In the first edition of Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 presented by Lauren Laverne , he said that he spoke publicly about the rights of homosexuals to give others “ hope . ”	-3.2748
He also said that a victory at the Olympic Games after the birth of his first child would have become less important for him .	-2.9693
The regular presenter of the long-running show , Kristy Young , has released several months due to a disease .	-3.4384
Daley appeared in Laverne ’ s first program , saying that he felt “ less worth ” than the others , because “ it was not accepted by society to stand on men and women . ”	-4.9592
He said , “ To this day , these feelings of less value and difference have given me the strength and strength I needed you to succeed . ”	-4.7592
He wanted to prove that he was “ something , ” he said , in order not to disappoint anyone if he was aware of his sexual orientation .	-4.8264
The two-time bronze medal winner has become a high-profile LGBT activist , using his appearance at this year ’ s Commonwealth Games in Australia to encourage more countries to decriminalize homosexuality .	-4.1656
He said he was saying that he was lucky enough to live openly and without consequences , and because he wanted to give hope to others .	-5.1210
The three-time World Champion said that he fell in love with a man , US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black , whom he met in 2013 , and he was very surprised .	-3.9666
Daley married the Oscar winner 20 years older than him last year , but the age difference was never a problem .	-3.0380
“ If so much is done in such young years , ” he first attended the Olympic Games at the age of 14 , and three years later his father died of cancer , he said it was hard to find someone at the same age who experienced similar high and low levels .	-6.8423
The couple was in June parents of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley , and Daley said his " whole perspective " has changed .	-2.6494
“ Last year , everything revolved on me to win a gold medal , ” he said .	-3.3491
“ But you know what , there are more important things than Olympic gold .	-2.6900
My gold medal is Robbie . ”	-0.6649
His son bears the name of his father , Robert , who died in 2011 , only 40 years after a cancer diagnosis .	-3.1756
Daley said that his father did not accept that he would die , and one of the last things he asked was whether they had their tickets for London 2012 - because he wanted to be in the front row .	-2.7495
“ I couldn ’ t say to him : <unk> You won ’ t see it any more to sit in the front row , Dad <unk>, ” he said .	-5.0452
“ I kept his hand when his breathing was suspended , and only when he was really no longer breathing and dead did I realize that he was not invincible , ” he said .	-5.7297
The following year , Daley joined the 2012 Olympic Games and won bronze .	-2.9805
“ I dreamed of this all my life – diving into the water in front of the local audience at the Olympic Games – there is no better feeling , ” he said .	-5.3079
He also inspired his first song selection – Proud of Heather Small – with this song he prepared himself for the Olympic Games and it still makes Gänsehaut .	-7.4764

The Weak Mickelson sat on the Bank on Ryder Cup Saturday	-4.3092
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game , but he must dramatically improve his form so that it does not become a sad milestone .	-4.7744
Mickelson , who played for the 12th time at the event , which takes place every two years , was put on the bank by Captain Jim Furyk for the Foursomes and Fourballs on Saturday .	-10.1740
Instead of being at the heart of the event , as is so often the case for the US , the five-time Major Winner announced his day between firers and rounds of practice on the golf course , hoping to overcome its depth .	-9.5201
The 48-year-old is never the most straight driver even at the peak of his career and is not suitable for the narrow Le Golf National Square , where the long Rough regularly punishes failures .	-5.2257
And as if the course were not challenging enough on its own , Mickelson meets Francesco Molinari , the British Open Champion in Sunday ’ s ninth match , who won all four matches this week together with Neuling Tommy Fleetwood .	-7.3307
If Americans have four points left behind when they start the 12 individual games and have a hot start , Mickelson ’ s match could be absolutely crucial .	-5.3823
Furyk expressed his confidence in his man ; what else was left to him .	-4.5652
" He fully understood the role he had today , gave me a slap on my back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow , " said Furyk .	-3.7308
“ He has a lot of self-confidence .	-2.0648
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has done so much for these teams in the past , and this week .	-2.1997
I probably wouldn 't have thought he was playing two games .	-3.4775
I had hoped for more , but it turned out to be that way and that is the way we thought we had to deal with it .	-6.4729
He wants to be out there , just like everyone else .	-1.9848
So far , Nick Faldo holds the record for most of the matches played at the Ryder Cup , which Mickewill on Sunday .	-5.6415
This could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never fully matched the heights of its individual record .	-3.4826
Mickelson won 18 times , lost 20 times and played seven times undecided , while Furyk said that his presence was invaluable for the team .	-4.7963
" He 's funny , he 's sarcastic , funny , he loves to entertain people , and he 's a great guy he can have in the team room , " he explained .	-3.3471
I think the younger players also had fun this week to compete with him , that was nice to see . ”	-5.1655
It offers much more than just the game . ”	-1.5870
The European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a big lead can soon disappear .	-3.5559
Thomas Bjorn , the European captain , knows from experience that a big lead in the individual matches of the last day can quickly become an uncomfortable ride at the Ryder Cup .	-4.4867
The Dane debuted in the game in Valderrama in 1997 , where a team trained by Seve Ballesteros had a five point lead over the Americans , but only narrowly surpassed the finish line and won with a thin margin of 14 <unk> to 13 <unk> .	-7.3980
" We remember that Valderrama was in the lead ; we had a big lead in Brookline , where we lost , and in Valderrama we won , but just , " said Bjorn , after he the Class of 2018 , now leading 10-6 in the Le Golf National , Friday and yesterday in a 5-3 victory .	-6.6781
History will show me and everyone in this team that it is not over yet .	-3.1358
You will be absolutely bored tomorrow .	-1.6229
Go out and do the right things .	-1.8615
It is only over when the points are displayed on the board .	-3.7191
Our goal is to win this Cup , and that is what we focus on .	-3.3477
I have always said that I strongly believe in the 12 players in our team , but we are dealing with a strong opponent , the best players in the world . ”	-3.1951
Enthusiastic how his players played on a hard golf course , Björn added : " I would never be too fast .	-4.7200
Tomorrow is also a day .	-1.8002
Tomorrow are the personal appearances , and that is another matter .	-2.9487
It 's great to be out there with a partner , if things go well , but if you are out there alone , then your own skills as a golfer are tested on the whole .	-6.6730
This is the message you have to give the players : get the best out of them tomorrow .	-9.2457
Now you are going to pass on your partner and he has to do just as you do . ”	-7.3021
In contrast to Björn , the opponent Jim Furyk will strive for his players to perform better individually than they do as partners , with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas , who scored three out of four points .	-5.2111
Furyk himself has already experienced such a sensational turn on the final day , when he was part of the winning team in Brookline , now he is one of the losers after the European team performed the “ miracle of Medinah . ”	-5.7780
" I remember every damned word , " he said on the question of how Ben Crenshaw , the captain of 1999 , had gathered his players on the way to the last day .	-3.7875
We have 12 important games tomorrow , but we want to get started as soon as possible , as we saw in Brookline , in Medinah .	-3.9791
Once a dynamic has developed , the pressure exerts on the middle matches .	-5.3064
We have built up our structure accordingly and brought the guys out as we felt , you know we are trying to create something special tomorrow . ”	-5.3227
Thomas , along with Paul Casey , Justin Rose , Jon Rahm , Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter , the other European in the top rankings , should lead the counterattack against Rory McIlroy at the top .	-9.6042
I put this group of guys in this order because I think it covers the whole way , " said Bjorn about his individual selection .	-3.3211
Re-postponing Germany ’ s New War Ship ’ s Timet	-3.4915
The German Navy ’ s latest frigate should have been put in service as early as 2014 to replace the years of the Cold War warships , but , according to reports from local media , it will take at least until next year , due to flawed systems and escalating costs .	-6.9058
The commissioning of the “ Rhineland-Palatinate ” , the flagship of the brand-new Fregattes of the Baden-Württemberg class , has now been postponed to the first half of 2019 , according to the newspaper “ Die Zeit ” , calling for a military .	-5.0193
The navy should have launched the ships in 2014 , but serious problems after the first delivery weighed heavily on the ambitious project .	-4.9915
The four navy frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class ordered in 2007 will replace the older ships of the Bremen-class .	-4.3774
It is assumed that they have a powerful cannon , a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles , as well as some Stealth technologies , such as reduced radar , infrared , and acoustic signatures .	-10.4822
Another important advantage is longer maintenance intervals : the latest frigates should be usable for up to two years without starting the home port .	-5.7113
But the ultra-modern warships , which are supposed to allow Germany to project power overseas , will already be obsolete by the constant delays when they are finally put into service , as the weekly “ Time ” notes .	-6.7488
The unfortunate F125-Fregatte made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to launch the ship and returned it to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg .	-4.2773
This was the first time that the navy returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery .	-3.1056
Little was known about the reasons for returning the ships ; German media mentioned a number of critical “ software and hardware ” effects that would make the warship useless in combat operations .	-4.2287
Software defects were particularly important because the ships of the Baden-Württemberg class are served by a crew of around 120 sailors - only half of the crew on older frigates of the Bremen-class .	-5.2099
It also turned out that the ship has a considerable overweight , which would limit performance and make future upgrades for the navy more difficult .	-15.0099
It is assumed that the 7,000 ton “ Rhineland Palatinate ” is twice as heavy as ships of the same class used by the Germans during World War II .	-4.1504
In addition to faulty hardware , the price tag of the entire project - including the training of the crew - will be discussed .	-10.9375
Instead of the originally projected € 2.2 billion , the cost now seems to have reached the staggering level of € 3.1 billion ( roughly $ 3.6 billion ) .	-4.1679
The problems with the latest frigates are particularly important in the light of recent warnings that Germany ’ s maritime power is dwindling .	-4.7378
Earlier this year , Hans-Peter Bartels , Chairman of the German Parliament ’ s Defence Committee , admitted that the war fleet actually “ runs out of ships capable of being deployed . ”	-5.2750
The official said that the problem has grown avalanche over time , as old ships have been put out of service without any replacement .	-4.8403
He complained that none of the Baden-Württemberg regattas were put in service by the Navy .	-3.2096
The National Trust laughs the secret lives of bats .	-3.3514
New researches on a property in the Highlands of Scotland try to find out how bats use the landscape for food search .	-4.9272
It is hoped that this will provide new insights into the behaviour of the unique flying mammals that will guide future measures to protect animals .	-5.3564
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will be followed by soprano ppistols and brown , boring and Daubenton leathermics at the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross .	-16.3650
Special recorders are placed at the main points of the lodging to monitor bats during the whole season .	-6.0096
NHS employees and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys with handheld detectors .	-2.2430
A professional sound analysis of all images determines the frequency of bats and assigns the calls to species .	-5.5273
The habitat card to be created and the report to be drawn up should provide a detailed overview of the behaviour .	-4.9511
Rob Dewar , National Trust for Scotland ( NTS ) , hopes to find out which areas of the habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by each species .	-4.2608
This information will help to identify the benefits of habitat mining , how to best preserve meadows and how forests for bats and other related species are best preserved .	-5.9983
There has been a sharp decline in bats in Scotland and the whole of Britain over the past hundred years .	-4.7120
They are threatened by construction work affecting their sleeping places and the loss of living space .	-4.4104
Wind power plants and lighting can also pose a risk , as can fly-trapping and some chemical treatments of building materials .	-6.0228
Baths are not really blind .	-3.7371
Adapted to their nightly hunting activities , the ears are more useful than the eyes when catching bags .	-5.9289
They use sophisticated echo positioning technology to locate errors and obstacles in their flight path .	-4.8605
The NTS , which is responsible for managing more than 270 historic buildings , 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country , takes bats very seriously .	-3.1051
There are ten trained experts who carry out regular surveys , inspect sleep spots and sometimes carry out rescue operations .	-4.8142
The organisation has even set up Scotland ’ s first and only dedicated bats reserve in the Threade-Estate in Dumfries and Galloway , home to eight of the ten Scottish bats .	-5.2006
According to manager David Thompson , the property is an ideal habitat for them :	-2.4122
“ Here in Threave we have a great area for bats . ”	-2.1737
“ We have the old buildings , many old trees and all the good living space .	-2.5820
But there is still much unknown about bats and the work we do here and on other land helps us to understand better what they need to live . ”	-3.6645
He emphasizes that it is important to check whether bats are there before maintenance work in buildings , according to which it is possible that when a single sleeping place is destroyed , up to 400 females and boys can be killed – a whole local population may be erased .	-8.2255
Baths are protected ; it is forbidden to kill , harass or disturb them and destroy their sleeping places .	-4.5153
Elisabeth Ferrell , Scottish Bat Conservation Trust employee , has encouraged the public to help .	-2.2910
She said , “ We still have much to learn about our bats , and for many of our species we simply do not know how their populations are . ”	-2.7921
Ronaldo rejects rape claims when lawyers sue the German journal	-2.4978
Cristiano Ronaldo has branded rape claims against him as " fake news " and claims that people " want to promote themselves " by using his name .	-3.0365
His lawyers will sue the German news magazine “ Der Spiegel ” , which published the allegations .	-2.8162
The stormer from Portugal and Juventus was accused of having raped an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in in 2009 .	-3.4574
He was supposed to have paid her $ 375,000 to keep quiet about the incident , The Mirror reported on Friday .	-4.0549
Hours after the allegations were reported , Ronaldo , 33 in an instagram live video to his 142 million followers rejected the reports as “ fake news . ”	-3.8187
No , no , no , no , no .	-0.7277
What they say today , fake news , ” said the five-time balloon D 'Or winner in the camera .	-2.9700
“ You want to apply by using my name .	-2.3456
“ That is normal .	-1.7623
They want to draw attention to themselves when they say my name , but it is part of the job .	-2.4220
I am a happy man , and everything is good , ” the player added smiling .	-2.5528
Ronaldo ’ s lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against the magazine “ Der Spiegel ” because of the allegations ; according to Reuters , you spoke of “ an inadmissible reporting of suspicions in the field of privacy . ”	-6.0202
Attorney Christian Schertz said that the player will demand compensation for “ immaterial damage equal to the severity of injury , which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years ” .	-4.3474
The alleged incident was reported in June 2009 in a suite of Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas .	-3.3304
According to documents submitted to the Clark County District Court in the state of Nevada , Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player ’ s room after meeting in a nightclub , where he raped them anally .	-5.2942
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident , saying that he was “ 99 % ” a “ good guy , ” let down by the “ 1 % . ” . was . , , , . were . were .	-6.9964
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex , but it was consensual .	-1.8990
Mayorga also claims that she has gone to the police and had photos taken of her injuries in a hospital , but later agreed to an extrajudicial settlement because she was " afraid of retaliation " and worried about " being publicly humiliated " .	-5.7430
The 34-year-old says that she is now trying to invalidate the agreement because it remains traumatised by the alleged incident .	-3.7624
Ronaldo was on the verge of moving to Real Madrid by Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack , and this summer changed to the Italian giant Juve with a € 100 million deal .	-5.7492
Brexit : Britain would forever regret losing car manufacturers .	-2.2533
“ The UK would regret it in life if it lost its position as the world ’ s leading car manufacturer after Brexit , ” said Economics Minister Greg Clark .	-4.3938
He added that it was " worrying " that Toyota UK told the BBC that they would temporarily stop production at their plant in Burnaston , near Derby , if Greater Britain left the EU without a deal .	-4.2541
“ We need an agreement , ” Clark said .	-1.1888
The Japanese automobile manufacturer said that the impact of border delays in the event of no-deal Brexit could cost jobs .	-3.4269
The plant in Burnaston , which manufactures Auris and Avensis for Toyota , produced almost 150,000 cars last year , 90 % of which were exported to the rest of the European Union .	-2.7801
“ If the United Kingdom leaves the EU at the end of March without an agreement , I believe that it will stop production in our plant , ” said Marvin Cooke , CEO of Toyota in Burnaston .	-5.1926
Other British car manufacturers have expressed fears that they will leave the EU without agreement on the modalities of cross-border trade , including Honda , BMW and Jaguar Land Rover .	-3.6057
For example , BMW has already announced that it will close its Oxford plant for a month after Brexit .	-2.9806
The main concerns relate to what automobile manufacturers say about the risks of the supply chain in the event of no deal Brexit .	-3.7571
Toyota ’ s production facilities are based on demand-driven manufacturing , which means that parts are delivered every 37 minutes by UK and EU suppliers for special production .	-5.7949
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without an agreement , there may be delays at the border which , according to industry information , may lead to supply shortages and partial shortages .	-4.6588
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day of stock in his factory in Derbyshire , said the company , and so would stop production .	-3.4253
Mr Clark said that Theresa May ’ s Chequers Plan for future relations with the EU was “ exactly calibrated to avoid these border controls . ”	-3.4365
We have to have a deal , we want the best deal that not only allows us to achieve our current success , we also want to seize this opportunity , ” he said to the BBC Radio 4 programme today .	-6.1106
“ The reference not only by Toyota , but also by other manufacturers , is that we absolutely must be able to continue with what has become a very successful series of supply chains . ”	-4.7305
Toyota did not indicate how long the production freeze could take , but warned that the increase in costs could lead to long-term damage to the factory ’ s competitiveness , losing jobs .	-6.9426
Peter Tsouvallaris , a trade union representative , and has been working in Burnaston for 24 years , said that union members are increasingly worried : “ In my experience , once they have been dismantled , jobs are lost forever . ”	-5.3963
One government spokesman said : ' We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU ' .	-3.5116
Trump ’ s Rosenstein meeting could shift again , says the White House	-8.8596
Donald Trump ’ s high-profile meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “ postponed another week , ” as the battle for Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues , the White House read on Sunday .	-4.7661
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller , who examines Russian interventions in the elections , the links between Trump and Russia , and the possible obstruction of justice by the president .	-4.2255
Whether Trump will fire the deputy prosecutor , or not , and thus threaten Müller ’ s independence , Washington has been trampling for months .	-5.2524
Earlier this month , the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the wearing of a cable to record talks with Trump , making it possible to remove the president of the 25th Amendment .	-4.2052
Rosenstein rejected an opinion .	-1.4273
But last Monday he went to the White House , while reports hailed that he was about to resign .	-3.4880
Instead , a meeting with Trump , who was then at the United Nations in New York , was announced for Thursday .	-2.7004
Trump said that he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein , but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a clash with the hearing of the Senate ’ s Judicial Committee in which Kavanaugh and one of the women , Dr. Christine Blasey Ford , who accused him of sexual misconduct .	-4.5007
On Friday , Trump ordered a one-week FBI inquiry into claims against Kavanaugh and further delayed a full Senate vote .	-3.7400
Donald Trump ’ s press spokeswoman Sarah Sanders was on Fox News on Sunday .	-3.0932
Asked after the Rosenstein meeting , she said : " A date for this has not yet been set , it could be this week , I could see that I was going back another week , given all the other things that are going on with the Supreme Court .	-5.4904
But we will see and I keep the press always up to date . '	-9.5716
Some reporters would challenge this claim : Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10 .	-2.7165
The guest Chris Wallace asked why .	-0.8147
Sanders said that the lack of briefings was not due to a reluctance to television reporters who behave like self-actors , but she also said : ' I will not be against them being in the gallery ' .	-5.4285
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase .	-2.0677
'The President carries out more questions and answers than any president before him , ' she said and added , without any evidence , ' We have looked at these figures ' .	-5.3981
Briefings will still take place , Sanders said , but should the press have the chance to ask the President of the United States questions directly , it is infinitely better than to talk to her .	-4.4469
We are trying to do a lot of that , and you have seen how we have done it in recent weeks , and it will replace a press conference if you can talk to the President of the United States itself . ”	-4.2993
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or takes part in public meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries .	-3.0397
Press conferences with one person are rare .	-1.0605
In New York , the president may have demonstrated this week why , by making a freestanding and sometimes bizarre appearance before assembled reporters .	-5.3056

Foreign buyers will be charged a higher tax rate when buying property in the UK - the extra money will be used for homeless , Theresa May announces today .	-12.2023
This move is seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn ’ s success , attract young voters with promises , offer more affordable housing , and seek high incomes .	-3.8341
The stamp fee is levied on people and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK , and the additional money will help the government to combat homelessness .	-4.7374
The surcharge - which is levied in addition to the current stamp tax , including the higher rates introduced two years ago for second flats and rentals - could be up to three percent .	-10.4421

And that means putting our broken housing market in order .	-2.4367
Britain will always be open to people who want to live , work and build a life .	-2.7344
However , it cannot be right for foreign companies and people who do not live in the UK to buy homes just as easily as for hard-working British citizens .	-4.0495

“ I wanted to compete as a player for my country . ”	-2.7219
I got a B-cap and that 's it " , Ross said to BBC Scotland 's sports sound .	-3.5228
" But I have often watched Scotland in Hampden with my father as a child , and it is always something that has brought me back .	-2.8827
" This opportunity would only come if I succeed in club management . "	-4.0606
Before Ross were Dick Advocaat , David Moyes , Sam Allardyce , Martin O 'Neill , Roy Keane , Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio Manager of Sunderland .	-1.8086
The former manager of Alloa Athletic says that he was not afraid to follow the footsteps of these established managers in such a large club , before he had already rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town .	-5.6862
'The success for me is currently defined by the question ' Can I bring this club back to the Premier League ? '	-3.4682
With its structure and facilities , this club undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League , ” he said .	-2.8455
" It is not an easy task , but I would probably only see myself as successful if I could get the club back there . "	-5.6488
Ross is only three years in his management career , after a time as co-trainer at Dumbarton and a 15-month spell for Hearts ' coaching staff .	-2.8930
He then helped Alloa recover from the release to the third class , and gave St. Mirren the title of master in the following season from the edge release .	-6.1908
Ross also says that he never felt as comfortable as he was at Clyde , Hartlepark , Falkirk , St Mirren and Hamilton Academical during his playing career .	-5.0987
" It was probably a real crossroads , " he remembered when he took over the leadership of Alloa .	-3.0273
“ I really thought that the position as a manager is right for me , even more than that of a player .	-4.1647

The summer heat wave has increased revenue for the battered British pubs , but has increased pressure on restaurants .	-4.2037
Pub and bar groups experienced an increase in sales of 2.7 percent in July - however , revenues in restaurants fell 4.8 percent , according to the figures .	-4.7712
Peter Martin , from the management consultancy CGA , which compiled the figures , said : " Continuing sunshine and England longer than expected to participate in the World Cup resulted in July following a similar pattern as in June , when the pub search rose by 2.8 % , only that the restaurants were even more affected .	-7.0403
The decline in the catering business by 1.8 % in June only worsened in July .	-3.6975
Drinks dominated pubs and bars by far the strongest , with like-for-like-numbers rising more than the restaurants .	-5.1103
The food dominated pubs suffered from the sun , though not as dramatic as the restaurant operators .	-4.6178
It seems that people only wanted to go for a drink .	-2.9254
In the managed pubs and bars , drinks sales increased by 6.6 % this month , while food fell by 3 % . "	-3.7411
Paul Newman , an RSM analyst for leisure and hospitality , said : " These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April .	-2.9616
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the out-of-home market .	-4.3453
It is not surprising that restaurant groups are still under pressure , although a 4.8 % decline in sales compared to the previous year will be particularly painful , alongside the continuing cost pressure .	-5.8772
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food operators , and the time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will ensure the much-needed break .	-5.1053
Overall , sales growth in pubs and restaurants , including new openings , was 2.7 percent in July , reflecting the slow introduction of new brands .	-2.9350

Milk pumping advertising , which compares mothers to cows , has led to controversial online discussions .	-3.7107
A milk pump company has provoked controversial online discussions , owing to an advertisement comparing breastfeeding mothers with milking cows .	-4.5736
On the occasion of the market launch of the supposedly " world 's first silent and portable milk pump " , the consumer technology company Elvie published an ironic advertising inspired by music videos to show the freedom of mothers with this new pump .	-4.8558
Four real mothers dance in a hypocrisy in the middle of cows to a number with the following song text : ' Yes , I melt me , but you see no tail ' and ' If you did not notice that it is not your euter , it is my breasts ' .	-7.1027
The slogan goes on : ' Pump off , pump off , I feed the babies , pump off , pump off , pump off , I melt my ladies ' .	-4.7991
However , the advertisement published on the company 's Facebook page caused controversy online .	-3.6114
With 77,000 calls and hundreds of comments , the video has received mixed reactions from the viewers , many of whom say that it illuminates the " horrors " of the dairy industry .	-3.2460
'It is a very bad decision to advertise cows for this product ' .	-2.2980
Like us , they must become pregnant and give birth to produce milk , except that their babies are taken away from them within a few days of birth , " wrote a person .	-4.2046
The Elvie milk pump fits inconspicuously into a still-bra ( Elvie / Mother ) .	-3.7027
Another commented : " Understandably traumatic for mother and baby .	-1.6292
But why not use them to promote a milk pump for mothers who can keep their babies ?	-10.2067
Someone else added : ' Such an outsider acquisition ' .	-3.5537
Others defended the advertising , including a woman who admits that she found the song “ original ” .	-4.9745
I think that is a great idea .	-1.6169
I would have received one if I had agreed .	-3.5002
By pumping I felt like a cow .	-7.6118
The display is a bit crazy , but I took it as what it was .	-2.2917
This is a brilliant product , " wrote a person .	-2.1076
Another commented : ' This is a funny advertisement for mothers who pump ( often at their workplaces or toilets ) and feel like ' cows ' .	-4.5365
This is not an advertising that praises or assesses the dairy industry . '	-4.1594
At the end of the video , the group of women reveals that they have all danced with the decent pumps in their bras .	-4.3970
The concept of the campaign is based on the recognition that many women who pump milk say they feel like cows .	-2.8857
The Elvie pump , however , is completely silent , has no wires or hoses and fits unobtrusively into a still-bra , giving women the freedom to move , keep their babies and even go out of the pump .	-6.6013
Ana Balarin , partner and ECD at Mother commented : " The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that deserves a bold and provocative market launch .	-2.9426
By drawing a parallel between the expression of women and dairy cows , we wanted to focus on breast pumps and all its challenges , while at the same time demonstrating in an entertaining and comparable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring .	-4.5650

Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a camp on the Texas border .	-2.9858
The number of migrant detained children increased , even though the monthly border crossings remained relatively unchanged , partly because the Trump administration ’ s tough rhetoric and policies made it more difficult to find sponsors for children .	-4.8757
Traditionally , most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves , and fear that they risk being expelled from the country when they fight for a child .	-4.2281
The risk increased in June , when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to fingerprint , and that the data would be passed on to the immigration authorities .	-9.5613
Last week , Matthew Albence , a senior official within the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Authority , testified to the Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to support unaccompanied minors .	-3.6971
The agency later confirmed that 70 % of the detainees had no previous criminal records .	-2.7490
" Almost 80 percent of people who are either sponsors or household members of sponsors are illegal here in the country , and a large part of them are criminal aliens .	-3.5635
" So we continue to pursue these people , " Albence said .	-4.1090
In an effort to process applications for children more quickly , officials introduced new rules that require some of them to appear before the courts within a month of detention , and not after 60 days , which was the previous standard , according to accommodation staff .	-6.0623
Many will appear not personally , but via video telephone conference to argue with an immigration judge for legal status .	-5.0490
Those who do not qualify for discharge will be expelled quickly .	-3.3661
The longer children remain in prison , the more likely they are to be fearful or depressed , which can lead to violent outbreaks or attempts to escape .	-3.8420
Advocates said that these concerns are being reinforced in a larger body like Tornillo , where signs of a child ’ s struggle are more likely to be overlooked because of its size .	-5.8845
They added that moving children to the tent city , without having enough time to prepare them emotionally or say goodbye to friends , could aggravate a trauma that many are already struggling with .	-4.8927
Syria Calls on US , French , and Turkish “ occupying forces ” to withdraw immediately .	-2.3666
Foreign Minister Walid al-Mouem called on Syrian refugees to return home before the UN General Assembly , even though the war in the country has been going on for eight years .	-3.7416
Mouem , who is also Deputy Prime Minister , said that foreign forces are illegal on Syrian soil under the pretext of combating terrorism , and “ they will deal with it accordingly . ”	-4.5847
“ They must immediately withdraw unconditionally , ” he said to the Assembly .	-2.1977
Mouem claimed steeply and firmly that Syria ’ s “ war on terror is almost over . ” More than 360,000 people have died in the country since 2011 , millions more have been displaced from their homes .	-5.2634
He said that Damascus would continue to “ fight this holy battle until we liberated all Syrian territories ” from both terrorist groups and “ any illegal foreign presence forces . ”	-3.9008
The US has around 2,000 soldiers in Syria , mainly training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad .	-3.7492
France has more than 1,000 ground soldiers in the war-torn country .	-3.3500
On the question of refugees , Mouem said that the conditions for return were in order , and he accused “ some Western countries of irrational fears ” that led refugees to keep themselves away .	-5.6948
“ We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate their return , ” Mouem said .	-3.7656
“ You politicize a strictly humanitarian issue . ”	-2.4034
The US and the European Union drew attention to the fact that reconstruction aid for Syria could only be provided if a political agreement between Assad and the opposition was reached on an end to the war .	-4.7221
UN diplomats have said that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold , Idlib , has made it possible to advance political talks .	-4.6347
The Russian-Turkish deal prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian troops on the province , where three million people live .	-3.4567
But Mouem stressed that the agreement set “ clear deadlines , ” and he hopes that military action will be directed against jihadists , including those who are “ wiped out ” from Al Qaeda ’ s Nusra Front .	-6.4766
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections .	-2.9289
Mouem called conditions for Syrian government participation in the committee : he said that the committee ’ s work should be limited to “ reviewing articles from the current constitution , ” warning of interference .	-4.4542

It is not surprising that Pennsylvania ’ s 17 is experiencing a flood of cash , thanks to a rebalancing of a congressional district that two incumbents reached in a race around the same seat .	-4.4002
For this new district in the suburb of Pittsburg , the democrat Conor Lamb – who won a seat in another district in a special election last spring .	-4.2591
Lamb is against another incumbent , the Republican Keith Rothfus , who is currently representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania , which clearly overlaps with the new 17th .	-4.1311
The cards were re-mixed after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally manipulated in the sense of the Republicans .	-3.4448

But sanctions were only considered against El Salvador , which was estimated to receive $ 140 million in US aid in 2017 , including for stun control , development , and economic support .	-4.0024

Federal Attorney for the Terrorist Attack in NYC	-4.2897
Prosecutors in New York are demanding the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov , suspected of the terrorist attack in New York City , where eight people died – a rare punishment that has not been carried out in the federal state since 1953 .	-3.8203
Saipov , 30 , reportedly used a Home Depot car in October for his attack on a cycle path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan , where he caught pedestrians and cyclists .	-4.3821
To justify a death sentence , prosecutors must prove that Saipov has “ deliberately ” killed the eight victims and has “ deliberately ” inflicted severe physical injuries , according to the memorandum of intent in the southern district of New York on the death penalty .	-5.5349
Both charges can be attributed to death according to court records .	-4.1730
Weeks after the attack , a federal sworn jury sued Saipov on 22 points , including eight charges of murders linked to the blackmail of protective funds , typically used by federal lawyers in cases of organised crime , and an indictment of violence and destruction of motor vehicles .	-7.0520
The attack called for ' substantial planning and precaution ' , the prosecutors said , describing the way Saipov carried out it as ' odious , cruel and spoiled ' .	-4.7788
“ Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused disaster , damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini , Nicholas Cleves , Ann-Laure Decadt , Darren Drake , Ariel Erlij , Hernan Ferruchi , Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco ” , says the declaration of intent .	-3.2350
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina .	-1.0162

He pleaded innocent on the 22 charges .	-3.8919
David Patton , one of the federal defenders who represents Saipov , said that he was " obviously disappointed " by the prosecutor 's decision .	-4.2561
" We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty , rather than accepting a commitment to life in prison without the possibility of release , will only prolong the trauma of these events for all concerned , " said Patton .	-10.4776

Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane reached the water when trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport .	-4.2208
The officials said on Friday that seven people were taken to hospital .	-2.5865
The airline announced that six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday , and all of them were in a stable state .	-3.2781
What caused the crash remains unclear , as does the exact sequence of events .	-2.1157
The airline and the U.S. Navy reported that the aircraft had landed in the lagoon just before the runway .	-3.7518
Witnesses want to have observed that the plane has departed from the runway .	-4.1953
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane was flying very low .	-2.6515
“ This is a really good thing , ” Jaynes said .	-2.4765
Jaynes said that he and others managed to wade to the sinking aircraft ’ s emergency exits through high water .	-5.5451
He reported that the cabin crew panic and screamed , and he suffered a slight head injury .	-3.3937

Paul Rowlett , an analyst at the US Department of Justice , has spent several hours as an expert on information evaluation .	-4.3412
He outlined for the jury how he composed the movements of the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of their death on the basis of mobile phone records .	-4.4506
Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was at Chambers on the evening of her death , which contradicted his earlier claims , reported The Clarion Ledger .	-4.0415
The data on Chamber ’ s mobile phone showed that he was in the company of his friend Michael Sanford , and then Sanford was interrogated by the police .	-6.4089
Sanford said on Saturday , saying that he was not in the city on that day .	-3.3326
When the prosecutors asked whether Tellis spent the night in Sanford ’ s truck , he replied that he lied because his truck was in Nashville at that time .	-3.6878
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died .	-2.2710
According to mobile phone records , they only knew themselves for a week .	-3.6610
Rowlett said that after Chamber ’ s death , Tellis deleted text messages , call and contact information from his phone .	-3.2902
“ He has deleted them from his life , ” Hale said .	-2.3671
The defense begins on Sunday with the final arguments .	-2.0896

New York Girls sue couple for being cancelled according to " racist " text .	-5.4663
A New Yorker nanny sues a couple for discriminating redundancies after receiving a letter from the mother who complains that she is " another black person " .	-6.4688
The couple denies that they are racist and considers the complaint to be " blackmail " .	-3.8912
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman , a mother of two children , was dismayed after she found that her new childcare , Giselle Maurice , was black when she took her first day in 2016 .	-3.9732
Mrs Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a short message : ' Neiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiin NOCH A HEARTH PERSON ' .	-4.9002
Instead of sending him to her husband , she sent him twice to Mrs Maurice .	-2.2865
After having noticed her patcher , a " uncomfortable " placco Flaxman dismissed Mrs. Maurice and explained that her divorced nanny , who was African-American , had done a bad job and that she wanted to stop a filipino instead , according to the New York Post .	-7.1285
Mrs Maurice was paid for her work in one day and then sent home for a Uber .	-3.1520
Now Maurice is suing the couple for compensation for the redundancy and is demanding compensation of $ 350 per day for the six-month full-time job for which she was originally recruited , albeit without a contract .	-6.0500
" I want to show them , look them , they don 't do it , " she said to the post on Friday and added , " I know that discrimination is . "	-4.5401
The couple has contrasted the claims and said that the decision to end Maurice 's employment relationship was reasonable and that they acted for fear because they could not trust her after insulting her .	-5.0850
" My wife had sent her something she did not want to say .	-2.6630
It is not racist .	-0.5489
“ We are not racists , ” she told Joel Plasco of the Post .	-2.5586
" Would you entrust your children to someone you have insulted , albeit accidentally ?	-3.9633

Paddington publishers feared that readers could not identify with a talking bear , revealing a new letter .	-2.0155
Bond ’ s daughter Karen Jankel , who was born shortly after the adoption of the book , said about the letter : it is hard to imagine that someone reads it for the first time before the publication .	-4.4493
“ It ’ s very amusing – now that we know about Paddington ’ s great success . ”	-2.3374
She said that her father , who had previously worked as a BBC cameraman and was then inspired to write a children ’ s book by a small toy bear , would have remained optimistic if his work had been rejected , adding that the 60th anniversary of book publication was “ bittersweet ” after his death last year .	-4.5707
With Paddington , whom she calls “ a very important family member , ” she still says that her father was quietly proud of his eventual success .	-4.9689
" He was a fairly calm man , and he was not a botanical person , " she said .	-3.1199
" But because Paddington was so real for him , it was almost like having a child that achieved something : you are proud of the child , although it is not really your doing .	-5.0383
I think he saw Paddington 's success a little like that .	-2.3091
Although it was his creation and imagination , he always paid tribute to Paddington himself . ”	-2.9039

I could not howl or scream because I was surrounded by families and other people .	-5.3597
I really had to tear myself together .	-1.8472
Finally , Mrs Ednan-Laperouse , grieving about the loss of her daughter , went on board the aircraft with the other passengers who knew nothing about the torment she was suffering .	-5.7339
“ No one knew anything , ” she said .	-1.7968
“ I had lowered my head , and tears fell down all the time .	-2.7200

The FBI investigation has begun , and Brett Kavanaugh ’ s future is at stake .	-2.4396
“ I thought that if we could actually get something like what he demanded - an investigation limited in time and scope - we could perhaps reach a little agreement , ” said Mr Flake on Saturday , adding that he feared that the committee would “ fall apart in the midst of a deep-rooted party political blockade . ”	-6.9496
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate ?	-2.0395
Their restraint is simply due to timing .	-2.4573
It is only five weeks before the midterm elections , on 6 November – if the Republicans do badly as expected , they will be severely weakened in an attempt to push the man who wants to be elected to the country ’ s highest court .	-7.2705

The number of North Korean surpluses to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago , a South Korean MEP said .	-2.8119
With reference to data from the South Confederation ministry , Park Byeong-seu reported that there had been 1,127 fiduciary breaks last year , compared to 2,706 in 2011 .	-6.6877
Park said that stricter border controls between North Korea and China and an increase in prices for human traffickers play a key role in this .	-4.2376
Pyongyang has not spoken publicly .	-1.9245
After all , most of the poultry from North Korea receives South Korean citizenship .	-4.3741
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953 .	-1.5953
Most flee China , which has the longest border with North Korea , which is easier to cross than the strictly guarded demilitarized zone between North and South Korea .	-2.8350
China regards the surpluses as illegal migrants , not refugees , and often forcibly repatriates them .	-7.8000

Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh hysterical , saying that he is unsuitable for the service of the Supreme Court .	-3.9838
The leader of the Democratic minority group , Nancy Pelosi , called Brett Kavanaugh , the candidate for a seat at the Supreme Court “ hysterical , ” saying that he was temperately unfit to serve the Supreme Court .	-4.9571
Pelosi made the comments at an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin , Texas .	-1.3606
“ I could not but think that if a woman had ever acted like this , they would have called it “ hysterical , ” Pelosi said about her response to Kavanaugh ’ s statement before the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday .	-4.7991
Kavanaugh denied the claims emotionally that he had sexually attacked Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both young people .	-5.4041
During his opening speech , Kavanaugh was very emotional , sometimes he almost cried and fought with tears when he talked about his family and his high school years .	-9.6239
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in committee , calling the accusations against him a “ grotesque and coordinated call murder campaign , ” organized by liberals angry that Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election .	-4.3368
Pelosi said that she believed Kavanaugh ’ s statement that he could not serve before the Supreme Court , showing that he was biased against democrats .	-3.4324
“ I believe that he himself is disqualified by such statements and the way he can be influenced by the Clinton and the Democrats , ” she said .	-4.4845
When asked whether , in the event of its confirmation and a democratic majority in the House of Representatives , she would seek a detention procedure against Kavanaugh , Pelosi hesitated .	-5.3407
“ I want to say the following : if he does not tell the truth to Congress or the FBI , he is not only unsuitable for the service of the Supreme Court , but also for the service of the court in which he is currently employed , ” Pelosi said .	-6.1841
Kavanaugh is currently district judge in D.C. appeals court .	-3.3185
Pelosi added that as a democrat she was concerned about possible Kavanaugh judgments against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade , because he stands for conservative justice .	-3.5634
In his confirmation hearings , Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would overturn certain decisions of the Supreme Court .	-4.4035
“ It is not time for a hysterical , biased person to go to court and expect us to say , “ Is this not wonderful , ” Pelosi said .	-3.4015
And women must stand it .	-2.7832
It is a real rhetoric , months and years full of anger , and she cannot go out without crying .	-4.9646
" We cry if we become angry , " Mrs Steinem said to me 45 years later .	-2.6213
'I do not think this is unusual , right ? '	-2.6446
She continued : “ I once helped a woman , in the executive , who told me that she was crying when she became angry , but she developed a technique in which , every time she became angry and began to cry , she said to the person with whom she spoke : “ You may think I am sad because I cry . ”	-6.2259
I am angry . '	-1.5440
And then she just continued .	-3.2573
And I thought that was brilliant . ”	-1.3973
Tears are allowed as valve for anger because they are fundamentally misunderstood .	-2.5440
One of my strongest memories of an early job in a male-dominated office , where I once cry with indescribable anger , was that I was caught at the neck of an older woman , an angry manager before whom I was always somewhat frightened - who dragged me into a staircase .	-7.3249

In 1987 , when Mr. Hart was announced to have an extramarital affair aboard a boat called “ Monkey Business , ” he was out of the race . Ms. Schroeder , deeply frustrated , thought that there was no reason why she was as president .	-5.0663
“ It was not a well-thought-out decision , ” she told me with a laugh 30 years later .	-3.2204
" There were already seven more candidates in the race , and the last thing they needed was another .	-2.3432
Someone called it ' Snow White and the Seven Dwarves ' . '	-2.9409
Because the campaign has long been in progress , it was lagging behind with funding , and so it swore that it would not participate in the race unless it collected $ 2 million .	-5.7671
It was a lost battle .	-1.4485
She noted that some of her supporters , who gave $ 1,000 to men , would give her only $ 250 .	-2.9639
“ Thinking who , I get advance lorries ? ” she wondered .	-4.9592
When she delivered her speech and announced that she would not launch a formal campaign , she was so overwhelmed by emotions - gratitude for the people who supported her , frustration about the system that made it so difficult to collect money and raise voters rather than delegates , and anger about sexism - that she was stifled .	-4.7209
“ One might think I have a nerve collapse , ” Schroeder recalls how the press responded to it .	-3.5176

How China ’ s Trade War with the US could be Benefit from Beijing	-5.0496
The opening salves of the US-China trade war have been deafening , and an end to the clashes is not in sight . A gap between the two countries can be of benefit to Beijing in the long run , experts say .	-5.7808
US President Donald Trump launched the first warning early this year by taxing important Chinese exports , such as solar panels , steel , and aluminum .	-3.4645
The introduction of new tariffs on Chinese products imported into the US worth $ 200 billion ( <unk> 150 billion ) this week has led to a dramatic escalation of the situation .	-4.1116
Beijing has every time revoked itself in the form of benefits , and last but not least , tariffs of between five and ten percent on US goods worth $ 60 billion .	-6.5745
China answers every blow to the US , and it is unlikely that the world ’ s second largest economy will give in in the near future .	-4.5329
Bringing Washington down means giving in to demands , but beating it publicly from the United States would be far too embarrassing for Xi Jinping , the president of China .	-5.4552
But if Beijing uses its opportunities correctly , the trade war with the US can have a long-term positive impact on China by reducing the interdependence of the two economies , experts say .	-5.0743
“ The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing can create the conditions for economic turmoil in one of the two countries is much more dangerous than observers previously assumed , ” said Abigail Grace , a scientific employee at the Center for New American Security , a think tank focused on Asia .	-4.4435
