Munich 1856 : Four Maps Changing Your View of the City	-2.9448
It is a miserable institution where young people are to meet today .	-6.1610
A crypt chapel where the S-Bahn tunnel is now dug .	-4.7347
Small gardeners manage the former farm of farmers .	-3.6458
The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories .	-3.5341
It annoys if maps are not up to date .	-2.7209
Everyone who has had to get up and running knows this because the Auto-Navi displayed a green meadow instead of a bypass road .	-6.9015
The historic maps of the digital Bayern-Atlas , an offer by the Bavarian Geoportal of the state government , are far from current - but this is precisely why they are very revealing .	-6.7791
Especially if you compare them with current online maps .	-2.9302
Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed since the 19th century in the area of distribution of Munich ’ s Mercury .	-5.1525
The digital Bayern-Atlas is a patchwork that cannot be recognized as such .	-4.3392
More detailed maps , so-called Urposition Sheets , have been added to the large overview map for cities and municipalities .	-5.2139
According to the Bavarian survey administration , these were created between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria .	-5.5353
Your client : Napoleon .	-2.4596
The French army leader occupied Bavaria since spring 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .	-3.1437
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic inclusion of Bavaria - for military purposes , of course .	-4.5111
Although French troops finally withdrew with the peace of Lunéville on February 9 , 1801 , it was today ’ s neighbors who created the idea of a comprehensive Bayern map .	-5.5900
Elector Max IV Joseph continued to advance the project , founded the " Topographic Bureau " - and thus the Bayerische Vermessungsverwaltung .	-5.0969
The Urpositionsblatt for Munich dates back to 1856 and can be found on the website of the Bavarian State Library .	-5.0119
The former / present comparison is the most impressive one , for example , of the state capital .	-6.1147
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .	-2.6845
One example is Untersendling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856 .	-3.5444
Sendling was incorporated into the Munich district 21 years after the map was drawn up , i.e. in 1877 .	-10.5073
Today Untersendling is in the middle of the city .	-2.9571
The houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along the current Plinganserstra<unk>e , which was only named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878 , a leader of the revolt of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705 .	-5.3088
Where the West Park is today , you can see nothing but fields - at first glance : when zooming in , a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears : handwritten numbered corridors from the so called " primeval photograph " from which the Land Tax was derived .	-7.2928
Small plots no longer occupy farmers - but small gardeners of the " Land in Sun " plant .	-5.9606
A large green area is located north of Untersendling .	-3.4495
The Theresienwiese , which has been the scene of the Oktoberfest since 1810 , was actually a meadow - not a concrete desert - in the 19th century .	-4.2173
On the other side of the River Isar , the historic map provides an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine .	-3.1403
In the Urpositionsblatt you can read not only the street name " am Gasteig " or the hill " Auf der Lüften " - but also in large letters " Irren Anstalt " .	-4.5772
Yes , here on the Auerfeldstra<unk>e you used to block people with delusions .	-5.1946
In 1858 / 59 the Munich Kreis-Irrenanstalt " Auf der Auer Lüften " was created .	-3.7014
In 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the establishment of the psychiatrist , who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwigs II .	-5.6869
" He was progressive for his time and , for example , ended the arrival of the so-called madmen .	-4.4036
In addition , he has forbidden the staff to use violence against the occupants , " says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Haidhausen Museum , who has worked with the institution for an exhibition .	-5.5262
There was room for 280 patients , later it was extended to 500 places .	-4.9670
At some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreissirrenanstalt in Haar 1905 .	-5.3316
This is where the Isar-Amper Hospital München-Ost , one of Germany 's largest psychiatrists , has been located since 2006 .	-7.0608
On the grounds of the former Auer Anstalt , young people are now meeting in the Salesianum in Munich .	-4.4064
The order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth hostel with training facilities .	-3.6322
To the west lies the football pitch of TSV München Ost , east residential houses from the 1980s .	-4.5126
In 2015 , the " Casa Don Bosco " children 's house was built in an architectural style on the original building of the Irrenanstalt , which had been destroyed during the Second World War in the event of bomb attacks .	-6.7019
The Marienplatz was listed as " Haupt Platz " in 1856 , the Kaufingerstra<unk>e was called " Kaufinger Gasse " .	-3.6297
The Second World War brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .	-2.7165
The Allied bombs broke many holes in the city centre in December 1944 .	-3.3777
A large one remained today - at Marienhof .	-4.4260
The English Institute , small shops and a medieval crypt chapel once stood at Marienhof , where the preparatory work was carried out these days , and on April 5 , 2017 the spade for the second S-Bahn railway line .	-8.4038
With the slider you can compare the old München-Card with the aerial picture of today - and fill up the hole at Marienhof .	-5.3065
Civil Rights Group Published Travel Warning for Missouri	-2.8005
The National Association for the Promotion of Colors has issued a warning to people travelling to Missouri due to discriminatory policies and racist attacks by the State .	-4.7477
" The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri , which is due to enter into force by August 28 , 2017 , calls on African-American travelers , visitors , and Missourians to pay particular attention to state travel and to exercise extreme caution , as a series of questionable , racist incidents have recently occurred throughout the state and are noted here , " says the group 's opinion .	-7.6348
A recent Missouri law , which makes it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits , as well as state law enforcement agencies , which disproportionately target minorities , prompted the group to issue travel warnings , said NAACP .	-5.6651
" They have violations of civil rights that happen to people .	-3.2948
They are stopped because of their skin colour , they are beaten up or killed , " said the president of Missouri NAACP , Rod Chapel , Kansas City Star .	-3.0770
'We hear complaints in such frequency that we have not yet heard . '	-3.1741
It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the US .	-2.3691
The group cited incidents such as racist crimes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .	-2.3626
Sanders died in questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no petrol during the state 's journey and was detained by the Missouri police without being accused of a crime .	-6.0819
The Council also draws attention to a recent report by the Missouri Public Prosecutor 's Office , which shows that black drivers in the state are 75 % more frequent than whites .	-5.1694
" The recommendation is that people are aware of what could happen in Missouri , " Chapel said .	-2.5623
'People must be prepared to bring security or let relatives know that they are travelling through the state ' .	-6.2073
In 2015 , Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes , according to the latest figures from the FBI ’ s hate crimes reporting program , which ranked the state 16th in terms of the number of such injuries .	-3.8094
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination .	-3.0110
Previously , the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after states passed immigration laws requiring local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for immigration violations , which the ACLU believes will contribute to further racial profiling .	-4.9917
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department to other countries , but lately , interest groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US .	-4.6754
Weidzan Project is Elemental	-3.2325
The Fischerbach Weidezaun project is a success project and will continue next year .	-2.6733
The members of the CDU , Peter Wei<unk> and Kordula Kovac , have taken a picture on the ground .	-5.4361
Representatives of the Fischerbach CDU local association met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies at the Schwendemann family ’ s rightgrabenhof .	-5.8598
Markus Schwendemann initially gave insights into his farm , where he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , supplies 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and hosts five holiday guests .	-5.6153
" Black Forest milk " is for him an alternative marketing route for the milk of his cows , says Schwendemann .	-3.5700
On the table of the guests only regional .	-7.8549
Since he is also Chairman of BLHV of Fischerbach , he described the Weidezaunprojekt as " elementary important " .	-5.1128
I cannot be profitable on such steep land .	-4.2080
The green area provides a lot of work , a lot of work needs to be done with the motor sensor .	-5.2726
" We are struggling with the conditions and topography here , " stressed Schwendemann .	-3.7567
In 2003 he took over the parental farm and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if it does not run a biofarm .	-5.2457
For Mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : " The Commune recognized the importance of the Weidezau project and is glad about the Leader Promotion " .	-5.3437
Farmers would have to be supported at a cost of EUR 3000 to EUR 4000 per hectare .	-4.2254
It is hoped that it will be possible to extend the reforestation of land for a while .	-9.7947
" The biggest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and are concerned about how they can continue their business , " the mayor said .	-6.1222
Farmers are often criticised for promoting them .	-3.1632
In 2013 , a total of 25 parcels were fenced off by eleven participants via the support of the pastures .	-6.1545
This means that the open area is 40 hectares , which must not be reforested by at least 2023 .	-5.5330
Of the total costs of 71 500 euros , half were supported by Leader , a quarter carried the municipality of Fischerbach .	-5.5659
The farmers therefore remained EUR 12 610 , which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of wheat .	-4.7463
" The great advantage is the durability of the fences , " said Schwendemann .	-2.3428
Kordula Kovac stressed : " You are doing a really good job , without farmers and rural women it is .	-4.5463
Peter Wei<unk> also stated : " Best food is produced here " .	-3.6073
The Landscape Care Directive ( LPR ) Baden-Württemberg enables state support for pastures .	-4.3511
The aim is to keep the Black Forest open .	-2.0114
A prerequisite is the existence of a funding framework defined by the LPR .	-4.3049
In addition , the fenced area must not be subject to the cultivation of tractors ( over 35 % of cultivation ) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation .	-8.6025
The Fischerbach Weidezaunprojekt 2018 is currently under construction by eight participants with 24 plots who want to build nearly 16 km of fence .	-5.8436
The reserve area is 35 hectares , the calculated costs are over EUR 112 000 .	-5.2835
Is nothing more sacred ?	-1.2138
Now Trump ’ s White House Receives the Statue of Liberty	-4.1047
The surest sign of regime change is when they start attacking the statues .	-2.3530
Americans appreciate it as much as anyone else - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein in Baghdad in 2003 .	-5.7257
Stephen Miller , one of the Trump regime ’ s key ideologues , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with CNN ’ s Jim Acosta about the president ’ s proposals to radically restrict legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty .	-4.3057
To remain fair , Miller did not attack the statue itself .	-2.6641
A horde of boat owners and liberty-Imitators would have laughed him if he had done so .	-4.0625
But it took on its significance , and in particular the importance attributed to it when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus was added to its base in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument .	-5.0238
As Miller Acosta complained , " I don 't want to go into a complete story here , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world .	-4.0239
The poem to which you refer , which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . '	-2.6017
Miller is factually correct , but , as he himself put it , it is not really about history .	-3.1344
It is about the contemporary response to Lazarus 's stirring words , the only one in which a state invites not only any old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : " Your mosquitoes , your poor , / your oppressed masses who yearn to breathe freely / the wretched waste of your rich coasts . "	-7.1173
There was never a time when the ' miserable waste ' was better to see on our screens .	-3.5719
Miller did not engage in literary criticism – he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump ’ s US .	-2.6920
This conflict over the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate : it is indeed a conflict over America ’ s importance .	-4.0205
Lazarus - and her friends who fought to place their words on the ground after their death - knew very well that they were carrying out a highly political act .	-5.1252
The sculpture should show the links between French and American Republicanism by portraying the female embodiment of freedom in a worn classical depiction .	-4.9738
Lazarus changed this meaning : In her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .	-2.9697
And she gives herself a very different name : mother of exiles .	-2.7887
The combination of the poem and the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism .	-3.1098
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , people from the right wing wanted to change it a long time ago .	-3.9791
The great shrine of Rush Limbaugh , a kind of John the Baptist for Trump ’ s coming , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was not inviting anyone , but rather an early neo-conservative who brought the American flame into the surrounding world : " Lady Liberty is moving forward .	-5.2612
It is supposed to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .	-3.5892
The torch is not supposed to light the way to the United States . '	-4.2353
Limbaugh came across something quite unusual .	-3.8896
The importance of the statue is quite a question of the position of perception .	-3.1122
The great fanciful act of Lazarus was to see it as it was seen by the exhausted , wretched but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships .	-4.5654
It is truly a question of seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and an opportunity to improve their lives .	-3.5646
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they must hear .	-3.2916
And that , of course , is not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to recognize .	-3.4565
Their torch is not intended to light the path , but to inflame the hatred that is their only source of power .	-4.4075
World Cup 2017 : Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team .	-5.0637
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots were part of the Great Britain team .	-8.6838
Neil Black , UK athletics director , says that the 16-member Scottish contingent in the World Cup will " make a massive contribution to the team " .	-6.3213
A record number of Scottish athletes were selected for London 2017 , which will start on Friday .	-2.4059
Black believes that ' something special is developing in Scotland ' and that the UK 's athletics have to learn something from it .	-3.8108
" We welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find out , " Black said .	-2.9949
" I speak to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think that it has something to do with what they have done .	-3.0157
Scottish athletes think that it has something to do with what they have done .	-2.8520
British athletics : It has something to do with what they have done .	-1.8559
And also with the type on the street corner .	-2.4263
Whatever the combination of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . '	-1.8743
Several of the Scottish athletes are candidates for the medal , including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track , while Eilidh Doyle was elected the team captain .	-5.9112
" Eilidh is quite modest .	-1.5476
Her captain 's speech was incredible , " says Black .	-2.1386
" A number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and very motivated .	-3.7631
The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh naturally brought was great . '	-4.1187
The Commonwealth Silver Medal winner , who will compete at the 400m hurdles at their fifth World Championships , says that it is " incredible " that 16 Scots are in the British team .	-5.4462
Scotland ’ s best total number of World Cup athletes so far was seven , achieved in 1983 and 2015 .	-5.0197
The medium-haul runner Muir is on this path and has set five British and two European records last year .	-4.4442
It will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs .	-2.8935
Chris O 'Hare , running 1,500 metres , is another Scot to watch after a great season that included victory in the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games .	-5.1498
Doyle remembers her first world championships when the only other Scot in the Lee McConnell team was .	-4.2494
The team captain says that she is " immensely proud " of the fact that many of her fellow countrymen will not only be part of the team , but will also be involved in medals and finals in some cases .	-5.7462
" The special thing about being team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so it was a great honour anyway , but knowing that my team mates voted for me and elected me makes it something very special for me , " she added .	-5.1351
" Obviously I am very proud of all the Scots who belong to the team .	-2.1418
It only shows how far we have come .	-2.1657
And they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to rise on podium .	-3.5890
What about my speech as captain ?	-7.3117
Yes , I think she went well .	-1.2583
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation , as we have a home world championship .	-5.1658
So it is really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from our being back in the Olympic Stadium .	-3.7345
I get a second chance to go out and compete there and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there . '	-3.5090
Blocking critics on Facebook : Don ’ t worry about public office if you can ’ t stand up to stoking voters .	-5.3663
The father of our country knew something of bad press .	-2.5913
Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long for newspapers to beat him for anything from domestic politics to his political principles .	-3.3753
He shook in the criticism , safely .	-4.7961
But he has not silenced his critics .	-1.0437
In 1783 , Washington said : ' Freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and dumb , we are being slaughtered like sheep ' .	-5.3651
This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan , who must work to be more like Washington .	-2.4256
Hogans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .	-4.6724
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him earlier this week .	-2.1323
The governor 's staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivol , and the online comment was full of a backlash with " Well , and ? " .	-2.9616
" It 's just facebook " , many people said .	-2.2605
But it is important .	-0.7454
And it is especially important when it is a type like Hogan .	-2.5309
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state that is surprisingly popular .	-2.6822
He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation .	-2.5581
Hogan is not a reactionary hothead .	-2.0454
He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to principles .	-3.5349
He was also very adept at using Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and playfully rebuke his hapless head after chemotherapy on his side .	-5.9012
Therefore , blocking people who come to the side of the governor - which is a public forum known as official and of employees paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .	-6.1641
In an interview with The Washington Post , Hogan ’ s spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor ’ s actions , arguing that blocking comments was nothing more than a moderation .	-3.6763
But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hate-filled people swinging the whip online .	-4.3634
The post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan . were .	-3.0604
These are only real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur and a priest , not trolls .	-4.1129
They all said that their comments were respectful , thoughtful , and not profane .	-2.0579
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan 's Catholic faith .	-2.5424
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie , Md . , was not hateful , but she asked about hate crimes .	-2.8418
" I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news , " she wrote in the commentary section of the news program " The Post " .	-3.7995
" I do not value this idea , either , when a number of people take a stand on the same subject , they are ignored by some as a so-called collective effort and not recognised as a large group of citizens concerned " .	-7.1805
What the governor 's staff called the " concentrated spam attack " would probably call " intercession " .	-7.8657
The Facebook era makes it easy to crop a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment .	-3.2302
It is much cleaner than in the past if we had done the same thing that staff were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials , or to arrest and silence demonstrators .	-5.0300
But that is exactly what happens digitally .	-2.4930
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for insulting Facebook and other social media .	-2.3641
President Trump is sued by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed .	-1.7347
One of the first milestones on this issue fell last week in Virginia .	-2.5952
The Chairman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment , according to the US judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria , when she expelled a voter from her Facebook page .	-4.7502
And in Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin ( R ) also received a visit from the ACLU for its use of Facebook and Twitter .	-3.7891
This should not be so difficult .	-1.7672
At the time of Washington , the time of affordable port had a similar effect to the Internet .	-4.7682
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800 , and anonymous letterwriters suggested his leadership .	-3.2967
Even then , Washington had anonymous trolls .	-1.1232
The people who used pseudonyms such as " Juricola " , " Valerius " , " Belisarius " and " Portius " wrote all the letters to newspapers that made Washington 's decisions .	-3.9457
Petitions that criticized his position on the Amity Treaty , trade , and shipping with the UK overthrew his post , according to the historical documents collected by the George Washington Project 's online papers .	-4.8498
But he has not silenced them .	-1.5966
Freedom of speech , disagreement and discourse are at the heart of our nation .	-2.4602
And true leadership means accepting it .	-1.6638
Ronan Raffiery Hopes for Renaissance Club Home Comfort	-4.3263
Former European No. 1 Ronan Rafflety will hope for home comfort in the next three days , as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .	-4.9674
The Northern Ireland , which led to the final round next door to the Archfield Links last year , before losing against Paul Eales , is linked to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador on behalf of the club founder and CEOs Jerry Sarvadi .	-6.1821
" I saw how the Renaissance Club was built , and we see how it gained its fame with this event , " said Rafflety .	-4.8271
" The players will see this course from their best side , it is in a great condition .	-3.8284
Jerry did a great job when he set up this place .	-3.3468
He is a keen defender of this game and is proud of his performance here .	-3.1710
This is a great showcase for this course . '	-2.6620
The Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , although he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32 years of career .	-4.5627
" This really feels special , " said Southport based player .	-4.1616
" I couldn 't defend the Extremadura Open because it was taken out of the program in the year after I had won it .	-3.3013
To return to this part of the world is magical .	-1.8912
It is a wonderful place to play golf .	-1.8134
Last year 's memories come back , and it was something special for me and my wife , Sharon , to win here last year .	-3.6311
It was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . '	-2.7122
Gary Orr , who came to the European Senior Tour earlier this year after his 50th birthday , returns to the action on home soil .	-3.8848
This event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .	-2.0576
" It always means a bit more when you play at home , " said Orr , the man from Helensburgh .	-2.6281
" You want to do it well , but you also feel this extra pressure .	-3.2702
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .	-1.9717
I am glad to see how it went . '	-4.5012
With the trio on the field are former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and Senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst , Roger Chapman , Mark James and Mark McNulty .	-3.8329

Less lung cancer deaths from passive smoking	-2.6147
In the last two decades , fewer and fewer people have died of lung cancer because of passive smoking .	-2.5928
This is the result of a study by scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf ( UKE ) .	-3.3563
" According to our estimates , 167 lung cancer deaths per year are attributable to passive smoking , " said Professor Heiko Becher .	-3.2396
In comparison , he drew up his own study on the subject of 1994 .	-4.6327
At that time there were 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking in Germany every year .	-3.7948
The new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health .	-1.9550
Domestic connections prove to be very complex .	-4.4479
The construction works in Villinger Stra<unk>e are in full swing and " are reasonably in time " , says the head of the construction station Fred Heinze .	-5.7818
In the area of home connections , the situation is more complicated than expected , as there is much hiding in the underground , which is not indicated in the plans .	-7.3458
Traffic , which repeatedly obstructs construction works , is a major problem for the Stumpp company ’ s construction truck .	-6.1076
" The ignorance of drivers in front of red traffic lights and bars is already enormous , " says Heinze .	-4.6932
The road is closed and only the bus lines are allowed to pass .	-5.4080
Angelo Caruso , Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz of Stumpp have been working on the bridge for weeks .	-1.9850

When Bardina Degi cooks dinner , she does not use a stove .	-3.6641
It even rarely uses a pot .	-2.7087
In her wooden house in Enarotali , the capital of the Paniai regency in the troubled Indonesian province of Papua , the housewife usually puts a sweet potato - locally called " nota " - directly into the fireplace .	-4.6213
After half an hour the charred bulb is taken from and swallowed with eager , unashed hands .	-6.3930
Degi sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , for example washing clothes with cloudy water from the nearby swamp .	-5.4715
A bucket in a roofless room serves as a latrine .	-2.6956
As the youngest of her husband 's four wives , she was not assigned any fields .	-3.4900
Polygamy is common here .	-1.4538
Of course , late to work can be dangerous : most villagers are unemployed , and many drink hard , and there are soldiers here .	-2.9452
" Nobody dares to walk around in the village after 5 p.m. " she says .	-2.9656
It is a rare insight into daily life in the highlands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was admitted in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,026 elders were to vote in front of the occupying forces through a public hand survey .	-12.7089
An existing movement that stirred up independence against Dutch rule quickly turned against the Jakarta government , which controls the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers .	-5.0761
In 2003 , the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua , with the independent part of Papua New Guinea covering the eastern part of the island .	-4.0550
Enarotali is as remote as it might be .	-3.3045
There is no public transport .	-1.8665
The city of about 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences and corrugated iron roofs transformed by rust into various yellow-brown tones .	-5.2835
Few Indonesians have travelled here , let alone journalists and virtually no foreigners .	-3.1281
Before Christian missionaries arrived , Mee Pago Papuans worshipped a god called Uga Tamee .	-2.3080
There have also been other changes .	-1.5359

Papua is Indonesia ’ s poorest province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst child mortality and literacy rates in Asia .	-2.9140
But it is also Indonesia ’ s goldland .	-2.4747
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Grasberg , owned by the Phoenix Freeport McMoran , is only 60 miles from Paniai , a highland province of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants .	-3.2183
In 2015 alone , Freeport lost $ 3.1 billion in gold and copper .	-2.2306
Papua also has an estimated $ 78 billion in timber resources .	-2.3638
But this wealth is a source of misery for the Papua , who ensure that Indonesia ’ s powerful military maintains a stifling presence .	-3.6885
A 2005 survey in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid nearly $ 20 million to local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004 , including up to $ 150,000 to a single officer .	-3.9038
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden gans and are treated mercilessly .	-2.7218
According to activists , more than 500,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been raped , tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969 .	-2.3269
Mass killings in Papua ’ s tribal highlands in the 1970 ’ s became genocide under the Asian Human Rights Commission .	-3.0655
In the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful demonstrators last year .	-2.0985
" We Are All Losing " is stated in a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane , which contains reports of last year 's atrocities , such as unlawful executions and torture - rape and electrical strikes are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal crackdown on peaceful demonstrations .	-5.7179
" It is difficult to count the number of victims because incidents happen every week , " says Andreas Harsono , Indonesia 's Human Rights Watch researcher .	-3.3926
The bolts have intensified as Papua 's resources bring an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia .	-4.1189
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic changes as Muslim economic migrants come from the populous islands of Java , Borneo , Sumatra , and Sulawesi .	-2.9678
Javanese canteens sell fried chicken and Gado , a mixed vegetable with peanut sauce served .	-4.4690
Local people are fighting to keep up here .	-6.7955
" The migrants have begun to sell chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than local Papua , " says Abeth You , a 24-year-old Paniai resident who moved to the provincial capital Jayapura .	-4.5652
'It has cost the local Papua - the Mama Mama [ the Women ] of Papua - their market ' .	-5.5795
Indonesian President Joko Widodo , popularly known as Jokowi , promised to address the inequalities and violations in Papua during his 2014 campaign .	-3.5217
The former carpenter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua , including Paniai , on his way to the presidential palace in Jakarta .	-3.4602
But little has changed in Papua , and today the locals feel cheated .	-3.0939
" Our hearts have broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014 , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , " says You .	-3.5560
Indeed , only two months after Jokowi ’ s inauguration in October , Paniai suffered a low point .	-2.2315
On December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children were out and sang Christmas songs in front of a campfire in Enarotali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle .	-3.6920
The frightened children told them that they should turn on their headlights .	-3.2486
One of the soldiers took offense at their tone and came back later with four soldiers , according to the local pastor Yavedt Tebai .	-6.0192
The soldiers who had drunk hunted and beat the group with their rifles , said victims and witnesses .	-3.7530
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .	-1.8844
A child , the 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo , was so badly beaten that he fell into the coma .	-2.7822
A few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire , and things escalated the next day .	-2.6635
Approximately 1,000 young Papua men , women , and children gathered in a football pitch in front of the local police station and the military commando center to demand justice .	-5.0484
They wore ceremonial hunting arches and performed the Waita dance - continuously in circle and imitating a bird song - by Papua 's Mee Pago tribe .	-5.9223
Some demonstrators began to throw stones on police and military posts .	-3.4193
When the mood was heated , a command was sent to the soldiers via an internal radio : " If the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , " says a TIME official document that was not released to the local media .	-5.7855
Yeremeias Kayame , 56 , the head of the Kego Koto quarter of Enarotali , saw the imminent danger and called for rest and called for the crowd to return home .	-4.2673
Nobody was listening in the mood .	-1.9696
" When I turned around , I was suddenly shot into my left wrist , " he said TIME on the veranda of his colourful wooden house .	-3.8285
Kayame still does not know who fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here .	-2.7529
" It was overcrowded , many shots were fired , " he adds .	-1.9154
The local man Alfius Youw was hit three times , so his cousin , who witnessed the shooting .	-3.3598
" I ran to him and studied his body to make sure he was , " said Yohanes , who , like many Indonesians , has only one name , the TIME in dismal mood .	-4.5519
" I saw that he was dead ... I ate him . "	-3.9909
The Chief Inspector of the Papua Police , Yotje Mende , told reporters that his officers wanted to " secure " their station because they were attacked .	-3.7203
" We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us , " said the spokesman of the Papua police , Commissioner Sulistiyo , in 2015 .	-3.3301
'It is about life and death ' .	-1.7811
According to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstrators were killed and many others injured .	-2.3598
The news about the killings came to Jakarta only on the following day ' filtered ' .	-3.3162
Three weeks ago , Jokowi made a passionate speech in Jayapura in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and vowed to address the historical grievances in Papua .	-4.3572
" I want this case to be resolved immediately , so that it will not happen in the future , " he said .	-3.1103
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he set up an extrajudicial mechanism to settle historical human rights violations .	-3.9122
But the excuses began almost immediately .	-1.4568
" Most injuries occurred long ago .	-1.5355
Some were in the 1990s and early 2000 's .	-2.4564
The point is that we have committed ourselves to tackling these violations , but there are processes that need to be gone through , " he said .	-4.9885
Then Wiranto retreated when he talked to TIME in Jakarta on June 5 , saying that he had no plans to set up a complaints mechanism in Papua .	-4.0028
Instead , ' everything is regulated by law ' , he said .	-2.3139
Wiranto , accused of " crimes against humanity " by the UN , which claimed more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor 's bloody 1999 independence vote , said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had already been resolved , including the Paniai incident .	-4.7579
Families of the Paniai victims opposed such claims with grim infidelity .	-6.4384
" I have been interviewed four times over the last three years , but there has been no progress , " says Yohanes .	-3.0362
'I am tired . '	-1.5206
He says that years later he still lives in fear .	-2.2888
" I am afraid , " he says .	-1.3170
'I am afraid of being arrested by the military , afraid of being shot . '	-3.4645
His brother , Yacobus , repeated the view that the people of Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident .	-3.5832
He says that he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims .	-1.9164
" After I had buried the corpses , the military looked for me , " he says .	-2.9845
The shootings did not stop .	-1.7535
On Tuesday the Indonesian police shot villagers in Paniai neighborhood Deiyai .	-2.7154
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company that refused to bring a unconscious man to hospital , one person died and 17 others were injured , including children .	-3.5494
The man , 24-year-old Ravianus Douw , who was drowned when he fished in a nearby river , died on his way to hospital .	-2.8004
Broken villagers protested in front of the company ’ s office .	-8.1954
The police said that the villagers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warning shots .	-9.2842
But locals say that the mobile brigade ( Indonesian paramilitary police ) began to shoot at the crowd and killed one .	-2.2716
" We were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , " says the 29-year-old Dominggu Badii , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly admitted here , according to the TIME .	-5.2206
'I have been hiding in my house for two days ' .	-2.9835
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the officers involved to be held accountable and for withdrawing the mobile police brigade from the area .	-4.4745
Paniai has always been a source of unrest for the Indonesian Government .	-2.4183
The lack of meaningful development reinforces the dissatisfaction of the tribal members of Mee , Moni , Dani and Damal who live in the green highlands of Papua .	-4.0878
Many joined the " Free Papua Movement " ( OPM ) , the rebel army , which claims to defend the rights of Papua by launching sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers .	-3.1015
Some of the top OPM leaders are from Paniai , including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya .	-2.2351
In response , thousands of people have been arrested in Paniai in recent years and arbitrarily detained on the pretext of ' safeguarding national sovereignty ' .	-3.4448
Some never appear again .	-2.2567
Among the people of Papua , Paniai is known as " a tragic , forgotten place " .	-2.7577
Poverty strengthens discontent .	-1.6097
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals .	-2.2503
Bread is just as remote .	-2.0834
People here are building everything they eat : Nota , fruit and leafy vegetables .	-3.4465
Agriculture is the task of women who can work on four or five fields of sweet potatoes .	-4.2383
They keep the bulk of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market .	-6.1349
Ten pieces of Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees ( 75 cents ) .	-1.6919
Over time , economic inequalities have grown between indigenous Papua and new migrants , who have reached a greater number since new flight routes opened to the airport of Nabire .	-6.0042
The few jobs that exist in the region typically go to the better-educated and wealthier migrants .	-2.9495
Papua rarely have the capital or the skills needed to lead their own businesses competitive .	-3.9818
" Young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money here , " says John Gobai , chairman of the Paniai tribal council .	-3.7564
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua .	-1.2400
Moreover , restrictions on reporting remain rife with international media .	-3.2505
At the beginning of the year , French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua for lack of coordination with related institutions , even though they were given rare permission to film .	-6.5364
According to Phelim Kine , the Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch of Asia , Jokowi ’ s campaign ’ s promises to lift restrictions on reporting in order to promote transparency and development have not been realized .	-4.8837
" There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia 's restless eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua : visa refusal and a black list , " he said in a statement .	-3.4663
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely confined to Papua ’ s immediate neighbors .	-3.0640
In March , six Pacific states - Tonga , Nauru , Palau , Tuvalu , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate " various and widespread violations " in Papua , including the Paniai Shooting Company .	-4.3618
The same countries have historically supported the OPM .	-4.9766
The spokesman for the Indonesian Foreign Ministry , Arrmanatha Nasir , rejected the group 's accusations and said journalists in Jakarta : ' Indonesia still has a democratic system and there is free media , so it is difficult to cover up the evidence of human rights cases ' .	-4.9202
The people on the ground want more foreign governments to take note of this .	-4.6812
When an official delegation from the Netherlands , led by the human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar , visited Jayapura on 4 May , locals broke their silence and urged him to remain " We want freedom " , according to a source that also attended the meeting but wishes to remain anonymous .	-5.7610
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua say that they are unlikely to vote for Jokowi again .	-2.5042
" Jokowi is a person who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Paniai shooting , " says Gobai , the chairman of the tribal council .	-4.5755
He wants Jokowi to know that , apart from living under the constant threat of a predatory military , the Paniai people are in poor education and health services .	-3.8175
Gobai says that the Paniai people , like other Papua , regard their voice for Jokowi as a " debt " that he has to repay .	-4.1612
" They do not need money , they just want justice , " he says .	-2.2818
Despite the threats and intimidation , the Paniai victims ' families carried out a final symbolic act of comfort : the corpse of a victim was buried on a ground just opposite the police and the military station .	-5.6495
They know that they may never have justice , but at least they do not let those responsible forget their crimes .	-3.7900
" A member of our family was killed , " says Yacobus with a shrewd head .	-3.8392
'What else can we do ? '	-1.4916
Collect the Torch skyscrapers of Dubai for the second time .	-3.8536
A fire took place on Friday in one of the highest residential towers in the world in Dubai and forced hundreds of residents to flee from the 337-meter high 79-storey building .	-4.1458
It is the second fire that blows through the high-rise building in just two years , which is randomly called the Torch Tower .	-6.2256
The building was evacuated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .	-2.6020
" We slept and we stood up at the fire alarm and the shouting of the people .	-7.6711
We ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor , " a resident who told his name as George angab , Reuters .	-3.4239
Dubai ’ s civil protection authorities said that the fire-fighting units extinguished the fire at 4.00 local time ( 00.00 GMT ) and cooled the building .	-5.3483
The government said it is working to provide shelter for those affected .	-2.7833
The incident can revive questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high-rise buildings around the world . , , , , , and . , , , , , , , , , , ,	-6.0680
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage came from the covering , the outer covering for decoration or insulation .	-5.2501
In Britain , the police said that they believe that the system of slabs for insulation and coverings at the London Grenfel Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died .	-5.6249
No Davis Cup Reform : Best of Five	-2.0466
The President of the International Tennis Association ( ITF ) has passed the General Assembly with his big Davis Cup Coup .	-4.3051
At the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City , the revolutionary proposal for this sport to play Davis Cup single on only two sets of wins was hardly supported by the required two-thirds majority .	-6.3548
The long , but also highly appreciated five-piece classics are thus preserved in the traditional competition .	-9.2140
63.54 % of the member states voted in favour of the reform , so ITF President David Haggerty ’ s goal was narrowly missed .	-5.1203
" We respect this decision , but are disappointed that our member nations have not adopted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and the Fed Cup .	-2.6856
We need a change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historic contests , " said Haggerty .	-3.2787
They will continue to work to improve the job .	-4.0627
Not until the vote , after many objections , the proposal had already been made to carry out the final in a neutral place .	-6.4132
New from 2018 are only comparatively small details : The Davis Cup and Fed Cup finalists will have the right to host the next round in the coming year .	-5.6163
In order to reduce the costs for organisers , the requirements regarding training places and so on will be made easier and players will have to take less official media dates before the Davis Cup .	-6.9637
More than 1 out of 5 US travelers bring prohibited items onto the plane , finds a survey .	-6.3889
A survey conducted by air passengers revealed that more than 20 percent of deliberately or unconsciously banned items were smuggled past the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent of those who entered the aircraft while carrying accidentally banned knives or other items with blades .	-7.5809
Less than 1 % claimed that they had belatedly discovered that they had traveled mistakenly with firearms , ammunition , or explosives .	-3.7888
The survey of more than 1,000 people - carried out by a jet charter service , Stratos Jet Charters Inc . - also found that younger travelers tend to disregard the rules .	-4.9163
Of those surveyed who admitted that they deliberately tried to fly with something banned by the TSA , 19.7 % of millennials were members of generation X , compared to less than 15 % .	-4.6184
The most common objects deliberately bypassed TSA agents were food and liquids .	-3.0516
More than 3 % admitted that they knowingly carried objects with blades through security control , while 2.2 % of female respondents and 3.7 % of male respondents also confirmed that they had deliberately brought banned drugs into the plane .	-5.3409
The company said it had consulted travellers all over the country to find out how many smuggled goods inadvertently brought about by airport security and how many would have done it deliberately .	-7.4716
It is no surprise that the people most likely to carry smuggled goods - whether knowingly or unknowingly - through safety were those who fly most frequently .	-4.8223
However , the company points out that the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing .	-2.6966
People are often unsure which liquids they may carry or how much of them .	-3.5031
So it is no surprise that the largest amount of liquids banned by TSA are liquids .	-4.3113
For a while , people thought that TSA could view books as smugglers .	-3.3802
Liquids are permitted on domestic flights , but not on international flights .	-1.6145
Elon Musk doesn ’ t care : Tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel the order	-5.7496
Elon Musk is happy to announce the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla " Model 3 " .	-4.1833
So far he has denied that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation .	-5.1369
In addition to the always triumphant figures on sales increases and even bigger sales targets , Tesla CEO Elon Musk has for the first time revealed another , less brilliant figure when he announced the latest quarterly balance sheet : the cancellation of the new mass-market model 3 .	-8.0750
In recent months Musk had advertised more than 500,000 preorders for the new car , which is just beginning to be delivered .	-6.9040
Now Musk admits : Of the 518,000 preorders , 63,000 have already been withdrawn .	-4.4962
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations .	-3.2726
In case of cancellation Tesla will pay the 1000 Euro ( US $ 1000 and UK $ 1000 ) " reservation deposit " completely .	-5.7342
Currently , 455,000 of such non-committal reservations were made , and Musk admitted to a telephone conference with analysts .	-5.3957
However , Tesla boss does not believe that the cancellation of around 12 percent of all orders could become a problem .	-4.7191
His argument : the challenge of ambitious growth targets lies not in demand , but on the production .	-3.4276
Last year Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles .	-1.2369
In 2018 - all models taken together - it will be 500,000 , one million in 2020 .	-4.1729
The demand for this is obviously there .	-2.9195
According to Musk , there are currently 1800 reservations per day .	-2.7042
If you order a " Model 3 " today , you can expect delivery in the second half of 2018 at the earliest - if Tesla manages to drive its brand new production lines , which have never been tested in practice , with maximum capacity without major interruptions .	-6.5622
Many experts doubt that this is possible .	-1.4746
However , if there are major delays , the non-binding nature of reservations could become a problem for Tesla .	-5.0831
Because then the company cannot prevent dissatisfied customers from getting away in droves .	-4.5058
Pruitt , the EPO ’ s leader , is falling because of the flouting of the Obama-Era rules to reduce emissions .	-6.9234
One day after being sued by 15 states , Scott Pruitt , the head of the Environmental Protection Agency , retracted his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules to reduce emissions of smog air pollutants .	-4.5672
Pruitt presented the change when its agency proved more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administrations .	-3.5516
He did not mention the lawsuit that had been filed against his previous post in a Federal Court of Appeal .	-4.0703
It is a deadline for states on 1 October to meet the 2015 standards for ground-level ozone .	-3.7165
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid ' meddling in local decisions or impeding economic growth ' .	-3.7588
Pruitt , who was the Oklahoma Public Prosecutor before he was appointed by President Donald Trump , has long been a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations .	-3.9816
Since his arrival in Washington , Pruitt has repeatedly sought to block or delay regulations that the chemical industry and the fossil-fuel industry oppose .	-4.2834
The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the latest legal setback for the audit regulatory rollback agenda .	-3.1130
Last month , a federal court in Washington ruled that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of an Obama administration rule requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks .	-4.8350
In a statement published on Wednesday evening , Pruitt proposed that his about-turn on ozone standards simply reinforces the EPO ’ s willingness to cooperate with states through the complex process of timely compliance with the new standards .	-4.6896
" Under previous administrations , the EPO has often failed to meet the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be charged by activist groups and others , and in an agreement to set the deadline for implementation , " said Pruitt , who sued the EPO more than a dozen times in his previous job .	-5.2943
" We do not believe in legal regulation and we take deadlines seriously .	-2.4255
We also take the law and authority that exists for us seriously . ' .	-7.1440
However , the EPO 's opinion said that at some point Pruitt will use its ' late and all other legally available powers ' to ensure that the rules ' are based on sound policies and the best available information ' .	-5.5618
Congressional Republicans are pushing for a more comprehensive reform of the ozone rules .	-3.8183
A bill approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .	-2.6470
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate .	-1.5520
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman , who led the coalition of states that had sued the EPO this week , said that the group intended to maintain legal pressure .	-3.6656
" The reversal of the EPO - after our complaints - is an important benefit to the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities , " said Schneiderman .	-7.6229
New York joined in this case California , Connecticut , Delaware , Illinois , Iowa , Maine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Pennsylvania , Rhode Island , Vermont , and Washington , and the District of Columbia .	-2.0688
Soil ozone occurs when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil refineries , chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight .	-2.9255
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems for sensitive groups of people and contribute to thousands of premature deaths every year .	-3.0050
Public health officials and environmentalists cheered on Pruitt ’ s surprising change of course .	-3.4791
" It is disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this sensible step from the person responsible for protecting the air we breathe , " said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity .	-4.1571
" We must continue to fight the Trump administration 's ideological crusade to pander to polluters and their particular interests . "	-3.4014
Tumblingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilary Church	-2.4513
750 years of St. Hilarius Church : On the occasion of the anniversary of the Church of the Mountain , the old cemetery area in Tumblingen on Sunday , July 16 , at 4.30 p.m. is invited to a serenade .	-6.1746
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historic St. Hilarius complex is a popular place to stay .	-4.3606
Visitors to the sixth Benefiz-Seredade can be enchanted by this powerful place .	-3.6804
The rescue and maintenance of the oldest building in the village have made Tumblingen friends and supporters their concern .	-5.2135
Walter Martini stresses : " It is a unique village gem " .	-2.5512
In 1267 the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in the Württembergische Urkunstbuch : Count Hermann von Sulz sold " the mountain with the parish church on Tumblingen and the Vogtei " to Magister Eberhard von Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver .	-5.3626
According to the letter of the document , on the Tumbling mountain , apart from the former parish church , there was also a stately court , to which the church or the right of patronage belonged , and not the other way round .	-7.6067
So people lived there as well .	-3.1944
As can be seen from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt from 1858 , next to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf , which are still visible today in the townscape of Tumlingen , the " mountain " was the third , the stately settlement centre of the village .	-6.0099
Old maps from the time around 1600 confirm these historical features .	-4.6174
The law of patronage arose from the early medieval right of church .	-5.7423
A gentleman who built , furnished and occupied a church with a priest remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this church .	-5.5295
The right to appoint a pastor or or to propose a new pastor to the bishop was attached to it .	-4.7642
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower .	-1.9606
The larger of the two crumbled at Christmas 1673 .	-3.7397
The newly acquired bell then sounded for the first time in 1692 , but had to be handed over later in World War II in 1942 .	-4.9609
In the 30-year war ( 1616 to 1648 ) the windows were closed and the bell ropes were stolen .	-4.6901
The roof was leaked .	-3.6603
In 1796 , French troops were stationed near the church .	-2.7592
They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood .	-2.2754
Remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809 .	-1.8035
Until 1869 , the Tumblinger Hilarius Cemetery was also the last resting place for the dead of hearing welders .	-5.2301
In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Hilariuskirche was demolished .	-3.6074
Only the church tower was left standing .	-2.7932
In the New Year 's Eve 1834 a storm split the church tower and half collapsed .	-3.7619
In order to prevent an accident , the tower was aborted .	-4.4259
Only the tower dwarf that still exists today was preserved as a witness to the 750 years old church history .	-5.2795
Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem from the " Schaffigen Rentner " as successor to Dieter Dockhorn maintain the Hilarius facility .	-4.1206
On Sunday , July 16 , the Friends and Sponsors of Tumbling invite the sixth serenade to the old cemetery to the St. Hilariuskapelle .	-5.9681
It is designed by the combo of the Kepler Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with contributions by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis .	-4.0188
Local leader Hartmut Romann speaks the final word .	-3.4207
The program starts at 4.30 p.m.	-1.7567
Open from 3.30 p.m.	-4.0548
For the end of the Serenade there is a ring in front of the graveyard .	-5.2682
" Enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows towards the forest " , the organizers point out the fantastic view .	-4.6039
The Serenade takes place only in dry weather .	-3.4375
The organisers are hoping for many supporters to maintain the historic St. Hilarius facility , which is important for Tumblingen and Hörschweiler .	-5.4924
Friends and patrons of Tumblingen feel particularly committed to home care , as Serenade organizer Walter Martini confirms .	-4.9133
Association wants to have windmills approved	-4.2767
" Boisheim defeats " does not see any legal requirement for construction and has therefore approached the Agriculture Council .	-5.6586
The association " Boisheim defeats " has invited Landrat Andreas Coenen ( CDU ) to withdraw his permission for the construction of planned wind power plants in the Nette Boisheim .	-6.8948
It was made illegal .	-2.5149
The association argues that , at the time of its approval on December 30 , 2016 , no wind power plants could have been approved at all in the Nette Boisheim , because at the time in Viersen only a wind-power concentration zone existed at the city border to Schwalmtal .	-7.9383
Within this concentration zone , the construction and operation of wind turbines is generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone does not allow the use of wind energy for the rest of the city .	-5.7796
These zones are designed to prevent the landscape from being " sealed " .	-4.6166
The city of Viersen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette a few days earlier by amending the land use plan - but it had not been approved by the district government of Düsseldorf because of a form error .	-7.2232
" Due to the lack of planning requirements , the approval certificate issued remains illegal and therefore also to be withdrawn , " said Christoph Erkens , Chairman of " Boisheim defeats " .	-6.1208
The current state of affairs : before the summer recess , the City Council decided once again on the wind concentration zone in the Nette Boisheim ; a permit from the district government is still pending .	-8.4861
Erkens : " This means that the granting of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is excluded from planning law " .	-6.8029
The circle confirms the receipt of the request .	-2.1186
" The corresponding letters have been received by the circle of Viersen since last week , " said a speaker .	-4.7807
The circle is taking them to look at the matter again .	-4.3697
However , they are not likely to stop the process .	-4.1632
With a view to ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court , the circle did not want to comment on the content of the arguments of the association " Boisheim defeats " on Thursday .	-6.8572
NEW Re , a subsidiary of NEW , plans to build four windmills , each 200 metres high , on an area at Nette Boisheim .	-5.2952
Last year , the company , in which the city of Viersen was indirectly involved , had already concluded lease contracts with the owner of the 65 hectare site .	-5.4368
With the construction of the four wind power plants , the electricity demand is to be met by around 11 400 households - which is equivalent to about one-fifth of the electricity demand of all four households .	-7.3766
The NEW Re wants to invest around EUR 20 million .	-2.2249
Last summer , Viersen ’ s Stadtrat gave the green light to buy three wind turbines in the Linnich wind farm near Aachen and to participate in a wind energy plant in <unk>bach-Palenberg in the district of Heinsberg .	-4.6088
Car and tractor crash together : woman dies in terrible accident	-6.0150
A terrible traffic accident took place on Friday morning at around 10 a.m. on the L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel ( Rhein-Lahn Prize ) .	-6.7344
A woman was killed .	-1.9397
Two other people were slightly injured .	-1.8854
The provincial road remained closed for hours .	-2.8388
According to police data , a 17-year-old young woman from Bornich , with her car , uses her 53-year-old mother as an escort to the L 333 in the direction of Bogel .	-6.3229
City and Dealers Planning Home Shoots Weekend	-4.0521
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region are supposed to rediscover shopping in the city centre in September .	-4.4966
The trade association and the town administration want to use the weekend on September 8th and 9th to attract the inhabitants to the shopping area .	-6.9741
As the chairman of the trade association , Christian König , announced , the " home-shop " weekend is intended to sensitize customers to what offers their own city offers apart from the usual supermarket goods .	-7.3997
A market with regional providers is therefore planned , similar to the weekly market .	-3.6940
In addition , domestic companies will present themselves with their training places .	-4.1245
In addition , the shops of the city centre should invite you to " midnight shopping " .	-5.6995
The action is aimed not only at residents of the city and the region .	-4.7982
In preparation are commercials on the radio , an Internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend , according to Christian König .	-4.1002
City administration and trade association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce .	-3.8841
This means that the trade association and the city will enter another stage of the project " Attractive downtown " .	-5.6955
This includes new offers , such as the first " Active Day " at the Brunnenfest and sale Sunday , discussions with all traders and hosts to encourage them to participate actively .	-6.7762
Also attractive offers for Saturday and the waiver of parking fees on that day are part of the concept .	-3.8418
In addition , customer potential is to be opened up again or again .	-4.7615
These include spa guests and tourists .	-2.6456
But many locals would also have lost sight of the city when shopping .	-4.3526
In the end , everyone would have to contribute to reviving the city centre , including landlords , businesses across the city and associations .	-6.0955
It is necessary to overcome the lethargy with a network , which partly spread , King said in the spring .	-5.2323
Birgit Streit , head of the IHK-Center in Mühlhausen , announced that five Thuringian cities will participate in the third " Heimat-Schoppen " day in Germany for the first time .	-6.0190
In addition to Bad Langensalza , these are Weimar , Sömmenda , Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode .	-6.3677
The day should ' promote the appreciation of local trade and emphasise its importance to the common good of our cities ' , says Streich .	-5.8935
The campaign under the auspices of the IHK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen with his or her buying behavior can influence his or her direct environment .	-6.7655
Two dead and several injured after US school explosion	-3.3752
During construction work there was a gas explosion in the school building .	-2.9830
New people have been injured .	-2.1062
Two people were killed and nine others injured in a gas explosion in the US city of Minneapolis , some of them severely .	-3.6466
According to the fire brigade , on Wednesday ( local time ) there was still an injured person in critical condition .	-4.9667
One person died when part of a school building collapsed during the explosion .	-3.1604
A first missing person was also rescued later .	-5.4761
The dead were school employees .	-1.7126
As an accident , the authorities suspected work on a gas pipeline .	-3.3084
At the time of the holiday , few people stayed in the Minnehaha Academy building .	-4.3367
Trump put pressure on Mexico for paying the border wall after leaked transcripts of phone calls .	-4.0484
Transcripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .	-2.4920
On January 27 , Trump , in a phone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto , asked to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall .	-3.7072
The US President insulted him because he had publicly denounced the wall , and reportedly said to him : ' You cannot tell the press . '	-5.1345
Trump launched his presidential campaign with a promise to build a wall on the US southern border , vowing to make Mexico pay for the project .	-4.1111
transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and revealed a tense exchange .	-2.9313
Mr. Trump said Mr. Turnbull that trade for the US was " ridiculous " to take over refugees who emigrated to Australia , " mies " and " stupid " , and that the existence of trade mediated by the Obama administration would make him look like a " depp " after he proposed a ban on the resettlement of refugees to the US .	-6.8044
Mr Trump ended the call after saying to Mr Turnbull that ' this is the most unpleasant call for the whole day ' .	-3.9582
Moore ’ s Ford Massacre : Activists resurrect racist Lynchakt as a call for justice .	-4.0506
A 1948-year-old Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in rural Monroe , Georgia , and jumped to the Ford Bridge from Moore .	-4.2333
Before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver could reach the bridge , a group of white men came out with guns to block its way .	-5.4564
The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man in a needle stripe suit - took a long train at his cigar and looked through the windscreen .	-7.4649
Inside , the occupants hovered in fear .	-3.3227
" We want this n ---- r Roger ! " the man shouted .	-3.2963
'Get him out of the car ! '	-1.1202
Tales torn the silence when a young black man was dragged from the front-passenger seat .	-5.0123
Fortunately , this terrible scene , which was played on 22 July , is just a sequel .	-4.3055
But when a noose is thrown around the neck of " Roger " , almost everyone in the audience threw out very real sighs .	-4.6271
Since 2005 , civil rights activists have returned to Moore 's Ford Bridge to imitate the night when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by Ku Klux Klan in 1946 .	-4.6374
No one has ever been charged with the murders .	-2.6284
" It is really incredible that not a single person has been arrested in all these years - although we see them in our communities , although we know who they are , " said Tyrone Brooks , who is helping to organise reproduction .	-5.8829
'It is a stain on a story , but it is a burden on our souls ' .	-3.1679
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Congressman of the State of Georgia and a civil rights activist for a lifetime .	-3.6235
For him , the posture serves as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected .	-3.9917
" We want prosecution , we want an end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we need justice , " he said .	-3.3667
'We cannot achieve healing and reconciliation until we get justice ' .	-2.7877
A forensic doctor lays a bedcloth over the corpse of one of the victims of the Moore Order Lynch on July 27 , 1946 .	-6.1337
According to FBI files received by NBC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the Lynch process .	-3.5430
But no one has ever been charged .	-2.2417
Although the suspects have remained at large for decades , civil rights activists say that the double motivation for Lynch actions throughout the city has always been known : politics and sex .	-4.9193
In April 1946 , a Supreme Court ruling enabled the black citizens of Georgia to vote for the first time in the summer pre-election campaign .	-4.0511
At about the same time as the election , according to the FBI , the black farm farmer Roger Malcom stabbed a white landowner , Barnett Hester , during a fight - allegedly because of a woman .	-5.6113
Brooks said that the rumor was in the city that Hester slept with Malcoms Dorothy , and that the baby she wore was not from her husband .	-4.1270
On July 25 , 1946 , Loy Harrison , a prominent white landowner , paid $ 600 to release Malcom from prison , according to the FBI .	-3.0291
He was accompanied to prison by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey .	-2.1948
But when they moved away from prison and approached Moore 's Ford Bridge , a lynchmob surrounded the car .	-3.5087
" As it turns out , it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murders , " concludes a FBI report .	-2.7182
" It is also obvious that there was a plot between state and local prosecution , which was not only involved in the murders , removed evidence and covered up the identity of witnesses " .	-5.1829
Brooks formulates it even more succinctly .	-2.2952
" It was an electoral massacre , " he said .	-1.4543
'They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : ' If you register and if you vote , that will happen to you here ' .	-4.1000
For nearly a decade , Cassandra Greene led the annual replication of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murders .	-3.2015
Their presentation is vivid , moving and is based on a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe that it no longer exists in America .	-5.8229
It is hard to watch , and even harder to look away , but Greene said that is the point .	-3.5144
" We don 't want to talk about the lynching because we are then confronted with its ugliness in all of us , " she said .	-4.1908
" But I can 't build a relationship with you if you don 't want to listen to me or if you don 't want to hear what I have " .	-4.4956
The rehearsals for this year 's production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest of the black - rushed into a room and laughed when Greene started a well-rehearsed overview of the piece .	-6.1988
Wade Marbaugh is Greenes co-director .	-1.9260
He has played the role of chief clan member for years , but he said the role would never be easier .	-6.6196
" I feel dirty because I am not so , " said Marbaugh .	-2.1661
" But I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return to these times . "	-3.0408
On the other side of the room , the actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona , who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester , tried their lines .	-2.8254
The play begins with Malcom , who attacks Hester , furious that he has slept with his wife Dorothy .	-4.6966
'I said n --- he , vanished from my property ! '	-2.8124
Rascona reciprocates the fire .	-3.4382
There is a pause .	-0.8698
And then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .	-2.4720
Greene laughs the loudest .	-1.1383
" What ? ! " Rascona asked .	-2.1936
It is alarming and confused .	-1.4868
Was I too hard ?	-1.2348
" No , " Greene said , still kicking .	-2.0506
" I simply do not think that white people said ' n --- he ' .	-2.9268
" But , " one of the other black actors quipped .	-3.6332
'You just have to hit the hard ' R. ' .	-2.2923
And that is exactly where the energy shifts in space , a sense of comradeship replaces the unease .	-4.3085
Everyone is busy getting this right , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four people killed .	-3.1619
The scene starts again .	-1.5513
This time , when Rascona says the N word , he says it sharply and forcefully .	-3.8392
Absolutely no one laughs .	-1.5653
This repetition ends up violent and fast .	-2.6632
There are cries , shots and then silence .	-1.2838
A woman dressed with a wedding dress stands above the corpse of the actor and performs Billie Holidays mourning praise " Strange Fruit " .	-5.2711
Your voice breaks at every second word .	-2.1755
About one hundred meters behind it , a group of about four dozen spectators sucks away sweat and tears .	-5.5025
The audience is divided almost evenly between black and white .	-2.1578
A couple came from Ithaca , New York , to see the performance , many come down the street .	-4.1450
They have experienced almost eight hours of Georgia ’ s crushing moisture when Brooks travels to the tombs of Malcoms and Dorseys on a pilgrimage .	-6.4443
Up to this point , the murders have remained an anecdote , but now that you are standing in the same country where the Lynch murders have taken place , the air is sparking .	-5.8648
When the last notes of the song end , Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the corpse .	-2.9612
Children watch their heads , register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whisper to each other .	-4.4273
" They are not really dead , " a young boy murmurmurs as if he wanted to remember .	-3.8144
After a few minutes Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it 's over .	-2.4008
The actors throw away the Lynchseil and wipe their tears .	-3.6597
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh , the man who played the clan member .	-2.5299
Nick Rascona hugs two of his fellow players and then breaks down in her arms crying , the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through with him .	-5.1718
" It is okay " , one of the women whispers .	-2.1725
" We know that this is not in your heart .	-1.7068
You did so for one reason . '	-1.6752
Later , the audience and the actors joined forces for dinner .	-6.2245
At one table a white couple from Atlanta chats excited about the replication with a black pair they have just met .	-4.8725
Denise Dulinski fought to find words that left the performance feeling .	-3.6941
" It 's hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like you and who do it because they look like you , " she said .	-3.4614
" What this really does with me makes me believe that the lynching is still going on , " she added , " today this is called only police shouting . "	-5.8060
In the same room , Tyrone Brooks ’ s court holds his table , eats and recalls civil rights .	-4.1192
He said he had already started planning the performance next year .	-3.4310
" The posture is somewhat inspiring , because it describes the horror of what we have endured , but it is also a moment of learning , " he said .	-3.2956
" It 's so if we don 't learn anything from it , then it can happen again .	-4.0002
Those who do not study their own history , those who do not know their own history , are condemned to repeat it . '	-3.1850
" Dawn of Gods " reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreut.	-3.2073
In the fourth part of Richard Wagner ’ s monumental work , director Frank Castorf also relies on a colourful , frivolous staging against a gigantic six-storey backdrop .	-5.2901
The revolving stage ( designed by Aleksandar Denic ) offers a shabby street corner including the Berlin Wall and the Dönerbude , a GDR Plaste and elaste logo or the New York Stock Exchange .	-5.4431
Before that , an open Mercedes vintage car parks in which the Rhine daughters pose as rockers , or alternatively an Isetta .	-6.2136
Captured oil barrels remind of Castorf 's leitmotif - money , power and greed - which draws through its " ring " staging .	-5.6229
The three Rhine daughters - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel , Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize beautifully as in the .	-3.8865
Kess seduces Siegfried ( Stefan Vinke ) , crush a corpse in Hollywood style into the boot and give the Krawallo clique .	-5.6042
Stephen Milling sings the wonderfully nasty Hagen that surrounds the aura of a heavyweight boxer .	-3.8732
Brutal the scene when he shoots Siegfried .	-1.7794
Later , Gunther ( Markus Eiche ) must believe in it .	-4.3814
The audience thanks the ensemble with strong applause .	-2.0461
Foster , Milling , Vinke and conductor Janowski are celebrated strikingly , who formally bows his hands to Merckel-Raute .	-6.6817
There is great applause for the Festival Orchestra , which is on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat again in casual leisure clothing .	-6.3965
Frank Castorf and his team of directors were eagerly awaited .	-2.8203
In 2013 , if he had yet to have a running concert , five years later , there was great jubilation in which the sporadic " Buh " rounds fell .	-10.1932
Festival director Katharina Wagner should have been pleased about this .	-4.9189
" You notice that the audience has somehow grown together with the " ring " , she said just before the performance of the dpa .	-4.4864
The audience not only made a form of peace with Castorf , but also grew an understanding of his view .	-4.2235
I would like to draw a positive conclusion .	-3.4785

Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs and cuts the dividend to revive business .	-2.9564
On Friday , the British education group Pearson said that it would cut another 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividend by 72 % , as another restructuring program was launched to overcome the pressure that the company faces .	-5.8571
The job cuts , which Director-General John Fallon largely announced at the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019 , are in addition to his previous restructuring , which has already lost 4,000 jobs .	-5.2624
In May , Pearson announced a cost-cutting plan of another <unk> 300 million ( $ 394 million ) in a third cost-cutting program to revive a business hit by the rapid move to digital learning .	-5.1547

On May 31 , a massive bombing in the center of the city killed more than 150 people with the country ’ s deadliest military attack since the US-led troops ousted the Taliban from power in 2001 .	-3.8297
The violence underscores the precarious security situation in Afghanistan , as US President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of US troops supporting the military and police in the country .	-3.1914
Respondents say that the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , its policies , and , in particular , the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani .	-4.2005
EPO Returns Decision to Delay the Smog Rule after Claims	-3.8604
The US Environmental Protection Agency has repealed a decision to delay the Obama administration ’ s regulation requiring states to contain smog-causing emissions , one day after 15 states sued the Agency for the move .	-5.4311
The EPO announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the so-called ' ozone provisions 2015 ' and said that it indicated the Agency 's commitment to cooperate with states .	-4.7917
" We believe in dialogue with and that we are responding to our state partners , " said EPO leader Scott Pruitt in a statement .	-4.5298
Pruitt announced in June the EPO 's intention to delay the ozone provisions - in which pollutant emissions are to be measured in part of the country in order to determine where cuts need to be made to comply with stricter air quality standards - by one year until October 2018 .	-6.3718
A group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , filed suit on Tuesday , saying that the effort was illegal .	-3.6869
President Donald Trump ’ s administration has sought to reduce a wide range of environmental requirements that former President Barack Obama has imposed as part of a broader agenda , which Trump claims to boost economic growth .	-5.2324
However , efforts have triggered the backlash of democrats and nature conservation groups , which are concerned about the impact of greater emissions on public health .	-5.0018
The EPO website says that inhaling air containing ozone " can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms " such as asthma .	-4.4665
Community area	-1.8187
In the end , the decision was clear : in the event of two votes against , the municipal council of Fluorn-Winzel decides to create a common area in the future residential complex .	-6.3534
Before the discussion there is an important information : the purchase contract for the missing property is signed , reports Mayor Bernhard Tjaden .	-4.6019
Although it will still take time for the area currently belonging to the parish to be in municipal ownership , there is no longer any obstacle to planning the project to be undertaken by a private investor .	-7.5199
There is a discussion on a Community area .	-3.5623
One of the two investors still in the boat offered to meet the community .	-3.2951
On the ground floor , it would provide a living area of approximately 55 square metres and an adjacent terrace of 70 square metres for a special price .	-4.2210
The administration and the majority of the municipal council intend not to provide such a common area as a meeting point only for the residents of seniors , but to enter the community openly .	-7.0686
As an example , the word " Strickcafé " made the rounds .	-3.7970
The decision , which was already pre-decided last autumn by the allocation of funds for the current budget , will be sweetened by funding .	-7.1075
The building is located in the redevelopment area . of is . is . is . is .	-6.6270
According to Tjaden , the creation of a Community area would be eligible for funding at 60 % of 30 % .	-3.3858
In order to signal to the investor that they do not want to throw a stick between their legs in this respect , the proposal for a decision provides for the observation that both saddle- and the surrounding construction - and pull-roof - which reduces the level of grief and makes building more economical - would be possible .	-10.3019
Not only does Wilfried Sohmer think that this addition is unnecessary .	-4.0174
If it helps : unanimity happens to the panel .	-3.8163
The Community area is not so easy .	-2.6350
Daniela Ruhe refers to the many buildings with which we do not really make progress , but we are now rejecting them from the window in the common room , she says : ' I am struggling with it ' .	-9.7205
Yvonne Staiger is strongly in favour of the Community area , but absolutely against local participation .	-4.7919
It sees a hidden subsidy to already wealthy or even foreign investors .	-3.7004
That is not the case , because the purchase of the area does not give a subsidy , but receives a real value that can be marketed in case of doubt , and that is the opposite .	-7.9783
Staiger ’ s request to split up the proposal for a resolution accordingly has three supporters .	-5.8014
Thus , two votes against the original programme , which Stefan Haller sums up : " If we take the decision in this way , we will take a huge step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure " .	-5.9667
Auto collision : Radler on the Road	-7.0032
On Wednesday in Garath , an 82-year-old cyclist was captured by a car and seriously injured .	-10.2121
As the police announced , the 82-year old Langenfelder had been travelling by bicycle at 12.20 p.m. on the cycle path of the road Schwarzer Weg from the direction of Hilden .	-5.8557
The senior wanted to cross the road at Am Buchholzer Busch .	-3.4225
A car guide in the same direction gave him priority .	-2.6731
When the Langenfelder took to the road , he apparently did not pay attention to the opposite traffic .	-5.1790
He joined a car that ran a 66-year-old Hildenerin .	-3.5707
The man was thrown onto the street .	-2.3611
He suffered severe injuries and was brought to a hospital with a saving money .	-5.1936

The FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory game of the new season .	-5.2351
Seven pros are missing the title defender in the Supercup against the Cup winner .	-4.0452
The teams at the German football record champion Bayern Munich are getting bigger and bigger before the Supercup on Saturday ( 8.30 pm / ZDF and Eurosport ) at Poklingensieger Borussia Dortmund .	-6.6356
In the duel with the BVB , coach Carlo Ancelotti must also renounce David Alaba .	-6.3244
The Italian confirmed this on Friday .	-1.7902
In addition , the coins of Manuel Neuer , James , Thiago , Jerome Boateng , Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat are missing .	-3.1037
For the five defeats in the last six test games , Ancelotti was responsible for the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team .	-4.6101
" We know that we are not in the best physical condition , " said Ancelotti and added : " The most important point is the balance in the team .	-3.4586
That was not good at the end of the day . '	-3.4004
The 58-year-old believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory game of the season .	-3.9787
" Football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation .	-1.0683
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .	-2.3082
The team is ready .	-0.6963
We want to play intelligently , " said Ancelotti , who expects a " difficult , intensive game " .	-2.7921

Wandering from Star to Star in Harz	-2.9184
The first " star trail " is to be created in the Harz region .	-5.0104
The association Sternwarte Sankt Andreasberg plans this .	-3.1486
A planetary path exists in Göttingen - since 2003 .	-2.2413
A " star trail " responds to the information needs of many Harz visitors , it was said .	-4.9526
It combines nature , science , movement and sporting performance .	-2.8670
Members want to set up tables along the planned route and inform them about stars and constellations .	-4.7083
In a first phase until 2018 , the association plans " accessible installations in five to six places " in Oberharz .	-4.5092
Infrage kämmen St. Andreasberg , Braunlage , Hohenei<unk> and Sieber .	-4.8579
The information on the table should be supplemented via the Internet .	-3.7738
That is why good mobile network reception plays a role in selecting locations .	-4.3746
Accessibility is also a criterion .	-1.7970
Later , the star trail of Zug is to be extended by train .	-4.7216
" On the star-path visitors will learn a lot of interesting facts , for example about the physics of the individual stars , " explained the association .	-5.8394
They also learned why stars have different colors , or why a star shines more than another , even though it is much further away .	-4.6187
It also deals with the constellation in which a selected star is located and when it is best to see .	-5.1315
The association has been operating the highest observatory in Northern Germany since 2014 in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg .	-3.3786
According to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the location in the middle of the National Park Harz is one of the six darkest regions in Germany .	-3.5842
From there , the Milky Way and even the Andromeda galaxy are often visible with the naked eye .	-3.8515
Since 2003 , at the initiative of the Planetarium Göttingen , the university town has had something similar to the planned Starwerg - the Planetenweg .	-5.7157
Starting in front of Gebhards Hotel in Goetheallee , which forms the interior of our solar system , the Planet Trail with its steles leads up to Hainberg and the observatory - as well as an " extraterrestrial " site in Diemarden ( municipality of Glen ) with the planet Sedna .	-6.2369
The steles with the individual planets - including Pluto at the endpoint degraded to the dwarf planet - are situated exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .	-5.6053
The Earth shrinks to a ball of 6.5 millimeters in diameter , while the exactly 75 meters away Sun measures 70 centimeters .	-4.6172
The entire distance of the planetary path is about four kilometres .	-3.9225
While the light from sun to Pluto takes about eight hours , pedestrians need a good hour to the Stele with Pluto .	-4.4927
Pedestrians are therefore faster than the light in space .	-2.2085
But the march to the next fix star would take half a year .	-3.6390
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time , discuss a possible showdown .	-2.1572
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia , who should be in a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing fight in the near future under <unk> 147 , met for the first time on Thursday .	-6.3101
They were in separate rooms in ESPN offices in Los Angeles , to Garcia , the unbeatable World Boxing Council Lightweight Champion , who went down the corridor to welcome Lomachenko , the World Boxing Organisation Super-Festival Champion .	-5.2776
After Garcia ’ s victory by unanimous decision on the former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday at Showtime , both fighters are members of the Top Five Pound for Pound list .	-5.2482
Garcia stretched out the right hand and said : " How do you , Champion ?	-2.8938
I wish you good luck . '	-1.2172
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday evening at 7 p.m. on ESPN .	-2.0890
When the couple posited for photos , Lomachenko Manager Egi 's climate noticed that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the " perfect size " .	-4.6874
" I am a former feather weight , " Garcia recalled .	-3.1553
" I got up for Broner [ to 140 pounds ] , but I 'm not so big .	-3.0581
I am small for 140 .	-0.8780
I would like to come down to the point of light .	-4.8031
And he has to move to lightweight [ 135 pounds ] and then we fight .	-3.3010
That is what the fans are asking for .	-4.3478
Let us give them that . '	-1.3004
Lomachenko agreed .	-1.5338
'Boxing needs this fight ' .	-2.0516
Climate asked whether it should be on pay-per-view , part of a strategy that Lomachenko has to fight with a 135 pound debut this year to agree next summer with Garcia a date ( 37-0 , 30 knockups ) that also has interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Linares Luke Campbell after their lightweight title in the forum on 23 September .	-5.6288
" This fight could take place in pay-per-view mode because all the fans asked for it , " Garcia said , and later expressed himself openly to fight in the network that offers the best financial package .	-5.1562
We are the best .	-0.6036
No other names can create this kind of attention .	-1.9039
Whenever they are ready ... "	-1.5459
Garcia said that he regarded Lomachenko as " an enormous fighter , " and he may be participating in his Saturday fight .	-8.4026
But Lomachenko stopped at the generous praise for Garcia and said that he thought the triathlon champion from Riverside see " very slow , sorry Mikey ... you wanted the co-out " .	-5.7393
Garcia said that the focus is to show punch , then boxing .	-2.9704
Both said that they could feel the momentum that arose for their own struggle .	-3.5981
" This is the battle that must be fought .	-2.6750
No other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm .	-2.2173
I am more than happy to work on it , " said Garcia .	-1.7565
Lomachenko said : " I have waited for the top fighters , and that is Mikey .	-2.7419
It will be a great fight . '	-1.6567
Four injured after Reifenplacer	-4.0829
In the event of an accident on the A7 , four people were seriously injured in part on Thursday afternoon .	-3.8819
According to the first information , the driver of an Opel Zafira probably lost control of his car at around 4.30 p.m. just before the market opening .	-7.3766
The car dragged to the right into the evil , where it swallowed and then remained on the roof in the green strip .	-6.6258
The four occupants - two adults and two children - were seriously injured in the accident .	-2.5792
During the first supply of the injured by the rescue service , the A7 was closed to the north for about one hour , and then the traffic on the left lane could be passed by the accident .	-7.0670
Fortunas Hoffmann : ' Triple chain works better '	-1.8883
After 2 : 2 , Andre Hoffmann hopes for the start of the season for Braunschweig that the optimization of the defence formation in Aue points .	-5.0513
Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the first round of the season , with the result too , if not the two opposing players were against Braunschweig at 2 : 2 .	-6.0651
" These were two opposing points too much , and we need to be even more careful in Aue , " says the defender of Fortuna Düsseldorf .	-5.6808
In the Ore Mountains the chain of triangles should also be further optimized .	-4.2831
And a gate after a kick-off , the Fortunes no longer want to catch up .	-7.5103
" For the future , it will be the case that no one will stand next to Michael ( Rensing ) . "	-5.1078
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better able to cope with the Triple chain even after the experience gained in the preparation than with the Quadernet .	-7.7866
" I don 't know how we are going to act in Aue yet , " says his coach Friedhelm Funkel , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , " because we have players who can build well in the triangle on the semi-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Giesselmann , " said Hoffmann .	-6.3947
'It is a prerequisite , but that we harmonise even better and that we do not make so many play-offs . '	-7.2532
Of course Hoffmann also drives to Aue to win the game .	-2.8029
" But if you can speak of a failed start after a draw , don 't know .	-4.5518
The performance could well be okay , " said Hoffmann .	-3.4491
'But if we can stand on Sunday with four points and focus on the Cup , we will certainly be able to talk about a proper start to the season ' .	-6.0456
His coach did not want to know about this .	-3.5210
" I will judge the start of the season only after six to eight days of play , " said Friedhelm Funkel , who does not want to speak of an advantage over Aue , just because the match of the Saxons in Heidenheim had to be cancelled prematurely due to a storm .	-6.1699
" Now they can start the season with a home game , " said Funkel and Hoffmann believe that players from Aue might even be a little fresher , as they would not have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against a top favorite in the bone .	-7.5602
" But they don 't know where they are today , " says Fortuna 's internal defender .	-4.4916
Although the guests from the Rhineland go to the meeting of the final ( almost ) finished stadium of Aue as a light favorite on Sunday .	-5.7792
" The fact that we are throwing them away just because we have the claim to be among the first six is nonsense , " says Funkel , whose balance sheet is very positive with only one defeat against Aue from nine games .	-8.0098
" There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga to beat from the start , " explains Fortuna 's chief coach .	-4.6030
'Making such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant ' .	-2.5508
And so Funkel certainly does not want to experience his players on Sunday .	-3.8865
New Results of Sweden 's Asylum Age Review	-3.8343
Recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , which have undergone a new method of medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 % of the people tested are over 18 years old , but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .	-5.5405
The Swedish Forensic Medicine Authority ( Rättsmedicinalverket ) started the tests last year .	-6.1152
They are to make the assessment of age more accurate during the asylum procedure , after the Swedish migration agency ( the immigration agency ) was criticised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were minors .	-8.0943
To date , migration sales have sent 6,880 cases to be tested , and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now released the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31st July 2017 .	-4.7754
Eighty percent ( 2002 ) were considered 18 or older , while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the person was " possibly 18 years or older " .	-3.7547
In 432 cases , the conclusion was that the person is " possibly under 18 years old " .	-2.1637
The tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .	-3.1506
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency , the results in recent months are consistent .	-2.7630
" We see no big difference in statistics of recent months , the numbers are fairly constant , " he said the magazine The Local .	-3.5770
The high proportion of cases in which the person has been judged to be over 18 does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has lied about his age .	-4.5157
In May , the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases ' suggesting that the person being investigated was 18 years or older ' .	-4.1207
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results , she found that in 243 of these cases the person had said openly that she would be 18 years old this year .	-4.1953
The method of medical age assessment , in which x-rays of wisdom teeth and MRT recordings of knee joints are made , which are then analysed by dentists and radiologists , has also been criticized in some areas .	-5.4238
A skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute , whose work involves assessing the biological maturity of humans to see if they went sooner or later than usual through puberty .	-4.0626
" I had reason to think about it and I do not think that the type of measurement should be used .	-2.6486
Judging biological age in this way is very uncertain .	-2.3786
If we cannot say it safely , we should not pretend we could , " he said to the newspaper Metro .	-3.5597
However , Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests : " In general , you can say that the risk of misjudging a child as an adult is low .	-3.4557
The greatest risk is when the person is under 18 , in this case this is about 10 % . '	-4.1541
Full Plan	-1.6322
Work on the three bridges of highway 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well .	-2.3036
On Wednesday , a seven-tonne concrete section was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach .	-3.9316
" We are very good at the time , it 's going super " , says Reinhold Leicht , head of the road and traffic department at the government headquarters in Freiburg .	-6.8884
In April the work began simultaneously on all three bridges in need of renovation between Schramberg and Lauterbach .	-3.8801
The construction is scheduled for October and it is easy to be sure that the timetable will be met .	-4.4894
The first bridge , coming from Schramberg , leads over the Trombach .	-2.1816
It is a concrete vault arch bridge covered with red buntsandstein and has a total length of 4.80 meters . are . are of . are of . of are . of of .	-7.8192
It was built in 1900 .	-1.3095
Like the other two bridges , it has now entered the years .	-3.7069
In order to ensure stability and road safety , the three buildings are now being thoroughly renovated .	-4.4884
The other two bridges cross the Lauterbach .	-1.9460
They are made of red buntsandstein .	-2.8522
Both were built in 1939 and are 12 or 10.60 metres long .	-3.4532
The bridge at the village entrance of Lauterbach has now received a 1.30 m wide and seven tonnes heavy bridge cap on the north side on Wednesday morning .	-5.7384
This is a border attachment , which is also used as an operating route .	-4.4714
On Friday , a 2.20 metre wide bridge cap will be installed on the southern part of the bridge .	-4.3362
That is where the pedestrian path should go .	-3.9575
The special thing about this is that they are finished parts , a patent of the Schramberg company Dizwo .	-3.9949
The other two bridges are already equipped with patented bridge caps .	-2.8054
Special sensitivity has required the installation of cables by the building in Lauterbach .	-4.8801
Because there is also a fibre optic cable to which many companies are connected .	-3.9748
The local residents were informed about the project in advance by hand paper .	-4.9800
In addition , fish and cancers had to be fished first .	-3.6974
For the bridges between the Bauhaus building and the Freizweiher in the direction of Schramberg , traffic is controlled by a single traffic light .	-5.4862
For the construction work on the bridge at the Lauterbacher entrance , the road is completely closed in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels " Tannenhof " and " Seven Linden " .	-4.7829
The total cost of the three bridge renovations is EUR 700 000 .	-3.5864
It is financed by the country .	-2.9141
AfD in Gerolstein : Bunter Protest in German potato salad	-2.6797
It is not so often the case that parties are pulling together , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( AfD ) comes together , which is difficult to reconcile otherwise .	-5.4114
The parties represented at the Volcanic Eifel ( CDU , SPD , Grüne , FDP , FWG , Left ) belong to a broad alliance , which on that day shows a peaceful flag , because the AfD in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle Rondell invites the poster " great campaign start " .	-6.6467
And well-known names are coming to the start , such as Alice Weidel , who together with Alexander Gauland is the top duo for the federal election on September 24 , and the deputy Federal Chairman Beatrix of Storch .	-6.4469
But those who are already on the spot hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the AfD people , but to demonstrate .	-5.4966
The motto " The Eifel remains colorful " .	-2.9522
Originally , the City Tick was planned under the motto " All at one table " on the Brunnenplatz , but now takes place in the parking lot below the Rondell - and thus directly in front of those who come to the AfD event in the Stadthalle .	-7.4849
A colourful picture that can be found there .	-3.4569
And what Christa Karoli , chairman of the One World Forum and one of the relevant organizers , is really pleased : " Great how many people have come together here " .	-5.8906
There is music and a lot of food , including an " primordial potato salad , which the AfD could eat easily " , says the woman who brought him with him .	-5.2079
The police have ordered many officials to Gerolstein , and they are also present at the railway station , which is only a few metres from the venues .	-9.1219
How did the AfD actually come on Gerolstein ?	-1.8526
Mario Hompes of the AfD Volcanic Eifel reports that he has endeavoured to attend such an event and won the prize .	-5.9333
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had first asked in Daun , but had received a cancellation because there were not enough parking spaces because of the already built Laurentius tree .	-7.1366
So now the Rondell , Hompes is pleased that " we can have such a nice event here " .	-3.6634
Looking at the event at Rondellvorplatz , he says : " This is the right of the people , the main thing is that it remains peaceful " .	-4.5672
This is also the case : around 8pm , a band provides entertainment on Rondellvorplatz , and several speakers in the Stadthalle , including the Rhineland pfälzische AfD Chairman Uwe Junge .	-7.6318
There are about 200 people in the hall who are waiting for the top candidate for the federal election , Alice Weidel , and the deputy Federal Chairman Beatrix of Storch to make their speeches .	-5.7653
The police presence is unchanged , but so far the officials have had a quiet evening .	-3.0486
The AfD event lasts a little more than an hour , the guests on the forecourt have a longer breath , but also there is a plan to clean up shortly after 9 p.m.	-11.6724
The police can move away - no special incidents .	-3.3765

Both soloists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have solo positions in top European orchestras .	-3.9515
Petkov Solotrompeter is the soloist of the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is the solo pianist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra .	-5.2829
Both combine the desire not only to cross the boundaries on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the various genres .	-4.5044
This is how Johann Sebastian Bach sings in a new dress , Daniel Schnyder 's " World Music " combines with Bulgarian folklore , and in the play " Exchange Suite " by the jazz composer Nils Wogau , classical music , jazz and free play merge into a fascinating piece of art .	-8.5511
This core piece of the programme was premiered this spring with huge success in Freiburg .	-4.3148
The renowned composer Nils Wogau wrote it specifically for the two musicians and more : The Haslach Monastery Church with its special acoustics is consciously included in the concert .	-5.4181

Now I look back and think to myself : ' Girls , be proud of you ! ' .	-3.6485
In particular , they don 't like to explain their love life to the public : " People expect you to relate to you in a certain way and that annoys me .	-5.6324
And perhaps some people call me thankless , but I do not like having to justify myself to the whole public . '	-4.1440
West Virginia Governor announced that he would change the Party .	-2.9963
. West Virginia ’ s Democratic Governor Jim Justice announced on Thursday evening that he would change the party at a rally with President Trump .	-3.3806
Whether you like it or not , the democrats have moved away from me , " said Governor Justice .	-2.3000
" Today I will tell you with many prayers and much thought ... today , as a resident of West Virginia , I will tell you that I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor . "	-4.6147
The rally erupted in jubilee .	-3.0929
" Tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republicans , " Justice added .	-1.7181
'As a trainer , I would say that it is time to play another game ' .	-2.7385
Mr. Trump promised a big announcement at the West Virginia Rally .	-2.6363
Mr. Trump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not approve Hillary Clinton ’ s Democratic candidate .	-2.2923
Justice , the only billionaire in the state , according to Forbes , was elected in 2016 .	-2.7472
Forbes noted that he owns coal mines in five states and inherited a coal business from his father .	-3.1798
It is worth about $ 1.59 billion .	-1.2221
In the meantime , on Thursday evening , the Republican National Committee issued a statement saying : ' The Governor Justice change is another blow to a Democratic Party that would prevent us rather than work to make our country great again ' .	-5.3719
" With only 15 governors and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement by Governor Justice is only the last rejection of a party that is free from top to bottom and unable to find a positive , unifying message , " said RNC Chairman Ronna McDaniel in a statement to CBS News .	-5.5953
Coe praises " honest " Russian excuse for doping scandal	-2.1624
On Thursday , the global leader of athletics , Sebastian Coe , praised what he described as an obvious apology from Russia for a doping scandal , but he repeated that it was not the time for the country to be re-admitted to sport .	-5.3631
Russia ’ s athletic leader Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championship that his country ’ s ban from sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping .	-4.6371
He said he was sorry for " all athletes who were caught up in gold and silver medals at competitions " .	-4.6023
Despite his comments , the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 , after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia .	-3.0040
" I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , " said IAAF President Coe to the reporters .	-2.3778
'The entire Council and Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation recognized for itself that it has experienced some rather hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the federation is reorganised ' .	-5.5189
Coe said that he was also ' pleased ' that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction .	-3.7109
" I think it was a very constructive day and I think that progress has been made , but Congress supports the recommendations of the task force that this is not the moment to reinstate Russia , " Coe said .	-3.1954
" We must do everything in the coming months to normalise this situation .	-2.7376
The guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate clean athletes from the corrupted system , " he added .	-2.7038
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete as neutral players at the World Athletics Championships , which begin in London on Friday , following the strict IAAF criteria .	-4.9802
On Monday , the head of the IAAF Task Force , Rune Andersen , said that Russia still has to meet some of the criteria for reinstatement .	-3.7903
Drug tests are still inadequate and banned trainers are still free to work , he said reporters in London after a lecture at the IAAF Council .	-3.8602
Muery for soldiers crashed in Mali	-4.3486
At a ceremony in Fritzlar , northern Hesse , about 1000 people thought of the two soldiers who died in a helicopter crash in Mali .	-6.7094
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the Domstadt under high security precautions .	-2.6760
On the undefined crash , Secretary of Defense Ursula of the Leyen ( CDU ) said nothing .	-4.3855
However , she called the two pilots who had arrived as " experts of her profession " .	-6.8211
" We salute the highest sacrifice they have made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany , " she explained .	-3.3920
The 33-year-old Major and the 47-year-old staff member from Northern Hesse died on Wednesday a week ago in West African Mali .	-4.6673
Their coffins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday they were brought to the Fritzlarer Dom Sankt Peter by a German army death guard .	-6.2065
At noon only the members of the church took leave .	-4.4260
After that , the ceremony began in the circle of the family , the closest friends , representatives of the Bundeswehr and the politicians .	-5.9625
Hessen ’ s prime minister , Volker Bouffier ( CDU ) , and the general inspector of the German Armed Forces , Volker Wieker , were .	-4.0517
The monks laid down roses , the relatives stood arm in arm at the coffins .	-6.0238
In front of the church , Fritzlarer and numerous soldiers pursued the ceremony on a canvas .	-3.7588
Secretary of Defense of the Leyen called the surrounding soldiers " highly decorated " and operational .	-4.9811
The crew of the team helped build the Tiger combat helicopter in Fritzlar and was one of the first six trained Tiger pilots of his regiment .	-7.0224
Volker Bauersachs , commander of the regiment to which the soldiers belong , also said : ' If this occupation could not avert the crash , then no one would have been able to . '	-6.3988
Doubts about the UN mission in Mali did not show Minister von der Leyen : the deployment was dangerous .	-3.7456
But he was also of great importance ' for a country from which we are separated only by two states ' , she said .	-3.7343
After the funeral the coffins were taken from the cathedral .	-2.9236
When and where they are buried , the Bundeswehr made no mention of this .	-4.1990
Prince Henrik does not want a grave next to his wife .	-1.8967
The man of the Danish Queen Margrete ( 77 ) , Prince Henrik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death .	-3.0350
The royal house announced this on Thursday .	-3.5709
Traditionally , the Danish king pair is buried in the Cathedral Church of Roskilde .	-3.1993
The sculptor Bj<unk>rn N<unk>rgaard already made a sarcophagus for the two .	-2.0454
The queen agreed with her husband ’ s decision , the statement continued .	-4.7603
Where Prince Henrik is buried is still unclear .	-2.4671
However , he does not intend to be buried in his French homeland .	-3.2786
Prince Henrik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .	-2.2409
After his wife Margrete ascended to the throne in 1972 , he would have liked to become king .	-3.7645
In 2016 , he retired , including the title " Prinzgemahl " .	-5.6258
As Henrik did not get the title and the function he wanted in Denmark , he did not see himself as equal to his wife - not even after death , explained Lene Balley , the chief speaker of the Danish royal house .	-6.7325
It is still unclear where the last resting place of the 83-year-old will be .	-4.4554
He does not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .	-3.0737
He likes the country he has worked for over the past 50 years .	-2.2103
Born Henri de Laborde de Monpezat , son of a French noble family , Margrete had met in London in 1965 .	-3.7646
He worked at the Thames in the French Embassy .	-2.3107
During his later wife 's sympathies with the people , Prince Henrik had a severe standing with the Danes in his almost 50-year reign .	-6.2859
In an autobiography Henrik said about the first years in Denmark : " A few months after my arrival everything I did was criticized .	-3.6028
My Danish was wavering , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk socks instead of knitting socks , Citro<unk>n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .	-2.7961
Even for the Gauloises , which I used to smoke instead of Virginia tobacco and which had the reputation of being the brand of socially critical intellectual , I could not hope for forbearance .	-6.2468
I was different .	-0.7298
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not to be ashamed .	-2.7971

Prime Minister Weil Wants for a Rapid Election	-3.4018
CDU and FDP before a possible majority in Lower Saxony	-1.8879
Lower Saxony ’ s Prime Minister , Stephan Weil ( SPD ) , is in favour of a rapid re-election of the country ’ s parliament after the loss of the red-green government majority , but he does not want to resign .	-5.6321
Because , on Friday , it was in favour of the dissolution of Parliament .	-3.8595
Previously , the surprise exit of a Green MEP from her Niedersachsen country party had plunged Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) ’ s government into a severe crisis .	-4.8282
Five months before the official date of the country ’ s election , the red-green coalition in Hanover lost its narrow one-majority in parliament to the opposition from the CDU and the FDP .	-4.7612
Elke Twotten , a former Green MEP , founded her move with the non-nomination for 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg ( Wümme ) .	-5.7598
" I see my political future in the CDU , " she explained on Friday in Hanover .	-2.2154
CDU leader Björn Thümler will recommend to his group that they be included .	-3.2137
Together , the CDU and the FDP would have 68 seats in the Lower Saxony parliament , the SPD , and the Green Group .	-9.1629
So far , the ratio has been the opposite .	-2.3435
The new Landtag will be elected on 14 January next year .	-4.6606
Thümler said that the red-green state government must now decide whether it can continue to govern without a majority in this situation .	-3.5246
Stephan Weil , however , considers it essential that the day of the land should decide on its own resolution as soon as possible .	-6.0212
The CDU Group is expected to decide on its next approach on Tuesday .	-3.1162
The constitution also provides for the possibility that the day of the land will deprive the Prime Minister of his confidence and elect a successor .	-5.5663
" Our Constitution offers several options .	-1.5885
These possibilities need to be properly examined in law , " said Thümler .	-4.9994
'It will be easy to discuss all the issues if they are legally considered . '	-6.1081
Thümler called Twesten 's step " but something curious " .	-4.5304
The politician herself emphasised : " I am not a traitor .	-2.3117
I feel very good ' .	-1.0553
She called herself a black green supporter .	-3.9958
The Greens called on the renegade Members to return their country 's mandate .	-4.1251
" Of course , we assume that she will immediately return her country ’ s mandate , which she has received via the green country list , " said the country ’ s leaders , Meta Janssen-Klucz and Stefan Körner .	-14.3503
The chairman of the Green Group , Anja Piel , said : ' We very much regret the decision of Elke Twvest ' .	-4.5929
She has deliberately chosen not to have a debate in the group .	-3.1917
'Even in the light of the lack of differences in content , we cannot understand this step ' .	-8.3431
SPD chancellor Martin Schulz condemns the transfer of the Lower Saxony Green MEP Elke Tvest to the CDU as a betrayal .	-4.5161
" The behaviour of the former Green MEPs in Lower Saxony is not only betrayal of the electorate , but also betrayal of the Red Green , " wrote the Federal Head of the Social Democrats on Friday on Facebook .	-5.4195
He supports Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) 's decision to have the country 's day re-elected quickly .	-3.9402
The exit of Twenties costs the majority of the Red Green in Lower Saxony .	-5.9330
" In her wounded vanity and in her frustration , the politician puts her personal interests before the welfare of the country , " SPD Secretary General Hubertus Heil criticized .	-4.7409
" It is scandalous that the CDU in Lower Saxony is taking part in this dirty play of intrigue and is trying to make political capital out of it " .	-4.3350
Niedersachsen ’ s CDU group leader , Björn Thümler , will recommend to his fellow Member that Elke Twesten be included in the CDU .	-4.6098
The SPD ’ s leader in the Bundestag , Thomas Oppermann , accused Twesten of falsifying the results of the 2013 election with personal career thinking .	-6.0593
The CDU was the strongest force before the SPD , but the SPD and Greens had a very thin majority of one vote in the parliament .	-5.1441
Minister of Agriculture in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from poisonous eggs , Mr Schmidt ?	-2.9150
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs .	-1.2105
How could the scandal happen ?	-1.9678
How can consumers protect themselves .	-1.0937
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CSU ) is interviewed with the editorial network Germany ( RND ) .	-3.6868
Mr Schmidt , how can the consumer protect himself from poisoned eggs ?	-1.8844
I can only encourage all consumers to look closely at the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp print .	-3.6870
On the consumer protection portal www.Food Warnung.de the federal states provide the latest information on the respective egg charges .	-6.4487
Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .	-1.1118
Even if , according to everything we know at the moment , health risks are virtually excluded .	-4.5143
Is Aldi now getting the best possible crisis response - all the eggs out of the supply - because the Federal Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development is not really playing the central role of the reconnaissance ?	-6.1930
Food monitoring is the responsibility of the federal states .	-3.2817
Nevertheless , my House has immediately opened up and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since Germany became aware of its concerns .	-7.1221
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers .	-2.2209
Trade , like manufacturers , must ensure that the products sold are transportable and safe in health .	-4.4097
If the maximum residue content of 0.005mg / kg is exceeded for eggs , these are not transportable .	-4.1153
Unloaded eggs can be sold and eaten .	-3.0294
This time , businesses are not to blame .	-2.5566
Are manufacturing companies and consumers sitting in the same boat ?	-3.0068
As we know , the production companies are not directly responsible .	-4.7531
On the contrary , they have to face economic damage due to alleged illegal practices by service companies .	-4.7767
As always , there are too few inspectors in the event of an emergency .	-3.5275
Is it just a lack of staff or a coherent competence ?	-4.1420
It was the official controls that revealed the process .	-3.5750
The truth , however , is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out 100 % .	-3.4821
It is precisely for this reason that it is essential to provide consistent information on such events and to hand them over to the public prosecutors in cases where criminal offences can be committed .	-7.7909
I have already made it clear on several occasions that I expect the responsible authorities to provide a complete explanation .	-4.3209
Is there really a need for regular alarm in food scandals ?	-3.9768
Consumers have the right to obtain only safe and transportable food .	-3.1433
If an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly outraged .	-3.0309
The wrong means have put manufacturers , traders and consumers in a situation that is absolutely unnecessary .	-5.3043
In principle , it must be clear that the illegal use of the insecticide fipronil in the attitude of food-producing animals is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately .	-5.4489
This must be done consistently and with great pressure at all levels .	-3.3997
I expect all the competent authorities to clarify the situation quickly and fully .	-4.0064
How the financial rules of football affect Neymar ’ s move to Paris .	-3.2667
The rules aimed at preventing unimpeded spending by European football clubs will not disrupt Neymar ’ s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to French Paris-Saint Germain .	-3.9458
Any consequences will come for Paris Saint-Germain of UEFA , because the governing organization that oversaw the European game has the power to ban teams from accessing the prestigious Champions League tournament .	-5.5110
Financial fair play rules created by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will eventually have to prove that the transfer of Neymar was financed without large losses .	-4.8501
Barcelona has paid € 222 million ( $ 262 million ) to get the Brazilian out of its contract , and Neymar will receive a salary of several $ 10 million per year .	-4.0197
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar 's move to France .	-1.3151
PSG can certainly ease the money so that Neymar signs up and takes him into a galaxy of other stars , given the funding of the team through the energy rich ruler family of Qatar .	-6.1813
Clubs may spend a lot of money on acquiring players , but they must deal with legitimate sources of revenue that allow them to break through their football related business .	-6.4920
FFP was conceived by Michel Platini as UEFA President in 2007 .	-3.1175
The former French player believed that clubs that had incurred enormous debt in their pursuit of success effectively cheated and risked ruining themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support .	-5.0759
In 2011 , FFP shifted from focusing on club debt to monitoring its losses .	-2.4700
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich used in Chelsea in 2003 – bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand – should become a harder business .	-4.8499
During the current three-year FFP preselection period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses of € 30 million .	-4.6222
And , although Platini fell into disfavor by the 2015 presidency , his UEFA successor , Aleksander Ceferin , continues to push for excessive spending .	-5.4074
" Certainly FFP is not dead and we will certainly strengthen the rules for the future , " said Andrea Traverso , who is responsible for FFP at UEFA , to The Associated Press last week .	-3.7115
Although the PSG has paid Neymar ’ s buy-out clause in a lump sum , it can distribute the amount for the billing over the duration of its contract .	-4.7828
Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the release amount for the next five years can be reported in the annual accounts of EUR 44.4 million .	-5.1982
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 hit the PSG , along with Abu Dhabi , which owns Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions .	-3.5120
The PSG received a fine of € 60 million ( at the time $ 82 million ) , which was later reduced to € 20 million - and it was ordered that the team members for the 2014 / 15 Champions League remain limited to 21 players instead of the normal 25 players .	-5.3787
UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outperform their financial supervision by inflating their revenue from companies associated with a club ’ s owners .	-5.8884
While a kataric company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsorship were to exceed the standard market rates , UEFA would not allow this to be considered a legitimate income .	-4.9476
This was precisely what happened in 2014 , when UEFA decided that the value of PSA sponsorship was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .	-2.5493
It has been reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come on payments from the World Cup 2022 Organizing Committee in Qatar .	-4.3675
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar will become World Cup ambassadors , and that such a maneuver for UEFA regulators could simply be found out .	-4.9290
The previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules .	-3.4152
UEFA did not have preparatory talks with PSG on Neymar 's transfer , said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .	-3.9134
They spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation .	-3.7118
The latest published reports show that PSG reached a profit of more than € 10 million in 2015 / 16 with sales of € 542.4 million .	-4.7467
The accounts for the last fiscal year still need to be published .	-2.5226
PSG expects that Neymar 's arrival is a blessing for sponsorship deals , merchandising and jersey sales .	-2.6637
The association assumes that sales will increase by at least 30 percent after signing .	-3.4337
The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players go , and it tried to prevent Neymar 's move by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP .	-3.7494
" It is a clear case of " financial doping " with the club and the state , " said the president of La Liga , Javier Tebas , the Spanish daily AS with regard to Qatar 's eventual ownership of PSG .	-3.4471
Arsenal Manager Arsene Wenger , whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon , shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that finances a club .	-3.9272
" It is the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football over the last 15 years , " said Wenger on Thursday .	-3.3441
" Once a country has an association , everything is possible .	-2.4229
It will be very difficult to respect financial fair play , because you can go different ways or have different interests if a country has such a large player to represent a country . '	-5.0731
Swiss is in search of a new Schoggilieferant	-5.1708
In recent years , Chocolat Frey has produced on-board chocolate for Swiss .	-2.6859
Now the sweet collaboration is about to come to an end : the airline rewrites the order .	-5.7562
Swiss-Specher Meike Fuhlrott confirmed a corresponding report from Friday 's newspaper " Northwest Switzerland " on request from the news agency sda .	-5.0871
According to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .	-3.1430
The products would be reviewed every two to three years and subjected to quality control .	-3.2897
" We are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolat Frey , " said the speaker .	-2.6648
Some 17 million small , red-white , Schoggitafens of 14 grams per year distribute the cabin crew to the passengers before landing .	-7.8207
Swiss did not want to provide any information about the costs .	-3.3590
Industry insiders estimate the order volume according to " Northwest Switzerland " to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss Francs - the Migros subsidiary generates annual sales of around one billion Swiss Francs .	-5.3114
But more important is the advertising effect : for a chocolate maker it is a prestigious order .	-4.5196
The Swiss does not want to betray how many applicants there are in the new tender .	-3.7567
Only Swiss manufacturers are eligible .	-2.7392
According to the newspaper report , Chocolat Frey wants to renew the treaty beyond spring 2018 .	-3.5557
For sda , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion .	-3.3210
Since 2006 , Swiss chocolate boxes have been distributed on board their flights .	-3.6836
Before the Swiss entered into a contract with the Migros subsidiary , Barry Callebaut had delivered the chocolate trays in cooperation with Hug .	-4.3480
Swiss introduced the possibility to place the logo two and a half years ago with the launch of cooperation with Chocolat Frey .	-3.1714
The airline works with various Swiss chocolate producers .	-2.4025
On long-haul flights , First Class customers will be spoiled with treats from the Confiserie Sprüngli , in Business Class Dutch passengers Schoggi from Lindt and in Economy Class Schoggi from Chocolat Frey .	-5.4313
Swiss Schoggi from Chocolat Frey also distributes on the short-haul route , both in business and in economy class .	-5.6940
Athletics - Discuss Olympic champion Robert Harting achieves World Cup finals	-5.1186
The three World Champion fights for a medal in the final on Saturday .	-4.2824
His brother Christoph , the Olympic champion of 2016 , had failed in the national World Cup finals and could only look at the disco competition from the grandstand .	-6.9490
Also with the first attempt the Polish title defender Piotr Malachowski , who threw 65.13 meters wide , qualified for the final fight .	-4.8629
Nostalgia enters the niche in " Wet Hot American Summer " and " Comrade Detective " .	-2.9328
This repetition of the story is nostalgic at the same time because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80s , for the 90-ies Grunge era ( when the thinkers David Wain and Michael Showalter turned the Sketch comedy " The State " for MTV ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , such as Elizabeth Banks , Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd , went to bigger things .	-5.8316
As a cultural artefact , it is both a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook capable era of permanent memories .	-3.2671
But as a franchise it feels like time is running out .	-2.0275
" First Day of Camp " worked surprisingly well , not only because of its absurd humor ( it contained an original story for a talking dose of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .	-3.8638
By focusing on the core of the gag - middle-aged actors play horny children who grow up - they nevertheless managed to regain the last part of the joke .	-6.0574
" Ten Years Later " , with its adults now playing adults , is less emotionally ingrained and its parody goes more by the casting cannon principle , including a riff on the Stalker films of the 90s like " The Hand That Rocks the Cradle " ( " The Hand that the Wiege swings " ) .	-7.3209
At one point a character crawls through an Apple Powerbook , some inline skates and " a number of other things from 1991 " .	-3.4746
Many of the central stories are the same .	-0.9210
The loving Coop ( Mr. Showalter ) , now novelist , has still not forgotten Katie ( Marguerite Moreau ) .	-3.0518
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost his virginity .	-1.4328
And there is another crazy plot involving Ronald Reagan ( including Mr. Showalter ) , now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good impression of Michael Ian Black ) .	-4.5229
As always , the excursions are the best part of the franchise .	-1.7182
It is especially fun to see Mr. Rudd , who is always young , showing Matt Dillon 's beard of " Singles " , whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy feels like an old cracker .	-6.5868
These are the moments of random madness that could fuel this franchise like a kind of repetitive " Seven Up ! " series until it reaches what I believe to be his logical conclusion : " Wet Hot American Summer : Twenty Years Later " , the last scene of which will show the band how to visit the film premiere of " Wet Hot American Summer " .	-6.0422
" Comrade Detective " on Amazon is now reminiscent of a different kind of nostalgia : the revival of the Cold War of " The Americans " , the film " Atomic Blonde " and even " GLOW " with its East versus West wrestling iconography .	-4.2049
The comedy , created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka , with Rhys Thomas as a director indicates to be a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two policemen as friends , two officers from Bucharest fighting for truth , atheism and the path of Marxism Leninism .	-4.7189
The main characters - a hard-fisted Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici , whose dialogs are synchronized in English by Channing Tatum ( also an executive producer ) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt .	-4.2426
It is a brilliant idea .	-1.1739
But it is not much more than an idea .	-1.5392
There are some nice gags for prestige ( the police spend time watching chess on television , as Americans may do with football ) .	-4.3803
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate , Nick Offerman , Mahershala Ali and Chlo<unk> Sevigny - ensures a decent game ' Find the Voice out ' .	-3.0204
But " Comrade Detective " is so committed to the veracity of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like a single .	-3.3732
In six long episodes , the comedy is not fast or frequent enough .	-3.9731
" Comrade Detective " , edited to a lesser length , could better deliver his Agitprop style , as Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the American Embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men devouring a bunch of hamburgers .	-6.5821
The message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can do everything to feed a gelage .	-4.2016
The fictitious Romanian creators were not wrong : we do it even with our own recent history and with theirs .	-3.0630

15 defendants were arrested between the ages of 25 and 77 , and arrest warrants were issued against them .	-5.2052
In addition , officials provided greater quantities of marijuana and cocaine , firearms and several hundred thousand euros .	-3.9469
Two people were arrested in simultaneous raids in Italy .	-2.1996
German arrest warrants were issued against the two Italian suspects .	-2.7516
The two will therefore probably be shipped to Germany .	-3.5262
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action .	-2.2097
In total , more than 300 police officers were in operation .	-3.7650
The members of the mafia are accused of organised drug-related crime , serious violence , attempted murder and robbery and extortion .	-4.3225
Since summer 2016 , the State Prosecutor Konstanz has been investigating organized drug trafficking in southern Germany .	-3.7728
There was a lively exchange between the public prosecutors in Konstanz and Palermo , and the investigators of the Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .	-4.0234
That is why the large-scale deployment on Wednesday morning was accompanied by four officials from Palermo .	-4.2096
The investigation focused mainly on Italian nationals closely related to the Italian mafia .	-4.1339
Also an incident on May 27 in Hüfingen , where several shots were fired into a restaurant early in the morning , is likely to go to the band 's account .	-5.5880
How Great Gaps in the Foreign Register	-4.5139
" Data from citizens who should not appear " : According to a report , the foreigner register in Germany has serious shortcomings .	-5.6919
This leads to sometimes serious misdecisions on asylum procedures .	-3.6492
According to a media report , the Federal Government ’ s refugee management officer , Frank-Jürgen Weise , has drawn attention to large gaps in the central register of foreigners .	-5.5747
Deficiencies in the data recorded there could lead to ' sometimes serious mistakes ' in asylum procedures and expulsions , warned in an analysis presented by the ' Süddeutsche Zeitung ' .	-6.2441
According to data , the register covers ten million people with foreign nationality , including some 5.7 million from non-EU countries .	-4.7868
The data are thus managed by about 600 foreign authorities in Germany .	-4.0383
Because the data had not been properly maintained , some data quality has not been good .	-5.1960
In individual cases , data from 1921 had been found , ' by people who have long since ceased to live , or by citizens who have become German citizens and should not appear in the register ' .	-5.7358
" Error data input can significantly slow return processes , " the report goes on .	-4.5420
Moreover , EU citizens are included in the statistics on expatriates who do not have to leave at all .	-5.4395
Such false allocations , however , " led to a distorted debate on the handling of expatriates , " the analysis says .	-7.5439
Meanwhile , the Federal Government seems to have begun sending refugee families back to Italy with children under 16 when they arrived from there .	-5.1392
This is the result of an internal paper by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees ( BAMF ) , reports the " Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung " .	-4.2866
The paper thus states that the BAMF has been carrying out such procedures ' with regard to families with children - with the exception of infants and infants - in Italy since 1 June 2017 ' .	-5.9199
It has been virtually impossible since the end of 2014 , according to the newspaper , to refer to the difficult situation on the ground .	-4.2345
Under the Dublin Agreement , refugees are the EU state that they first reach .	-4.4394
When a migrant travels to another EU country , that state can send him back to the country of entry .	-3.5924
For the reasons , the office now writes : ' In the meantime , the capacity for families with underage children has increased substantially in Italy ' .	-7.1447
Italy has provided guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families .	-2.7108
Even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECHR ) considers these commitments to be sufficient .	-2.4693
Other EU states would also send refugees back there under the Dublin Agreement .	-3.0508
Ulla Jelpke , spokeswoman for the left-wing party in the Bundestag , criticised this decision : " Families with children are threatened with illegal admission conditions and a threat to the welfare of children because of the shortcomings of the Italian asylum system .	-8.4702
Second result	-6.1161
The blood donation service has already provided 220 litres of blood from people living in Oberreichenbach .	-3.6128
At least of the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .	-3.4849
First of all Jürgen Greule , who with his 100 donations now shared 50 litres of blood .	-5.1059
Traditionally , the community pays tribute to the multiple willingness to donate blood at the Council meeting .	-5.6567
" It 's great how our body is designed to do this , and we pay tribute to the donors , who make their blood available to foreigners , unselfish , " said Mayor Karlheinz Kistner .	-7.2010
" A single blood donation helps several people , " explained Holger Mainbacher , the District Manager of the German Red Cross ( DRK ) , because the canned are broken into their components .	-6.5787
For example , three people could benefit from a blood donation .	-3.3401
At the same time , Maisenbacher reported about the actions that will take place in Oberreichenbach in the spring .	-3.7231
" This year we achieved the second best result with 114 donors , " said DRK District Manager .	-3.7448
Obviously , a few years ago , the change to the Theatre House led to higher numbers of participants .	-6.1420
Even before , Thomas Bockstadt , Susanne Reichle , Sandra Schöck , Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiple donors and were awarded 50 blood donations each .	-4.5303
Half as many Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger , while Tamara Pfrommer , Petra Schleeh , Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter spent ten times each 500 millilitres of their life juice .	-5.4197
The Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25 %	-1.2196
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and weakening inflation have dampened speculation about an increase .	-3.8609
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain " sluggish " by maintaining interest rates on family incomes in the midst of increasing pressure .	-3.8594
The Bank ’ s Monetary Committee ( MPC ) ’ s policymakers voted 6-to-2 to keep interest rates to 0.25 % , with fewer members pushing for an increase this month , as weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase .	-4.8373
In its quarterly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts to 1.7 % in 2017 and 1.6 % in 2018 , warning that pressure on household incomes would continue , with inflation expected to rise to just under 3 % in the autumn .	-4.0727
But it signaled that interest-rate hikes would be needed in the next few years to rein in Brexit ’ s fueled inflation , saying that borrowing costs may have to rise more than expected in financial markets .	-4.0680
Members also voted to withdraw part of the Mammut stimulus package issued a year ago after Brexit .	-2.9640
It will call for time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funding for banks from next February , even though it has been said that it is now expected to provide GBP 15 billion more under this system - with GBP 115 billion sterling .	-8.4520
Minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : " In the MPC 's central forecast , GDP remains weak in the short term , as pressure on households ' real incomes continues to put a strain on consumption . "	-7.3011
At interest rates , she repeated that " some monetary tightening " would be needed to cool inflation and a " slightly larger " extent than the markets expect .	-5.0306
The markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .	-2.8057
However , the Bank stressed that increases would be " gradual " and " limited " .	-2.6138
The Bank ’ s down-adjusted growth forecasts for this year and next are relative to the 1.9 % and 1.7 % forecast in May .	-4.1874
It has kept its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .	-2.3305
The pound fell against the dollar and the euro after these news .	-2.5303
The pound fell by 0.5 % to $ 1.31 and fell by 0.4 % to € 1.11 .	-2.3278
The decision will not change after the recent disappointing growth figures have dampened rising expectations of an interest-rate hike , and GDP has risen from 0.2 % in the second quarter in the previous three months to 0.3 % .	-5.0343
Growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will recover slightly after the bank by the end of the year .	-3.6798
The recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and low salary increases , as tightening becomes worse before it gets better .	-5.3765
She added that monetary policy cannot ' prevent ' the drop in income in the next few years , but she added that wages will ' recover significantly ' at the end of her three-year forecast .	-4.4414
The economy is also strengthened by rising demand for British goods , owing to the weak pound , which will compensate for part of lower consumer spending .	-3.9629
The decision comes one year after the fall in interest rates to 0.25 % last August , following the shocking EU vote that caused the pound to fall .	-3.6249
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years for this to fully reach prices and the economy .	-3.6180
Before the Bank ’ s last verdict on interest rates , the call for an interest-rate hike had increased , as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households , with three policymakers demanding an increase of 0.5 % in July .	-4.8106
Inflation fell from 2.9 % last month in June to 2.6 % , even though the Bank said that it was expected to do so and that it will pull it back in the coming months .	-5.2469
The bank said that the excess relative to its 2 % target was ' entirely ' to the weak pound .	-4.4179
Andrew Montlake , director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers , said : " Given the recent decline in swap rates , the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive , as lenders are clamoring for business and want to end the year in a positive way .	-5.1956
The market looks particularly good for those who end existing deals and close new mortgages , and many with free options and low rates are becoming more popular . '	-5.5598
NHS ( The National Health Service ) is a controversial HIV drug that prescribes 10,000 people .	-7.2652
Patients will have access to " transformative " HIV prevention treatment from September , following a fight before the High Court against funding the drug in the NHS .	-4.9998
NHS England announced that pre-sexual preexposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 % , will now be delivered by the health service on a first three-year study for an estimated 10,000 people .	-5.6550
He agreed to finance the trial after the Court of Appeal confirmed a Supreme Court ruling last year that the NHS had the power to pay for the PrEP despite the claim that local authorities should finance it .	-4.4010
The move announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England boss Simon Stevens as an " important new intervention " , while the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) called this a " decisive moment " .	-5.1978
Sexual health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool , and Sheffield will be among the first to enable people to register , and more clinics will follow in October before it is introduced throughout England in April 2018 .	-3.4792
Preexposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .	-3.6418
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in cases of infection .	-2.7115
Taking PrEP before sexual intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in a person 's body to prevent an HIV infection .	-3.4266
Such medications can be taken every day or two hours before sexual intercourse .	-3.5965
Those eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men , transsexuals and people with HIV positive partners who have not been treated successfully .	-2.9295
Clinics identify suitable participants who agree with the study , including men , women , transgenders , and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment .	-3.6841
People who live in England and are registered with a family doctor may also register for participation in their local participating sex clinic .	-3.9323
The program will be $ 10 million and NHS England signed a contract to deliver drugs this week after an international competitive procurement .	-4.5944
The study aims to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence , as it is specifically used , recorded and implemented on a large scale .	-5.4837
Stevens said : " This major new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .	-3.0312
It is another milestone in the more than three decades of sustained progress in tackling one of humanity 's greatest health challenges . "	-4.2350
Deborah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National Aids Trust ) , said : " This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .	-2.4094
PrEP , targeted at vulnerable and vulnerable people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic .	-3.7020
From September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded experiment in England to develop a new instrument that is genuinely individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner , which will improve many , many lives .	-5.2641
We warmly welcome this announcement . '	-2.0867
Ian Green , chairman of the Terrence Higgins Trust , said : " The priority must now be to carry out the study quickly throughout the country and to leave no one who has a risk to HIV behind .	-4.7612
Now that PrEP medicine has been procured , we are on the right track to protect more than 10,000 people infected with HIV . '	-4.0276
Sharon Hodgson , shadow health minister , said : " The beginning of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and delay by the government .	-3.4851
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection .	-3.2168
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of PrEP .	-2.6484
It is now important that this study be carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people infected with HIV , and that it will help us to move closer to ending the spread of HIV in society ' .	-5.0994
Living Big Life : Upstairs and clever designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a generous home .	-4.1186
Joanne Leigh , a former banker with a passion for real estate , fell from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014 .	-2.8344
It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags .	-3.1159
" Before that I lived with my Ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room , " says Joanne .	-1.9474
" I was looking for something comparable to my price .	-2.3635
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and she had the same high ceilings .	-2.0034
I fell in love with them and made an offer on that day . '	-2.5398
Since the first visit , the 1.000 square feet apartment has been completely overtaken .	-4.4977
Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to make the most of the spacious ceiling .	-4.9252
" I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .	-1.4941
That was my request , ' she says .	-2.0307
To this end , they commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne .	-4.4273
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other , so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine where one could stand .	-3.7031
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the target .	-2.3009
" The steel mill is rather complicated , " he explains .	-2.4346
" We had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked on top of each other without us having to lose ourselves .	-4.7852
It was not just a question of building a simple platform , but of putting the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function at the top or bottom . ' . , , and , , , , , , , , ,	-8.0400
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms on top of each other at full height - with much more drama .	-4.2420
For the mezzanine , a classic copper light window from Retrovius looks down over the glamorous living area .	-4.2401
Played gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program .	-2.7774
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .	-2.1105
At both ends a small corridor is mirrored to make it work longer .	-4.1422
In the kitchen , the reflection feels like a window in another room .	-2.6245
At the entrance , mirrored units provide space for all Joanne cutlery and glasses .	-4.5132
By perceiving a more glamorous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .	-3.0431
Collapsible kitchens are nothing new .	-4.9287
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door .	-2.9099
" A little bit of engineering came in , " explains Erfan from the steel reinforced veneer MDF door .	-4.4030
'It is weighty , so when you push the door up it glides very easily ' .	-5.0392
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Joanne could gain an additional 16 m <unk> , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .	-5.7806
" At the end of the day you will sell the ground floor - or how your property is valued , " says Erfan .	-3.6672
" In a rudimentary form , a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on ground size . "	-3.8673
Here they have managed to enlarge the floor and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage .	-6.0179
" The materials are the things you touch and therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home , " says Erfan .	-3.5061
" You don 't fall in love with the electrical sockets in the walls .	-2.7115
These are important , but they do not play with your heart . '	-2.1668
It shows that an apartment can be transformed into something quite amazing by a good design and an increased number of square meters of something standard .	-5.0980
Indeed , like Joanne , you could decide not to leave them .	-2.2778
Brothers Fight for US $ 500 million in housing empire	-6.3793
Two brothers , four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty , are in a dispute over one of Victoria ’ s largest property empires worth more than $ 500 million .	-4.5137
Former director of the ' Carlton Football Club ' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak , just three doors away from his younger brother Paul , who brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets should be shared .	-4.4381
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp division debate is taking place in the Supreme Court .	-4.7656
Together with her mother Anna , the brothers own 38 homes worth more than half a billion dollars since the family bought a shop at Smith Street , Collingwood in 1973 .	-3.6529
The Westco Jeans family founded there and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores .	-3.1601
It was sold in 1999 for $ 85 million .	-2.0260
This money has been invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lutis now comprises offices in the city centre , the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller and shopping centres in the suburbs .	-4.2351
According to an agreement with her deceased father , Colin - described by Paul as " the main operator and the dominant personality " in the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of the company 's assets and Paul has about a third .	-7.6484
A court record states that this means that Colin owns $ 316 million worth of property and Paul worth $ 176 million .	-3.3328
The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .	-3.0993
" The divisions proposed by Colin left him with what I thought to be the best objects , " he wrote in a first Affidavit in 2015 .	-3.2404
Last Friday , after several failed mediation , the first Supreme Court hearing took place .	-2.9779
The brothers are now also fighting for control of the existing business , from which Colin , as Paul claims , ruled out .	-5.4637
Colin argues that this is not true , but accuses Paul of administering some possessions incompetently .	-2.9472
In an early Affidavit submitted by Colin , he says he hopes to settle the dispute .	-2.7230
" My Italian heritage prescribes that the family is the most important priority , " he wrote .	-2.9771
Costs rise in this case , with hundreds of pages of affidavits , emails , and reports from companies , including Deloitte , Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer , and leading lawyers , including Allan Myers , QC , and law firms held by both sides .	-4.7852
Mrs De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran milk bars and delicatessen shops from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970s .	-3.5623
They took advantage of the security to buy the Collingwood property , in which Colin opened the family 's first jeans ' land .	-4.9238
Colin says that he started Westco there when he was " high school in my last years when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . "	-3.8850
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to hand over their property to their sons .	-2.7640
" Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , " she wrote .	-2.2548
Two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lutis group , with Colin claiming that Mark was paid $ 10 million on leaving the company and Luke $ 26 million .	-3.4387
Both Lukas and Mark , Paul says , have become bitter about the conditions of their financial separation .	-3.7385
Colin was very reticent , although he was a former member of the AFL Board of Directors and , following a 2015 biography by Eddie McGuire , was the best friend of the TV star .	-5.7174
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers .	-1.6787
Only Colin replied by SMS to say " I really can 't say much " because the case is before the courts .	-3.5647
" It is very , very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and pull our family name through the courts , " he wrote .	-3.0344
In mid-2016 , Colin wrote to the court that he tried to fulfill his brother ’ s demands .	-2.6662
" Our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end our current dispute , " he said , adding that he " still hope for a solution " .	-3.4326
On Friday , that hope seemed to be over .	-2.6967
" Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future , " Colin wrote .	-2.4183
Trump ’ s new chief of staff plans to reduce the president ’ s media abstinence .	-2.1862
Others tried it and failed .	-3.5379
Perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do so .	-2.2955
If so , he will be the first .	-1.4068
Politico reports that the new White House Chief of Staff is planning to limit the flow of information to President Trump , including news media reports , in the hope of keeping the chief on a more consistent course .	-4.0803
Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey :	-1.1162
" When John F. Kelly , the White House ’ s new chief of staff , met with senior officials on his first day of work , he was a major problem in President Donald Trump ’ s White House , which he wanted to repair : bad information that comes into the president ’ s hands .	-6.9171
Kelly told staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he received good information . '	-4.2142
Kelley ’ s diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet .	-1.6265
President Trump ’ s relationship with television goes back decades – and now that he is in the White House , his television advertisement is still strong .	-4.8365
" When candidate Trump was annoyed for unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting from officials to be convinced , " said former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg to Politico in February .	-5.6795
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that " the key to keeping Trump ’ s Twitter habit under control is , according to six former campaign officials , to ensure that his personal media consumption contains a steady praise . "	-7.1660
Okay .	-0.6214
But the idea that Trump ’ s Twitter habit has ever been “ under control ” is ridiculous .	-2.0667
Perhaps these campaign officials know something we do not know to others - that Trump ’ s tweets would have contained even more fuel without their interventions .	-4.8798
We will probably never hear about the tweets that Trump has not sent .	-3.0502
If his employees have managed to keep him out of trouble several times , their efforts have been worthwhile .	-5.1718
But no one has consistently prevented Trump from causing controversy .	-2.4153
Part of the problem is that in a White House composed of competing parties , people keep trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump with material that may promote their views of the world .	-4.5738
Politico - very busy with this story - reported in May about the consultants ' preference to provide the president with dubious information for strategic reasons .	-5.9266
This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher :	-1.4025
" Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can respond like a volcano to negative press clippings , especially those with damaging leaks , and that he is committed to finding out where they come from .	-4.3732
That is exactly what happened at the end of February , when someone gave the president a maliciously printed copy of an article by GotNews.com , the website of Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh of being " the source behind a bunch of leaks " in the White House .	-5.4062
Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for harassment , or that he offered no concrete evidence , or that in the past he made false accusations and revoked them .	-5.5652
Trump read the article and began asking staff about Walsh . "	-2.8883
Goldmacher added that then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Secretary General , Rob Porter , “ tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork Trump receives . ”	-3.1797
How did this work ?	-1.6018
Kelly tries to do the same three months later .	-1.7299
Perhaps he will prove himself a more effective Priebus Manager , but Trump is still his impulsive self , and his advisers are still seeking influence .	-3.4848
These unchanging factors make Kelley ’ s mission very difficult .	-4.2803
Most wanted criminals are sent by Europol	-4.0974
Since the address is unknown , the help of the population is asked and hoped for .	-4.1586
Police across Europe this summer send ( virtual ) postcards to dangerous criminals on the run .	-4.0349
Since the addresses of the sought after serious criminals are by nature unknown , information from the population is hoped and asked .	-6.6209
On Friday , Europol reported on the action following the Winter EU Most Wanted calendar .	-5.2848
Experience would have shown that many people are hiding in holiday destinations , as Europol said .	-5.0798
21 postcards were put together for wanted criminals from 21 EU countries .	-3.6944
Since 2016 , the website www.eumostwanged has been available , more than 2.5 million times it has been viewed .	-5.7825
36 of the online applicants have been arrested so far , at least 11 of them on the basis of information after publication on the website .	-6.4799
Travellers negotiate a ditch and return to the ' Millionaires ' series .	-3.2374
Some of the wealthiest homeowners of the West Midlands are once again at war with some determined travelers who negotiated a ditch drawn by the community to reclaim a field in front of their mansions .	-5.5567
The travelers parked their 20 caravans on a field outside a prosperous street of Solihull , which is called the " Millionärs series " .	-4.8118
They brought horses , babies and an army of transporters , after they were thrown out in May , but without being deterred by a ditch excavated by the Council in order to prevent their incursions .	-4.9674
The tactile group found a gap in defense systems and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unhindered to find a way .	-4.1352
Angry residents have harassed the advice of Solihull , who said that it is ' useless to deal with the problem ' .	-5.9387
An anonymous resident said : " They went there on Monday evening after they were sent by Bentley Heath , where they threw stones on the passers-by .	-5.0888
The Council must be put into practice by shame because it was useless in dealing with the problem .	-4.2529
The passengers were there in May , moved forward and are now back .	-3.0994
More happened last night , probably more today . '	-3.7621
She added : " The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by keeping long instructions to protect its parks .	-3.7598
I live on Streetbrook Road and I am not happy to continue to pay my community tax if the Council cannot even stop it . '	-3.2492
A resident who did not want to be called said : " It is ridiculous , we have just seen the last round of those travellers just to be plundered by another round .	-4.4539
The numbers have increased this time , and we have even seen a horse in the parking area . '	-4.1256
A speaker from the Council of Solihull said : " We are aware of an unauthorised camp on the land beyond Streetbrook Road and are working with the police at Solihell .	-7.4981
To support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible report anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101 .	-2.9671
This will help to create a picture of the situation in which the Court must examine when we present our case . '	-4.7405
Birkenhof Become Waldhotel Luise	-2.0760
The former Hotel Birkenhof becomes the Waldhotel Luise .	-2.4567
The house at the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and is due to be reopened on 1 March next year .	-3.8314
That is good news for the city .	-1.7030
After all , with the closure of Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014 , around 30 000 nights per year were lost and also income from the tourist tax .	-6.1865
In the autumn of 2014 , with dramatically rising numbers of refugees entering the county , the hotel building was offered to the County Council Office as a collective accommodation , causing controversy .	-7.9041
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by drawing up a plan to secure the area as a hotel location .	-4.7364
The decision was not uncontroversial in the municipal council .	-3.7910
However , Freudenstadt ’ s Lord Mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and spoke of serious interested parties at the time .	-6.3989
He should be right .	-0.8409
The Luisenhotels Group , based in Bad Bergzabern , has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three-star plus category called Waldhotel Luise .	-5.7718
The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object .	-1.7993
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb .	-1.9722
They are called Hotel Luise , Luisenpark , Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise .	-1.2712
At the former Hotel Birkenhof building waste containers have been standing in front of the entrance for a long time , and when you enter the house , it becomes clear what extensive renovation work is being carried out .	-6.3565
The floors were torn out , ceilings were partially dismantled , old bathtubs were removed from the rooms .	-4.8783
The entire hotel building is a single building .	-2.4251
There is still much to do by March .	-2.2990
" It is actually a nice hotel , " says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper .	-3.3217
Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style .	-2.5723
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers , the entrance area is redesigned and new windows are installed .	-3.7566
Everything should later become " beautiful citizen " , as Thomas Scherer puts it .	-4.5208
'We want to make a jewel on it ' .	-3.3279
Swimming pool , spa area and meeting room are also available .	-4.2808
You don 't want to position yourself at the high level of hotels in Lauterbad , but already at an upscale downtown level , Scherer emphasizes .	-6.0146
The Waldhotel Luise , with its 60 rooms , aims to expand , further explains Scherer .	-4.8501
Both individual tourists , groups or businessmen should feel at home at the hotel .	-4.9069
He has had talks with OB Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause , according to Scherer .	-3.4521
The city 's ideas are identical to those of the hotel group .	-5.2835
'We are on the same line ' .	-1.7512
When it comes to the level of investment , Thomas Scherer does not want to set out exactly .	-4.9109
Less than a million euros , he expects .	-3.4226
The exterior installations are also brought to the fore , which is already clearly visible .	-5.4509
A large terrace is created in a courtyard , which will be open to the public from the restaurant .	-6.0154
Thomas Scherer is optimistic : " Freudenstadt is a good market " .	-1.2389
Russia Affair : US Special Counsel Invoices Grand Jury	-4.3117
In the Russia affair of US President Donald Trump , Special Counsel Robert Mueller is said to have set up a so-called Grand Jury after a report .	-4.3744
The panel has started work in recent weeks , wrote the Wall Street Journal , citing people familiar with the matter .	-5.1073
The newspaper read the step as a sign that Mueller has expanded and intensified his investigation .	-4.0815
The CNN broadcaster reported that there are already first charges of the body in connection with a meeting between Trump ’ s oldest son and a Russian lawyer .	-3.8642
US intelligence agencies have long accused the Kremlin of intervening purposefully in the 2016 presidential campaign .	-2.9939
Mueller is investigating whether there was agreement between Trump ’ s campaign and Moscow .	-2.8498
The investigation will focus on several men who campaigned as Republican advisors .	-4.6437
According to reports , Mueller also looked at Trump ’ s private and business environment more and more .	-5.5482
The " Washington Post " wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Investigator has brought Trump to the center in person and investigate whether the president may have obstructed the judiciary in the course of the affair .	-7.0642
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine the evidence available in possible criminal cases and to decide whether charges should be brought .	-5.9612
Grand Jurys are therefore also called indictments .	-2.8741
In most cases , they are switched on when there are major and controversial cases .	-4.5483
The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors .	-2.0123
The board can also be activated by the Public Prosecutor to invite people to interrogate under oath .	-5.0807
According to CNN , subpoenas have already been issued about the encounter between Donald Trump Jr . and a Russian lawyer .	-3.8359
People who were involved in the meeting had been asked to make a statement , as the report says .	-6.7855
They should also provide documents .	-1.1843
In addition to Trump Jr . , Trump ’ s counselor and son-in-law , Jared Kushner , and his then campaign leader , Paul Manafort , were also on the conversation .	-4.9974
Legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the installation shows that Mueller is not intimidating in his work and that he wants to act quickly if necessary .	-5.0449
But it must not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide whether to issue an indictment .	-5.7502
Nevertheless , the establishment of the body is the beginning of a new phase in the investigation and a new cause for concern for President Trump .	-4.1114
Amid the new revelations , the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents .	-2.9648
" Russia 's history is a total invention , " Trump said .	-1.9715
The subject gives the democrats a chance to ' feel good because they have nothing else they can talk about ' .	-3.6817
His special adviser Ty Cobb stated in an opinion that he knew nothing about the appointment of a Grand Jury .	-4.0802
However , they usually work in secret , he emphasized .	-4.3038
The White House is in favour of any measures which speed up the work of the Special Rapporteur in a ' fair ' manner .	-4.4155
Former FBI chief James Comey has said three times that it is not being investigated against the president .	-3.9741
There is no reason to believe that this has changed , the statement continued .	-4.3644
But Mueller had only been deployed after Trump fired Comey .	-2.1949
Because of this buzz , accusations against Trump had been made that he wanted to obstruct justice .	-5.5594
Comey told a Senate committee in June that Trump asked him to stop investigating then-national security adviser Michael Flynn .	-3.2737
The President is under great pressure because of the investigation .	-2.7645
After the presentation of US media , the White House collected material against the Special Investigator and his staff .	-4.4549
This triggered speculation about whether Trump would dismiss Mueller .	-3.1152
Unlike an independent Congressional Special Investigator , such as the Watergate affair of later resigned President Richard Nixon , Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired by the Ministry of Justice at the behest of the president .	-4.4926
But several senators from both parties want to prevent such a move .	-2.9671
On Thursday , two groups of Republican and Democratic Senators presented draft legislation that would make the Special Investigator less easy to dismiss .	-5.2258
Antarctica ’ s Gigantic iceberg	-2.2968
In Western Antarctica , a gigantic iceberg has separated itself from the Schelfeis of almost seven times the size of Berlin .	-5.4246
This was announced by the Bremerhavener Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .	-2.8373
The colossus weighing more than one trillion tons and 5800 square kilometres is now pushing north and will probably take two or three years until it has melted .	-5.3146
With 175 kilometres in length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered in the last three decades .	-4.2453
It does not pose a threat to people .	-3.1190
The extent to which climate change has played a role in the collapse of the iceberg is unclear , according to research .	-4.8020
In total , however , there has been a series of unusual ice loops in the region for about 30 years , writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice ( NSIDC ) in a factual background .	-5.5370
According to many researchers , this could be related to global warming .	-3.1194
The now canceled colossus was part of the Larsen-C Shelf .	-5.1879
Schelfeis floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers .	-2.8404
As a result , it continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly .	-5.0290
Larsen-C Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula .	-3.6066
North of this bargain , the balance of growth and breakdowns was disturbed a few years ago .	-5.0054
AWI researcher Daniela Jansen writes that a complete bargain was broken there .	-5.2498
There are some points in favour of the risk of the Larsen-C Shelf , because the front edge has never been as far removed as it is now .	-10.8106
In addition , the ice plate is under tension and may break down if a piece of ice breaks at a key point .	-7.3306
The melting of Schelfeis and Eisberg does not increase the sea level , as they swim on the water and squeeze out ice as much water as it does after the melting itself .	-5.5746
However , the loss of the ice sheet results in the glaciers leading directly into the sea and flowing out much faster than before .	-6.8031
This may increase sea levels , but only to a small extent , writes the British research project on Antarctica ( Midas ) .	-4.5361
The Larsen-C Schelfeis , according to AWI , is the fourth largest scalp in Antarctica , with almost 50 000 square kilometres .	-6.0019
At the crossing from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters .	-4.4365
There it breaks down regularly .	-3.7104
" Although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change , the ice sheet is now in a more dangerous position , " said Martin O 'Leary of the British Swansea University .	-4.3564
" This is the widest withdrawal since the records began , " he also confirmed .	-4.2390
Among scientists , it is controversial whether the Larsen-C Shelf will grow again , or whether it will go back in the long term and possibly collapse , his colleague Adrian Luckman said , " Our models say it will be less stable " .	-7.0580
But it will take decades .	-1.8234
Although these researchers do not attribute the collapse of this gigantic iceberg to climate change , a great many ice caps on the Antarctic Peninsula have collapsed in recent decades .	-5.9242
This long Antarctic tip stretches towards South America .	-3.5104
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey , the Antarctic Peninsula 's ice surface has fallen by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s .	-3.2360
The temperature rise contributed to the decline .	-2.5628
Over the past 50 years , the Antarctic Peninsula has warmed up by about three degrees , making it one of the areas where temperatures rise the fastest .	-5.4590
Christian Democratic Union on Personal Charges	-4.4060
Because it is becoming more and more difficult to fill vacant positions , the CDU is demanding that it leave the employers ' association in order to become more attractive .	-5.2688
Only shortly before the summer recess did the day of the roundabout leave 41 new administrative posts .	-5.6950
More than 1100 employees and civil servants work for the county administration in Mettmann .	-2.0928
Once again , 17 trainees have had their first working day .	-3.4989
The places of instruction at the circle are obviously very much desired .	-5.6269
About 620 applications were registered for the places to be awarded this year .	-4.2005
Nevertheless , the circle still lacks staff to cope with the increased requirements and tasks .	-4.7494
Currently there are still 50 vacant positions at Mettmann County .	-3.7987
Doctors and engineers as well as general administration forces are required .	-5.2124
The CDU now wants to take the initiative with the FDP and the UWG in the roundabouts and confront the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .	-6.3324
According to the wishes of the parties , the administration shall " develop a concept for personnel recruitment and personnel development " .	-5.2947
The aim is not only to meet short-term requirements of professionals , but to counteract the shortage of applicants in the future , it is said .	-6.6540
The overall concept should be geared to the inside and the outside world , concrete measures should be identified for cross-beginners and a training offensive should be called for by the CDU , FDP and UWG .	-7.2796
That sounds like a good approach .	-2.0261
Because the circle is concerned with human resources problems that were never known before .	-5.8060
Other cities recruit good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .	-3.1611
We are talking about a genuine ' competition of public employers ' .	-3.2895
In addition , a large number of employees who leave the service due to illness or age .	-5.6500
So it is high time to act , so that more jobs are not left unfilled .	-5.3598
But Klaus-Dieter Volken , leader of the CDU , goes further than the joint motion with his party .	-3.7495
He recently caused a bad surprise at the day of the round-trip , when he publicly questioned staff spending and stunned the other parties .	-8.0688
People want to see any possibility of leaving the local employers ' association reviewed .	-5.0356
" If we do not find a satisfactory solution here in the short term , then the district administration with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the towns in question - should aim for a pet fare " , says Volker .	-8.6771
In this way , the CDU is trying to pay employees and officials better than the public service system actually provides for .	-5.6938
At the moment , salaries are precisely prescribed , increases or more money are only possible if you change to a higher level , which is geared to professional years .	-7.6386
But the circle ’ s tasks have grown more and more in recent years .	-2.9316
Only a few weeks ago , new spaces had to be set up in which employees took care of the provisions of the new law on prostitution .	-4.4390
Not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers , Landrat Thomas Hendele and District Director Martin Richter have a problem : they have too few .	-6.8900
Italy Fixing the Tone to NGO Migrant Rescue Boots	-7.9291
Italy has warned NGOs using lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they cannot continue to do so unless they abide by new rules for their operations .	-4.1324
" If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue to work , " said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa .	-3.2569
Minniti 's warning came a day after the Italian authorities seized a boat from the German aid organisation ' Youth Save ' because their team had effectively cooperated with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration .	-4.4808
The aid organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to comment on detailed allegations by the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio .	-5.1098
" For us , saving human life is and remains our top priority , so we are very sorry that we cannot currently operate in the search and rescue zone , " said the organization in an opinion on the social media .	-4.9618
'We can only assess all the accusations currently being made after we have gathered all the information and can assess the situation ' .	-5.0370
The Italian authorities had monitored the boat of ' Youth Save ' , the Iuventa , since October .	-3.0943
It is suspected that his crew will take tube-boat migrants on board , delivered directly to them by traffickers , and that the smugglers will be able to leave so that the ships can be used again .	-6.6795
At least such a meeting was supposedly only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the Public Prosecutor 's Act , the content of which was published by Italian media .	-4.5146
The crew is suspected of ignoring the authority of the Italian Coast Guard to monitor the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other reason .	-4.2082
Under the code of conduct , boats such as the Iuventa must , above all , have an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities .	-3.8311
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the code : Save the Children , MOAS from Malta and Pro-Active Open Arms from Spain .	-3.4702
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be seen as unnecessary but acceptable , because they would not entail ' substantial changes or disabilities ' in their bailouts .	-4.6845
Among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel Prize winner is Doctors Without Borders ( MSF ) .	-4.9313
Minniti has now said that the number of migrants arriving in Italy after the rescue operations has fallen sharply in recent weeks , indicating that efforts to strengthen Libya ’ s coastguard and to cooperate with local mayors have borne fruit .	-10.4700
" In recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , " said the Minister .	-2.3724
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives , and with Chad , Niger , and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of reaching Europe .	-3.0635
Rise and Trials	-2.0491
Nine Weilermer Bikers , the " Berliner outpost " and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the Nordpfalz to enjoy the Trials and sights for four days .	-7.8929
Three friendly guides were at your disposal .	-7.5808
The accommodation in the Wachenheim Valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .	-3.3250
The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra .	-2.6335
The first tour led to the Michaelkapelle above Deidesheim at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards .	-2.8260
It was followed by vantage points , partly on towers , from which one could look far over the Pfälzer forest and the upstream plains .	-5.9044
In between there were always longer climbs for which long trials rewarded .	-4.8786
On the second day after Bad Dürkheim we went to the Saline and the Volksfest Wurstmarkt .	-4.0651
Again , lookout point mounted at a vantage point , connected by " flowy " trials and moderate climbs .	-6.7098
On the last two days many altitude meters were announced .	-4.8324
Caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and inns brought welcome breaks .	-2.8493
In Bad Dürkheim , bikers breathe in the open-air inhalation of salted brine .	-5.0415
Neustadt was also planned .	-3.5104
After 173 kilometres and almost 4500 metres of altitude , the group had experienced the Pfälzer Forest from its best side - sportive and cultural .	-4.7620
Console instead of Rasen - Bundesliga Fits for E-Sport	-3.7167
Will the sports stars be sitting in front of computer consoles instead of scrambling over the stadium grass in wind and weather ?	-7.0378
The fact is that e-sport has long become a serious industry , a lucrative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gain .	-5.1846
The first Bundesliga players , who are increasingly involved in this area , have also recognized this .	-5.3700
FC Schalke 04 and VfB Stuttgart , who founded an e-sports department in mid-July and signed a contract with two professionals for the FIFA 17 computer game . and were and .	-9.2647
" We hope to inspire new young target groups for the VfB , " says CEO Jochen Röttgermann .	-4.2490
He is sure that there are still a number of clubs going up this train .	-5.3923
This weekend , FIFA World Cup London will host the first Interactive Club World Cup , where players from different clubs will compete .	-6.4782
Besides Schalke and Wolfsburg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint-Germain or the PSV Eindhoven qualified .	-2.9633
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sports .	-2.3046
The former coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players .	-2.1009
" Real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 year olds in particular , that young people will continue to go to the stadium in the future , " says the 52-year-old .	-6.1682
And : the clubs tried to conquer all kinds of markets , especially the Asian ones .	-3.4231
With prominent e-athletes under contract , you could be present online much more often than just sending the Bundesliga team to Asia once a year .	-5.8572
What exactly is this about ?	-2.2458
In e-sports , computer games like " League Of Legends " , " Dota 2 " , " Counter-Strike " or the football simulation FIFA are fought at competitive level .	-4.8724
As in normal sports , leagues have long established in which the pros compete against each other .	-3.9757
And in Asia ’ s 2022 games , e-sport is already part of the official program .	-3.3960
But is this a real sport ?	-3.0612
For many , the idea certainly needs to be used to .	-3.9964
Ingo Froevil , too , has long considered the question .	-4.3844
For the professor at the German Sports Academy in Cologne , E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that are also found in classical sports - for example increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormonal changes .	-5.6653
It also needs cognitive skills , technical and tactical understanding , and rapid reaction capability .	-3.6314
Professional gamers should not only train at the console , but also their bodies and pay attention to nutrition .	-3.8386
" The fitte player is a good player . "	-2.1003
However , Froevil also sees problems : " Doping becomes more and more a topic " .	-4.6003
Controls were difficult to implement in online games , and the scene lacked the structures of classical sport .	-4.2832
On the positive side , the scientist highlights the high integrative impact of e-sports .	-4.3411
Players travel internationally , like a large global family , there are no intercultural barriers .	-4.5552
A study by the management consultancy Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software ( BIU ) predicts rapid growth in e-sports .	-4.0086
In 2016 , Germany implemented € 50 million , mainly through advertising , sponsorship , and major tournaments .	-4.1322
In three years , sales are expected to be 130 million .	-2.8023
This is little against the nearly € 2.4 billion of the Bundesliga .	-5.2798
However , E-Sport is " not far from other established sports such as handball , basketball or ice hockey " , the Deloitte consultants write .	-4.7176
Many countries are already international .	-1.7207
Major markets are Asia and the USA , where former basketball players Shaquille O<unk>Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez participate in the US NRG eSports team .	-3.6060
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSports betting provider Unikrn .	-2.3310
There are also things going on in Europe .	-3.1385
In a Norwegian school e-sport was introduced as a subject of education , says Froevil .	-4.9093
In the Netherlands and France , according to Dutch , the first-league football clubs are now obliged to set up an e-sports department .	-4.1725
" Compared to Europe , Germany is lagging behind , " explains VfB ’ s board member Röttgermann .	-5.4321
It is no longer enough to indulge in nostalgia and to transfuse old times .	-6.1421
The aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but at the same time to align the company with the modern market .	-4.0748
" We live in a digitized world , " says Dutt .	-2.4857
'You cannot keep in mind that only football will keep everything as it always was ' .	-6.1442
Gift Eggs - The Egg Alternatives to Cooking and Baking	-3.1994
The scandal of poisoned eggs has now hit almost all federal states .	-4.5605
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord reacted and removed all eggs from the sale across Germany .	-3.5826
Only eggs that have no fipronil should be taken into the shelves .	-5.8955
Michelle Carter convicted of the texts pushing Conrad Roy for suicide .	-2.8070
A Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend to commit suicide through texts and calls .	-3.5108
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years have been suspended .	-2.6671
Carter was sentenced in June for the negligent killing of Conrad Roy , who died on July 13 , 2014 .	-2.8347
The father of Roy said at the hearing on Thursday : " My family is uncomforting .	-2.4826
My son was my best friend . '	-0.8571
Carter was allowed to remain free until appeal .	-2.5327
She had been faced with a maximum sentence of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that she and Mr Roy suffered mental illness .	-3.4691
dressed in red trousers and a creamy blouse , Carter stood there with tears in the eyes , with folded hands and downwards eyes when she was convicted .	-4.7032
" Conrad Roy killed her actions , " the lawyer said to the court .	-3.5213
" She finished his life to make her own better .	-2.3061
She took no responsibility , " she said .	-2.7719
'She has shown no remorse ' .	-2.1712
But Carter 's lawyer said that it was " a terrible circumstance that she completely regretted " .	-6.1322
Judge Lawrence Moniz , however , said that he did not find that their " age or maturity , or even their mental illness , have a significant impact on their actions " .	-4.1623
A prosecutor read a statement by Roy 's mother Lynn Roy , who said that " there is no day when I do not mourn the loss of my beloved son .	-3.7642
I try to be there for his sisters , despite all the pain we will have for eternity with us , " says it .	-6.7122
Roy 's sister , Camdyn Roy , said she would be " persecuted " by the realization that she would never attend her brother 's wedding or be a aunt for his children .	-4.5453
" Not having this only person with whom I have been together since my birth every day is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , " she said .	-3.9662
The case seems to set a legal precedent , because there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide .	-2.7251
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead from carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014 .	-1.8991
The case attracted national attention after Carter ’ s text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life .	-3.2349
" Stop , jump from a building , create yourself , I do not know there are many ways , " she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on holiday with his family .	-5.0037
In the moments before his suicide , she wrote : ' You have to do it , Conrad ' and ' All you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy ' .	-4.1392
Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention through the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from the case through any press .	-3.8703
The case has divided legal opinion .	-2.3318
Among the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox , who was convicted in 2007 for murder of her British fellow inhabitant in Italy before she was released two years ago .	-4.9030
Mrs Knox , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : ' Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not prison ' .	-3.3541
Joshua Kimmmich : Learning from the FC Bayern ’ s New Mini-Lahm	-4.6673
It is no coincidence that Joshua Kimmich was allowed to run up as captain at the Audi Cup .	-4.4476
The FC Bayern are confident that the Confed-Cup winner will be able to win a big season - no extra motivation will hurt .	-8.1614
Something was different on his place in the cabin , which saw Joshua Kimmich immediately , even though the additional garment was very , very small .	-4.7991
But since Philipp Lahm and no Manuel Neuer were to be seen far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup , he stopped by his arm .	-6.2882
" The coach has not announced it , " the conted-cup winner told us after his first bet as a Bavarian captain .	-5.3841
Good , the consolation could have been better than at 0 : 2 against the SSC Naples .	-4.2119
But Kimmich could interpret the sign of the coach as well .	-5.5951
Not the eight years old Arturo Vidal had been chosen as the game leader in the C-Elf , who was made up of youth players , debutantes and professionals who came straight out of their .	-8.1533
Sugar is best distributed to those who are trusted to keep their spirits happy .	-6.1500
Those who have been chosen to enter the legacy of Lahm can only use a small extra motivation .	-5.1013
Kimmich confirmed : " This is what you want as a player : take responsibility " .	-4.0302
On Wednesday the 22-year-old flipped over the field as a mini-lame .	-4.0313
To the right behind , this is now his position , the white bandage on the arm did its rest .	-5.1632
And Kimmich at all looked like the one who could take the rudder in his hand in this start formation .	-8.0253
He gave instructions , tried to steer the unengaged force .	-3.9376
He had a look for the whole while many others were preoccupied with himself .	-4.6611
Vidal with overplaying his lack of fitness ( hardly flipped ) ; Renato Sanches so that he could start to tie up with the achievements of the Asian trip ( also only limited ) ; and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle so that their first appearance in the Bayern-Trikot would not be negative .	-10.2257
After all , that worked very well .	-3.3008
He was also a member of the party .	-10.1905
The famous Napoli Storm was often hard , and Süle also tried to win a few times during the game .	-8.8161
Mr Rudy admitted that the result was ' not as we hoped ' .	-2.9072
But he also showed a decent performance at his debut .	-4.4753
Game shift , Tempowechsel : " For this style I was also brought " .	-6.6486
How unusual this world of Bayer is for the newcomers was seen after the match .	-6.5323
Rudy , for example , did not give one or two in the catacombs , but certainly six or seven interviews .	-2.6216
Kimmich passed away after a few brief statements in the back of his new fellow players .	-6.2844
There he heard an interesting sentence from Süle : " What is going on here , I have already noticed .	-4.7151
In Bavaria you simply have to win every game " .	-3.2677
After all , he no longer has to teach the new .	-2.6282
Alaba Motivated <unk>FB Women	-2.7693
David Alaba believes in the success of our <unk>FB ladies .	-2.5678
Austria ’ s most famous footballer reported on Twitter shortly before the match and wished the <unk>FB ladies well .	-6.2762
The Bavarian Legionaire is almost Klubkolleg of <unk>FB captain Schnaderbeck and is involved with our ladys .	-5.8027
The tweet of the Austrian footballer of the year and Champion League winner should be a special injection .	-6.1055
Perhaps our ladies might well need the famous Bavarian dusel .	-3.8746
Business satisfied with Rhineland Minister : Economics praises Wissings Tempo	-5.2622
It was often irreconcilable , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when Eveline Lemke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economy of Rhineland-Palatinate .	-3.2146
This is apparent after more than a year when the new Minister for Economic Affairs , Volker Wissing ( FDP ) , is in office .	-3.6645
Chambers and companies from the region speak , on T V , of a change in economic policy - and simultaneously blame the old minister .	-5.7676
Frank Natus , Chairman of the Trierer Unternehmen Association ( VTU ) , says : " Wissing takes up the wishes of the economy , which Lemke has all blocked " .	-4.0454
Natus sees the biggest U-turn in infrastructure policy : the closure of highway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country ’ s list of priorities .	-5.1998
This year , the Ministry is hoping for a plan settlement procedure , and the construction law will stand by 2021 .	-6.5734
The Trier West Circuit , which is in the urgent need of the Federal Transport Plan , also plays a role in the country ’ s plans .	-6.8634
The aim is to launch the route in December 2020 , says Minister Cornelia Holtmann .	-3.2841
Natus sees this as a signpost to support regional but internationally competing companies .	-3.9871
The Chamber of Industry and Commerce ( IHK ) Trier , as suggested by Wissing , aims at a Rhineland-Palatinate label for wine in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports that has been declining for ten years .	-6.0990
In addition , Wissing has an open ear for people who want to start their own company , praised the IHK .	-5.4973
The Trier Handwerkskammer sees in the new Meister-Bonus an additional incentive for young trainees , says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach .	-3.6457
This is a premium of EUR 1000 for the master examination passed and EUR 2500 for graduates who make themselves independent within ten years of their master education .	-8.2341
But the country ’ s homework list remains long .	-3.6336
In the planned road construction , facts need to be created quickly , while at the same time , Jan Glockauer , Chief Executive Officer of the IHK Trier , says .	-6.8675
Of 56 new engineers who want to hire Wissing in the state of mobility , only 29 are currently employed .	-6.6952
IHK calls for more orders to be placed to external offices .	-3.6750
Christian Baldauf , the CDU Group ’ s vize , refers to the Court of Auditors ’ calculations that the country invests more than EUR 20 million less in the maintenance of national roads than proposed in 2017 and 2018 .	-5.4430
Frank Natus also expects a country ’ s concept of how to fix the regional shortage of skilled workers .	-5.0471
Similarly , the country ’ s existing broadband expansion is sobering .	-5.8155
In 2016 , regional companies had only rated net supply as 3.4 in an IHK survey .	-4.8489
They complained about broken Internet connections and breakdowns .	-4.0977
On the other hand , former economic minister Eveline Lemke is out of politics at the moment and is still on the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind .	-5.0897
The Green Group left Lemke in April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe - where , after four months of disagreements , she has already cleared the field again .	-5.5550
Audi is expected to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - Car manufacturers are facing a backlash .	-4.2146
A day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles .	-2.9271
The BMW chairman said that the company believes that ' there are smarter options than driving restrictions ' , referring to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles .	-4.7055
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .	-3.1099
None of the companies described the undertakings as a call back .	-3.2740
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules on carbon dioxide emissions .	-3.2597
But the nitrogen oxides emitted by diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma .	-2.3973
The costs for car manufacturers to install systems to neutralise exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles are also increasing , making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .	-4.4334
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of cunning the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem .	-3.6384
The companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen ’ s mistakes , which could regulate the use of so-called shut-off devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car has been tested but that drive back in normal driving conditions .	-6.9902
In the United States , several Volkswagen employees have been accused , while others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic .	-4.6972
Last month , the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .	-2.7337
The former manager , Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be tried in the United States .	-3.0818
At the beginning of this year , Audi was included in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen , after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circumvent emissions regulations in Europe , and a question focused on the United States was extended .	-4.5004
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to Volkswagen ’ s profits .	-4.5579
This is the message on Saturday ’ s Isar	-4.3854
The city wants to protect the Isar .	-1.7369
In order for Isar visitors to take part , a raft will pass through Munich on Saturday , which has a special message .	-6.6287
Wenn es am Samstag wieder an die Isar geht , wird dort zwischen Flascher und Reichenbachbrücke ein gro<unk>es Floss sehen .	-4.5867
And this is not a common raft , with Isar tourists .	-3.4652
But the building reference wants to clarify .	-4.9876
On the raft you can see a large information transparent .	-3.2198
It shows a mountain of rubbish .	-2.1281
The start of a publicity campaign to appeal to the Isar visitors .	-3.7643
With the motto " True love is ... " the understanding for the Isar is to sharpen as a protective wild river .	-6.4405
Last summer , the river passed through the river Isar and this year , too , there are further actions and measures to achieve a reckless and environmentally conscious behaviour .	-7.8571
Mordillo ’ s Knollies and Laughter against the suffering	-4.9847
Mordillo was one of the most frequently published cartoon artists , the buttons of his figures are his trademark .	-5.3216
Even with 85 , the Argentinean still draws and works on a film .	-4.7268
His message : laugh , ' because there is too much suffering in the world ' .	-2.5011
Guillermo Mordillo was born in Buenos Aires on August 4 , 1932 .	-5.8168
In his first years as an artist , he beat himself , among other things , as a draughtsman for greeting cards - which frustrated him .	-7.5231
" The happiest day in my professional life was the day when my job lost , " he once said .	-2.1233
After stations in Lima , New York and Paris , he achieved a breakthrough at the end of the 1960s : with the publication of his cartoons in " Paris Match " and then in the " Stern " and other leading magazines around the world .	-5.4439
Even in China , Mordillo found a lot of fans . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-3.8546
Again and again the artist was inspired by cities .	-2.8749
Large round figures of Mordillo are drawn with the Leaning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and Red Square in Moscow .	-3.9721
In the early morning , according to his own data , he is still sitting at the drawing table , working almost ten hours a day .	-4.7947
About calendars , puzzles , books for young and old , t-shirts , plush toys and watches , his drunken figures continue to spread throughout the world .	-5.9242
For six years he has also been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters .	-3.7988
The main person in the movie " Crazy Island " is a giraffe - Mordillo 's most popular animal in his drawings - which has a thousand-foot counterpart .	-4.5421
For the first time , his figures speak in the 3D film , which is to be released on the cinema screen in 2019 .	-5.0544
" I don 't know exactly what they will say , it 's strange for me , " says Mordillo .	-2.2192
The script is not written by him .	-1.1539
For this reason , he relies more on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced without words .	-5.4630
Provence Lavender Threat Climate Change	-2.7024
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .	-2.3494
Lavender is falling because of the drought and diseases affecting insects , causing a great headache for scientists and farmers trying to find solutions .	-5.4831
Eric Chaisse , expert of the agricultural research institute CREEPPAM in Provence , said : " Lavender in Provence is effectively at risk because the plant has been exposed in recent years to the effects of climate change , which brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn .	-5.7387
This has an effect on the lifetime of lavender .	-6.5257
There is also a small cicade , a microbacterium that transmits dwarf cicades , and in very dry weather there are many of them . '	-4.4964
And the stakes are high .	-1.8714
Lavender oil not only attracts tourists , it is also very popular for perfumes and cosmetics .	-4.0693
Eric Chaisse said : " Instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , underdeveloped and either missing or weakened .	-4.1071
So we have fewer parts with essential oil . '	-2.5027
The solutions that are being considered include better water distribution and a slowdown in soil evaporation , but also the spraying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drought .	-5.1180
The town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhön celebrates its 1200-year anniversary this year .	-3.2015
Fixed point is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival .	-4.1640
Crams , guilds , dealers , vagants or a country knight ’ s hanger should be experienced in the city centre these days .	-9.2339
The murder of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico	-2.3313
The Riodoce weekly staff usually meet on Wednesday to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the Sinaloa state through organised crime , corrupt officials , and incessant drug wars .	-4.8322
But on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .	-2.2061
They were told that it is important to change their routines .	-1.7668
Two high-ranking journalists discuss what is more secure : they are supposed to take their children to the office , which in 2009 were the target of an attack with grenades , or leave them at home .	-6.1306
Security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room : opponents , neutrals , allies .	-2.5506
They ask reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is needed , perceptions and abdominal feelings are sufficient .	-4.3111
There are drug smugglers , politicians , business people , journalists suspected of being on the government or cartel payroll , a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .	-4.7031
There is no respite from the violence , and as the corpses are accumulating throughout the country , more and more journalists are there : at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012 ; 589 have been under federal protection following attacks and threats , and until now there have been at least seven deaths in seven states this year .	-5.9452
Among the latter is her editor and her inspirator of Riodoce , co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas .	-3.4863
" The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , " Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on drug-related violence .	-3.0141
His absence is deeply felt , although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez showing his middle finger with the word " Justice " hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building .	-5.3206
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the reporters discuss their shared themes , the trauma , their nightmares , insomnia , paranoia .	-2.8594
Although a special Federal Attorney Office was set up in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists , according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists , it has only initiated two criminal proceedings . of were . were .	-13.2443
As with most thousands of murders involving drug trafficking and organised crime every year , journalists ' murderers are rarely brought to justice .	-3.6733
At Riodoce , they still insist on treating the Sinaloa violence , even though they are uncomforting and although the terrain is now even more treacherous .	-5.1150
Without information about the murderers , without justice , the meeting to discuss security has little benefit , says Ibarra .	-2.2906
" It is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , " he says .	-1.7886
'As long as we do not know why , we are all . '	-3.1585
On the morning of 15 May Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the provincial capital of Culiacan .	-3.0233
He only managed to drive a few blocks long before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men , forced out of his car and 12 , probably because of the newspaper 's name " Twelve River " . of were .	-7.0149
The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .	-2.3012
Valdez was 50 years old .	-0.8512
He left a woman and two adult children .	-1.7859
Rumors tend to fly around freely in Culiacan .	-1.9697
But there is practically nothing but silence about Valdez .	-2.6300
Since Guzman ’ s arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January , Sinaloa had become one of the country ’ s bloodiest battlefields , with rival factions fighting here to fill the vacuum .	-3.2009
It does not matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or more people are shot on the streets or that the cemetery is full of decorated two-storey mausoleums for drug kings , which are larger than many houses for the living .	-5.7494
Forget for a minute that there is a state of ' calm ' when only one cartel has control over the coastal state , with its valuable ports and drug trading routes to the United States .	-4.0984
Despite this , and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work , Ismail Bojorquez ( 60 ) , co-founder and director of Riodoce , was guilty of not protecting his friend .	-3.7803
He believes that two misunderstandings contributed to the murder .	-1.5735
First , in February , there was an interview with Damaso Lopez , a leader of one of the rival cartel factions in the war with Guzman ’ s sons .	-3.8181
This publication may have annoyed the sons , suspected gang members bought up each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks .	-4.2567
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own security after seizing another newspaper that had published the same story .	-3.5435
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .	-2.4884
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there .	-2.5172
He was an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 , when he joined five colleagues on the foundation of Riodoce and sold $ 50 .	-5.0778
In Sinaloa , " it was impossible to conduct journalism without encountering the drugs problem , " said Bojorquez .	-2.9654
Over time , the newspaper earned a reputation for bold and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .	-3.8105
Reporters loved being able to publish hard-hitting investigations without fear of censorship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they were able to read stories that no one else dared to deal .	-4.2961
Eight years after the foundation of Riodoce , she received the prestigious " Maria-Moors Cabot Award " for her coverage in Latin America .	-2.7516
In the same year , Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee on the Protection of Journalists for his courage in pursuing Mexican drug history wherever she was .	-4.1220
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid .	-1.4285
" I want to live on , " he said at the time of the CPJ award .	-2.5355
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa " is a way of life , " he said last October in an interview with Rommeviento TV .	-3.1755
" You have to take on the task that suits you as a journalist - either that or you play the stupid .	-4.3138
I do not want to be asked : ' What did you do with so many dead ... why did you not say what was going on ? '	-3.4038
The Riodoce team is missing Valdez , the bird of fun that could flood like a dockworker , the friend who was generous with hugs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .	-4.2735
They trusted his routine .	-2.0781
He would always wear his hat .	-0.8940
He would always go to El Guayabo , the bar opposite the office , and always sit there at the same table .	-2.4384
Now they ask : Was his love of routine his spoil ?	-2.3520
His death has also forced her to question her own assumptions about how best to do her job and stay alive .	-3.6526
" They don 't like it if you are dealing with their women , their children , their clean shops , their homey runways " to move drugs .	-5.1032
" These things were not allowed , " said Bojorquez .	-1.9438
The result , even in the best times , is a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation .	-2.4911
Trust your own instincts .	-1.5320
If it smells wrong , stay away from it .	-1.8376
The trouble is , said the editor of Riodoce Andres Villarreal , that " smell a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing happened with Javier . "	-3.5945
The old rules , as he and others say , no longer apply in Sinaloa , just as they do in Tamaulipa , Veracruz , Guerrero , and other states where a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes , weak institutions , and corrupt government officials is at home .	-4.1712
The landscape is constantly changing .	-1.4324
In the space where Riodoce ’ s staff met for security training , mobile phones were suddenly not allowed , and days before it became known that spyware sold exclusively to governments was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .	-5.7083
Outside , two policemen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 <unk> C ) in the shade of a tree .	-3.8691
They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a middle class district of Culiacan .	-4.2488
Half in joke , some of the reporters wondered whether these officers were among the 50 % of the policemen that the governor himself described as untrustworthy .	-4.6960
It has been months since the reporters went into the mountain landscape , where drug gangs are in fact under control .	-4.5318
For this week 's issue , Riodoce has looked at three main stories .	-4.2407
There was the murder of the brother of former boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa .	-2.2856
They also had an exposé of government spending that focused on the governor ’ s hometown .	-3.1807
And there was a group that hijacked one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan , one block from the office of the prosecutor .	-3.0613
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite place for drug traffickers and authorities .	-4.5893
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the governing Institutional Revolution Party ( PRI ) , which ruled all political levels almost the whole century .	-4.6647
Recently , several PRI governors were accused of high-profile cases of corruption .	-2.4666
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant , including one in which a son of " El Chapo " Guzman escaped a military attack .	-3.6690
Only a few months earlier , readers would have regarded the column of Valdez as the best informed source of the abduction .	-4.1169
" In the past we knew what happened , " said Villarreal , 46 , with the nickname " El Flaco " because of its slim body stature .	-3.9397
" Now all channels of communication with our sources have broken . "	-2.2466
The Valdez office has been transformed into a storage room for signs and stickers protesting against the murders of journalists , because employees have become something they themselves would never have expected : activists on behalf of the press .	-5.0066
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and went to the office of the prosecutor the next morning for a demonstration for another journalist .	-4.6271
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed in the western state of Michoacan .	-2.3322
A burnt body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests that it is his .	-4.0470
Journalists throughout the country have become louder by writing in organized protests " SOS Press " on walkways and buildings .	-4.5011
On that day , the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to gather international support for justice in the Valdez case .	-4.2932
At a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa the day after the assassination of Valdez , Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and killing them because they said the truth .	-5.8463
She has since asked for it to be reassessed by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity .	-4.1548
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were " surrounded " by organised crime , government officials involved and a uniform society .	-4.2021
In his last book " Narco Journalism " , he wrote that reporters are killed not only by drug gangs , but also by the orders of politicians and security forces who were stuck in a blanket with organized crime .	-5.3467
Last year , the media watchdog group " Articulo 19 " assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists to the police and officials .	-4.1570
" You die in Mexico because they want you to keep your mouth , " Ramirez said .	-2.1994
Obviously , the murders have a deterrent effect .	-2.8021
No one forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipa six years ago .	-2.8575
Your body was found along with a note supposedly signed by the Zetas cartel : ' I am here because of my reports ' .	-3.6441
A computer keyboard and headphones lay beside their separate head .	-2.6039
Some branches have chosen to close , such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the assassination of correspondent Miroslav Breach in March .	-5.5323
Others continue , as Nuevo Laredo ’ s El Manana did after its director ’ s assassination in 2004 .	-3.8131
In 2010 , the Diario de Ciudad Juarez was publicly directed to the drug cartels with an editorial on the front page entitled ' What do you want us to do ? '	-4.8091
Some journalists have fled their home countries , or even from the country .	-6.6473
It is a painful decision .	-0.8258
It is difficult to find work in exile , and they are still watching the streets and looking for dangers .	-2.1915
And sometimes they are hunted , as it seems to the photographer Ruben Espinosa , who was murdered in 2015 in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the flight from Veracruz .	-3.9860
For those who stay behind and continue working , it is a daily dance with risky decisions .	-3.6065
Ibarra , who once wanted to be a poet , admits that drug trafficking frightens him .	-2.3339
" Mexico goes to hell , and that is why I became a reporter , " he said .	-3.1276
At midnight last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Riodoce sat on the pavement in front of the office and drank beer when all their phones started to buzz at once .	-4.6597
A number of shootings with gang rivals and security forces near the resort of Mazatlan left 19 confirmed dead .	-3.7601
The war continued to escalate , as promised by a number of cartel messages in the region .	-2.7459
From the Bordsteinkante you have published the news on the website of Riodoce via mobile phone .	-5.3638
The title page had to be changed the next day .	-1.5784
Sirens woke up nearby - another shooting facility in the area .	-4.8705
Bojorquez took a look at the policemen who kept guards to see if they were ready .	-3.7977
If they were afraid at all , they did not show it .	-2.6217
Under the enormous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible to the whole of Sinaloa , the Riodoce staff followed his footsteps .	-7.2080
'How can you only remember to close ' , said Bojorquez , ' when on the same day that Javier was murdered , the intern asked me to send her to the streets to report . '	-5.6371
Dinosaur used camouflage to escape his enemies .	-2.4386
At first glance , it looks like a statue , albeit a frightening one .	-2.2012
Researchers have now found that the first findings of a Canadian miner 's incredible rhino were so well preserved that experts have described it as the " Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs " .	-5.5159
It was so well preserved that they even discovered that his scaly skin was of reddish brown - and they said that it had had something of a " restless past " .	-4.6730
The report in the journal " Current Biology " described him as " the best-preserved armored dinosaur ever found , and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world " .	-3.7433
The fossil is a newly discovered species of Nodosaurs , which lived in the middle of the chalk period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .	-4.1722
Its incredibly well-preserved state has stunned researchers who describe it as ' truly remarkable ' .	-3.8109
According to reports in National Geographic , the armored plant eater is the best preserved fossil of its kind .	-3.5539
It was found by Shawn Funk when he grub on March 21 , 2011 at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta , Canada .	-2.1240
He met something that seemed out of place from the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely .	-3.8290
The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology .	-2.3081
They spent the next six years discovering the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,100 kg ) heavy Earth slump .	-4.0439
After all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be unveiled .	-2.7979
" If you blink a little with your eyes , you might almost believe that it has slept , " said the main author Caleb Brown , scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum , where the creature is to be seen .	-4.0969
" It will go down in the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaure . .	-5.5620
Researchers have found that , despite being covered with armor and resembling a changing tank , this herbivore has probably been threatened by meat eating dinosaurs .	-5.3668
The heavily armored dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators , and used a shielding technique known as antishading , which is also used by many modern animals .	-4.8103
This would have allowed itself to be better mixed into its surroundings and evaded its enemies , experts say , suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs .	-6.2313
The 110 million year old Nodosaurian family creature made headlines in May and is now featured in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology .	-4.9883
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and it Borealopelta markmitchelli named after the museum technician Mark Mitchell , one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours discovering it carefully .	-4.1313
The amazing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armor over his body .	-3.7881
They discovered the account shading , a common defense method in the animal kingdom , meaning that the tip of the creature was darker than its base .	-3.8746
Although contour shading is common , the results are surprising , as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of today 's animals .	-4.4313
It suggests that the dinosaur was driven by enough pressure from meat eating dinosaurs , that evolution favored concealment of confrontation as a means of survival .	-3.8649
But most contemporary animals using contour shading - think of deer , zebra , or belt animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey , which signals that this Nodosaur was exposed to a real struggle for survival .	-6.4750
" Strong predatory behavior on a massive , heavily armored dinosaur shows how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the chalk age must have been , " Brown said .	-3.9670
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was red brown .	-2.4195
Scientists continue to examine the animal for evidence of its life , including its preserved intestinal content , to find out what it has eaten as its last meal .	-4.3686
They believe that the dinosaur , when he died , ran into a river and was driven out into the sea , where he sank on his back to the seabed .	-5.4128
At that time , Alberta was as warm as South Florida today , and rivers and oceans probably spread far more inland than they are today .	-3.4365
" This Nodosaur is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin , but also remains in three dimensions and retains the original shape of the animal , " Brown said .	-5.5244
" The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as in the early Cretan period .	-4.0528
You do not need to use much imagination to reconstruct it ; if you shoot a little with your eyes , you might almost believe that it is sleeping . '	-5.4866
The chalk season was a time when huge theropods , carnivorous dinosaurs , standing on two legs , crossed the earth .	-4.5160
Although the king of them , the Tyrannosaurus Rex , lived millions of years after Borealopelta , the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his fearsome ancestors .	-3.1275
This includes the acrocanthosaurus , a 38 foot ( 11.5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters .	-4.4256
Scientists , whose latest findings appear in the current Biology journal , believe that Borealopelta was sank in the sea after death and mummified in mud .	-4.9409
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he grub on March 21 , 2011 at Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta , Canada .	-2.3454
According to the museum , it is the best preserved armored dinosaur of the world , including skin and armor , and is complete from snout to hip .	-3.3317
The creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,300 kg ) .	-6.7437
It contained two 20-inch long peaks that raged from its shoulders .	-4.4218
Researchers believe that the armored herbivores were swept through Western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea .	-4.9648
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur kept its armor in exquisite detail .	-2.3620
The fossilized remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the remains of the skin still cover bumpy tank plates along the dinosaur .	-3.6488
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic , such a level of conservation is as ' rare as a gain in the lottery .	-2.5734
The more I see it , the more confusing it becomes .	-1.8597
Auched remains of the skin still cover the bumpy tank plates that carry the animal 's skull .	-8.4942
His right forefoot is on his side , his five fingers are stretched upwards .	-3.7319
I can count the scales on his sole ' .	-1.3391
In the Storm : Mass Karambolage on A8 : Many injured	-3.8302
A serious accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : Nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carambolage .	-4.8107
There are many injured , kilometres of traffic jams and gaffer .	-3.2306
On the motorway Stuttgart-Munich ( A8 ) , about 20 people were injured on a mass carambleage on Thursday afternoon .	-4.4225
According to the first data from the police , about 5 p.m. between the connecting points Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen ( district of Aichach-Friedberg ) , almost 30 vehicles , including probably trucks , were interlinked during a thunderstorm .	-6.9931
The exact number of injured persons was initially not reported .	-4.3374
It is a matter of minor or minor injuries , said a police officer .	-5.0316
A large number of rescue vehicles were at the accident site .	-3.9959
The A8 has been completely locked in the direction of Munich .	-2.8673
In the direction of Munich there was a ten-kilometer long backlog .	-6.3778
As an AZ reporter reports , there were also massive obstacles on the opposite track - due to numerous gaffer .	-6.0040
The fire brigade took note of the characteristics of the vehicle drivers , who now face severe penalties .	-5.8073
Shortly after 18 : 45 a second accident took place on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and Dasing .	-2.8396
There was a collision between a car transporter and a car .	-3.7965
A rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .	-2.6374
Deutsche Bahn : Group tests " Comfort Check-in "	-1.8570
It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced before : nothing suspecting is sitting in the train and sleeping .	-5.4623
Or one is deepened in his work and has just a brilliant thought .	-3.8495
And then : pufff .	-0.9392
Come the conductor and awaken a soft or rips the passenger out of the workflow .	-6.9740
Ticket control .	-2.0134
But the periods of disruption are soon over .	-3.7283
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the creative-free ticket control system .	-8.7223
You simply confirm by mobile phone that you take your seat and devalue your ticket .	-4.9401
Currently , a test operation runs on two routes .	-3.3653
" If the offer arrives , we will extend it .	-6.6460
It will probably be available at the beginning of next year on many other long-distance routes in Germany , " said a train marsh .	-4.8846
" Comfort Check-in " is the name of the train for the ticket validation without the conductor .	-6.9222
In order to be able to use them , however , some requirements have to be met : you need a smartphone or a tablet .	-5.5112
And you have to book an online ticket - which most passengers already do .	-4.2312
You also have to buy it via the App of the train , the DB Navigator , which is the most convenient way to book your tickets .	-5.6274
Finally , you need a seat reservation .	-2.9587
Because the " comfort check-in " works like this : you get into the train , call your ticket under " My Tickets " .	-5.0536
A button for electronic validation will appear for test customers .	-4.4090
The train attendants receive a message on their mobile devices that passengers X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y .	-4.3070
When the train attendant arrives in place Y at the ticket control , he knows that there is a passenger with an already devalued online ticket .	-6.6642
You can therefore continue to sleep , continue working and remain silent .	-4.5790
The " check-in " has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should benefit the passengers .	-4.2200
" If you would like to travel relaxed without ticketing control through our train crew , simply check in the DB Navigator . . is . is . is . is . is . is	-9.5060
This allows passengers to personalise their travel time on the train , " says Michael Peterson , DB ’ s Marketing Board .	-4.9534
Second plus : " And our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs " .	-3.7091
Those who often travel by train know that , in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket controls are one of the main problems .	-6.0451
Because often you , but in any case one of your fellow travellers , do not have all the documents you need to validate online-tickets .	-6.7374
Either the credit card or ID card is missing or a document to be presented .	-5.9974
The result is endless discussions between train attendants and passengers , which leads to a bad mood in the abbey or in the larger area and delays in the control of your own ticket and ultimately takes the time for the conductor to take care of other concerns .	-7.8550
Only a small number of test customers can still use the new service .	-2.2719
And this only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund Strtgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen .	-3.6149
Further train numbers on the same route are not yet activated .	-6.6863
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question : " Who Streets ? "	-2.8587
On 9 August 2014 , Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core .	-2.5017
Only one day after she arrived in New York City , the geborene in St. Louis sat on the bed of an Airbnb apartment that she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone .	-4.1432
She stumbled over a post from someone in high school .	-2.0823
" The police have just killed an 18-year-old child , and it is still on the street , " they said .	-3.8705
Confused because nobody else had posted the information on their feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .	-3.5077
A user with the handle <unk> TheePharoah was constantly retweet on their timeline .	-3.5127
The rapper from the territory of St. Louis was there to tweet the death of Michael Brown , an unarmed black 18-year-old killed by a white policeman in Ferguson , Mon .	-4.2317
He posted an image of Brown ’ s lifeless body that was stretched out on the street and would remain there for four hours .	-4.5588
" That 's wild , " Ferrell thought .	-2.8354
But death was nothing new for them and their community .	-1.9187
She dropped her phone to return to tweets about people on Canfield Drive later in the evening .	-3.7947
There were photos of the police band and people shouting , and of a man who claimed to be Brown 's father who had a sign with the inscription : ' Ferguson 's police just killed my unarmed son ! '	-5.3079
She watched a live feed where a policeman stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a belling dog .	-3.2037
In another video , she said , another policeman escaped his gun and shouted : ' I will kill you ... animals all ' .	-3.7094
" This is not usual , " Ferrell remembered her statement .	-3.6490
'This is not the kind of murder to which we have become accustomed and which we can call typical ' .	-3.9489
At this moment I felt chilled .	-2.5613
I was angry and crying . '	-1.7684
She booked a return flight and went home the next day .	-1.4615
After landing at 11 p.m. , she took her 6-year-old daughter out of her father 's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning .	-4.5321
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the following three years is the theme of a new documentary film , " Who Streets ? " , in cinemas from the 11th century onwards .	-4.3832
It is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resilience that exists from the point of view of the people who live in the community and who have filled the streets to demand answers .	-3.9892
When Ferrell drove to Ferguson with her daughter , who wore a flower dress and a matching crown , they discussed a conversation that they had countless times before this morning » about the black experience and the black state <unk> .	-5.5007
" You remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe in ? " she remembered what she said .	-3.5837
" We are now going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that was not right .	-3.1042
I could not take them with me , " Ferrell said later .	-2.6990
" What happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .	-2.3319
She must know it and see it and be brought up in it .	-3.3496
It must be well developed , not only to know activism and organisation , but also the different strata of black experience and the black constitution , and what we must do to become free , to free ourselves .	-6.7872
Although I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she does not personally experience blatant racism , she is no different from the next black woman ’ s child .	-5.5031
I have the feeling that I would be doing her a disservice to keep her away from it . ' .	-6.4882
The first station , when she arrived in Ferguson , was on South Florissant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which became a camp area when the activists waited for the possible non-prosecution of Officer Darren Wilson .	-6.2145
There Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who had lunch .	-4.2351
They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators .	-2.6800
Slowly , a new type of activism for Ferrell began to take shape .	-2.0059
" My activism has changed completely after August 9 , " she said and noted that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities .	-4.3933
" I had no experience in organizing .	-1.5971
Everything has come . '	-1.6429
Weeks later Ferrell met during an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan , one of the co-directors of the film .	-3.2093
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to " document " what happened .	-2.0665
One question Ferrell asked was : ' Do you want to document or try to find a story you can exploit ? '	-4.2057
This skepticism was fueled by countless cases of people , often whites , in a community that benefited from pain and resilience .	-3.5399
As Folayan said in an interview recently , ' We had heard that people born and raised in Ferguson did not center their voices and we wanted to do it differently ' .	-3.9586
Folayan had already worked with the then co-director Damon Davis , an artist in the field known for his activism around death penalty passengers .	-4.9414
Ferrell 's involvement brought the project closer , and together with six other locals , the team of " Who Streets ? " followed in the years after Brown 's shooting .	-6.2805
" This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us , " Davis said .	-3.1558
" That was the main thing for me as these people are represented , because that is how I will be presented . "	-4.8797
The aim was not to focus on Ferrell 's experience - to show that the movement " is not a messiah leader , but a community that comes together , " said Folayan - it proved to be the most open participant in the film .	-4.2659
As a result , documents from " Who Streets ? " show surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell 's life as she falls in love with and marry her wife .	-3.9553
" I felt naked , " said Ferrell and laughed when she first saw the finished product .	-2.7826
" But I understand that there must be a degree of vulnerability in this work and in the dehumanization of black people . "	-4.5159
In addition , Ferrell ’ s story repeats the role of black gay women in the broader black-live matter movement .	-3.8757
Two of the three founders of the movement , who after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 marked the film " BlacklivesMatter " in social media , identify themselves as gay .	-3.8450
" Black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement as a whole , " said Ferrell , " and therefore we are constantly fighting on various fronts .	-4.9983
Black , gay women must bear the brunt of everything . '	-2.4811
Folayan agreed to note that ' the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women ' .	-3.1186
However , she insists that " this is not an affirmative type of action " , where Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity .	-4.7123
" She was the person who stirred up this energy , " she said .	-1.5837
" It is no coincidence , although she was at the front , because in a life at these crossings as a black gay woman so much is at stake .	-4.9002
You can feel your energy through the screen . '	-2.1519
The news cameras have long since disappeared in Ferguson , but the racial links between the community and the police continue to exist .	-4.1775
Ferrell is on probation for 2 <unk> years because of the blocking of a highway at a demonstration . . are . are .	-4.7134
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : " A Chaos " .	-3.2117
However , she clings to a song and feels committed to this memory since she took to the streets in Ferguson three years ago .	-4.9825
" It is our duty to fight for our freedom .	-0.9955
It is our duty to win .	-0.8875
We must love and support each other .	-1.3564
We have nothing to lose - except our chains . '	-2.0565
From " Dream " to " megalomania " : TV readers discuss Bit Gallery	-3.3546
The Bit Gallery moves people , although it is still far from being built .	-3.1172
But the idea of a shopping centre at the southern end of the pedestrian zone has divided the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .	-3.5468
Cold hardly makes the issue one .	-4.3489
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page " Volksfreund Bitburg " .	-2.5255
While some say to the Bit Gallery : " That would be a dream " ( Anja Becker ) or " That would be really great " ( Nicole Schauchen ) , it comes from the other side : " Do not need a person " ( Siggi Betzen ) or quite simply : " megalomania ! " ( Lars Scholz ) .	-5.5836
While proponents rely on a gallery to attract more customers into the city , which also benefits the rest of the business , opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will bleed out .	-7.1230
In addition , the gallery is planned on the site where the farmhouse market hall is located , where 13 direct marketers offer their products .	-5.6753
This will put an end to the construction work .	-3.7602
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to Beda Square with possibility to sit outside .	-3.8465
Simone Rooms : " We have been buying in the farmhouse market hall almost weekly for many years .	-4.1841
Most of all our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the rural women are always very happy .	-6.0569
We also discovered the butchery for ourselves .	-2.6123
We would like to see this offer maintained during and above all after the construction of the gallery .	-4.2842
Other cities do .	-3.1742
Especially the Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt is interesting . "	-2.5161
Gerd Densing : " Whether direct marketers locate themselves in a market hall in the gallery is up to the rent .	-4.4650
This should not be very low for the new project . '	-4.6197
Eva Kilic : " Why Shopping Palaces in Bitburg ?	-2.0205
Be it clothing , shoes , drugstores or supermarkets , I find that superfluous .	-4.6959
There is enough of this in our city .	-2.7138
You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .	-2.9902
However , since there is not even a proper weekly market here , it is all the more important that we at least retain the market hall .	-4.8813
After all , the goods offered there are fresh , are mostly offered directly by the producer and are also inexpensive .	-4.7909
As you can see , shops in a shopping centre are rented only by larger companies , because the rentals there are often not acceptable to a retailer .	-5.9795
It is a pity , there are almost no more special deals , and what is left of them will probably disappear . '	-7.5275
Wolf Fandel : " For me , a shopping centre with a market hall does not fit together .	-3.2980
And the gallery doesn 't fit into Bitburg .	-1.7011
Above all : Where should the farmhouse market hall go during the construction period ?	-5.0001
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long term , if the Bit Gallery actually comes .	-4.7477
Or does the ghost Bit Gallery already manage to sell all shops from Bitburg ? '	-4.3484
George Marquet : " That will simply not work .	-2.0255
And no one needs a shopping centre that is empty .	-2.2380
In my opinion , it would have been better to promote a real farm market , rather than this gallery .	-4.2474
However , thanks to the insane number of - I think - pointless construction projects in Bitburg , there is no room for a farmers ' market hall .	-6.7762
If the farmers ' market hall is destroyed , a piece of culture will disappear . '	-4.1557
A fitting similarity : artist creates portraits of Chelsea Mannings DNA	-4.9295
In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which are almost imperceptible - hanging on cables from the ceiling .	-4.2584
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupferter and Haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning .	-3.8546
Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison , where the former intelligence analyst served a 35-year prison sentence after making diplomatic reports on the WikiLeaks site publicly classified as secret .	-5.1501
The new exhibition , which was opened on 2 August , is called A Becoming Resemblance .	-4.3952
She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg , whose discipline combined their expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Manning , a transgender and pioneering dissident , whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in office .	-5.3677
Through the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted by Manning and created from the 30 portraits , how someone could look with these genomic data , Dewey-Hagborg has created a sharp , though somewhat intellectual commentary not only on the formability of DNA data - the many ways in which they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of this interpretation - but also on identity .	-6.2521
Manning , born as Bradley Edward , but has been openly talking about identification as a woman since her puberty , was convicted of 20 charges in 2013 , including six violations of the spying law , computer fraud , and theft .	-5.1780
Through the prison her image was suppressed , so much so that there was only one photograph - a grainy , black-and-white selfishness , in which Manning was visibly sitting on a driver 's seat and wearing a plating wig - with which she was associated .	-7.7405
In 2015 , Dewey-Hagborg came from the great success of her 2012-project ' Stranger Visions ' .	-3.1384
In it , the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artefacts such as cigarette dumplings and chewing gum by extracting DNA from waste to produce an image of what these people might look like .	-5.1047
That was when she received an email from a newspaper magazine .	-3.0383
" They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , " said Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition .	-6.2486
And she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed , so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .	-4.3921
The artist and her imprisoned muse became unequal friends of letters , which exchanged several letters over the course of two years .	-6.5921
They even created a comic " Suppressed Images " , illustrated by Shoili Kanungo , which foresaw a future in which President Chelsea 's judgment would be transformed and it would be able to see the exhibition in person .	-5.6074
Indeed , just a few days after the book was published , Obama would demand Manning ’ s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome form of happy meeting .	-4.0546
There is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Trump is waging a war against whistleblowers from the government camp and transgender troops to find new , tweetable ways to further inflame the rigid divisions that he was supposed to fix .	-5.9033
When Dewey Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said that " things happen for a certain reason " .	-3.3011
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Manning asked for an end to the " automatic fragmentation , the basis of which was gender , race , sexuality and culture . "	-5.1324
On the opposite wall , her mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandfeet of Cs and Gs and As , is written in pencil .	-4.5777
Dewey-Hagborg hoped , by incorporating the 200 letters ( or nucleotides according to the artist ’ s advanced scientific lexicon ) , to show how astonishingly similar , at least in biological terms , we are all .	-4.5961
" What people will hopefully take with them is that our genome does not care about who we are and how open genetic data are for an interpretation and how subjective they are , " said Dewey-Hagborg , whose video work of 2007 , Spurious Memories , is also visible .	-5.0615
" DNA data can tell so many different stories , so these are 30 of these stories . "	-2.7168
The last part of the exhibition , which is kept in its own room , is a page from the aforementioned comic novella .	-4.6550
She shows Manning how she appears with a hands-free phone in her hand from the disciplinary barracks of the United States like King Kong .	-4.7391
" When they call your speech , they won , " it says .	-4.6180
'Never stop your mouth ' .	-3.2783
" It came directly from a letter she wrote to me , " said the artist , from Philadelphia .	-3.8193
'I still get goose bumps when I talk about it ' .	-2.9550
Manning has not yet personally seen the exhibition - as predicted in the comic book - but if it should do so , it will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks , by their own genomic simulacrums , which are joined together like hordes of protesters .	-6.9183
This was also targeted , like everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 " 2 , Mannings Statur ) , where their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil .	-5.9412
" In the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , " said Dewey-Hagborg of the portraits .	-2.7795
" I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement that was also behind its liberation . "	-3.8123
Professor Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford University sought for murder .	-3.9067
A nationwide human hunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an Oxford University employee who is sought as suspects after a man was stabbed with deadly injuries in a luxurious apartment in Chicago .	-5.5257
On Monday , arrest warrants were issued for Wyndham Lathem ( 42 ) and Andrew Warren ( 56 ) for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell Duranleau , as evidenced by the files of Cook County ’ s Local Court .	-4.8712
The documents say that Cornell Duranleau , 26 , died after several stitches .	-2.0571
A common warning system , published by the Chicago Police Authority , states that the corpse was discovered on July 27 . were . were . were . were	-5.5409
Officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries on his body .	-2.2008
Cornell Duranleau was declared dead in the place of the event , and detectives investigate the stitches as murder , while the police actively seek the two suspects , officials said .	-4.7054
Lateem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007 .	-2.7669
Alan K. Cubbame , Vice President for University Relations , said in an email statement that Lathem was now in custody and was excluded from entering the Northwestern University campus .	-6.0804
" This is now a criminal matter investigated by the competent authorities , and Northwestern University cooperates with this investigation , " said Cubbag .	-4.2900
Warren is a Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University .	-2.1944
A spokesman for the University and Somerville College said in an email statement that ' we are in contact with the UK police and ready to help the US investigation authorities in every way possible ' .	-5.4375
The statement added that Warren ’ s colleagues were shocked and want him to stand up .	-4.6044
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Agency , Anthony Guglielmi , said that he urged the suspects to face up to the authorities .	-3.7060
" The police have an idea of their place of residence , and our efforts to locate them are intensifying , " Guglielmi said .	-3.4665
Guglielmi said that local , regional , and national authorities are helping to find the suspects .	-2.1264
Guglielmi said that the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received a mysterious tip saying that something had happened in apartment 1008 .	-4.0824
The police described the scene as very cruel .	-0.9714
Guglielmi said that it was unclear whether the incident had also taken place on 27 July .	-3.2434
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building .	-2.9816
" We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship , " Guglielmi said .	-1.9566
The Grand Plaza management team issued a statement to the residents : ' The police are currently working on the timeline and the background of the victim and exploring a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . '	-4.8772
" We will close the WADA road map in the near future " - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko	-3.1371
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that it will not take long for the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) to be implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency ( RUSATA ) .	-3.5584
" At a certain stage of fulfilling the criteria of the roadmap , RUSADA has been granted the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD ( UK Anti-Doping ) .	-4.0687
The WADA timetable has been updated in this respect , " said Mutko on Thursday .	-2.9624
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA roadmap for compliance with the code describing the criteria for the reinstatement of RUSADA and recently published on the organization 's website .	-5.2297
According to Mutko , it does not contain anything that could give Russia cause for concern .	-3.1419
" Everything has been announced , everything is being implemented .	-2.4149
And the results will be submitted to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and the WADA in the near future , " he added .	-1.8244
One of the criteria mentioned in the list , however , states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the WADA approved investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sports .	-4.3562
As far as the matter is concerned , Mutko said : ' We are carrying out the investigation because our anti-doping system has admitted a mistake .	-4.5007
All measures have been implemented .	-1.4034
But there were no state programmes and we will not admit anything that does not exist . '	-3.3306
Mutko ’ s words were consistent with those of Vitaly Smirnov , the head of the independent Russian Anti-Doping Commission .	-3.6292
In talks with the Russian branch RSport at the beginning of the day , Smirnov admitted problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organisations , but then added : " We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .	-4.8808
No one intends to accept this report unconditionally , " said Smirnov .	-2.8585
RULADA was excluded from the implementation of doping controls in Russia in November 2015 as part of the WADA doping scandal .	-5.4403
However , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping ( UKAD ) .	-2.2447
After a visit to Moscow in July , WADA General Manager Olivier Niggli explained that RUSADA is moving " in the right direction " in order to be reinstated .	-5.8343
Aldi no longer sells eggs .	-3.0550
This was shared by the business groups .	-2.7391
It was a mere precaution that no health impairment could be assumed , as the communication stated .	-6.0718
From now on , only eggs are likely to be delivered to Aldi , which have been proven to have been tested negatively on fipronic antiluxes .	-7.3908
Aldi wants to create clarity and transparency for its customers .	-4.0146
Start-ups that will help your company not to become the next user .	-3.3732
Amy Eratt wanted to measure the happiness of your employees on your e-commerce startup , but the surveys did not work .	-5.0753
Answers were often vague , unhelpful , or even worse fraudulent .	-2.5318
And even if you promised anonymity , some workers did not trust the process .	-1.9179
" There was simply never consistency and objectivity , " said Eratt , who runs the 75 person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Company Madison Reed .	-3.5996
She called people from outside for help .	-3.1496
A new Human Resources Startups race is growing to help businesses find out how their employees feel .	-3.0631
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee involvement , it enables companies to conduct surveys , address specific groups and demographic groups , provide employees with anonymity and complaints hotlines , and in some cases allows whistleblowers to bypass the C-Suite executives and directly contact the board .	-5.5292
" You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health , but where is the fit for your company ? " said Jim Barnett , co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement .	-3.9569
Erratt said that she won a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint .	-3.9811
In addition to snap-surveys and surveys by certain teams , it offers a corporate heat card that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which executives have low approval results - so you can check why .	-5.7985
Companies come to see that they must remain at the top of the workplace culture , so that you are not the next Uber to be involved in scandals since a former employee published a blog post describing an environment of harassment in which those who spoke were punished .	-5.5068
For start-ups like Glint , this wish for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity .	-3.1107
The global governance , regulation , and compliance industry could have more than $ 118.7 billion worth in 2020 , according to the Let 's Talk Payments financial website .	-3.8784
Denver , Colorado , Start-up Convercent , which helps companies to prevent and recognize bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity early this year amid the Uber case in discredit .	-3.2929
Convercent has almost 600 clients , including Airbnb , Microsoft and Tesla .	-1.6498
Uber has recently registered as a client .	-2.0427
Like Glint , Convercent lets companies send tailored " pulse " surveys , collect confidential responses in real time and view the heat cards of your problem areas .	-4.7821
It also provides an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior .	-3.2003
And if the Chief Executive Officer is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .	-2.5340
" The court of public opinion has captured the regulators , " said Patrick Quinlan , the founder and CEO of Convercent .	-3.5747
When a company is found that treats its employees badly or behaves unethically , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycotts , workers ’ flight , and lawsuits , Quinlan said .	-7.2049
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations , has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and a simple way to reach their corporate headquarters .	-4.2247
Previously , when an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .	-4.8501
It was often a form of intimidation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vitrano , Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel , who said there was no good way to follow the complaints of staff .	-3.9715
Now that the company is using Convercent , problems previously hidden by leaders who sat in offices in cities or states , such as discrimination , harassment or unfair practices , can be identified and addressed more quickly .	-5.9048
" I can get closer to this holistic , 360-degree view of experience with employment , " said Vitrano , who leads the Risk Management Group at Ruby Tuesday .	-4.3523
" And we protect our shareholders from employment and litigation . "	-3.1024
Companies began to take ethics , values , and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 , after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations by the Enron scandal , Quinlan said .	-3.5610
But it took until the " social media came to their right " that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry from going online .	-4.3089
" Before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , " he said .	-1.4826
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service and charge companies with recurring fees for using their products .	-3.8263
It is a business model and an opportunity that finds the approval of venture capital investors who supported both start-ups .	-4.1520
Convercent received $ 10 million in financing in February from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital , raising the total capital to $ 47 million .	-3.2585
Glitzern secured $ 10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November , bringing total funding to $ 60 million .	-3.1687
These investments are hardly surprising , given the interconnected nature of companies , culture , and venture capital .	-2.7133
There is a growing set of research that shows that today 's employees expect more from their jobs than they have done so far .	-4.7832
In competitive markets like Silicon Valley , high salaries and interesting projects are only stakes .	-2.2001
The employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .	-3.8237
" If people are happy to be in a company that has their voices heard , and that the work you do is worthwhile , then they feel more committed to making this company successful , " said Nina McQueen , Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn , which uses both Convercent and Glint .	-4.7923
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies are running well , and companies are doing well when employees work and are committed .	-6.2131
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase the commitment and commitment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .	-4.5870
The data on employee engagement according to the experts of the workplace culture important .	-3.9852
But the data are useless if the managers of a company do not take action .	-3.7803
In fact , when a company asks staff for your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way .	-3.2539
And if change does not come quickly enough , or at all , it can create disappointments and discourage employees .	-4.7271
" If you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be ready to have 4,000 talks , " said Russell Raath , President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kotter International , who has seen companies that have relied too much on collecting data .	-4.7251
" Because if you do not follow will employees wonder , " Did you really hear me ?	-3.3243
Do you care about this ?	-2.4822
And who you do not care about , why should I ? '	-2.9620
Madison Reed , who is now carrying out monthly employee surveys , was able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported on Glint , says Erfurt .	-4.5842
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees , it was able to reorganize several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems .	-4.6553
At Ruby Tuesday , the company is getting new insights into its employees , and it hopes that in the long run , this will lead to a better binding of workers in an industry that is known for high sales .	-6.1096
" If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , " Vitrano said .	-2.1159
" And if you lose people , you also lose customers .	-1.8432
And if you lose customers , you will lose companies .	-2.3160
The NCAA eliminates the two-day practice and makes a long day for the Bruins	-6.5716
At 11 : 00 p.m. , a lot of UCLA football players are chatting on one side of the team 's new training fields on the campus .	-6.3935
Some have removed their jersey parts and show their back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .	-3.2399
For a good part of the team , these idle minutes are a lunch break .	-2.9011
Players enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final exams after the three-hour exercise before returning to the Wasserman Football Center at 6 : 30 the next morning .	-5.0429
" This is a real tread for the guys for the next three days , " said Bruins-Trainer Jim Mora just before Monday became Tuesday .	-4.0415
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the load of players , and it has actually extended its days - at least until the final on Friday .	-3.3562
Therefore , the first three training sessions of the UCLA should start at 19 : 15 in order to meet the players ’ already completed schedules .	-6.1143
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins postponed the start of the camp almost a week after the last season , and for the first time during the summer school six times during Moras playing in Westwood .	-5.8380
They are expected to perform 18 exercises during August , 20 before the formal preparations for their start against Texas A & M in September .	-5.6839
Mora said that he supported the rule change of the NCAA , even if they add another point to players ’ busy routes .	-5.4911
" We put this enormous burden on them three or four days , and it is very challenging , " said Mora .	-3.1473
" And they just pushed it through , they continue to plagiarize , they are great people .	-5.7808
I think that as soon as we reach Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . '	-4.1710
The UCLA will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished , which will not be an easy task , given the clear lines of view of its fields from an adjacent car park and the adjacent Luskin Center , a high-class hotel that has already been run with footballs that cleared a safety net behind a gate post .	-7.6255
Bruin players are supposed to occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mora admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .	-4.6104
" We will use our security , " said Mora .	-2.2009
" This is a real problem , and it 's not far away to think that people there rent a room and then adjust to record an exercise .	-6.0538
If you have the video tape of an exercise , it is quite a good business .	-3.0514
But we have security forces there and we have security forces in parking 8 .	-5.5568
We will do the best with what we have .	-1.3888
I am therefore not too concerned .	-3.0435
We have a plan . '	-0.9039
Facebook wants to intensify fact-finding in the fight against fake news .	-3.9904
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with fake reports to third-party fake auditors and then display their results under the original post , said the world ’ s largest online social network on Thursday .	-6.7842
The company said in an opinion on its website that it will start using updated machine learning methods to detect potential false reports and send them to fact-checking officers who may display results of the fact-checking from the original article .	-6.9315
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main distributional points for so-called fake news , many of which believe that they have also influenced the 2016 US presidential election .	-3.7411
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with French voters being flooded with false stories in the run-up to the May presidential election , and Germany supporting a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to quickly eliminate hate-filled postings , as they did before the September elections .	-5.6421
On Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new fact-checking will be launched in the US , France , the Netherlands and Germany .	-3.6395
" Besides knowing which stories are challenged by third-party auditors , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , " said Sara Su , product manager for Facebook news on a blog .	-5.0463
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature for the " related article " and work on other changes to its news feed to reduce false messages .	-3.9779
Making a comic novel : A Castle in the History of England	-2.3104
In his recent past , Scotney Castle was seen in a Squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s .	-4.1171
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cosy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent , and has now become the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes , a mophaari Yorkshire with a love for historical documents .	-5.5971
" I find it so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years , " he says woefully .	-3.3520
'What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand ' .	-2.9420
A Castle in England spans the period from the Middle Ages to the Edward Age and documents the families that lived in Scotland .	-4.9316
It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive : he wrote ' Dead Men 's Teeth and Other Stories ' in 2014 , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he unexpectedly found emotionally .	-3.7626
" I only responded to the thumbprint on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700 's who worked for the Jakobiner , " he says .	-4.6129
" That is his thumb !	-1.6300
And letters always cried for smoke , because at that time a fire was ignited because of light .	-5.9367
For someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he were there himself .	-4.1655
Oh , I love archives ! '	-1.2110
For someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council of England and lived in a castle for nearly four months ( " To be honest : I have a little overvalued my welcome greeting " ) , all this seems too good to be true .	-6.0942
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian " new " castle , seeing the archives and studying the castle 's many treasures and curiosities , such as the mounted hyen heads on the walls and the bottles that had been buried for centuries .	-5.2122
He walked through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle and talked to landscape guards , gardeners and sometimes to the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .	-5.1101
Then , at night he drank " whiskey and began to write " .	-1.5764
The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown , as the National Trust only received full access in 2006 when the last heir , Elizabeth Hussey , died .	-4.0248
When Rhodes arrived a decade later , the employees just started to look after the archive , which he described as " hundreds of years in which aristocrats said " Oh , put it on the attic " .	-4.9693
Diaries , letters from the English Empire era , maps that show who had what : " You might think that land conflicts would be boring , " says Rhodes , " but there was a birch that two families fought for .	-5.6358
Guys , let everything go its way ! '	-2.1596
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point for a broader immersion into English history , including ' The Labourer ' , followed by a man leaving the newly built castle to join the 1381 peasant uprising .	-5.8500
" There is a record of a revolt that occurred in the castle in 1380 , in this book entitled ' Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex ' , says Rhodes .	-3.4807
" The farm uprising began in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start .	-3.0307
Perhaps the two are connected ? '	-2.4152
Other stories are deeply rooted in the history of the castle , such as ' The Priest ' , which tells the story of Jesuit priest who the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation .	-4.3330
Or ' The Smuggler ' , which depicts the smuggler Arthur Darrell from the 18th century , who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones ( a discovery made only years later when his coffin was excavated ) .	-3.9849
The Darrells are Rhodes ' favorite family of Scotney : " The lords seemed to be quite Gauls , keep borrowing and spend money on things they could not afford .	-5.9865
Other generations of Darrell men resolved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well-looking boys , with a talent to recruit heirs . '	-4.6130
After finishing his mission in the castle , Rhodes is in search of other unique writing experiences .	-4.7611
He spent two weeks in the Finnish wilderness on a comic novel about Elämmäki , the site of an early 20th century sanatorium that has since been reclaimed by nature .	-5.2017
But Scotney has a special place for him .	-1.6267
" I was sad to go again , " he says .	-1.4237
It was like : ' Oh , now I have to deal with the damned life again ' .	-3.6065
Launched campaign : Over 300 years old Marian Chapel in Rhöndorf	-4.7949
With the revelation of the 301 year old Marian Chapel in Rhöndorf , the city of Bad Honnef started its campaign on Friday to introduce a new roof brand ( Rundschau from Thursday ) .	-5.3322
Until Thursday Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and slogan secret .	-4.9917
At the end of August there will be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth as the highlight of the campaign .	-4.2299
" Too good for us .	-2.0165
Or ? " , the actors of the action ask since yesterday on the posters at the Rhöndorfer Chapel .	-7.2965
" We don 't really think that , " they write on their website that was released yesterday .	-5.2769
" But we use this measure to attract your attention .	-1.6156
And to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .	-2.5720
Basically , we firmly believe that as a citizen of Bad Honnefer , we know very well about the beauty and attractiveness of our city . '	-4.7386
The action is about more than " just " a logo and a slogan , it goes on .	-4.0972
" It is important to formulate a single promise , one that gives the city a unique unique position " .	-6.2031
After all , it is in competition with other municipalities .	-2.2247
The city of Bad Honnef can be proud of its new roof brand and campaign .	-5.3019
Turkey ’ s Military Reform – Erdogan ’ s Fear of the Army	-2.0113
Every year at the beginning of August in Ankara , the Chief Military Council ( YAS ) advises on retirement and promotion in the officer corps .	-5.4959
So , too , this week .	-2.5962
At first glance a normal procedure .	-2.3764
But nothing is routine with the Turkish forces one year after the coup attempt .	-2.6412
The meeting was no longer held in the General Staff building , as in the past , but in the Prime Minister 's office .	-4.5362
The five Vice-Presidents and the Ministers for Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs also took part in the discussions under the Presidency of the Prime Minister .	-6.1945
As a result , the majority of the civilians in the YAS were .	-4.4256
The government is pulling the gun in the military .	-3.0596
Hulusi Akar , Chief of Staff , remains in office , but the commanders of the army , the air force and the navy were dismissed .	-8.0521
Since the failed coup , head of state , Erdogan , has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals . have been .	-4.0811
More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the army , mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the exiled preacher Fethullah Gülen , whom Erdogan sees as the leader of the coup attempt .	-4.9763
A total of 486 people who were to be directly involved in the coup attempt have been negotiated in Ankara since this week .	-5.6519
Already the day after the coup , Erdogan had called the coup attempt a " gift of God , " because he gave him the opportunity to " completely clean " the armed forces .	-5.5502
But does Erdogan really have the army under control ?	-1.8651
At the end of February , the newspaper " Hürriyet " published an article entitled " Unease in Military Headquarters " .	-3.2001
In general , there are concerns about an increasing " Islamization " of the army , which is manifested , among other things , in the lifting of the ban on headscarves for soldiers , the newspaper wrote .	-5.6624
In any case , the big deal with the army and the security forces continues .	-5.0310
In mid-July , Erdogan ordered another 7395 officials to be fired by decree , including 2303 police officers and 546 soldiers .	-4.0752
Erdogan seemed to have tamed the military .	-2.9258
The generals were seen earlier than the real masters of the country .	-3.6297
Three times , they putted on the basis of their role as guardians of the secular state order .	-5.5238
After winning in 2002 , Erdogan pushed back military power step by step , not least by invoking the European Union ’ s reform agenda .	-4.7630
Former officers say that Erdogan is deliberately pushing ahead with Islamization of the armed forces .	-4.7259
In the magazine " Vocal Europe " , a non-named officer who sought asylum for fear of persecution abroad warned that the Turkish army would be " full of extremists and Salafists " in a few years ' time .	-5.3640
If that happens , such a development could not leave NATO cold .	-3.7591
In any case , after the purges , there are doubts in the alliance about the Turkish army 's readiness to intervene .	-5.4043
NATO diplomats say that leadership structures and operational capabilities are ' weakened ' .	-3.3121
Washington Modifies the Green Card Rules	-2.6556
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Trump , quoted by the media .	-2.2642
It provides for legal immigrants to be reduced to 50,000 per year , stricter rules for obtaining visas for temporary work permits and restrictions on family visas .	-4.3911
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the president .	-1.7229
The bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .	-2.5415
" This law will reduce poverty , increase wages , and save billions of dollars for taxpayers , and will do so by changing the way Green Cards are issued to citizens from other countries . "	-3.6170
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .	-1.3832
This new application procedure will benefit candidates who speak English who have the financial resources to support themselves and to show knowledge that will benefit our economy , " Trump said , quoted by the American media .	-4.7612
Ministry wants to rehabilitate circuit for racetrack .	-6.1960
Over the last few months we have been arguing about the future of the racetrack dog - now it is going to be very fast .	-7.8328
Before the end of the year it is planned to build on the rough stretch on which the tourist railway runs .	-6.4100
According to the Ministry of Transport , construction work on the track will start this year in order to secure the future of the racetrack hut in the long term .	-6.3610
" By deciding to continue to order and renovate the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route , the country is committed to this connection , which is particularly important for tourism , " declared Secretary of State Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt .	-9.3483
He estimated the cost of repairing the route to around EUR 2.5 million .	-4.6786
The country takes over 75 % of this sum .	-3.8658
The contract , on the basis of which the shuttle will continue to be ordered by the country , is being finally voted on , Sühl explained .	-6.2437
The Ministry and the Südthuringen Railway as operators are already agreed on the technical details .	-3.9406
" The road map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are thus negotiated , " said Sühl .	-3.8520
The planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be concluded for eleven years .	-3.2117
The Rennsteig-Shuttle was scheduled to be ordered in December 2017 .	-4.8328
The Rennsteig-Shuttle is a popular railway connection between the Ilmenau and Rennsteig stations , especially for .	-4.2313
In the last few months , a pilot operation has been carried out to test whether the track is used by enough people to order it regularly in the future .	-6.5180
The route is also very difficult in parts .	-5.1983
The rise of sex robots is real , and we should worry .	-1.6024
Just when you thought it could not get even more crazy in 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots comes .	-4.8845
Yes , indeed .	-1.1264
Sex-robots are a big thing at the moment .	-2.9428
Recently , the Foundation for Responsible Robotics ( FRR ) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years .	-2.1098
According to Noel Sharkey , an emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR , we need to start taking their rise seriously .	-5.2229
Customers can choose the robot ’ s eye color , the shape of the chest and the type of finger nail .	-4.4602
" People are making fun of them , but the companies are providing a lot of it , and we will see it much more often , " said Mr Sharkey when he published his new report .	-7.8866
Modern sex dolls have developed from their inflatable partners into robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with deliberately human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence .	-4.1325
The user can " customize " his robot according to his or her convictions , choosing everything from the robot 's eye color to the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails .	-5.8478
But it becomes even more worrying , as many robots have the " personalities " who would make a Stepford woman look progressive .	-3.9724
Modern sex puppets have developed into robots with a silicone skin .	-6.8511
The RealBotix robot , for example , allows its users to adapt their robots to the characteristics they find appealing , such as shyness .	-6.2344
And then there is the Roxxxy Gold sex robot , developed by True Companion , with pre-programmed personalities such as " Frigid Farrah " , which gives the impression of shyness and " Wild Wendy " with an " adventurous " personality .	-4.8022
" Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is as well adapted to your personality as possible , " swoops the website of True Companion .	-4.8234
So she likes what you like , and she doesn 't like what you don 't like , etc .	-2.4735
She has her moods during the day - just like real people !	-3.1557
She can be tired , fixated on conversation or she can be " in mood " !	-3.8759
There are many worrying aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relations - but the submissive female characteristics , the allusions to rape , when one takes a step towards Frigid ( that is , revolting ) Farrah , worry one most .	-6.4064
On his website True Companion compared Roxxxy with a vibrator , but for men .	-2.3061
" If women ( sic ) can have a vibrator , why can men not have Roxxxy ? " says the website .	-3.6661
But these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy .	-3.1275
Their emergence and their increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture , a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with subjugation as an optional addition .	-4.5255
Of course , most men will not hold sex robots , and while the FRR looks at their growing popularity , they remain temporarily on the verge of consumer culture .	-5.7839
But what leaks out of the peripheral zones can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time we live in .	-3.9868
And many people are not strange or offensive until the free market gives them permission to do so .	-2.3036
There is a certain overlap that these advanced sex robots appear at a time when women ’ s rights are under threat worldwide , when there is a president in the White House who has been blaming for having sexually attacked women .	-5.8182
The most dissuasive aspect of the television series ' The Handmaid 's Tale ' ( ' The Report of the Magd ' ) is not the graphic images , the twisted bodies and the exposed eyes , but how realistic this vision works .	-5.3515
The Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap .	-2.8590
The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as possible ( albeit with pornostar proportions ) .	-4.0614
Their builders want them to feel human , to imitate the movement of a real body .	-2.7562
But , to the point when it comes to their " personalities " , robots are not real women .	-3.7393
You cannot separate or just walk away from your pet .	-3.9267
They have no mediation or background history , nothing that indicates independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total subjugation .	-4.6128
In other words , they are fake slaves .	-2.9987
Or , to put it in 2017 , girls of service .	-4.5284
Trump ’ s Great Performance ?	-1.1764
He makes Mitt Romney the embodiment of common sense .	-2.2041
It has become a truncation of the Trump era that the political divisions that polarized the US electorate have also divided small families .	-4.2911
Around Christmas and Harvest Day , US newspapers gave advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump ’ s electing relatives .	-5.0020
We are all supposedly trying to let our filter bubbles burst .	-4.6848
Less noticed has been Trump ’ s power to bring families together .	-2.5627
I mention this because my cousin , a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Republicans in our family , visited me this week in New York .	-3.5267
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .	-1.8626
With Trump in the White House , everyone she knows , including the Republican affinity with which she fought for decades for politics , is suddenly and uniquely on the same side .	-4.3912
That is certainly a good thing about the dining table , but it strikes me in another context that this also entails considerable risks .	-5.2734
The left has been strengthened by Trump , but his presidency ’ s disfiguring effect has the strength to push us all to the right .	-3.5996
When we talk about ' normalization ' and Trump , we are referring to the gruesome possibility that one day his manners will not turn us off .	-6.4191
But there is an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump “ normalizes ” right-wing Republicans , who suddenly appear to be the embodiment of rationality when compared to his standards .	-5.3295
Today , I find myself preoccupied with an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney ’ s bizarre version of the madman – the car roof dog , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax declaration looked ) – both of which , compared to Trump , are indeed very mild crimes .	-7.9171
When Trump goes , the next Republican candidate must be only mentally healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement .	-3.5395
When my cousin was in the city , we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park , the largest of New York ’ s carousels , and the best $ 3 you can spend in the city if you don ’ t need caffeine .	-5.6965
The horses are huge , the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are knee-jerk and the animals are twisted to look over their own shoulders with fear - extremely dark and the clipping music conveys this in a strange way .	-7.1340
So many clichés of a city disappoint : the views of high buildings become old , the skyline become too familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city does not live up to the dream .	-4.3115
Thirty-five years later , and I am still not completely over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage - the theme job Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a large roundabout in north London .	-5.4350
The Central Park carousel , however , is still a strange magical experience , as two two-year , one 11-year old and two women can go on it in the 40 ’ s and all have a great time .	-7.2270
If I could have assessed the carousel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately nobody asked for it .	-3.6418
On the other hand , this week in a department store , I was forced to evaluate my " experience " with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could get through my credit card .	-4.5243
In the coffeehouse at the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option of matching the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something over the shop table .	-5.1594
This not only slows down what should be a neutral exchange , but also puts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no one is needed .	-4.4668
The poor woman in the department store stood exculsively grinning , while I was tired of the experience of extending her five-star credit card .	-6.5390
Oscar Pistorius with Breast Paints from Prison to Hospital	-5.2553
Pistorius left prison for a hospital visit for the second time .	-2.4596
Last year , he was brought to hospital for the treatment of cuts on his wrists , according to the prison authorities , after a fall in his cell .	-4.7234
Pistorius was convicted of murder following an appeal by prosecutors against a first death sentence .	-4.3033
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine ’ s Day in 2013 by shooting her several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria .	-4.2365
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a nightly intruder hiding in the cabin .	-3.3948
The prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six-year prison sentence of Pistorius , which they say is too lenient .	-3.6784
The National Prosecutor said that she would appeal to the South African Supreme Court and that the appeal could be heard this year .	-3.9823
Pistorius runs the risk of his punishment being increased to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful .	-3.5357
There is no death penalty in South Africa .	-0.8993
When Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg	-1.9697
As the last of the Blumberger schools , the Viertklässler were discharged from Fützen and Epfenhofen during the holidays and in secondary schools .	-5.4515
Three of the school pupils will go to high school and four to secondary school .	-6.2938
School Director Angelika Sitte welcomed parents and representatives of the public at the Bürgerhaus Biesental in Epfenhofen on Tuesday evening .	-3.9598
As a symbol of school leaving , the 29 pupils of the four classes , led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder , chose a young eagle who grows up in the chicken farm but is then released into freedom .	-5.5336
This was followed by a musical called " Der Adler im Hünnerhof auf " .	-5.4110
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg , and let it erupt from his hens .	-4.9209
Instead of a chicken cucumber a little eagle came out .	-2.7459
But the hope of turning him into a chicken crumbled , the eagle spread his wings on a high mountain and disappeared .	-5.1522
Then the classes three and four showed a chicken dance in the stud of Yvonne Frank .	-3.8280
The hens danced with the young gockles who wore cylinders to the bet .	-2.7982
The eagle stands for integration , said school leader Angelika Sitte .	-3.5151
The kitten is different from the other kittens , but it belongs to it .	-4.5052
But he will never be like a chicken .	-1.8125
Its provision is to be free .	-2.2588
She wanted every four plaintiff to feel accepted in his new school .	-4.8363
It was followed by thanks to the colleagues , the former head of the school Michael Müller , who repeatedly jumps in to school bottlenecks , and the parents .	-8.8725
The chick 's time is over , Sophia Schumacher explained .	-5.1893
They don 't let their students off after two years of teaching because it was a really great time .	-6.1302
In the end she was able to rely on the four klässler .	-4.8236
In the end , all students heard a song of summer and holiday time .	-5.5943
The children enjoyed it .	-4.4506
Eight first class students have already registered for the new school year .	-3.9948
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece	-1.4302
Two Bulgarians were imprisoned for illegal camps in Greece , informed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted by television .	-2.9267
On the morning of 1 August , a group of illegally camping people , including the two Bulgarians , was arrested by the police in Sithonia .	-3.9458
On the same day , they were released while an investigation is under way .	-3.0186
The State Department reported bTV that the Bulgarians were later released .	-2.9022
The Greek authorities have tightened control of free camping and impose substantial fines on anyone found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose .	-5.3667
The controls continue throughout the season .	-2.6092
The ministry said that the court can impose a fine .	-2.0169
Software update for diesel vehicles : What the stakeholders need to know now .	-3.6654
How exactly does the software update take place ?	-1.7213
Do diesel drivers have to participate in the action ?	-3.8585
Overview of the most important questions and answers .	-1.5766
At the Diesel Summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars .	-2.6413
They are intended to improve the exhaust behaviour of cars in the emission classes Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 .	-5.8189
Euro-4 diesel or worse are excluded .	-2.5888
Anja Smetanin from ACE Auto Club Europa gives assessments :	-2.6525
Is the new action mandatory ?	-1.2222
No , the negotiated software updates are voluntary .	-1.5671
" The mandatory updates previously apply only to the vehicles that have Schumann software , " says Anja Smetanin .	-5.1062
Their retrofit has been ordered by the Federal Government of the Automotive Industry ( KBA ) .	-6.8090
How and when are customers informed about updates ?	-2.7120
The manufacturers have announced a speedy implementation in the coming months , but have not yet given a precise date .	-4.8110
Daimler has informed everyone concerned about this .	-4.1119
If an inspection is due in any case , it will be done within the scope of the inspection .	-3.9100
How long should the whole retrofit take ?	-4.6150
" Hard to say , " says Smetanin .	-2.5076
This depends on the commitment of the manufacturers and political pressure .	-2.7973
" We have seen that car manufacturers do not act voluntarily on the subject of the environment . "	-5.0390
How long should the update take ?	-1.4645
The conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .	-3.4459
It may be more time-consuming to get an appointment .	-3.4964
What do drivers who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group do ?	-2.7470
The ACE advises you to wait .	-2.6943
According to Smetanin , foreign manufacturers would probably follow suit .	-4.0189
Is there a massive fall in the price of Euro 4 cars ?	-3.5927
The ACE fears this .	-2.0047
However , it is precisely in the regions where driving bans are threatening .	-4.4334
There has been no loss of value for older diesel in rural areas .	-3.3903
The ACE advises you to wait for a sale .	-3.0182
LL Cool J gets Kennedy Center Award	-2.2700
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington .	-1.1833
The first award ceremony under President Trump promises to become political .	-3.0126
One of the winners does not want to come - in protest .	-2.2808
LL Cool J ( 49 ) is the first rapper to receive one of the coveted awards from the renowned Kennedy Center . are .	-3.1869
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday , this year also singer Gloria Estefan ( 59 ) , Lionel Richie ( 68 ) , choreographer Carmen de Lavallade ( 86 ) and TV producer Norman Lear ( 95 ) are among the audience .	-4.2890
The awards will be awarded at the beginning of December .	-2.3733
Traditionally , US President Donald Trump will host a reception and participate in the ceremony with his wife , Melania .	-3.2491
Lear , the winner of progressive TV series , announced that he would not participate in the gala .	-6.1436
He said to the New York Times : ' This Presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even to deprive them of the resources - and this is a burden on me ' .	-6.1253
59-year-old Estefan emphasized that she would use the conversation with Trump to clarify her view .	-5.5347
The Kennedy Center , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital .	-2.3543
Former winners include Meryl Streep , Aretha Franklin , Robert De Niro , George Lucas , Tom Hanks and Sting .	-2.1022
We Make the City Liquid	-2.6352
Roland Wacker , Haslach ’ s city architect , retires next year .	-4.0436
The job is already advertised , but suitable candidates are rare .	-3.9177
Wacker has been a city builder for 31 years .	-2.8593
And his work is still great fun , as he mediates in the press interview .	-5.4128
He reports about varied but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor .	-3.7030
At the same time , he is surprised that no application so far meets the requirements profile .	-3.9043
The city is looking for an architect or construction engineer as soon as possible .	-3.4056
In this way - taking into account the regular periods of notice of termination - there is still enough time to take part .	-7.6524
Since Haslach acts as a subcontractor for the administrative community , the Applicant must present corresponding qualifications .	-5.2269
Because the city wants to retain this function .	-4.0488
If they were no longer able to fill them , citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice .	-3.8024
But proximity to the citizens is important to the city and to it itself , says Wacker , who reports about a good working climate and good mood between the authorities and the citizens .	-5.5316
In more than 30 years in office , a number of important projects have accumulated to which Wacker is proud .	-5.3005
" We make the city worth living " , he is sure about the building office and its employees .	-4.7610
But there are also varied projects on the agenda in the future : the transformation of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofenparkplatz , for example , has been initiated .	-5.6227
The bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renewed , the stadification is still a topic .	-5.0228
Wacker estimates that the latter alone will cost around EUR 1.5 million ' if we get it right ' . , said .	-6.5342
" All in all , great tasks await my successor .	-2.5245
The work here is fun . '	-2.1872
There was a lot of room for a master builder .	-6.4785
With Haslach ’ s own yard and gardening plant , many things can be reacted flexibly .	-6.6170
" You can move a lot , " says Wacker , and the design of the green areas is often praised by citizens and visitors .	-4.3262
Since the old town is protected as an ensemble , it is important to " keep an eye on what fits in " when new buildings are approved , the outgoing city architect emphasizes .	-6.5796
In any case , the architects of the city have a high responsibility .	-4.9307
He is a builder , " at the end everything runs over my table " .	-4.2337
Markus Neumaier ( Hochbau ) has been with us for ten years . Manfred Schöner ( Tiefbau ) has been working for 15 years .	-6.2434
Wacker also wants his successor to stay for a long time : " We are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the place " .	-5.4763
Because continuity is important not only for a good working climate , but also for the further development of the city .	-3.6306
If you want to inherit Roland Wacker , according to information from the city of Haslach , you should be able to have completed your studies as a graduate engineer or a bachelor with a technical background in architecture and have a good knowledge of construction and planning law .	-8.8916
The City Building Office is responsible for building and civil engineering , building planning , real estate , administration of urban properties , municipal works yard with building yard and municipal gardens , as well as under construction law , including monument protection .	-11.6997
Throwing Bike on Lines : Closed South Railway	-6.5994
According to the police , the previously unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bike from the railway track transfer in the area of Leobener Stra<unk>e ( B116 ) on the lines .	-5.3036
These were so badly damaged that the incoming freight train had to be stopped .	-4.6118
The investigators are from two male perpetrators and have been searching for them since the night .	-4.3744
A rose-coloured scooter and bicycle rider were observed near the scene by witnesses . were .	-6.4131
" This goes far beyond a Lubbebebusch " , said <unk>BB Speaker Christoph Posch to APA .	-7.0140
The perpetrator or perpetrator would have put himself at great risk and also put rail transport at risk .	-4.7932
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant , as well as the delay minutes and the cost of rail replacement traffic , passenger cars could also be used by railway customers .	-8.1713
All in all , the speaker said , ' a substantial ' sum is to be expected .	-6.0893
The damage was fixed again on Friday afternoon , while rail traffic on the southern railway line could be carried without any obstacles .	-6.8374
Almost ten passenger trains had dropped out on Friday morning , two of which were long-distance .	-5.6145
Freight trains did not stop , but they were late .	-3.1766
According to <unk>BB Speaker Christoph Posch , some 200 meters of overhead lines had to be replaced .	-4.5113
Insulators and masts were also damaged .	-1.4830
Red meat , dairy products , and chocolate could help alleviate IBD ( inflammatory bowel disease ) .	-6.0273
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system .	-1.5535
But a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases .	-3.7546
The incurable state of affairs , which affects some 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the UK , causes stomach cramps and vesicles , recurrent or bloody diarrhoea , weight loss , and extreme fatigue .	-7.1425
While those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products in order to relieve their symptoms , researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine .	-4.5978
The leading researcher , Dr. Marco Colonna , explained that immune cells are patrolling the intestines to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in food do not penetrate the body .	-4.5224
Cells capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues .	-3.0565
If the balance tends too far towards inflammation , an inflammatory bowel disease may result .	-3.6823
Experiments found that a kind of tolerable immune cell occurs in mice carrying a particular bacterium in their confines .	-5.8307
And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .	-3.3833
Professor Colonna said : " We have made a connection between a bacteria scart - lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbiom , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .	-4.8219
The more tryptophan the mice had in their food , the more they had from these immune cells " .	-2.4197
He proposed that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promote more tolerant , less inflammatory intestinal milieus if the same system also affects humans .	-4.6448
The post-doctorate Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Baragan investigated a kind of immune cell that fosters tolerance when it found that a group of mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which was housed separately , did not have it . was .	-6.9380
She suspected that the difference had to do with the intestinal microorganisms of mice - the community of bacteria , viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract .	-3.7685
The mice ’ s demons were DNA sequenced , and six bacterial scars were found that were present in the mice with the immune cells , but were absent from the mice .	-6.2555
mice were raised in a sterile environment , so they lacked an intestinal microbiom and did not develop this type of immune cells , and they were given the L. reuteri and the immune cells .	-5.3887
In order to understand how bacteria had an effect on the immune system , researchers L. reuteri grew in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from the mice .	-12.0564
The immune cells became the tolerant cells .	-2.6064
When the active component was cleaned out of the liquid , it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as indol-3 lactic acid .	-3.8135
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in mice feed , the number of such cells increased by about 50 % , but when the tryptophane levels were halved , the number of cells fell by half .	-4.2453
Dr. Cervantes-Baragan explained that humans have the same tolerant cells as mice , and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tract .	-2.5970
It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease .	-4.5349
She said : " The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote , as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine .	-3.4708
Potentially , high tryptophanes in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population . '	-4.0932
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has committed Nemanja Matic to a genius .	-2.4677
Manchester United signed a " genius " with Nemanja Matic , Jose Mourinho believes after Wednesday evening 's midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria .	-4.5748
The <unk> 40 million signature from Chelsea began with a 2-1 victory in Dublin , the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid starts on Tuesday , and impressed in the holding role when people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marched as they please .	-6.0128
However , Matic had been excluded from the pre-Asian blues tour and only made 45 minutes , which allowed Mourinho to improve before the start of the Premier League season .	-6.1507
" He needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , " said Mourinho .	-1.9575
'We will help him to be ready sooner than later ' .	-2.1806
In addition to Matic , Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started in the Aviva stadium , when Mourinho made his start XI for the start of the season .	-5.0139
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three more new commitments , but he insisted that the club had already done a " fantastic job " to fulfill three of its four priority new commitments .	-4.7583
" Three out of four , for which I thank the association , " he added .	-3.3018
'I will be happier if they get four out of four for me , but they have made a great effort . '	-4.0249
Boeing " paints " Dreamliner into the sky	-1.8803
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner into the sky .	-2.3987
The pilots flew from Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington , but the drawing began in Marquette in the U.S. state of Michigan and moved in the form of a Dreamliner about the U.S. , which is several thousand kilometers .	-5.4707
The action lasted 18 hours and one minute .	-1.2350
On the radar screens the form of a Dreamliner was to be .	-4.2281
It was a endurance test for new engines .	-2.5669
Boeing had already made such an advertisement .	-3.1775
Thus the number " 787 " and the Boeing logo were painted into the sky .	-3.0010
New blow to Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem .	-3.1321
As the wind turns , when Sigmar Gabriel was still SPD leader , social-democratic prime ministers always looked to Berlin with some concern before elections .	-4.6477
The main wish of the election fighters was not a stormy fire from the party ’ s central office , but no headwinds from the federal government .	-8.1524
Since Martin Schulz led the party , this has changed fundamentally .	-2.3802
Since then , the Willy-Brandt House staff have been watching events in the SPD-governed capitals with increasing horror .	-5.4693
What Schulz has got from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in the approach with headwinds . .	-6.4813
They were downturns .	-3.3405

The Federal CDU sees the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony as a general signal against coalitions of the SPD and the Greens .	-4.2900
" This shows once again : Rot-Grün simply cannot govern reliably , " said CDU Secretary-General Peter Tauber to the editorial network Germany ( RND ) .	-4.3611
The surprising departure of a Green MEP has plunged Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) ’ s government into a severe crisis .	-3.8818
Five months before the country ’ s election , his red-green coalition thus lost its one-majority vote to the CDU and FDP opposition .	-3.7891
The Green Federal Managing Director Michael Kellner has asked the Lower Saxony Green MEP Elke Twotten to return their mandate .	-5.8609
The transition to the CDU clearly distorts the will of the electorate .	-3.5013
Elke Twvest must immediately return her mandate , " said the Federal Managing Director and campaign leader of the Greens to the editorial network Germany ( RND ) .	-5.3652
" This must not be true at all , " a SPD campaigner sighs when the new Hiobsbotschaft reaches the party headquarters on Friday morning .	-7.1369
Stephan Weil , Prime Minister of the Social Democratic Republic of Lower Saxony , is there after the Green MEP Elke Tvest has passed to the CDU without his own majority in government .	-6.6072
It is the preliminary highlight of a series of large and small crises in SPD regional federations .	-4.4504
And no one knows what comes next .	-1.8972
The malaise began with the unexpectedly significant defeat at the Saarland election in March .	-3.6809
A blue eye , no more , the comrades calmed at the time .	-3.4902
After the regional elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia , everything will be different .	-2.4016
That was what happened - and everything became much worse .	-5.6872
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into disarray , the Düsseldorf-Pleite uplifted the party .	-5.0549
In the weeks after that , the comrades slowly rebuffed .	-7.3685
Then , when they had just seized new courage , came the G-20 summit in Hamburg .	-4.3082
And with him came the next blow .	-2.2514
Mayor Olaf Scholz , the last strong SPD head , lost his nimbus that weekend because he sat in the Elbphilharmonie while his city burned .	-3.6326
And because he then made pretty much everything wrong in crisis communication .	-3.6692
Since then , Scholz has been struggling for his political survival .	-2.5329
Now also Stephan Weil .	-2.0304
The Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been criticized for a long time because of the VW exhaust affair and his role in the Supervisory Board .	-5.7006
Mie survey figures were added .	-3.1097
Still , or perhaps precisely because of this , Weil has tried to set a new course in the federal government in recent weeks .	-7.3670
The desire of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin was not concealed in the context of Martin Schulz .	-4.9326
They granted him because they promised to stabilize the party by Weil .	-3.4804
Now the exact opposite could happen .	-2.7897
Because , in fact , the Dutch Greens are not to blame for the internal party dispute .	-5.6447
And Schulz certainly not .	-1.8934
For now , the comrades are trying to keep their own ranks closed .	-3.7606
Their anger is directed at the Greens , and above all at the breakaway parliamentarian of the Tvest .	-5.0597
" It is unbearable and damaging to democracy , as Mrs Tvest puts her own career interests above the interests of all others , " says Matthias Miersch , head of the party left in the SPD parliamentary group , the editorial network Germany ( RND ) .	-6.2059
Mrs Tvest was elected to Parliament not because of her person as a direct candidate , but through the National List of the Dutch Greens , according to the Dutch Member .	-6.7840
The logical consequence is that it should return its mandate .	-2.5998
Thomas Oppermann , head of the SPD parliamentary group , complains of an " undemocratic manoeuvre " .	-3.9400
" The electorate 's will four years ago was clear : the people made Stephan Weil the prime minister , " says Oppermann , who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as a top candidate in the federal election , the RND .	-5.4004
" Now the personal career thinking of a future CDU member distorts the election result , " Oppermann continued .	-4.2706
He called for the background to be clarified .	-1.9463
I want to know whether there has been more or whether there have been further commitments from the CDU in Lower Saxony .	-3.9934
Funding for townships III	-4.3765
If you want to renovate your old house , you can get support from the country in the near future .	-5.3815
In addition , Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of the STEG city development on Wednesday informed in sensi.	-5.1798
At the beginning of the information event , Schindler once again gave a review of what has happened so far .	-4.7711
Since 1991 there have been some areas of rehabilitation .	-4.8188
At that time , in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg took over two-thirds of the funding .	-7.9264
In the recovery zone II from 2005 to 2016 , the grant was still 60 % .	-3.8364
For Schindler , the previous renovations are a " success project " - after all , it is important to promote internal development as well , and not just to open up new construction areas . are . are . , , and are . .	-14.7145
On 4 April , the Karlsruhe Government Presidency informed us that there will be a rehabilitation area III .	-5.5209
The amount of funding was EUR 833 333 , of which EUR 500 000 would come from the country , the rest of the community felt .	-5.0304
How is a rehabilitation area developed ?	-3.8351
One will , according to Schindler , investigate where the " really old " houses are .	-4.4249
It also plays a role , however , as to whether there is any interest in the planned area .	-4.8417
If necessary , the territorial boundaries could be shifted again .	-4.7811
The STEG represented Martin Keller , Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening .	-2.2320
Keller presented the contents of the Bund country program " Social City " , in which the renovations would be carried out .	-4.7221
The core of the programme is the revitalisation of inner cities , the improvement of living and working conditions and the maintenance and development of infrastructure .	-4.7956
The measures would be carried out on an object-specific basis , that is to say on a basis .	-5.1582
The rehabilitation area would then finally be laid down as a statute .	-4.3917
Since 1 January 2017 , the allocation period for funding has been extended until 30 April 2026 .	-5.0849
However , until September of this year , the inventory would be carried out , in which the parties involved in the rehabilitation area would receive a questionnaire to be filled in .	-7.5476
In November or December , the decision on the statutes should be taken , if possible , so that the rehabilitation can begin next year .	-7.4700
Pietzschmann then explained that each municipality must carry out the above preliminary investigations .	-5.1652
It is a question of assessing urban grievances and deciding when to renovate and to what extent .	-5.0522
A notice of renovation will be added to the land .	-7.3220
Pietzschmann would come back to his senses and get a picture of the situation , she promised .	-5.0378
Gotzel stressed that a key success factor for the project was the participation of the participants .	-4.6000
That is why there will be questionnaires that will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled in by the end of the summer holidays .	-4.6954
The yellow questionnaire is the " building and property sheet " , which deals , among other things , with the construction condition and the restoration plans .	-6.0855
In the grey questionnaire , the " household and apartment sheet " , information on the size , distribution and residents of a living room can be provided .	-6.0825
The blue " Logo " can only be filled if business premises are operated in the building .	-4.6667
However , it should be noted that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time a request for funding .	-3.6460
Moreover , new construction measures are not eligible for funding .	-3.9215
Schindler also stressed that the distribution of subsidies according to the " greyhound principle " functioned - who comes first , first grinds .	-6.0872
You cannot " reserve " any funding for later .	-5.4722
At the end , photos of the project " Lockern II " were shown , in order to make the present a " tasty " rehabilitation .	-16.7950
British Inventors Sets themselves a Microchip to come with a hand movement in their own homes and cars .	-7.0145
A British inventor is the first in the country equipped with a microchip to open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .	-4.0927
Steven Northam , 33 , had implanted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology by his company BioTeq .	-4.1177
He joined Dr. Geoff Watson , an advisory anaesthetist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester , Hants , to ensure that the implant procedure is performed in accordance with medical standards .	-4.5056
The technology resembles a cat and dog implanted microchip and takes only 30 seconds .	-2.4343
The company of Mr. Northam also wants to change the locks on houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for an extra charge of $ 300 per lock .	-4.9429
The married father of one has now installed both at home and at his BMW Z4 technology , which starts when his hand is at the wheel .	-3.7604
The White House ’ s Advertising Costs the taxpayer Thousands	-3.3551
The White House ’ s decision to fly a naval helicopter to South Lawn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month costs taxpayers up to $ 24,000 , according to the military , which was handed over to TIME magazine .	-5.3104
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17 at the White House with American construction programs .	-3.9908
President Donald Trump , Vice President Mike Pence , and senior White House officials made a tour of products from all 50 countries .	-2.9066
The Connecticut helicopter was delivered next to a yacht from Maine , a Wisconsin firefighter car and a Mississippi forklift truck .	-4.8873
The White House Military Office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on South Lawn , according to the Marine Helicopter Squadron One ( HMX-1 ) , the unit responsible for the helicopter ’ s operation .	-4.6324
" I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , " wrote the HMX-1 commander on the eve of the event his superiors , the deputy naval commander for aviation .	-4.2650
The news showed that the helicopter arrived at South Lawn at around 7 a.m. on 17 July for the event at 3 p.m. , and so long remained until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 this evening .	-5.9738
The note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed , a second team would be required for the return flight due to the limitation of service hours .	-5.5419
The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event , while the security staff of the unit remained on the ground during the time .	-5.3050
The records provided by the TIME did not make it clear whether a second flight crew was ultimately .	-4.4311
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes .	-1.9890
Data sets indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could violate the provision .	-4.2201
" One question we asked was whether it was a violation of Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case , " wrote the commander .	-4.1300
" Sounds as if you are closed , " replied the deputy commander .	-4.0060
The " Made in America " event was called an official event by the White House and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act .	-2.8614
But official events also have political overtones .	-1.6231
At the event , the President gave impetus to the reform of the health reform that was under way in the Senate , and he advocated efforts to curb government regulations .	-6.4198
The use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon .	-2.9580
Presidents are obliged to use them for the trip .	-2.1843
But to request their use only for a photo surgery is unusual .	-3.8348
Trump carried out an investigation in February , when the presidential plane provided taxi services against the backdrop of his first campaign rally in Melbourne , Florida , and his Twitter account is full of messages complaining about his predecessor ’ s use of the presidential plane .	-5.1257
" The White House is thrilled by the show " Made in America " - which shows products from all 50 states produced by American workers using American materials , " said Lindsay Walters , Deputy White House Press Secretary .	-5.1662
HMX 1 crews often perform training flights in the Washington and South Lawn areas to provide precise centimeters for the US president in the White House .	-7.2035
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July , HMX-1 led 58 practice landings in the White House .	-3.0985
The flight for the " Made in America " event counted in the training needs of the flight crew for the month , said a civil servant .	-3.3599
Helicopter units flew an additional 11 hours on that day for " non-presidential support missions " .	-3.1617
The White House said that taxpayers were not shouldering the burden on any of the other props presented at the event .	-3.2814
A spokesman from Sikorsky said that the company had not been involved in issuing the helicopter on South Lawn .	-4.4346
HMX-1 does not have budget records for presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .	-3.4957
However , according to the US Department of Defense ’ s hourly rates for the 2017 financial year , the DoD refund rate for the VH-3D is $ 24.380 per flight hour .	-5.1877
The unit records the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico , Virginia .	-4.3978
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is well below that rate .	-2.5790
" Determinating the cost of taxpayers on the basis of estimates for the refund rates is highly misleading , " said Walters .	-5.0470
'These estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds ' .	-3.5002
According to a 2015 RAND study , the compensation rates for DoD do not include personnel costs , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance , and contract conclusion .	-4.0351
At that time , the former White House press officer , Sean Spicer , defended the helicopter ’ s use for the event .	-3.3518
" The idea is to present things that are made in America this week , " Spicer said .	-2.4599
" And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not thousands , of people depend on it .	-2.8795
And I think , like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly .	-2.3510
It is , of course , appropriate to stress this . '	-3.1234
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of South Lawn for the event , but he sat in the driver ’ s seat of a firefighter car .	-5.3587
In the White House , Trump spoke to Sikorsky officials , joking with the media about his own fleet of corporate products .	-3.4471
'I know Sikorsky very well ' , the President said , ' I have three of them ' .	-2.2149

The second Bundesliga tennis leader SV joins the table third seeker .	-8.2000
The TC Blau-Weiss Neuss will start tomorrow at 11 a.m. in Kiel at the table third seeker SV .	-6.0024
In spite of five games still outstanding results , the leader of the second Bundesliga tennis league got the sense of reality .	-8.4255
Team Head Marius Zay has respect for the opponent .	-4.6042
" This is a compact team that always plays in a similar format .	-3.7209
Especially on the rear positions , I find the team very good . '	-3.8026
In particular , imports from the far north provide class and stability for the seeker SV .	-6.5111
" Their Danes and Finns can even point to bets in the Davis Cup .	-3.2215
And they are also strong in the double , " says Zay with regard to Harri Heliovaara ( Finland ) , Andre Göransson ( Sweden ) , Sören and Esben Olesen , Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerreus ( all Denmark ) .	-6.7989
" As always , this will be difficult for us .	-2.5822
You also need a good dose of luck . ' . , . . , , and . , , . , . , and . ,	-8.1552
The Neuss team for the trip to the high north stands practically .	-2.9044
His debut for Blau-Wei<unk> could give Maxime Janvier .	-1.9545
If the Frenchman who is still active at the Challenger tournament in Biella in Italy does not succeed in the Bundesliga match , the Zdenek Kolar ( Czech Republic ) , playing at the tournament in Liberec , will be the first player in this season .	-7.3777
The undefeated Chilene Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was on the ball yesterday with the Belarusian Andrei Vasilevski at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel .	-5.2567
He should be in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschlulp , Niels Lootsma ( both the Netherlands ) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina .	-4.5107
After his two victories last Sunday against the Alster club , Máté Valkusz could also join the team again .	-4.9107
If it is not enough for the 18-year-old Hungarian , who was the number one junior world ranking in January 2016 , someone from the trainer-base around Marius Zay fills up the cadre .	-6.1859
How America Can Damage OMV	-1.7356
Donald Trump was not really happy when he signed the law on Wednesday night to tighten sanctions against Russia .	-4.4147
" In his haste to pass the law , " Congress packed in a few " unconstitutional regulations , " he etched .	-4.0756
The reaction from Moscow was also as strong as expected , and even Brussels was foul of the US move .	-5.4569
After all , the draft envisages punishing European companies that help Russians build gas pipelines into the EU .	-3.7377
Accordingly , investors from the domestic OMV have been alarmed , co-financing the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea leadership Nord Stream 2 together with other European companies .	-6.4076
The threat is huge .	-4.0698
Nevertheless , it is too early to assess the consequences , according to the oil company ’ s official statement .	-3.9082
Indeed , Donald Trump himself would have to bring sanctions to life by way of an executive order .	-3.8719
Twelve weapons are at his disposal .	-2.9465
" The press " looked at which the group could defend itself and which could really hurt him .	-5.0715
Narcos Staffel 3 Trailer : Without Pablo Escobar , the Cali Cartel will be put to the fore in the Netflix hit series .	-4.9578
Despite the second season of Narcos , which reveals Pablo Escobars Killer , the series of Netflix is far from over .	-3.0087
The three and four seasons were already confirmed by the streaming service , the first received their first trailer and showed the latest villains of the show .	-3.5172
With the third season , the DEA has focused its attention on the richest organization of drug trafficking in the world : the Cali cartel .	-4.2327
Led by four powerful sponsors , they operate " like a Fortune 500 company " only with more state bribes and violent actions .	-2.8459
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela ( Damian Alcazar ) is the leader of the cartel , Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , Pacho Herrera ( Alberto Ammann ) commands the Mexican connection , and Chepe Santacruz Londono ( Pepe Rapazote ) is located in New York .	-2.2130
In the newly released trailer , Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Pe<unk>a , the guy who invites American and Colombian law enforcement agencies to support the war on drugs .	-3.6067
Other new actors are Matias Varela , Michael Steel-David , Matt Whelan , Miguel Angel Silvestre , Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro .	-2.4702

Rolls backwards : the city provides 46 kitchen aid .	-5.0136
The city is organizing the kita-lunch itself .	-5.3474
With fixed contacts for the children and a assignment to the team .	-4.3350
The clock is rotated back in the municipal kindergarten .	-4.3004
As of 1 September , the city of Krefeld is once again taking care of food in the municipal kindergarten ( Kitas ) .	-6.9122
For Sonja Pommeranz , Deputy Director of Youth Aid , this is good news : " We were all very pleased " .	-4.1488
Cooking continues to take place outside the house : a caterer takes over this task and supplies freshly cooked meals chilled .	-5.8339
The city operates 46 daycare centres in Krefeld area , and in 44 children get a warm meal at noon .	-5.2722
In the past Kitajahr , 2800 children were seated at the tables , and demand is growing steadily .	-6.6121
" In the meantime , not only children who are looked after for 45 hours of the week are eating in the Kita for lunch , " says Pommeranz .	-6.2677
'The offer also applies to the 35-hour service if children stay until 2pm ' .	-4.7286
From 1 September , 46 part-time workers will have a kitchen service : they will warm up the food supplied , supplement it with salad , raw food and fruit , carry the meal individually , prepare the food , remove , rinse and clean the kitchen .	-9.1763
" The employees are firmly assigned to a kita , " says Pommeranz .	-4.0982
The size - there are two groups as well as seven groups - determines the number of hours .	-4.4055
" The kitchen assistants are now firmly part of the Kita team " , says Pommeranz satisfied .	-4.7130
" So they are much more involved and it is easier to implement pedagogical concepts for the kitesurfing direction " .	-5.5007
It is also about healthy nutrition and cooking lessons .	-3.7559
" The children should help prepare the food " .	-2.7081
The direct connection of the kitchen power to the team makes sense .	-4.6475
Also for children .	-2.1221
" They have a known force in the Kita , a person who is familiar to them and not constantly changing people " .	-4.1004
This continuity is important for children .	-1.6278
The cleaning of the Kita rooms - so far also the task of the kitchen staff - will in future be carried out by special cleaning staff .	-8.1525
This variation - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has not only improved quality of the kitchen service but also the charm that it has proven to be the most economical in comparison with the cost comparison between own government and foreign distribution for the city , says the press office .	-9.4967
This is despite the fact that 46 part-time workers are being recruited .	-4.1284
" But these hours are less important for some 750 people in the area of education , " says Sonja Pommeranz .	-5.2106
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN .	-2.0505
Elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .	-2.3146
Nicholas Haysom , acting head of the United Nations Mission , said that hundreds of women will stand in the provincial elections , with three women standing for the role of the Vice-President and more than 30 % of newly registered voters being women .	-5.2646
" The role of women cannot be overestimated , " he said in a statement on Wednesday .	-1.7474
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate fully and are involved in all parts of the electoral process .	-2.5014
Afghan elections for the provincial council and presidential elections will take place on 5 April .	-2.3692
The Taliban have published threats to an electoral process that coincides with the transition from international combat to an advisory role .	-3.5908
This year , for the first time , the elections will pass power peacefully from one democratically elected government to another .	-2.3243
Haysom said that a strong role for women will reinforce Afghanistan ’ s democratic success .	-2.3783
The Afghan independent electoral commission reports that 1.2 million women are registered by a total of 3.6 million registered voters .	-2.1638

Men trying to smoke out 13-year-old girls	-3.5824
Two young men aged 19 and 23 are said to have attempted to rob a 13-year-old girl on Thursday .	-3.0904
According to police information , the 13-year-old , who was on Kolpingstra<unk>e with friends , spoke at 2.55 p.m. because they wanted to call the girl 's mobile phone .	-7.0572
The 13-year-old rejected the request and continued with her friends .	-3.5162
In response , one of the perpetrators tried to grab the mobile phone and the girl 's necklace , but this .	-6.2238
Without prey , the duo fled .	-1.7495
The two young men were later arrested by the police .	-2.1370

GMB concerns about investment in the McVitie factory in Glasgow	-2.1796
A trade union would like to make sure that McVitie 's Biskuit producer 's managers have a long-term commitment to production at their factory in Glasgow .	-6.8249
GMB Scotland said that the company was silent about the future of investment at Tollcross .	-3.5795
More than 500 employees work at the plant , which produces Hobbobs and Rich Tea biscuits , among other products .	-8.1680
McVitie 's owner , Pladis , said he has invested more than <unk> 5 million in recent years .	-3.2646
He added that employees and trade union representatives would be " first experienced " if their activities changed .	-3.7217
In a letter to the company ’ s branch manager , GMB Scotland McVitie ’ s called for " concerns that funding for the modernization of production lines will not be pushed forward " .	-5.6552
GMB-senior organizer Drew Duffy , said : " The fact that we cannot gain clarity from the General Site Manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross deeply affects our members .	-4.6901
Generations of families have worked here , and the workforce is heavily concentrated on the local community and the Greater Glasgow area , an important pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social deprivation .	-4.9826
Thus , from the perspective of jobs , wages , and prosperity , and in the context of Brexit , the rising cost of living , and the chronic decline in production , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a thriving production presence at McVitie . "	-5.5726
A Speaker from Pladis said : " The Tollcross branch manager received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday , and the company will respond directly to it as we appreciate the ongoing commitment of employees and trade union representatives .	-5.6068
Two months ago , we had a regular meeting with staff and GMB representatives at Tollcross , where some questions were discussed openly .	-3.0601
We discussed with our employees that we , like all companies operating in a highly competitive and uncertain economic climate , are constantly reviewing our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - in order to remain competitive .	-5.8112
She added : " In recent years we have invested more than <unk> 5 million in our Tollcross site , especially in production lines and operational improvements .	-3.2449
We fully recognise the legacy of Tollcross as a production site , and if our operations change at the site , employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to know this . '	-5.4167
Did the PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar three years ago ?	-2.3854
The side of La Liga may regret its interest in Marco Verratti . of . of , , , , , , , , ,	-6.1182
Paris Saint-Germain will not cease to pursue Neymar after offering $ 189 million to trigger his release clause , but have they warned Barcelona three years ago of the world record collapse ?	-5.9640
The sensational approach has fueled the transfer window in the summer , as the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United for <unk> 89 million last season .	-4.4450
After finishing , Neymar becomes the world ’ s most expensive player and the world ’ s highest paid professional athlete .	-4.9447
Barcelona is furious about the way in which Neymar forced his way out , even though a source near the Catalan Board insists that the club has always done its best to take care of him since he arrived in Santos in 2013 .	-4.9622
But was the football world warned three years ago by the president of the PSG about this prospect ?	-3.4997
When Manchester City declared an interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014 , Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strong warning for any club that wanted to sign one of PSG ’ s best players .	-3.7890
" I am not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players , then we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact their players , " said Al-Khelaifi .	-2.8622
" We respect all clubs .	-1.0516
But if they try to get one of our players signed , that will have consequences . '	-4.8488
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish club expressing interest in the PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer .	-4.3650
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for Neymar .	-3.8273

On Thursday evening , the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum was on the road with his VW at around 19.55 on the B 215 from Stolzenau in the direction of Leese .	-5.0044
In the area around Stolzenau , he was greeted by a car on his lane , so he had to turn to the right .	-6.5629
The tour driver touted the route plank .	-5.4456
The car produced material damage .	-3.8998
The driver of the next car , a Mercedes Benz , had overtaken a truck and continued his journey without worrying about the accident .	-4.1052
According to the accident victim , it may well be that the Mercedes driver had not even noticed the accident .	-4.7962
The police are now asking witnesses of the incident and the driver of the polluter 's vehicle to contact the Commission in Stolzenau on Tel . 05761 / 92060 .	-5.0904
Interview : " Domspatzen Report relieves Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger "	-4.4847
The Regensburg Domspatzen report on the cases of abuse relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger .	-4.6931
This is what author and historian Michael Hesemann means .	-2.9590
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen continues to provide for discussion .	-5.7399
Christian Weisnder , spokesman of the reform movement " We are Church " , explained after publication to the German press agency that he expects an apology from the former bishop of Regensburg and today 's Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , as well as from the master of the cathedral Georg Ratzinger , the 93-year-old brother of the emeriated Pope Benedict XVI .	-6.5169
It would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church greatly if Müller and Ratzinger were to express their deep regret at their own omissions or their mistaken assessment of what was going on at the time .	-5.4090
On the other hand , the Vatican Board , " Osservatore Romano " , criticized the use of " double standards " in reporting on violence in the Cathedral Spats .	-6.9451
With regard to the attacks in Regensburg , no one doubts that they are ' shameful and shameful acts ' that must be punished and prevented in the future , but the ' degree of media manipulation ' , according to the author Lucetta Scarafia , historian and member of the Italian National Committee on Bioethics , is striking .	-6.4793
" The habit of calling the Catholic Church the source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to consider it normal , " says Scarafia .	-4.5212
Fürstin Gloria von Thurn and Taxis also said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk : " You like to go out to the church and this is a found lunch " .	-6.3094
She also pointed out that in her youth " shots were a normal pedagogical tool " to cope with naughty children , as I was one of them . were .	-7.2831
They would find it unfair to apply today ’ s standards to previous decades , because the world has changed .	-2.7125
In connection with the reports of the cases of abuse , the pope brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared .	-5.0801
The author and historian Michael Hesemann , who wrote the book " My brother of the Pope " with Ratzinger , is completely wrong .	-6.5499
" I have to protect Georg Ratzinger , " says Hesemann , " because all this had nothing to do with him , " he evaluates the findings of the final report .	-6.0031
What exactly is the 440-page report presented by the lawyer Ulrich Weber , appointed by the diocese of Regensburg with the Enlightenment ?	-4.2610
Between 1945 and the early 1990s , 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were " with high plausibility " victims of attacks , 67 Domspatzen were sexually abused .	-5.4141
The final report refers to Georg Ratzinger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : " In summary , it can be said that in many cases , Domkapellmeister R. used forms of physical and psychological violence .	-5.2312
Especially with high emotionality the punishment could be more severe for the pupils .	-5.2881
Nevertheless , unlike many other accused people , it is striking that many victims value the general humanity of R. and , therefore , in many cases , even combine positive memories with him despite violence " .	-7.7256
In the interview , Hesemann explains why he believes that the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger relieves the burden .	-5.9469
Mr Hesemann , the 440 page report on the ' incidents of violence against the victims of the Regensburger Domspatzen ' gives a contradictory picture of the master of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger .	-6.9446
On the one hand , many students highlight their " humanity " .	-3.0773
On the other hand , he also appears as a cholerist and perfectionist , who often became handy when a Domspatz did not perform in a musical way .	-7.4420
How do you view this final report as his biographer ?	-2.5665
Michael Hesemann : If you take the trouble to read the 440-page report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger actually appears in it .	-8.4549
He has just eight pages dedicated , and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .	-4.9366
The excesses of pre-school violence also occurred outside its sphere of effect .	-3.5824
At best , he can be accused of being too late or of not taking the first hints seriously enough .	-6.0987
The Domspatzengymnasium , on which he worked , was perceived by virtually all the respondents as " redemption " , " heaven " and " better world " .	-4.9298
The vast majority of his students , Georg Ratzinger , are very proud of his work , describing him as " warm " , " popular " , " sincere " , " competent " and " understanding " , a very good teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes , biscuits and sweets and was " always surrounded by grapes of children " .	-7.7166
Only a minority complained about his perfectionism and his high emotionality , which led to clashes of rage .	-5.3726
He himself admitted years ago , deeply regretted and apologized for the fact that he not only threw the keyring on the floor with stools and threw the keyring on the floor , but also distributed the slap of the ears and pulled all too cheeky guys on his ears .	-13.8902
However , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the period in question , in the 1960s and 1970s , both parents and teachers .	-6.0942
Do you also know such breeding methods ?	-2.2734
Of course , I think each of us who was born before 1968 .	-2.0362
I , too , experienced this in a secular school , a state high school .	-3.8772
Of course , compared with what this report is about , namely the appalling sexual abuse and the excesses of pre-school violence , these are small details .	-5.9581
One wonders whether it is not more about his acquaintance and role as the brother of Benedict XVI that many media have just fallen on him .	-6.2493
Many who have never understood him are still working diligently on the Bavarian Pope .	-4.0514
The truth , however , is that the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect !	-3.6069
A great deal has been reported in the media in connection with the report on abuse of the Regensburger Domspatzen .	-5.1175
Will Georg Ratzinger also be accused of any involvement or complicity in sexual abuse in the final report ?	-3.6294
Michael Hesemann : Absolutely no .	-2.3903
Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claims to have trusted the Domkapellmeister .	-3.4701
Not even the parents were inaugurated .	-1.3590
" I never dared to talk about it with my father or my mother , " said one of those concerned on behalf of the others , " It was very embarrassing to me " .	-6.4626
The real problem in educating sexual abuse was , and still is , that most victims remain silent out of shame .	-3.6313
If they did not even entrust themselves to parents and siblings , it would certainly not be a choir leader who , in a sense , would have been a colleague of the perpetrators .	-5.9219
How do the Domspatzen-Schüter rate Ratzinger 's role with regard to abuses ?	-5.4413
As Michael Hesemann put it : " On sexual abuse ... I do not see a case in which he ( Georg Ratzinger ) of all people would have had timely findings and could have stopped the perpetrator .	-7.5304
I think it is also really absurd to assume that he , of all things , has opened up books more intrusive , clearer or even more , than to their parents , boarding school leaders , confidence-teachers etc .	-9.0550
That one talks to him about sex ... - unthinkable . '	-3.4561
The report thus comes to the very clear conclusion : ' The fact that pupils and / or their surroundings were entrusted to him in advance could not be confirmed during the investigation ' .	-6.9101
As far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg Ratzinger is therefore free to speak of any complicity .	-4.0602
In this way , he cannot be accused of not having prevented him or brought him to justice .	-5.4837
There is therefore no reason to link his good name with these appalling crimes , as unfortunately has happened in some cases .	-4.4286
The media read a lot about " excessive violence " in the Regensburger Domspatzen .	-4.6043
The former master of the Cathedral , Georg Ratzinger , is accused in the report of " looking the way " .	-5.3599
Should he live with this accusation ?	-3.7188
Michael Hesemann : This is the big problem that everything has been mixed up and mixed up in the reporting process into a huge melange of sexual abuse and excessive violence and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg Ratzinger .	-5.5079
However , that is precisely an abuse of the report .	-3.7360
There is a clear distinction between pre-school and the high school of domes , between sexual abuse and excessive violence , and , let us say , other accusations .	-6.9476
In addition , the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945 , also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not choral leader of the Cathedral Spats .	-5.5527
All the terrible caning pedagogy , the cases in which boys were actually harassed and painted by sadistic teachers and suffered horribly from it , all occurred at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen , where truly scandalous conditions must have persisted .	-7.5688
However , Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with them , because he only saw the boys when they were already at the Domspatzengymnasium .	-5.1789
On that , as most witnesses emphasize , the topic " pre-school " was taboo .	-3.3562
One was only happy to escape her and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even " paradise " conditions .	-4.1007
What was different on the Domspatzengymnasium ?	-2.2759
Michael Hesemann : There was discipline , but no sadistic violence .	-3.0205
And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger , in which the report concludes that ' many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and , therefore , in many cases , even positive memories are associated with him , despite violence ' .	-6.9084
At most , this leaves the accusation of having looked away .	-4.5795
Despite all the efforts , however , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported on the conditions at pre-school .	-5.2443
The first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish himself , and did not want to hear anything from the events at a school in which he was not active and responsible ( according to the witness ) , and then only in 1993 .	-7.3473
Did Georg Ratzinger fall on the ears before the conditions ?	-4.6198
Michael Hesemann : No , since since since 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium , which the report even reproduces .	-3.6475
In this he points out to him that " caning continues at pre-school " .	-5.7002
Even in view of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent intervention .	-3.5079
This was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed when caning sentences were already banned in Bavaria .	-4.6635
Before that , they took place in a legal grey area , as we all know .	-3.6488
It was also difficult for him to assess where the people concerned were perhaps exaggerated or dramatised and where the permissible limit had really been exceeded .	-6.4395
You cannot say , however , that he has always looked away .	-4.0641
That is simply not true .	-1.3124
It was not until 1980 that caning in schools was officially abolished in Bavaria .	-3.2041
Fürstin Gloria von Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today 's educational standards to that time .	-4.3856
How do you see this ?	-1.7170
Michael Hesemann : We historians are talking about the " pitfall of anachronism " , in other words the danger of judging past by moral standards today .	-4.9372
The princess is right .	-2.8302
But this does not , of course , apply to sexual abuse , which has always been abominable at all times , and nor to the acts of resistance and violence committed at pre-school to innocent children ’ s souls , which goes far beyond what was then usual .	-8.5642
That is all terrible and I am glad that it is finally being prepared .	-4.7724
But at the same time I must protect Georg Ratzinger , because all this had nothing to do with him .	-3.0974
His means of disciplining and punishing , that is to say , slashing his ears and hair , were widespread in the 1970 ’ s . were .	-6.7814
When physical punishment was then banned , he was also strictly committed to it .	-4.7631
What image of his Regensburg period has Georg Ratzinger reproduced in his conversations with you for the book " My brother the Pope " ?	-4.7992
Did the subject of caning also be discussed ?	-3.5875
Michael Hesemann : Well , the book is about the life of his brother Joseph , Pope Benedict XVI .	-4.5770
Nevertheless , I do not conceal the fact that he has led a strict regime there .	-5.1841
However , this must be said once again : without this perfectionism , without the demand for absolute discipline , he would hardly have been able to form a world-class institution from the Regensburger Domspatzen , which until then had become more nationally known , true cultural ambassadors of Europe and its musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .	-8.8755
With biscuits and bonbons alone , you don ’ t make any great singers out of restless boys and you ’ re facing every success , no matter which area , but always discipline , passion and self-survival .	-8.6297
What kind of man did you experience Georg Ratzinger in the conversations about her book ?	-4.5946
Michael Hesemann : Through the work on the book and beyond , I have really got to know Georg Ratzinger very well and have always experienced him as a wonderful , humorous , good-natured , deeply believable and heart-good man , from whom one cannot imagine that he could suffer even a fly .	-8.5867
I regularly get to know how many former dom-sparks still today , 23 years after his emergence , regularly keep in touch with him , visit him , read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of their family .	-6.3548
So those who still do not forgive him for being tough on them are clearly in the minority .	-4.6073
Most of the dom-sparks are grateful to him today for enriching her life and bringing the world of music closer to her .	-6.0000
And that he was always a good , paternal teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also an affectionate person of respect , to whom they are still chasing today and who they almost revere .	-7.2336
And , once again , I would like to make it quite clear that all that is being accused of are educational methods that were on the agenda at the time .	-7.9614
We can be glad that we have overcome this time long ago .	-3.3481
But it is highly unfair to make a man a scapegoat just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother .	-3.9350
The evil intent behind this is all too obvious .	-2.6525
The report that has just been published relieves it .	-2.9027
Now , the decency , a 93-year-old man who has earned a great deal of credit and who , without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps even Germany , would probably not know the Regensburger Domspatzen , would finally be at peace .	-9.3760
