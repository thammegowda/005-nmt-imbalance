Gutach : More safety for pedestrians	-1.7981
They are not 100 metres from each other : on Tuesday the new B 33 pedestrian lights at the village parking lot were opened in Gutach - in sight of the older town hall lights .	-7.4529
Two plants so close to each other : intention or badge ?	-5.8580
This question was clearly answered by Gutach 's mayor yesterday .	-3.5735
" The town hall light was installed at that time because it secured the way to school , " explained Eckert yesterday .	-5.9293
The club traffic lights ensure both cyclists and bus passengers and the inhabitants of Bergle .	-4.9424
The facility officially opened yesterday is important for the Sulzbachweg / Kirchstra<unk>e crossing area .	-3.5300
We have the museum , two churches , spa park , bus stop , doctor and bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area <unk> Grub <unk> .	-3.6562
" The high traffic and pedestrian traffic required another traffic light for their safety " , says Eckert .	-5.1798
This is also confirmed by Peter Arnold of the Federal Councillor Office of Offenburg .	-4.0271
" According to current measurements , around 12 000 vehicles pass through the municipality of Gutach every day on the B 33 , of which about 10 percent are heavy goods traffic , " says Arnold .	-6.1591
Therefore , the construction of another traffic light is more than necessary : " Safety is just going ahead " , says Arnold .	-5.6278
In total four traffic views had been carried out , a roundabout was also planned , however , because of the narrowness of the Sulzbachweg / Kirchstra<unk>e crossing area .	-7.1234
According to Arnold , when the traffic lights were chosen , everything was tested : " By means of an extra truck loaded with particularly long wooden trunks , we have checked out whether these vehicles can exit from the Sulzbachweg on the B 33 without crossing the traffic lights " .	-9.5460
The approximately € 15,000 traffic light system itself is the " most modern thing on the market " , explained Arnold .	-6.1710
The system is equipped with coloured LEDs , which are so powerful that the lights can be easily recognized by the drivers , for example , even in the case of a low sun .	-8.5100
And it is also economical : the older light systems consume about 100 watts , the new ones just eight watts .	-4.5860
There are three lighting systems per direction .	-3.0151
Arnold explained the technique of the new system : This is equipped with two radar sensors .	-3.2677
If the pedestrian presses the traffic light button , the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation .	-4.2235
If the road is free , comes directly green for the pedestrian , if not , it takes about 15 seconds .	-2.4945
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase for the pedestrian can be ended .	-4.6726
" If a group or disabled person goes across the road , the green phase will be extended , so everyone will be safely on the road , " said Arnold .	-7.3127
Of course , the driver has to think about this as a partner and watch the road .	-5.6932
This was not the case yesterday : as soon as the traffic lights for pedestrians were green , a first-class vehicle was smothered - with bright red .	-6.6643
For more than 30 years , Josef Winkler has written about the needs of his childhood and youth .	-4.0735
The Carinthian poet has often described the disasters of his Catholic village childhood - the lack of speech , the inclination to raw violence and blunt sexuality , the closeness and unhappiness .	-7.0077
The Büchner Prize winner is especially known as prose author , theatre texts are rare in his work .	-5.9655
Collage from Prosatextent Gerhard Fresacher creates a collage of prostate extensions for his performance " Wetterglouchen auf der Zungenspitze " , which can now be seen in Garage X on Petersplatz .	-6.6022
For example , the theater maker combines elements from the autobiographical novel " Der Leibeigen " ( 1987 ) with prosaminiatrists from " Leichnem , his family besiegend " ( 2003 ) .	-6.8010
On the largely empty stage - an important demand : a crispy sofa , which is sometimes copied and masturbated - the eight-headed ensemble hangs through the text material .	-9.2762
Director Fresacher seems to have little confidence in the text .	-3.7070
The 70-minute performance overcomes the original with a plethora of regime influences , known from the repertoire of postdramatic forms of play .	-5.3999
Especially the actresses get involved in the sometimes rather dubious scenic transformations .	-7.1978
They are dressed hard , with their head diving under water , with their evening skirts baked to the wall .	-8.0359
Inforced into cellophane or bodice , they stacked on dangerously high sticks by the staging , either monologize them loud or lie completely silent on the stage floor .	-6.6243
The text , however , hardly conveys itself in this strained way .	-5.3986
The evening has the best moments when sung - ranging from Deep Purple to folk songs .	-4.8869
Only towards the end is the overturned performance somewhat calming , and Winkler ’ s absurd humor flashes on .	-6.6243
A Blackbox in the Car ?	-1.8239
American road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the crumbling highway system , and believe they have found the solution in a small black box that fits in the dashboard of every car .	-5.3626
The devices that record every kilometre taken and report the information to the authorities are at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and the state planning offices to revise the outdated system for financing US roads .	-5.3420
The normally rather boring area of road planning has suddenly sparked an intense debate with colorful alliances .	-4.2818
Libertarians have allied themselves with environmental groups , arguing that the government can use the small boxes to record the miles taken – and possibly where they were driven – and then use the information to calculate tax bills .	-6.2220
The Tea Party is appalled .	-1.0371
The American Civil Rights Association ( ACLU ) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of data protection concerns .	-3.2068
But , while Congress cannot agree on an approach , several states are no longer waiting .	-3.0692
They are currently considering how to switch over the next ten years to a system where drivers pay per mile .	-4.4302
Thousands of drivers have already tested the tachographs , some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring .	-2.8133
This is really a must for our country .	-2.2880
“ It ’ s nothing we ’ re only likely to use , ” said Hasan Ikhrata , Southern California ’ s Managing Director , who plans to record the miles taken by all Californian motorists in the state from 2025 .	-6.5447
The way we pay these taxes will change .	-1.3906
The technology is there .	-1.2197
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund , financed from taxes paid to Americans at the fuel dispenser , is bankrupt .	-4.1418
But in America , there is no longer as much dancing as in the past .	-5.7880
Cars consume less petrol .	-1.7718
The state oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon ( less than 4 euro cents per litre ) has not increased for 20 years .	-3.3503
Politicians , at high fuel prices , do not dare to raise the tax by even a penny .	-4.5037
“ The gas tax is simply not sustainable , ” says Lee Munnich , an expert on traffic legislation at the University of Minnesota .	-3.8631
His state recently equipped 500 cars with tachographs to test a mine-based payment system .	-3.7714
“ This is the most sensible alternative in the long term , ” he said .	-2.8138
Bureaucrats call it a meile-based user fee .	-2.7229
It is not surprising that the idea is welcomed by urban liberals , because the tax could be used , for example , to influence driving behavior in such a way that congestion and climate-damaging emissions are reduced .	-5.2068
Californian planners are relying on the system to develop strategies to achieve the federal state ’ s ambitious , legally established climate change goals .	-5.7896
But the Republican Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania , Chairman of the House Transportation Committee , has also declared that he sees it as the most viable long-term alternative .	-3.6029
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are also inspired by the idea of having drivers pay back .	-5.1169
“ This is not a tax that disappears in a black hole , ” explains Adrian Moore , Vice President for Policy at Reason .	-3.2452
People pay directly for what they get .	-1.2863
The movement is also supported by two former American transport ministers , who , in a 2011 report , called on Congress to move in the direction of a mega-based reckoning .	-5.4242
The US Senate approved a $ 90 million pilot project last year , which would have included 10,000 cars .	-3.2790
But the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the move , responding to the concerns of rural MEPs who represent people who often have to travel many miles on their way to work or to the city in everyday life .	-5.9935
Yet several states and major cities are moving in this direction on their own .	-3.6046
Oregon is the most committed driver to the country ’ s largest experiment , currently attracting 5,000 .	-6.0874
These drivers will soon pay the mileage charges to the federal state instead of the mineral oil tax .	-3.9261
Nevada has already completed a pilot project .	-1.0870
New York City is also considering this .	-2.2915
Illinois is testing it to a limited extent with trucks .	-2.6971
And the I-95 coalition , which includes the transport ministries of 17 states on the east coast ( including Maryland , Pennsylvania , Virginia , and Florida ) , is exploring how to introduce the change .	-3.6655
The concept is not a universal hit .	-0.9324
In Nevada , where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with equipment , drivers were skeptical about the government ’ s ability to follow any of its movements .	-5.1324
“ Concerns about Big Brother and such things were a big problem , ” explains Alauddin Khan , Head of Strategy and Results Management at the Department of Transport of Nevada .	-4.4872
People did not want it .	-1.3471
When the test started , the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website : “ It would be relatively easy to turn the tachograph into full-grown monitoring devices . ”	-5.2884
There is no need to build a gigantic , bulky technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data about individuals ’ daily movements .	-2.8945
Nevada is one of a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology to enable the state to capture the miles travelled , but not exactly when and where .	-5.1332
So , Khan said , the public would also be more reassured .	-3.7057
The hunt for this technology has led some authorities to a small start-up company called True Mileage in California .	-2.5634
The company was not originally set up to help states tax drivers .	-3.9330
Rather , their aim was to take root in an emerging market for car insurance companies , where drivers are to pay on the basis of the miles they have travelled .	-9.1748
However , the devices they test are also interesting for road planners , because they do not work with GPS and provide only limited information that is regularly uploaded via modem .	-5.9711
“ People are more willing to participate when their speed and location are not recorded , ” said Ryan Morrison , CEO of True Mileage .	-5.2217
Major mistakes have been made in some of these public pilot programmes .	-2.3849
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways of doing this .	-2.3573
In Oregon , planners experiment with giving drivers a range of choices .	-3.5396
You can choose a device with or without GPS .	-2.0371
Or they do not choose a unit at all and instead pay a lump-sum fee based on the average miles taken by all federal residents .	-5.5134
Other bodies hope to be able to sell the concept of a suspicious public by providing the equipment with more functions than with less .	-5.0147
In New York City , traffic officials want to develop a taxable device that can also pay parking fees , pay insurance only for miles and collect speed data from other vehicles in real time , allowing drivers to avoid congestion .	-7.4187
“ Drivers would be motivated to participate by the added value of the benefits offered by the system , ” says a city planning document .	-3.8954
However , some road planners wonder whether all the talk about paying per mile is not just a huge diversion .	-4.7924
Officials at the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay area said that Congress could solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund simply by raising fuel tax .	-4.0881
An additional one-time fee or annual levy could be imposed on motorists using hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume little petrol , so that they also pay a fair share .	-5.4399
“ There is no reason for an operation if an aspirin is sufficient , ” says Randy Rentzler , the head of the Commission ’ s legislative and public affairs . , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-6.6380
If we do that , hundreds of millions of motorists worry about their privacy and many other things .	-3.1704
Königsfeld : Small Team Strikes Wacker	-3.2475
The voluntary fire brigade handled their autumn rehearsal with flying colours despite the lack of personnel .	-5.5732
Only eleven men took part in the exercise .	-2.1117
Head of department Hans Kammerer had chosen the Feder estate in Burgberger Stra<unk>e in his training acceptance .	-5.6251
A short circuit is supposed to have been formed during sawing .	-4.6562
Two people were injured as a result of the fire and the smoke development , but one of them could send an emergency call .	-5.1609
After Hans Kammerer 's first examination of the situation , two soldiers of the Wehrmacht prepared to enter the building .	-6.1624
After a short period of time it was possible to find the first person and to guide him to the outside .	-5.5530
The second person had to be worn .	-1.3436
This was not so easy as a narrow staircase was also to be overcome .	-4.9245
The building , a workshop with integrated stables for two horses , was not easy to secure .	-2.6000
It stored a lot of wood and also straw balls in it .	-3.9451
There were also electrical machines for woodworking .	-3.3925
The first extinguishing action took place via the tank in the vehicle .	-4.1139
Another line was taken by a flood hydrant about 100 metres away .	-6.0484
Now three ransom attacks have been designed .	-4.5268
A hollow pipe was also used in the building .	-3.5516
Hans Kammerer was also involved in the exercise in showing what is to be done with few staff available .	-6.2932
In case of emergency , support is provided via the daily operations group Königsfeld .	-4.3222
The commander was satisfied with the course of the exercise .	-2.6292
Interlinking Universities and Companies Important	-3.5086
During his visit to the district of Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald , President Guido Wolf of the Province of Titise-Neustadt was able to explain where the workers of tomorrow come from .	-6.4878
In the Förderzentrum Hochschwarzwald he worked with the managing directors of the vocational schools , the district gymnasium and the chair of the parental council on this important issue .	-7.2122
" Education is an important location factor " , underlined Claudia Stelle , director of the Hans-Thoma School , who presented the networked school project Educational Center Hochschwarzwald .	-4.1260
Wolf was impressed by the model projects for education .	-2.6960
Since 2011 there has been a successful cooperation between Förderzentrum , Kreissgymnasium and Berufsschulzentrum in the rolling city .	-4.5408
He also praised the family friendliness of the county .	-3.5162
" It is important not only to have a look at the family phase , but also , due to demographic change , the phase of caring for relatives , " Wolf explained .	-6.0181
He also said that more and more employees took care of the care and care of their families .	-4.2213
" Without the support of employers , the resulting burden on employees can lead to an end to the employment relationship , " Wolf said . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-5.3726
But no one can afford to lose skilled workers , he continued .	-2.2630
Another particularly important factor is the networking of universities and businesses .	-3.3127
" For those who have already experienced the advantages of the region during their studies , with their acquired knowledge and skills often remain in the regional economy , which contributes to the strengthening of the region , " the President of the County convinced himself .	-8.2030
After all , only if sufficient training places were offered would the need for skilled workers be met .	-5.1862
In his opinion , the location advantage of the district is its favourable location in south-west Germany , in the immediate vicinity of France and Switzerland .	-4.4582
In addition , on his train journey from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg , he experienced the efforts already made to develop local public transport .	-5.2218
" Stay stubbornly and make public transport better , " he said to the local politicians present .	-4.9314
Experience an entertaining afternoon with music	-3.4773
For 15 years the Kaul family has been inviting the Dietinger seniors to coffee , cakes and afterwards to a vesper .	-4.4984
In the past , the elderly were served in the resting place .	-5.5190
In the meantime , this afternoon takes place in the St. Josef nursing home .	-4.7875
The locals were looking forward to the delicious cakes and cakes .	-4.9989
Later , there was sausage salad .	-3.6293
Silvia Kimmich and her father , Karl Kimmich , performed with popular melodies .	-6.1448
The more than 100 years old natural stone wall as the front line of the old school house in front of the renovation to the Kirchstra<unk>e is to be put back on the city of Bräunlingen ’ s recovery plan .	-8.3047
In the days before the Kilbig , a small angular wall was built during the first works of the restoration of the front school yard , to stabilize and to relieve the static relief of the over one hundred years old natural stone wall with balustrade .	-9.1376
According to Alexander Misok of Bräunlinger Stadtbauamt , the National Monument Office is to be included in the planning process and a redevelopment plan for the old wall is to be .	-6.9182
After that , a cost calculation is to be carried out by experts , which will then be put on the table for the municipal council to decide and determine how to proceed .	-7.9524
A decision will probably be taken next year .	-3.0589
After the renovation , paving and planting of the old school courtyard within the two wings of the school built in 1912 , the following measures must be followed in the foreseeable future , the wall of limitation in need of renovation must be completely renovated and placed on new premises .	-9.6698
The historic century-old barrier wall of the old school to the Kirchstra<unk>e is mainly due to water and frost damage , as there is no drainage , needs renovation and has an archery tendency towards the front .	-7.8443
Deep cracks in individual stones are evidence of weather damage , but the wall is not at risk of collapse .	-4.9441
A fixed wall is a prerequisite for a school yard used by students , which has been done through the current fortifications .	-6.6472
The school yard renovation was originally planned even in the years 2008 / 2009 , but high unplanned expenditure led to a shift .	-6.8050
An important word in the historical school mausoleum , which has even been used for filming , will be spoken by the National Monument Office .	-6.8985
The city of Bräunlingen hopes to receive subsidies from the conservationists in the event of any guidelines coming from this site .	-8.4637
The students of the Bräunlinger Primary School , who are now taught again in a well-restored old school building with new Aula , can soon use the old school yard .	-6.4280
<unk>zdemir wants to receive jazz education in Stuttgart .	-2.8075
Cem <unk>zdemir , Federal Chairman of the Greens , has now become involved in the ongoing discussions about the future of music schools in Baden-Württemberg .	-4.1156
" I think it is wrong to give up the holistic education at the Musikhochschule Stuttgart , " says <unk>zdemir .	-4.5134
Jazz and classical music belong together at the jazz location Stuttgart .	-4.6252
In this way , <unk>zdemir , who is regarded as the favourite for a direct mandate in the federal election on 22 September , contradicts the Grün-Roten state government .	-6.8046
On the basis of an expert study , this forces a reorganization of the five music schools in Baden-Württemberg .	-4.1909
After that , among other things , the degree programme Jazz and Pop will be relocated from the Stuttgart University of Music to the Mannheim University of Music .	-6.2434
Discovered by the US Border : ' super tunnel ' on drug smuggling .	-5.1612
On the border between Mexico and the US , investigators discovered and shut down a ' super tunnel ' for drug smuggling .	-3.5130
As the US customs authorities announced , the more than 500 meter long tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity , railway tracks , and a ventilation system .	-3.9457
Three suspects were thus arrested , eight tonnes of marijuana and almost 150 kilograms of cocaine seized .	-2.8080
According to the data , the tunnel had not yet been used .	-2.5912
" These cartels are stupid when they think they can dig through under the radar , " said the Attorney General of the US Southern California District , Laura Duffy , at a press conference in front of a warehouse in San Diego , where one end of the tunnel had been discovered .	-5.5052
As Duffy said to the drug gangs , ' If you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them , we are determined to make this a huge waste of your dirty money ' .	-5.0010
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in permanent combat against the drug cartels .	-2.5833
Since 2006 , more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug crime .	-2.0940
Constructed by Experts	-2.0636
Due to the complex equipment of the tunnel , the investigators assume that it was constructed by architects and engineers and that the construction took about a year .	-4.8509
The track system was equipped in such a way that electrically operated could .	-3.8155
On the Mexican side , access is in a building 80 metres from the border .	-3.1711
According to the authorities , a ladder leads 20 meters into the depth to the actual tunnel entrance .	-4.9264
The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 m height and 90 cm width .	-3.1352
It would also have been appropriate to promote illegal immigration towards the United States .	-3.7112
Two of the suspects have been arrested in connection with the Kokai case .	-4.3026
The third , a Mexican , was captured for the confiscated marijuana .	-3.1446
All three are threatened with life imprisonment , as officials have said .	-2.9056
Eight such tunnels had been discovered since 2006 , and the press conference in San Diego continued .	-3.5925
But it is the first time that cocaine has been found in such a tunnel .	-2.9418
Normally cocaine is smuggled in small quantities and not through tunnels .	-2.4377
This shows the " despair " of drug gangs , whose traditional routes are now cut off , Bill Sherman said of the DEA drug search in San Diego .	-5.1977
They would do everything to get to the US .	-2.4964
No details were disclosed to those arrested , at least one being Mexicans , they said .	-7.6084
They have to expect prison sentences of up to ten years .	-3.2348
2014	-3.4903
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250 .	-3.6073
The first written mention is coming closer and closer .	-4.8536
If the year ends in more than eight weeks , the anniversary year is on .	-5.6018
Geisingen und Kirchen-Hausen were first documented together in 794 .	-3.9488
In churches a certificate was produced , in which both places are mentioned .	-4.5810
On 15 March there will be an official start to the anniversary year , and since Geisingen does not currently have a hall , this opening event will take place in the place where both were first mentioned 1250 years ago , in church houses .	-6.8775
As part of the anniversary , several events are planned both in Geisingen and in Kirchen-Hausen .	-5.7360
In July , the 1250 church houses will be held at a festive weekend from 18 to 20 July .	-5.6945
We are celebrating our return .	-3.2200
On Friday with a festival , on Saturday and Sunday with a festival around the Kirchtalhalle .	-3.9395
At the end of this festival there is also the Church-Hausener Kirchenfest .	-5.8005
City Music Director Rudolf Barth has written an order composition for the city on the occasion of the anniversary , which will be performed on three dates .	-5.3191
On the 21st of June , together with the Sonnwende celebration of the Black Forest Association , on the 12th of July in the Arena with fireworks and on the 13th of December , as the first concert of city music in the new Festhalle .	-5.7223
This will be completed and inaugurated in the anniversary year , the official date will be on the last weekend of September , 27 and 28 September .	-5.4200
A new chronicle will also be published on the occasion of the Geisinger anniversary of the city .	-4.8179
" It should be a chronicle not only of Geisingen itself , but a printed work about today 's violin singing , consisting of violinings , church houses , Leipferdingen , Aulfingen and Gutmadingen " , says Mayor Walter Hengstler .	-6.6855
And today ’ s violinism celebrates its 2014 birthday , and today ’ s spaceship was completed in 1974 with its insinuations .	-6.4766
The new chronicle will be presented on 21 or 22 November at the new festival hall in Geisingen .	-3.6227
But 2014 is another year with many anniversaries .	-2.7563
The Narrenzunft Strohglonki begins on 8 February with a traditional evening on the occasion of its 60-year existence , the harmony of Gutmadings becomes 90 years and has the banquet on 29 March and then celebrates the District Music Festival from 1 to 4 May .	-6.7950
The Altenwerk Leipferdingen is 40 years old , the Geisinger Schule has been at the new location for 50 years and celebrates this on May 10 , the Musikverein Polyhymnia Leipferdingen is 150 years old and celebrates this during the Brunnenfest from July 4 to 7 .	-5.7237
The town of Geisingen was first documented in 764 in a gift certificate owned by the St. Gallen Monastery .	-4.0528
The certificate was produced in churches ( houses ) , which was then a court .	-4.6595
Both communities are thus mentioned in the same document .	-2.9922
The reason for celebrating accordingly this 1250 year old in 2014 is , moreover , that municipal reform is 40 years back .	-7.1986
The Council is targeting track systems	-3.9317
Should the railway crossing " Am Hirschen " be extensively rebuilt to increase traffic safety ?	-4.9173
Yes , the municipal councils have decided .	-2.4705
For this , Schiltach has to take EUR 220 000 in hand .	-4.6670
Deutsche Bahn wants to improve the Kinzigtal railway line next year .	-3.1950
In particular , safety at railway crossings is to be increased - there are frequent collisions between trains and other vehicles throughout Germany .	-5.8553
If the municipalities agree to the redevelopment , they will have to participate with a third in the costs , the rest will be shared by the Federal Government .	-7.7617
Schiltach ’ s City Architect Roland Grie<unk>haber explained to the municipal council the peculiarities of the Bah<unk>transition “ Am Hirschen ” .	-5.6051
There , the city plans to build an outbooking at the height of the tunnelly world to the west of the railway tracks .	-7.2967
There , larger vehicles , such as those transporting timber , could also stand in the face of counter-traffic without having to block the tracks .	-6.6213
Grie<unk>haber therefore proposed to construct a necessary support wall in such a way that the city could widen the subsequent road in due course to ensure a smooth flow of traffic .	-5.7623
This was discussed controversially in the municipal council , as some councils questioned the need for street proliferation : Thomas Kipp , in his statement , brought the critics ' mood to the point : ' Do we have to take so much money into our hands for so few vehicles ? '	-8.8598
Mayor Thomas Haas disagreed : The railway crossing " Hirschen " is regularly used for long-distance transport .	-5.1926
Even wood from the area " Kuhbach " is partially transported over this route , because the vehicles up to 20 metres long could not use the route at the Häberlesbrücke because they could not turn into the main road there .	-6.6652
Moreover , the route serves as a diversion for vehicles that cannot use the tunnel when the main road is closed , Haas argued .	-3.9343
As it is clear that Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnels should be rebuilt and renovated , as is currently the case in Wolfach , the railway crossing " Am " Hirschen " could also have an important traffic significance for a longer period of time .	-6.6768
The councils agreed to investigate the costs of the planned extension of the road .	-4.0677
Despite this , the majority agreed to the conversion of the railway crossing with the proviso that the necessary support wall was built in such a way that the city could expand the subsequent road towards " Bahnhofstra<unk>e " to approximately 5.5 metres for congenial traffic .	-8.2956
On the other hand , the conversion of the railway crossing with Gereiz Trautwein could lead to a very different problem , which concerns access to the strongly rising " Geroltzhäuser Weg " .	-7.1537
The administration had the plans for the reconstruction of the railway investigated by the engineer ’ s office Breinlinger , as it had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhäuser Weg would be possible without further ado .	-8.1304
The investigation concluded that it was not possible to rule out the possibility that the slope conditions of the road could lead to longer vehicles being mounted .	-7.9644
The city , in turn , bears responsibility for this as a street paver .	-5.6372
The conversion could result in liability disputes .	-4.9089
Haas argued that since both the wood drain and the bending in the current state of development worked , one should not agree to the conversion of the railway crossing .	-8.1279
Also at this point the risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle standing on the transition is much lower than at the other railway crossings , because there is a good visual connection next to the center stop .	-8.0009
Even trains from the main railway station would have to be so slow that there is no collision threat .	-7.4951
In many cases , the reconstruction of this railway crossing was refused , as the city of Schiltach had to " take the problem out of the hands " with seagoing vehicles , according to the councils , as the railway could withdraw from the responsibility once the construction work has been completed .	-11.3704
The Board considers the changes to the railway crossings " Vor Heubach " and " Vor Kuhbach " , for which crossing agreements have already been made with the railway .	-6.5704
Esa Decides on Big Space : Missions for Billions	-3.5497
Distance planets , gravitational waves or black holes - European Space Agency experts now need to agree on two major projects they want to launch in the next few years .	-4.7992
30 suggestions were available , five are still in the race .	-3.9010
Worlds far away .	-1.3806
Astronomers have already found more than 1000 planets on other stars .	-2.6256
No one knows whether there is life on at least some of them .	-3.5113
The choice is difficult : should you search for gravitational waves ?	-3.5137
Or rather explore the origins of the cosmos ?	-2.6086
Or look for earthly planets and perhaps discover alien life ?	-5.3419
These are the questions that the European Space Agency , Esa , is asking itself .	-9.9804
For their Cosmic Vision programme , they are looking for ideas for two major space projects that are intended to significantly advance research .	-5.8923
The budget for such " L missions " is approximately EUR 1 billion .	-3.2754
The start is expected to be 2028 and 2034 .	-1.8301
In early September , the elite of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions .	-2.5798
30 ideas were under discussion , five of which have now come to a close .	-5.1015
Many bodies look at the proposals and catch up with researchers .	-4.2250
In the next few days a final decision will be made by the scientific programme committee .	-3.3895
A total of four major questions have been selected by the Esa , to which the missions of the 2007 Cosmic Vision programme will find answers .	-5.5321
What are the conditions for the formation of planets and life ?	-2.3351
The exact processes of the formation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus also the formation of planets that circle these stars - are still in the proverbial dark .	-5.8548
A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this darkness .	-2.4099
And if a star owns a planet , under what circumstances can life develop there ?	-3.0855
To address this issue , the Cheops space telescope will launch in 2017 , which will examine more closely 500 already known planetary systems in our vicinity .	-6.4074
But the possibilities are limited , Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros .	-2.7964
With larger instruments , astronomers could map earthly planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres and thus search for " biomarkers " : gases that are considered an indication of biological activity .	-5.0591
How does the solar system work ?	-0.9636
This question , too , is ultimately intended to shed light on the conditions for the emergence of life .	-5.5160
The magnetic activity of a star plays an important role and the interaction of its magnetic field and the particle radiation it produces with the planet system .	-5.1906
In our solar system , these processes can be investigated for example .	-4.0216
With the Solar Orbiter , the Esa has already approved a M-class mission ( where the budget is about half a billion euros ) for this question .	-4.7502
The probe is scheduled to launch in 2017 and monitor the sun ’ s surface and activity closely .	-3.8093
Jupiter and its moons are of great interest to the researchers .	-3.4539
They want to find out what role the giant planet has played in the development of the solar system .	-2.9717
For this purpose , the Esa provides the first of the three L-missions of the Cosmic Vision programme .	-4.2307
The probe " Justice " ( Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer ) is expected to begin its journey in 2022 .	-3.6203
Eight years later , she reached Jupiter and was to investigate the atmosphere of the planet as well as the icy moons of Europe , Kallisto and Ganymed .	-4.5412
What are the basic physical laws of the universe ?	-0.9833
The universe offers many possibilities to study matter under extreme conditions and to examine whether the laws of nature known to us are still valid there .	-4.4668
Perhaps there are also deviations that could lead physicists to a new theory under which all known laws of nature can be united .	-4.9371
How did the universe come about and what does it consist of ?	-2.8919
13.7 billion years ago our cosmos was created by the big bang .	-3.0625
In addition to the familiar matter of stars , planets , and creatures like us , there is Dark Matter , whose gravity holds together galaxies and galaxy clusters , and Dark Energy , which accelerates the expansion of the universe .	-6.0425
So far , researchers do not know which physical laws were valid in the first fractions of the Big Bang , nor what Dark Matter and Dark Energy consist of .	-5.5082
With " Euclid " , the Esa has already approved an M mission , which is scheduled to start in 2020 .	-4.5803
With a special telescope , the probe will investigate the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time in the entire sky , thus enabling conclusions about the nature of Dark Matter and Dark Energy .	-6.3219
Who could Race	-1.9134
Of the 30 proposals , only two will remain at the end of the selection process .	-2.3288
In the opinion of many experts " E-Lisa " , the best chances for an L mission to be granted is an ambitious concept for detecting gravitational waves .	-6.1967
Physicists mean changes in the structure of space time that Albert Einstein predicted almost 100 years ago .	-3.6273
To this day , they have not been shown . were .	-4.0614
Elisa could do that , the scientists hope behind the project .	-2.9050
The mission provides for a detector consisting of two or three probes located in space .	-4.2749
In contrast to plants on Earth , it could also provide evidence of gravitational waves created during the Big Bang , providing new insights into the emergence of the cosmos .	-6.4406
Four more proposals are still competing for the second L-mission : a large X-ray telescope called " Athena " , which is to explore black holes among other things , " Icy Planets " , another mission to the outer planets of the solar system , " Prism " , a mission to measure the cosmic background radiation , and the " Exoplanet Finder " , which is to detect and investigate earthy planets .	-6.0136
Among other things , suggestions have already been made to transport samples back from Mars , to explore moon , Venus and asteroids , and to solar physics .	-7.9724
Snowden willing to “ cooperate ” with Germany on US surveillance .	-2.6194
Edward Snowden , the whistleblower of the US secret service , has declared that he is prepared to travel to Berlin and to issue an announcement before the German Bundestag if the American National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander do not provide answers to their activities .	-5.4403
German MEP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden on Thursday in Russia , where he received asylum to discuss with him the statement in Germany . were . were . were . were . were . were . were . were .	-7.7207
In a letter from Snowden , presented by Ströbele to the media in Berlin on Friday , he writes : “ Even though the result of my efforts has been demonstrably positive , my government continues to treat dissent as a fidelity , trying to criminalize political expression with a threat of punishment , where no defence is possible . ”	-6.4550
But telling the truth is not a crime .	-1.6421
In the letter , Snowden writes that he is convinced that the international community ’ s support can convince the American government to drop the charges against him .	-4.3053
The indictment issued by the US Department of Justice includes state property espionage and theft .	-3.3798
German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich said to Time Online : “ If Mr Snowden is prepared to talk to German representatives , then we will find ways to make this possible . ”	-4.4243
Relations between the US and Germany are strained by claims that the NSA has left Chancellor Angela Merkel ’ s mobile phone .	-4.0846
Thomas Oppermann , the Member who heads the parliamentary committee responsible for the secret service , said that it should take the opportunity to listen to Snowden as a witness , if possible , ‘ without endangering him and completely destroying relations with the US ’ .	-6.1032
Ströbele , a member of the Greens , published an image of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed .	-2.4567
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia .	-1.7131
Ströbele explained that , according to the former NSA employee Snowden ’ s lawyer , he could not return to Russia if he left the country .	-3.6666
When Snowden says in Germany , he needs an assurance that he is “ safe , ” he says .	-4.3715
In his letter , Snowden stated that he would face a “ serious and ongoing ” campaign of persecution that drove him out of his homeland .	-5.0224
But it is touched by the global response to “ my act of political expression . ”	-3.1340
Citizens around the world , as well as senior politicians – including in the United States – have described the revelations about an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance as a benefit to the general public .	-5.2472
In his letter , Snowden makes an offer of cooperation to the German authorities “ if the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation have been resolved ” .	-3.7622
Frontier Airlines charges cabin baggage	-1.7792
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $ 100 of passengers who wish to stow hand baggage on their flight .	-3.8151
Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to $ 100 for one piece of hand baggage and $ 2 for coffee or lemonade , even though the announcement on Wednesday read that passengers should keep the full dose .	-5.0472
The new fee applies to hand baggage in the baggage compartment above the seat , and small bags under the seat are still free of charge .	-4.5040
Frontier explained that it will charge US $ 25 if the fee is paid in advance , and $ 100 for travellers who paid at the boarding gate .	-5.6582
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O 'Malley said that the fee of $ 100 aims to move travelers to take care of payment in advance .	-5.1010
“ We don ’ t want to calculate this sum , ” she explained .	-2.3532
Airlines started charging for the first and second checked baggage in 2008 .	-3.0342
Passengers who tried to avoid them have therefore taken as much of their hand baggage as possible , which means that the baggage compartments above the seat are often overfilled .	-6.6150
Fees are one way of getting passengers to take less on board .	-3.1154
O 'Malley said that the new fee is not really about making money .	-2.0299
It is about Frontier ’ s most loyal customers , who would have clearly stated that it would be increasingly difficult to find a place above the seat .	-5.7191
Passengers who buy their tickets on the airline ’ s website do not have to pay .	-2.8657
This means that a Frontier passenger may be allowed to take one piece of baggage free of charge , but the next person will have to pay $ 100 for a comparable piece of baggage .	-5.1030
O 'Malley stated that Frontier 's website and check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers were informed of the fee before they came to the boarding gate .	-5.0427
The new hand baggage fee from Frontier will only enter into force in the summer ; there is no exact date yet .	-4.8340
Passengers often boil over baggage charges and other charges , but airlines are happy to resort to them .	-5.1773
They argue that the transportation of baggage costs money and passengers should pay for this service if they wish .	-5.9662
Many on Wall Street view the new baggage charges as a sign that airlines are taking enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of loss .	-3.4576
However , most have so far left the finger at cabin baggage charges .	-5.1459
Spirit Airlines Inc. was the first person to charge hand baggage three years ago , and thereafter Allegiant Air , also a low-cost airline .	-5.4643
The only other airline with such a charge is the Hungarian Wizz Air , explained airline consultant Jay Sorensen , who closely monitors the additional charges .	-4.1911
He estimated in a December 2011 report that Spirit ’ s hand baggage charge would raise $ 50 million annually .	-4.0437
Sorensen , formerly a leader of Midwest Airlines , recently flown with Spirit and was curious about what would be expected of him at the boarding gate if passengers were faced with the company ’ s unusual hand baggage charge .	-5.7241
“ The boarding process was one of the smoothiest I have experienced in my aviation career , ” he said .	-3.7316
I expected to see teeth and handy discussions at the boarding gate .	-2.8930
“ The plane was full , ” he explained , “ and boarding ran like lubricated . ”	-3.2597
Frontier also follows Spirit in the $ 2 required for coffee , tea , lemonade or juice .	-4.5873
The company explained that passengers who bought lemonade or juice would keep the whole dose and coffee would be refilled for free .	-6.3014
Water is still free .	-1.2287
In 2008 , US Airways briefly tried to demand money for soft drinks , but reversed it seven months later , after complaining to passengers and no other large company was following .	-7.0398
Frontiers ’ step to charge hand baggage if passengers do not buy directly from the airline is the latest initiative to direct customers to their own website .	-4.6600
Airlines pay online travel agencies such as Orbitz US $ 10 to $ 25 per ticket sold .	-3.2564
This gives all companies an incentive to move passengers to buy directly with them instead of using an online travel agency .	-5.4368
Frontier , however , has gone furthest in this area .	-2.7139
In September , the company started to award only half as many frequent flyer miles when booking through an online travel agency .	-3.5906
On Wednesday , miles were cut once again to 25 % of the route .	-3.9834
A flight booked with a third party carrier with Frontier over 1000 miles will therefore only bring customers 250 miles .	-5.9735
Passengers can also reserve seats only when purchasing directly on the Frontier website .	-3.7686
Frontier has a loyal customer base at its headquarters in Denver , but the business is shrinking and the company is losing money .	-3.5281
Revenue declined by 9 % , and flight capacity shrank by just under 13 % in the first quarter , as can be seen in the financial report published on Wednesday by the parent company , Republic Airways Holdings Inc .	-6.0166
Republic has tried to get Frontier 's finances under control as part of the sale of society .	-4.4381
Proverbs from the Bible	-2.4598
About 40 women attended this year ’ s last women ’ s breakfast in the Protestant parish of Bisingen .	-4.3120
The theme of the day in the Municipal House was " Spears from the Bible " and " Speeches from the Middle Ages " .	-4.4736
After breakfast , Zita Köhler , the chairman of the Council of Churches , addressed the biblical proverbs in a lecture .	-4.9592
" Say words contain wisdom , rules , or warnings , " she explained .	-9.0437
She compared several proverbs with the corresponding biblical points and explained the meaning .	-3.6332
She called sayings such as : Wooden eye is vigilant , as scales fall from the eyes , cast an eye on someone who gives his own is the Lord in sleep to wash his hands of innocence .	-15.2168
On several occasions , the speaker also told her listeners what the saying was .	-4.4792
The speeches from the Middle Ages were accepted by the church community priest Christel Dehner : All good things are three , make blue , look a little .	-8.6193
She explained the meaning and origin of the speeches she called ' bridges to the past ' .	-3.6411
Finally , a raffle was raffled .	-2.9827
The prizes were hidden on a table and were described humorously before they were handed over to the winners .	-4.8296
Roman Waisenegger , the mayor candidate for the breakfast round , was also among the visitors .	-6.0302
Learning rather than unemployment : pilot project for unskilled people in tourism	-3.6845
At the Mecklenburgische Seenplatte a pilot project for the tourism industry is starting today .	-4.2676
Under the leadership of the Federal Employment Agency , 49 women and men who are already working as unskilled in the industry are to be qualified as professionals for hotels and restaurants over three winters .	-5.3492
" What 's new is that the six-month courses end with qualifications , " said Carmen Wiechert of the employment agency Neubrandenburg .	-4.5156
The benefits are manifold : participants would not be unemployed , firms would receive skilled workers who were increasingly lacking in hotels and restaurants , and the Agency would not have to finance unemployment .	-5.5180
The project also includes the Chamber of Commerce in Neubrandenburg and the German Hotel and Restaurant Association ( Dehoga ) Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania .	-3.8371
NSA explains that an “ internal error , ” not hackers , is to blame for the site crash .	-3.8192
The shadowy National Security Agency said late Friday that a mistake had paralysed their public website for a few hours , not hackers , as was claimed online .	-5.1036
“ NSA.gov was unreachable for a few hours this night because an internal error occurred during a planned update , ” the spy agency explained in an email message .	-5.0985
The problem will be fixed this evening .	-1.6195
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed denial of service attack ( DDoS ) is not true .	-2.0373
In the early hours of the evening , online server trackers noticed that the NSA website was unavailable for at least six hours , and that is still not for some users .	-4.9501
Previously , a NSA spokesman told ABC News that the agency ’ s sensitive internal network was “ in no way compromised . ”	-3.3229
Secret information is not in danger , the speaker said .	-3.3313
At least one group of hackers claimed to have paralyzed the NSA website with a DDoS attack .	-3.1655
In such attacks , the target website is flooded with page calls until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses .	-4.5125
Cyber-tactics are relatively simple , and the attacks do not serve to penetrate the internal network of the target system .	-6.9331
The former super-secret NSA , which was once called No Search Agency ( No such agency ) , is now in the light of the public ’ s eyes , exposed to sharp criticism in recent months of revelations about its extensive domestic and international surveillance program – a result of the secret NSA data stolen and published by the disenchanted former NSA employee Edward Snowden .	-10.4314
The growing controversy over the secret service fueled initial speculation that the incident today was the result of a targeted cyperal operation .	-4.1600
The number of people without jobs fell slightly in October by 22 to 1,307 .	-2.8295
Although the ratio was 3.1 % better than last year and also better than in September , " we would have hoped for more , " says Monika Felder-Bauer , deputy head of the employment agency in Sonthofen .	-5.8821
Many companies have reacted to recruitment so far .	-3.8790
One reason for this , according to Felder-Bauer , is that we have hardly any skilled workers in the craft sector , in the health sector and in the care of the elderly .	-6.0531
As a result of the year , job offers for staff in the hotel and restaurant industry have been running again since September .	-6.9640
The winter season starts in mid-December .	-2.6704
The complete background report can be found in the Allgäuer display sheet of 31.10.2013 ( page 33 ) .	-4.0888
Loss in Bombardier ’ s earnings after falling sales and orders	-4.5464
On Thursday , Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15 % decline in net profit after falling orders and deliveries of third quarter aircraft and contract problems in the railway segment had come under pressure .	-6.7675
Bombardier , based in Montreal , did not publish any flight test data for his brand new CSeries aircraft , nor did he give any further information as to whether the aircraft could enter commercial use next September in accordance with the ambitious timetable .	-6.6078
At the maiden flight of the test aircraft a month and a half ago , only three more launches have been followed , which makes it questionable whether the test phase is proceeding as planned .	-6.3778
The results fell short of the forecasts and resulted in a fall of more than eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange .	-5.4215
Cameron Doerksen , an analyst at National Bank Financial , lowered his assessment of “ outperformance ” to “ sector performance ” on Thursday , with a view to limiting the share price potential in the next one to two quarters .	-6.0996
“ While weaker aircraft deliveries were expected to be as close as possible , we are clearly disappointed by the margin development in the transport sector , ” said Doerksen in a customer ’ s letter .	-7.3199
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries when the aircraft test program moves ahead .	-3.9919
But if no new orders are announced in the coming months , we expect the market to become more skeptical of the program .	-3.2572
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft series will be able to catapult the company into the lower market segment currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus .	-3.5931
The first test aircraft was presented to the public in March and flew in September after months of delays .	-3.0190
But , to date , binding orders for CSeries are moderate at 177 , as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests to see whether the company ’ s claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost savings potential for the new jet aircraft are true .	-6.5187
Currently there are a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies .	-2.6006
Chairman of the Board of Directors , Pierre Beaudoin , is confident that Bombardier will reach its target of 300 binding orders at the beginning of the commercial use of the aircraft .	-4.7435
On Thursday , the company ’ s management assured analysts and the media that the programme was scheduled .	-4.9607
“ The test aircraft was no longer on the ground than expected , ” Beaudoin said at a telephone conference , adding that ground tests and software updates were scheduled during the aircraft ’ s lifetime .	-4.9317
Each manufacturer plans differently .	-2.1164
We have decided to take a first flight and then set up an overhaul period , which we have done .	-5.8873
This is happening throughout the programme .	-2.6580
The second of five test aircraft is expected to start in the next few weeks , the other shortly thereafter , said from the company side .	-5.3496
However , analysts remain sceptical about whether , twelve months after the maiden flight , the first customer can start a CSeries aircraft .	-4.1993
Bombardier explained that it is reviewing the planning for the commissioning ( EIS ) and will update it in the coming months .	-4.0580
“ The slow progress of the flight test – even though it seems to be in line with Bombardier ’ s internal planning – reinforces our view that commissioning will shift to the first quarter of 2015 , ” said Doerksen .	-5.8627
In the third quarter at the end of September 30 , Bombardier ’ s net profit fell to $ 147 million , or 8 cents per share of $ 172 million , or 9 cents per share a year earlier .	-4.2180
The adjusted earnings per share remain 9 cents .	-2.6613
Sales decreased slightly from 4.2 billion dollars to 4.1 billion dollars .	-2.8398
Analysts expected a profit of 10 cents per share and a turnover of 4.56 billion dollars , said Thomson Reuters I / B / E / S.	-3.2359
The world ’ s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer states that he delivered 45 aircraft this quarter , a 57 decrease last year .	-3.8028
Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26 .	-1.1297
The order book in the aerospace business was $ 32.9 billion on 30 September , unchanged from December 31 .	-4.2755
“ In the aerospace sector , the results were in line with our specifications , but the low order intake and overall market conditions were disappointing , ” said Beaudoin .	-4.5349
Revenues in the aerospace business fell 13 % to $ 2 billion .	-2.9993
Bombardier , the world ’ s largest railway manufacturer , announced that sales in this segment increased by just under 11 % to $ 2.1 billion .	-3.6710
The order book in the Transport Division amounted to $ 32.6 billion on 30 September , slightly higher than on 31 December .	-3.8914
The profit margin in the transport sector has been affected by settlement problems in some large contracts .	-4.1584
According to corporate management , there will be new targets for the fourth quarter .	-3.4079
In the afternoon trade on Thursday , the Bombardier share lagged 8.5 % and was $ 4.83 Canadian , after it was also announced that Google ’ s chief financial officer Patrick Pichette will move to the board .	-7.2019
The Brazilian Embraer SA , the world ’ s third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier ’ s closest rival , reported a 10 % decline in quarterly profits on Thursday .	-3.2695

As the airport management announced via Twitter , the incident began at 9.30 a.m. ( local time ) .	-3.6935
The access roads were closed , which , according to CNN , resulted in long backlogs .	-5.9076
Except for landings , air traffic had been suspended temporarily .	-3.5562
However , several planes were also visible on CNN at startup .	-4.8892
Terminal 3 is mainly operated by smaller US airlines .	-2.3768
The LAX airport in Los Angeles is the largest airport in the United States .	-3.0538
Kokai-dependent lawyer , who warned drug bosses against police investigation , must go to prison .	-4.6622
Basharat Ditta , 42 , gave information to sub-world size Neil Scarborough .	-3.2250
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction might come to light .	-3.3164
He was sentenced to three years in prison by Liverpool Crown Court .	-1.6117
A well-known criminal defender , who warned a drug baron against a large police investigation , fearing that his secret drug addiction could be exposed , was sentenced to three years in prison .	-4.8439
Basharat Ditta , 42 , provided Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about his drug trafficking activities after being compromised by his own cocaine addiction .	-3.2020
Criminalists ’ “ first class ” lawyer , nicknamed “ Bash , ” was arrested in his house in 2011 after police surveillance in Scarborough , whom he had represented in a previous drug trial .	-6.3333
Officials watched Scarborough ( 32 ) deliver three bags of cocaine at the lawyer 's house in Blackburn , Lancashire , while he was with colleagues at a bar meal .	-4.4744
The investigation revealed that Ditta regularly used Class A drugs after testing traces of cocaine in his hair , wallet and credit cards had been found .	-4.7552
For a period of eight months between January and August 2011 , he tried to obtain illicit information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners .	-3.2672
All four suspects were then monitored by the police in a major investigation into the heroin and cocaine trade in Lancashire , Cumbria , Merseyside , Berkshire , and West Yorkshire .	-3.3409
Together with 32 other people , they were later arrested after the police secured <unk> 1.5 million worth of heroin and cocaine in a series of house searches and <unk> 200,000 in cash .	-6.5295
Ditta , 42 , passed on information to the criminals , fearing that his drug addiction could become public .	-3.7537
Today , Ditta , who is working for Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn , was found guilty and convicted at the Liverpool Crown Court on two counts for obstruction of justice after a three-week trial .	-5.8535
He admitted the cocaine ownership at a previous survey .	-4.4405
The lawyer was transferred after the police found out in their investigation of Scarborough that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011 .	-3.5649
Two investigators followed the suspect and saw how he went to Ditta ’ s house and put the drugs under the bar ’ s dustbin with a purity of 60 % in a black golf glove .	-5.3093
Scarborough had a regular telephone call with Ditta , who was at dinner at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park .	-6.3606
The lawyer returned home , took the drugs and then nine communications were exchanged between the two .	-2.7632
In court , it became known that Ditta was a “ regular consumer ” of cocaine after tests of class A drugs discovered in his hair , wallet , and credit cards .	-5.4286
Ditta was later arrested , but refused to take cocaine and said that he had spoken to the alleged dealer because he was his client , claiming that their discussion was subject to “ legal secrecy . ”	-5.1506
During his arrest , Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards , but they were assured and he was taken from a hair sample .	-3.7282
In police interrogation , he stated that he had an office both at his private address and at work and that clients would call him home for legal matters .	-5.9276
In the court , it became known that he had called on important actors in drug trafficking , some of whom he had previously represented , after significant arrests and informed them of what the investigators knew about them .	-6.3262
Attorney Anne Whyte said , “ A criminal lawyer should know better than anyone else that the law is not broken . ”	-3.8547
Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal defender because he has admitted too much to certain clients .	-5.0578
The relationship in question is not simply that of a drug dealer , but of a drug dealer who provides his lawyer with drugs .	-4.3922
Some of his communications were undoubtedly legitimate , because he was the lawyer of these people .	-3.9851
But that went far beyond the bounds of a normal relationship between lawyer and client .	-2.9623
He acted as far as possible against the police investigation so that they could continue their criminal activities .	-5.1064
Mr Ditta thus brought his profession into disrepute .	-3.4170
He was too close to certain clients , particularly Scarborough , and he allowed his independence to be compromised .	-2.6243
Ditta dismissed any misconduct , claiming , “ If I were a corrupt lawyer , which I am not , and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough , I would not wait 15 hours , but do so immediately . ”	-5.0582
But after the hearing , Superintendent Lee Halstead of the Lancashire police said , “ Mr Ditta took the step from a criminal defender to a criminal when he began to buy drugs from organized criminals . ”	-4.5960
His cocaine addiction led to a hopeless compromise and made him susceptible to the motives of leading members of organized crime who asked him to obtain valuable information on police investigations .	-4.8428
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and provide public confidence and confidence .	-2.6276
Ditta has betrayed this trust and tried to hide behind the fa<unk>ade of his profession .	-3.9620
The Lancashire Serious and Organised Crime Unit led the investigation into Ditta , which also resulted in a conviction in three cases concerning the possession of cocaine and the obstruction of justice , which underlines our determination to bring criminals to justice .	-5.2573
This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that no one can escape the arm of the law .	-2.8969
We will find you and take you to court .	-1.8898
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after he declared himself guilty of conspiracy to heroin , cocaine , and cannabis .	-4.6239
Thirty-five people involved in drug trafficking were sentenced to 153 years in total for drug offences .	-3.9992
On his website , Ditta published an area of questions and answers about himself , in which he said that his dream job was to represent a lawyer on death row in America , his ultimate guest at dinner was Mohammed Ali and inequality of opportunity was the motivation for his work .	-5.9745
Revolutionary work of church music	-1.9541
At the end of the festivities on the occasion of its 160-year existence , the Liederkranz Dunningen will frame two services with the " Deutsche Messe " by Franz Schubert .	-4.9053
After the great success of the musical " Rock my Life " , which attracted the audience in the spring of this year , the Liederkranz will enrich two services with the performance of the Deutsches Messe by Franz Schubert at the end of the jubilee year .	-5.3456
On Saturday , 26 October , this extraordinary fair will be held from 19 during the evening fair in the St. Martinus Church of Dunningen and on Sunday , 27 October , from 10 : 15 at the worship service in the St. John Baptist Church in Lackendorf .	-7.5095
The so-called Deutsche Messe with the original title " Songs for the Celebration of the Holy Sacrifice of the Fair " , D 872 , is a spiritual music work of composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was considered almost revolutionary at the time of its creation .	-5.8995
The exhibition will be performed within the scope of the services , as the customer Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind .	-5.4654
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider , the choir is accompanied by the brass group of the music association Frohsinn Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi at the organ .	-3.5394
Haslach ’ s Conspiracy	-4.1489
For example , with the 2015 election to the Parish Community Council , basic principles will change in the Haslach ( SE ) unit of . are , , , and .	-8.0532
There is only one parish council for all six parishes .	-3.6816
At a joint meeting on Saturday , the Haslach , Hofstetten , Mühlenbach , Fischerbach , Steinach and Welschenstein were preparing for the changes .	-3.8430
After all , there is nothing to change the basic decisions of the diocese and it is up to the parish councils to implement them as satisfactorily as possible .	-5.9936
In the course of the day , it became particularly clear : skepticism about the new is slowly giving way to confidence .	-5.3329
From the ideas and expectations of the innovations in 2015 to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the parish council , the highly constructive discussions between the six bodies with the main staff of the ministry were enough .	-6.8013
Regionaldekan Georg Schmitt explained on the basis of a presentation the new guidelines for rescue units in the Archdiocese of Freiburg .	-4.9665
After that , SE Haslach as a parish will in future form a body of public law that enters into the rights and duties of the previous six church communities .	-6.7996
There will only be a common parish council and a foundation council in which the parish priest is represented .	-4.7930
At least two elected members are to be represented from each parish ; in the six parishes there are so-called local teams .	-4.8730
In future , their task will be to promote church life in the village .	-5.2872
The question of the finances of the individual parish community then showed considerable need for discussion .	-5.2056
The innovations provide that accumulated funds in the parishes are retained for purpose .	-7.0672
The liabilities , on the other hand , pass to the entire community .	-3.8396
There was great concern , particularly with regard to the large planned investments , the commitment of which would then be met by all parishes .	-7.4041
" In the past , too , investment was only made in projects that could be managed by the individual parishes on their own , " said Haslach ’ s parish chairman Bruno Prinzbach .	-8.4318
Practical experience with a joint panel for five parishes described Barbar Ritter , the chairman of the panel in the Schutterwald-Neuried maritime care unit .	-5.3691
In 2006 , they set themselves the task of ' becoming one , staying five ' and found that this is not so easy at all .	-5.5330
The bodies of the Haslach Seafood Unit then set out to answer questions about the future composition and size of the common parish council and the practical work of the community teams .	-7.0369
The preparations will be made concrete in further meetings and will be decided at another joint meeting of all six bodies next spring .	-5.9423
In the end , the parish council Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the ministry unit , which was approved by a clear majority .	-5.0853
Electricity in Pfullendorf is becoming more expensive .	-2.8129
The citizens of Pfullendorf must adjust to higher electricity costs .	-2.8881
As the managing director of the Stadtwerke , Jörg-Arne Bias , has confirmed to the S<unk>DKURIER , a four-headed Pfullendorfer family has an additional cost of 70 to 90 euros per year .	-5.9104
The major reason for the price increase is the increase in the EEG levy from 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt-hour .	-4.6689
Each year in October , the four operators of the large electricity routes reassigned this levy .	-6.2782
These figures the additional costs arising from the energy transition , which they can raise by a levy above the electricity price .	-6.2230
The Pfullendorf Stadtwerke are the last link in this chain .	-2.7714
The Supervisory Board of the energy company even assumed a higher levy in its forecasts , as reported by Jörg Arne Bias .	-3.8982
Now the concrete figures would have to be calculated before next week ’ s works could inform their customers about the exact price increase .	-5.8880
" We expect an increase of 1 cent plus x , " says Bias , with the number closer to 2 cents .	-5.2129
Beware of waiting periods	-4.2989
Sometimes a traffic light simply does not turn green .	-3.2709
The contact loop in the street does not react , or the light sign is broken .	-2.5504
What should you do then - drive with red ?	-5.2363
After long enough waiting at a red light and the crossing is free , he can continue , explained Ralf Becker in the magazine " Motorrad " .	-5.9244
However , the waiting time must be ' appropriate ' , which can be interpreted differently from case to case .	-3.8506
Becker advises you to hold out at least five minutes before starting a malfunction of the light .	-6.1219
However , if you continue the journey in spite of red light , you must be aware that you are entirely responsible for an accident .	-6.5948
Anyone who tolerates less than five minutes may not wait long enough , warns Becker and points to a decision by the Supreme Court Hamm .	-3.6121
In the negotiated case , a driver ignored the traffic lights after about three minutes of continuous red light and had to answer for a negligent red light breach .	-7.6273
After all , the traffic light was not broken , but turned to green a little later .	-5.6711
He was spared a driving ban because of the special situation - but not a fine .	-5.4503
Municipal Council Happens for Sound Budget	-4.5773
Whenever municipal council meetings are concerned with the budget , mayor Ralph Gerster has laughed well .	-4.6260
The community sack in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and debt has not been known to the administration since 2005 .	-5.1935
The 2012 financial year can also be seen as a full success in this respect .	-4.1085
This became clear when the annual accounts for 2012 were presented .	-3.5582
As Andrea Rothmund explained , the administrative budget was more than EUR 7.6 million higher than planned .	-3.7524
The surplus of the administrative budget , with around EUR 1.8 million , was also around EUR 1 million above the approach .	-5.0333
The surplus was mainly due to higher commercial tax revenues and the local share of income tax .	-5.2402
The wealth budget was also well above the projected levels .	-5.1359
Last year , instead of the EUR 1.5 million envisaged , it was EUR 2.5 million .	-3.5386
" This is essentially due to the increased administration budget , " says Rothmund .	-4.7891
As less investment was made than planned in the 2012 financial year , the collection of reserves was also higher .	-5.9596
Overall , the overall reserve was increased by around EUR 2.1 million to a total of EUR 4.9 million .	-3.1010
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for their good work .	-1.8055
" Such a work is not simply shaken out of the sleeve , " Gerster praised with regard to the annual accounts .	-5.6450
He and the municipal councils were obviously delighted with the good figures .	-4.0127
It may sound paradoxical , but it is precisely these good figures that citizens could soon be expensive .	-5.1073
Due to the good financial situation , the municipality has been able to forego high rates in the past .	-6.1945
In turn , according to Gerster , subsidies have often been cut from the country .	-4.7160
These subsidies from various compensatory levels are subject to conditions .	-4.3252
Among other things , cities and municipalities that apply for grants must have certain budgets .	-4.8733
" We have to look at the issue of heaps , because in the coming years there will be investments for which we would like to receive subsidies , " Gerster said .	-6.3723
Nagold : Hugo Werkstatter for 60 years in the Choir	-3.5272
With 60 years as a singer , Hubert Wermter ’ s story at the men ’ s association Cäcilia is almost twice as long as that of the autumn festival in which he was celebrated .	-6.2053
As usual , Hubert Wertner was on stage in the colors of his men ’ s singing group .	-6.0399
Even after 60 years he still enjoys singing with a choir that is now more than loved .	-6.3013
The club also had offices , including 28 years as a member of the committee .	-4.8714
He received several awards for his commitment and commitment to the association : Jörg Kohr , pastoral speaker on behalf of the Cäcilienverband Rottenburg-Stuttgart , gave him a certificate of honour - since the choir is also a church choir - and a letter of honour signed by Bishop Gebhard Fürst .	-6.8520
His fellow singers handed him the certificate of the German choral association and a engraved tin plate .	-4.0132
In addition to the award , the 31st autumn festival took place on a regular basis : with the MGV Vieh , the Liederkranz Salzstetten , the Sängerabteilung Baisingen and the local Musikverein , the Vollmaringer had loaded a colourful mix of different choirs and vocal styles , which included around 400 visitors .	-7.9282
The MGV Vollmaringen opened with atmospheric songs like " Im Weinparadies " and " Lustig , ihr Brüder " .	-4.2782
Her honor singer Hubert Wertem prepared for her a little ceremony - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart 's " Bundeslied " .	-7.6905
The men ’ s singing club Vie also sang classical choral songs such as " Jägerwerbung " by Julius Wengert , " Weit , weil weg " by Hubert Goisern and the folk song " When you go through the valley " .	-6.0621
The Salzstetten Song Crane , with its mixed choir and group of women - the " Impulse " - ensured the women 's quota of the festival .	-6.4206
The mixed choir , with the Neapolitan folk style " Santa Lucia " and " Eviva Espana " by Antos Gus , escaped to foreign countries , while the " Impulse " also resorted to foreign languages : " Liberatio " and " Hey Jude " were part of their program .	-6.7398
The Sängerabteilung des Baisinger Sportvereins came back with " What isch der Schwob ? " by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Papperts " Bierlied " back to the local scene , where the Fullmaringer Musikverein offered the crowning musical conclusion .	-7.2864
For the children there was a small programme - " Grandma Hanne " alias Hannelore Stollsteimer performed a Kaspersltheater and read a few stories about the children working for lunch .	-6.2688

It will be delivered to the kindergarten on the agreed day and will be processed directly by the helpers .	-3.2341
Helpers can be parents , grandparents , friends , clubs and , of course , the educators and children themselves .	-2.8432
Kenya ’ s press is outraged by controversial media law	-2.9181
“ We are in a frightening situation , and one may ask oneself : what does Parliament think of simply abolishing judicial independence tomorrow ? ” was read in the newspaper , which considers the draft law to be unconstitutional .	-7.2518
“ The law is draconian and very punitive , and we reject it , ” said Cyrus Kamau , Capital Group ’ s managing director , including CapitalFM , one of Kenya ’ s most prestigious independent radio stations and news sites .	-4.5110
He said that the new media tribunal “ will always be biased , because it is an extended arm of the government ” , and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya ’ s position in the global economy .	-5.3933
“ I hope the President listens to us and we appeal to him to reject this draft law and send it back to Parliament , ” he said .	-3.1636
According to The Star newspaper , the government is “ effectively putting the media in a stranglehold ” by means of the new law , whereas The Standard , Democracy and Freedom of Speech in Kenya has “ suffered a severe blow , ” and dubbed the draft “ draconian . ”	-7.4485
The adoption of the law is part of a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security following the attacks by armed Islamists on the West gate shopping centre in September .	-4.1113
The Kenyan media stirred up the authorities ’ anger by publishing photographs of security cameras showing how the units sent to the scene supposedly robbed the luxury shopping mall .	-6.7481
Police chief David Kimaiyo responded by ordering two journalists and a leading media representative , even though the subpoena was withdrawn after a media outcry .	-4.1615
According to the new law , media houses can be fined by up to 20 million Kenyan shillings , and individual journalists with up to a million and the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation .	-5.3534
The Tribunal also has the right to confiscate the property of those affected if a penalty is not paid .	-3.2552
According to the Daily Nation , “ a single punishment can push most radio stations into bankruptcy . ”	-4.6200
Moreover , the newspaper believes that these measures could have a devastating effect on what they describe as Kenya ’ s “ vibrant blogosphere . ”	-3.6873
If they silenced the media , politicians could do whatever they want with impunity .	-2.5950
“ No one will ever know , ” wrote Mutuma Mathiu , a national journalist who calls the Kenyan media a crucial factor in public control .	-5.1517
“ Leave politicians to themselves , drive the country into bankruptcy , and return to the time of hunters and collectors , ” he commented .	-4.8531
Kenyan lawmakers have already raised public anger .	-4.2553
In May , they agreed to reverse the cuts imposed by the National Compensation Commission , and reinstated their deft salaries of around 532,000 shillings tax-free per month – among the highest in the world .	-9.4012
Bad Dürrheim : A Dream Comes for the FC	-3.0717
In spite of the cold weather and the rain , the official opening ceremony for the artificial turf sport was not lost in importance for the city and the football club .	-7.3963
I think everyone wanted a more pleasant holiday last Saturday , but Peter didn 't want to play with it .	-6.3175
Thus , all those who came without an umbrella or could not keep one for any reason .	-6.3144
This was done to the musicians who surrounded the festival , as well as to many speakers .	-5.8521
Nass was therefore also the chairman of the FC , Albrecht Schlenker , who spoke of fulfilling a dream .	-5.0534
His thanks were mainly due to Mayor Walter Klumpp , who was strongly involved in the implementation of the project , the municipal council , the companies involved and the association members who took part .	-7.5706
Especially Lothar Held , Paul Weizenegger , Heiner Gail and Peter Graf .	-2.4951
The wealthy pensioners moved 400 square meters of pavement for the new roads .	-4.9862
This remarkable voluntary commitment was also appreciated by Mr Rombach , a member of the parliament .	-5.3937
Further comments were made to the urban sports committee Hubert Baier , the district chairman of the South African Football Association , Kuno Kayan , and Friedrich Knorr of the planning office , who announced a donation to the club ’ s youth department .	-6.6798
Mayor Klumpp reminded us that recurring weather influences in spring and autumn put the original lawn square in such a way that it could not be played .	-6.4780
Fifteen years ago , we had the first thoughts on how to solve the problem when we thought about building a third place at the football club or at the Salinensee Realschule .	-7.0086
Both were rejected .	-2.2126
Six years ago , there were thoughts about setting up an artificial turf playground , which was generally considered to be the ultimate solution .	-6.2263
Concrete plans were launched two years ago , when the FC took over the Schabelstube in Erbpacht , promised a cost share of EUR 100 000 for the construction of the square and approved funding of EUR 104 000 .	-6.0740
In October 2012 , the Municipal Council decided to take over the remaining EUR 356 000 in the total cost of EUR 560 000 , Klumpp summarized .	-4.1620
The construction of the 68 by 108 m artificial turf site began on 4 June .	-5.4300
During the three-month construction phase , 3000 cubic metres of soil were deposited , half of which was used for the installation of a dirt bike track .	-6.0321

On the subject of transport , which is not on the agenda this Friday , the SPD confirmed its opposition to a car toll demanded by the CSU .	-4.9019
A vignette is a " flatrate for multiplying and therefore ecologically counterproductive " , the SPD negotiator for transport , Florian Pronold , wrote to his group .	-5.4304
There was a threat of evictions on country roads , which are already the focus of accidents .	-6.9630
Furthermore , the introduction of a toll for all cars would be only a first step from Pronold 's point of view .	-4.5458
" There is a risk that compensation for Germans will be cancelled at a later date , " he said .	-3.6383

Vienna Airport Creates Passenger Calls	-2.4112
Mr Max Maier , please come to Gate 24 .	-1.3163
There will be no more announcements of this kind at Wien-Schwechat Airport in future .	-5.3473
A large part of the speaker announcements are thus dropped - the noise level is to be significantly reduced .	-7.3413
The aim of this innovation is to create a more relaxed atmosphere .	-2.4708
As Airport-Specher Peter Kleemann announced to Radio Vienna , Vienna Airport is following an international trend with the cessation of announcements concerning individuals .	-5.1768
For example , airports in Copenhagen , Frankfurt or Dubai are already giving up noisy calls .	-4.1517
The elimination of these announcements - on average , around 200 personal calls by the speakers sound in one day - is intended to make things more quiet at the airport in the future .	-7.6567
" It has also been shown in the experience that these individual announcements have been perceived relatively little , but at the same time all other information on changed flights or departure times has been slightly lost here , " says Kleemann in conversation with the radio station .	-8.0390

Milk and egg alternatives at a glance	-2.1270
Vegan nutrition requires herbal alternatives to eggs , milk and dairy products .	-2.0213
For example , purged tofu with vegetable seeds is a quark substitute .	-5.4233
Further is the vegetarian and world vegan day on November 1 .	-5.4506
On the occasion of the World vegan Day on November 1 , the German Vegetarian Society proposes a number of vegan alternatives :	-5.2254
Pure vegetable marine is a good alternative to butter , replace yogurt with soy yogurt .	-3.8855
Instead of milk , soya , oat , almond or rice milk can be used .	-2.9074
Affordable plant seeds replace traditional canopy .	-6.5644
There are also vegetable alternatives to eggs .	-2.0646
For example , a half-crushed , mature banana can replace an egg as a binder in a cake .	-3.5954
Also 50 grams of apple or a tablespoon of ground linen plus three tablespoons of water are suitable for this .	-5.7552
For example , dough is loosened instead of egg with a mixture of a teaspoon of baking powder , a tablespoon of food thickness and three tablespoons of mineral water .	-5.2241
But also 50 grams of soy yoghurt or silk pu can fulfil this purpose .	-4.6930
According to the Vebu , around 800 000 people in Germany currently feed vegan , that is to say purely vegetable .	-4.6413
Sleeping in New York	-2.0605
On the way to their host families in Weymouth , Massachusetts , the students of the Black Forest High School met the American city of New York .	-4.5485
After eight hours of flight , we went straight to Brooklyn Bridge , where we were walking to the heart of Manhattan .	-6.9140
Here , there was already a fascinating view of the world-famous skyline , which in the evening is a special attraction .	-6.2756
Due to the time shift , students were on their feet almost 24 hours , but according to the motto " The City does not sleep " the day was decided at Times Square .	-5.8562
Despite Shutdown , on the second day the Statue of Liberty could be reached by ferry and climbed on foot .	-4.3704

After a short flight from New York to Boston , students have arrived in their host families and experience the school life at Weymouth High School .	-4.5875
This year , another Hubertus fair will be celebrated on the day of St. Hubertus ’ s name in the parish church of St. Marien on the Hülbergstrasse .	-6.7862
St. Hubertus was a rather reckless hunter , converted by a vision and later appointed bishop of Liège .	-9.0988
The hunting horn brass group of the hunting rider Westfalen , under the direction of Brigitte Kluth , performs on parcours organ ( natural horns in the mood of Es ) according to old , originally French melodies .	-10.2533
The brass players wear riding clothes , because they primarily accompany riders , horses and dogs on a sled hunt .	-8.4412
The festive fair will take place on Sunday , 3 November at 11.30 a.m.	-3.9528
The newly designed Opschlag gleams with a new café .	-4.5537
One that invites you to stay and come back .	-3.1602
One that wants to make the name of the program .	-2.4586
According to Lexikon , Déjà Vu is a psychological phenomenon that is expressed in the feeling that a new situation has already been experienced or seen .	-5.2522
In case of a visit to the café of the same name at the Opschlag in the district town of Kleve in sight to the University of Applied Sciences Rhine-Waal , it does not have to remain in the pure sense of Déjà vu .	-6.4567
The aim of the café , with its beautiful name , is precisely this : to make a real stay experience not only in terms of mind , but also in a permanent way .	-9.6487
Because it 's just fun and just beautiful .	-2.4823
A glance into the inside of the opstroke 8 immediately gives the viewer a good feeling .	-4.9548
The modern but not cool café ambience looks like a place to feel good .	-4.3396
Here the team pampers the guest with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the top with a variety of coffee and cocktail options .	-5.0096
There is also a delicious cake or individually prepared fresh baguettes .	-4.8143
The owners , both 33 years old , made a name for themselves before the opening of the pretty café on the Opschlag as a restaurant : in Kranenburg they ran the " Art Lounge " .	-6.4774
From the move to Kleve to the Opschlag , the likeable café-lovers hope to have more audiences .	-6.5547
Not least through the university .	-2.8648
" Where we have no specific target group , " Daniel Büttner points out .	-3.5726
Instead , the two here want to address young students just as much as seniors and all age groups in between .	-4.6370
Speaking of coffee lovers .	-2.9501
The friendly owner couple stands behind the coffee enjoyment .	-3.2927
Enjoy the fragrant hot brew in various variations .	-4.1276
Expressofan	-2.3264
Daniel Büttner is the Expresso fan and Mirjam van der Stelt the cappuccino drinker .	-2.7838
" A baguette is my thing , " she tells the NRZ .	-3.7828
Two events already took place in the bright café .	-2.8311
Better said , one thing .	-2.9006
After all , the Port Festival took place outside - Café Déjà Vu did not benefit from it .	-4.9748
But there was also the Ringelnatzabend .	-1.7864
" Beautiful , successful and funny " , the two 33-year-old found .	-3.9073
But it is not Jedermann ’ s cause .	-2.6933
Daniel Büttner may not be a real fan of event evenings either : " You can 't do it all right " .	-7.1696
And with an event , I only talk to those who are interested in the special event .	-4.6413
For this reason events will be the exception .	-3.8359
" We want to disrupt the normal operation as little as possible " .	-2.6440
In other words , Déjà Vu is also synonymous with reliability .	-2.9127
With regard to the quality of the products offered here , as well as the team and the beautiful surroundings at the Opschlag in Kleve .	-4.0106
The road that is increasingly becoming a gastronomic mile .	-4.6767
For the joy of many glues , guests from near and far and students who discover the restaurants and thus also the Café Déjà Vu .	-7.2127

A Day of thanks to MGV in Dinker	-4.3980
It was the 165 th festival to which the MGV " Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker " invited this year and 52 guests , active singers and their wives were happy to come .	-4.9154
In the Vereinslokal the restaurant " Witteborg " in Dinker all enjoyed the harmonious cooperation entirely in the spirit of music .	-5.4276
Traditionally , the Stiftungsfest is always the right festival to perform honors .	-5.0170
The special award " Singer of the Year " was welcomed by the secretary Rolf Wagener .	-5.2276
" You have not only written a lot for us , but have also made a number of rounds for us , for which we thank you very much , " says the chairman of the choir Erich Schlotmann .	-7.2535
The awards for the participation in the performances and choral rehearsals by means of activity streams went to Dieter Schulze with 44 entries this year , followed by the honorary chairman Horst Pier-Ribbert , the chairman himself , and last year 's " singer of the year " Friedrich Winkler , each with 42 entries .	-14.0792
He was ranked five in the category of <unk> 5 <unk> 1 .	-9.3485
A special thank you was sent to the team of Vereinswertin Ange Pier-Ribbert , who once again had created an extra class menu and Gerda Pier-Ribbert for the table decoration .	-5.6197
The MGV " Friedrich-Wilhelm " meets his regular choral rehearsals every Tuesday at 7.45 p.m. in the Vereinslokal .	-4.0233
" New positive voices are always welcome " , says Schlotmann .	-3.4581
UN Announces New Objectives in Fighting Poverty	-6.2732
The United Nations is now preparing a series of new targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals announced 12 years ago to combat poverty .	-4.5462
In the run-up to the UN Sustainable Development Summit , which began in Rio de Janeiro in the evening , Australian diplomats played a key role in pushing for “ Sustainable Development Goals ” to replace the 2015 Millennium Goals .	-3.4610
They were included in the final draft document , which will be adopted at the summit by world leaders , including Mrs Gillard .	-2.8766
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said in the evening at the summit that the time had come to “ think beyond national interests . ”	-3.3333
“ I am pleased that member states have agreed to begin a process to agree on universal , sustainable development goals , ” he said .	-3.6158
“ These goals will build on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the post-2015 framework .	-3.1426
I will spare no effort to implement the mandate given to me by member states to realize our vision of the SDGs , built on the success of the Millennium Goals . ”	-4.1486
Although the SG Achim / Baden has been without victory for four days , the handball league continues to be in good mood .	-5.4395
This leaves coach Tomasz Malmon no doubt at all .	-3.2358
Everyone remains fully motivated .	-2.5747
However , I hope that we will finally win again .	-3.3625
" After all , I don 't know how such a victory tastes anymore " , Malmon expects a success story from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II .	-5.7211
Although the 3rd-league reserve from Fredenbeck has not yet picked out trees , Malmon is warning the index finger in advance .	-6.8486
Many of the players I have trained myself in the A-Youth .	-7.7064
So they will certainly be particularly motivated against their ex-coach .	-4.1873
" It is also important to wait and see if there is any reinforcement from the first , " explains the SG-Coach .	-6.2481
In order to finally return to the track of success , the Malmon team must definitely increase compared to the previous performances .	-5.2522
Especially in the cover and the shift game it hated a lot last time .	-7.1675
Opportunities must also definitely improve .	-3.0618
So I hope my players have finally got their heads free during the short break .	-4.4688
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing in the face of clashes between influential figures .	-3.3529
Thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo under the watchful eyes of the statue of Samora Machel , the founder of the state and first President of Mozambique , to vote for peace calls during a rare public demonstration .	-4.6433
“ We want peace again , we want stability , ” said Vanessa de Sousa , Managing Director of an investment company .	-2.4271
For fear of the country ’ s future , she exchanged her business dress for a T-shirt with the inscription “ We demand security ” in Portuguese and joined the crowd on Thursday at the Independence Square of the capital .	-5.9367
For two weeks , there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo , one of the worst battles since the peace agreement over 20 years ago .	-4.1682
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement , initially supported by the White ruled Rhodesia and later by the apartheid government of South Africa in an effort to destabilize the country ’ s independent government .	-4.6676
After the 1992 peace treaty , it became an opposition party .	-2.4273
Analysts believe that it is unlikely to return to full-blown conflict , but recent events have worried foreign investors and locals .	-3.4388
There is much at stake for the fast-growing economy , because the discovery of huge gas deposits off the coast and coal camps in the northwest could bring investment of more than $ 50 billion from companies like Rio Tinto , Vale from Brazil , Eni from Italy , and Anadarko from the US in the coming years .	-6.2553
The ruling Frelimo Party , the dominant force since 1975 , and Renamo blame each other for the tensions .	-2.4122
Renamo claims that the government provoked the recent clashes by attacking its members in the province of Sofala , a traditional stronghold of Renamos , on 17 October .	-2.9939
The attacks on the former rebels escalated when government forces attacked Renamo bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama , the leader of the group , said Renamos spokesman to the Financial Times .	-3.7502
The government blames Renamo for the clashes and accused the organization of attacking soldiers .	-5.7293
President Armando Guebuza has tried to downplay concerns about instability .	-2.1222
On Wednesday , he told AFP , the French news agency , that Dhlakama sees himself as a “ loser ” who wants to “ use all his remaining forces to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government . ”	-4.9257
Both Frelimo and Renamo emphasize that they want to avoid war .	-1.9418
But concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted as saying that Renamo abandoned the 1992 peace agreement .	-3.7414
He told the FT that he meant that Frelimo no longer respects the agreement .	-4.0958
“ Our vision is to reopen negotiations and to do so seriously , ” Mazanga said .	-3.4451
Previous talks between the parties contributed little to resolving the tensions fueled by a series of clashes this year .	-3.9867
“ We have two grown-up men ( Guebuza and Dhlakama ) who come together , ” says Joseph Hanlon , lecturer at the Open University and Mozambique expert .	-4.6123
None of them is good at negotiating and no one is prepared to make the necessary concessions .	-3.4083
Renamo , who is pushing for electoral reform , has already said that she will boycott the local elections in November .	-3.1711
Presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for next year .	-1.4482
Some commentators have interpreted the use of force as an attempt by a ailing movement to obtain concessions and financial concessions from the government .	-3.1708
Renamos electoral success has been shrinking since 1992 , while a newer party , Movimento Democrático de Mo<unk>ambique ( MDM ) , established by a former Renamo member , is likely to improve in the elections .	-4.3702
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – whose resignation is due when his second term ends next year – wants to destroy the country ’ s democracy .	-2.7807
“ He does not want multiparty democracy , he does not want transparent elections , he does not want peace because he does not want to give up the presidency , ” says Mazanga .	-3.3551
It is unclear what capacity Renamo has , but it has made troublesome attacks on police stations and vehicles on important north-south connections .	-4.3774
Most battles took place in the province of Sofala , which is a few hundred kilometres north of Maputo , but is home to Beira , the port , the mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale to export coal .	-5.4879
In June , Rio stopped using the railways for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the route .	-3.6899
Mazanga replied reluctantly to the question of whether Renamo would repeat .	-6.2876
Renamo said , “ the international community was warning that things are not good in Mozambique . ”	-4.0172
Instability has increased frustration with the government , says Fernando Lima , head of Mediacoop , an independent media company , because many people have already been concerned about corruption , slow progress in development , and a recent wave of kidnapping .	-4.9691
“ People think that the government and the president are responsible for the country ’ s future , and that he should be the one who finds solutions to the problems , ” he explains .	-3.5580
Omar Sultans , a demonstrator , said people just wanted stability .	-2.6561
“ No one is interested in Renamo and Frelimo , they just want peace and usable roads , ” he explained .	-3.6916
Children should be taught myths and legends as “ models for life , ” says an author .	-3.0457
Thor ’ s stories showed that “ brutal power has no chance of clever tricks , ” and the Artus legend demonstrates how important it is to have a dream .	-3.1799
But many of the myths are “ far too wild , too offensive , and in some cases too dirty to be taught in schools , ” and Crossley-Holland pleaded for a “ careful selection ” of age-appropriate works .	-4.6799
“ I find it wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education , ” he said .	-2.5252
I have been proposing this as a plan for 20 years .	-8.3163
He added that among authors and teachers who are “ excessively didactic , ” children would “ shut down completely , ” because in entertaining stories , messages would be “ subliminal . ”	-4.8513
Crossley-Holland , who translated Beowulf from the Anglo-Saxon language and is the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales , declared : “ You can pursue certain intentions , but you should keep them in the background as possible . ”	-4.6311
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult writer who writes for adults and an author who writes for children is the need to convey hope .	-2.8945
Not everything needs to be simplified or made happy , but there is an inherent sense of good and evil .	-3.2279
This must be subliminal , through which history is revealed and not explained .	-4.2237
This is the old story of showing rather than telling .	-1.9889
Hansjakob Pulls Again in Freihof	-3.0714
100 years ago Heinrich Hansjakob moved his retirement home in Haslach . On Sunday his last years were brought to life in the " Freihof " .	-4.7989
The many spectators were thrilled by the very short scene game .	-5.1972
From the arrival to the award of honorary citizenship to his death , screenwriter and Hansjakob actor Alois Kraftzcyk had designed an entertaining piece , which received a lot of applause under the direction of Cornelia Volk .	-5.5117
Marcus Zagermann took the audience as a speaker through the ten different scenes , explained connections and overcome time jumps from youth to retirement .	-5.6427
On October 22 , 1913 Hansjakob comes home in his childhood sky , in his Freihof .	-5.3411
And then the scene scene began , in which Alois Krafczyk once again shines in his parade as the great son of the city .	-5.0525
In style , he was introduced to Zweispänner and " Schwarzwald Füchsen " by Erich Becherer from Mühlenbach .	-6.1738
Not only did he receive a lot of applause from the audience , his sister Philippine also welcomed him .	-4.0694
Billy Sum-Hermann understood it incredibly well to get involved in the role of her sister and gave her an enormous life in mimics and gestures .	-5.7015
Between the individual scenes the Mühlenbach farmers ' band played carefully selected music and rounded off the performance .	-5.2469
Haslach ’ s mayor , Heinz Winkler , gave himself the honour of awarding the honorary citizen , who , in the presence of the then incumbent Hättich , and a part of the city council , made his appearance .	-9.9012
Their upbringing then made the three-king singers , who led Hansjakob to the exclamation : " Oh how beautiful , there are again youth memories of my own three-king time alive " .	-8.2554
With their song " O Jesulein " they enjoyed the public in the Freihof as well as the Storchentagskinner with their loud " Aus , Aus " .	-4.9039
Hansjakob had expressed his criticism of the Church as much at the time as his concerns about agricultural excesses , the consequences of industrialization , or the effects of war .	-6.3735
In the homeworld , behind his grave chapel on the fire near Hofstetten , he found his resting place .	-4.0973
" An troubled mind had finally found its calm and had gone back forever " , it was said at the end of the scene game .	-5.1100
There was a lot of applause and much praise from the audience for the performance .	-3.6500
Basketball : The hope of the Neckar giants is growing .	-3.9744
The chances of remaining in the league of the Ludwigsburg Bundesliga basketball team have increased .	-6.2714
If there is a wildcard procedure , there is now less competition for the Neckar giants .	-4.6174
The basketball project Hamburg Towers does not apply for a possible rear seat .	-3.9264
" We will not participate in the Wildcard process , " said former national player Pascal Roller , who has been developing the concept for a professional club in the Hanseatic city since 2012 .	-4.8229
But Ludwigsburg could not hear a first breath .	-4.7916
" We did not deal with the Wildcard procedure , so long as it is not clear that Düsseldorf will not receive a licence , " said Neckar 's giant boss Alexander Reil of our newspaper .	-5.8987
Up to 23 May , Beginners Düsseldorf Baskets can still submit documents to the Arbitration Court and prove their economic Bundesliga fitness .	-6.2233
So far , however , the Rhine countries have been denied the licence twice .	-3.9782
The Arbitration Court is the last instance .	-1.6684
Haigerloch : Abendmahlskirche Blicks	-4.1479

Snowden could also say in Russia	-3.4308
The former US intelligence expert , Edward Snowden , could also make statements in his Russian asylum in the US Latin America .	-5.5708
Representatives of the Federal State Bar Association could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old personally in Russia .	-5.5515
This has been reported by the Interfax Agency by reference to unnamed circles familiar with the situation .	-5.4461
It was said that such a question could be resolved intergovernmental .	-4.8092
Snowden ’ s departure from Russia is virtually impossible .	-2.5698
" In this case , he loses his refugee status , " the agency quoted her source .	-2.9178
Because Germany is an ally of the US , Snowden ’ s threat of extradition continued .	-3.6768

Two massive blue chargers and chargers distribute or load coal as needed .	-5.1643
Every movement of the handling equipment is accompanied by a sound warning sound .	-8.2458
" The signals are safe and legally required , " says Matthias Schrell , CEO of the Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven .	-4.2598
Unfortunately , in bad weather , this is widely heard - and so there have already been some complaints from people from the north of the city .	-7.3794

If the GDF-Suez power station goes online , a good 5 million tons of coal imports per year are realistic .	-5.5574
The three ship loaders on the bridge and the second transport belt could create up to 10 million .	-3.3381
Bavaria ’ s Basketball Economy , despite its first defeat	-4.7123
Even the first defeat in the Euroleague did not diminish the enormous optimism among the FC Bayern Munich basketball players .	-4.8379
" No one can forbid us to believe in winning against the best team in Europe in the last two years , " Bayern-Coach Svetislav Pesic commented after the unfortunate 83 : 88 ( 39 : 47 ) on Thursday evening at the title defender Olympiakos Piraeus .	-5.6700
We sent the message : Basketball also exists in Munich !	-2.1792
At their only third appearance in the European premier class , Munich sold itself very well for a long time , but were simply not clear enough in the decisive stages .	-7.0860
The guests first managed to convert a 15-point lag 13 minutes before the end into a guided tour before Piraeus gave the game another turn .	-6.5135
" We have fought incredibly back against the two-time Euroleague Champion , but then again made reckless mistakes , " said Bayern-professional Yassin Idbihi .	-5.5483
We are proud of our performance , but we want to win every game .	-2.0802

Ben Greenman : Ten Years of New York Comedy Festival : The New Yorker	-1.1709
One might say that New York City is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America : almost a hundred years ago , the genre artist Frank Fay , who worked as a concierge at the Palace Theatre on Broadway , began to tell the crowd about jokes in the form of a conversation .	-5.8737
Over the years , Fay ’ s innovation has been expanded , as last year at the New York Comedy Festival .	-4.6952
This year , Caroline Hirsch , the founder of Caroline ’ s stand-up institution , celebrates his 10th with over in clubs and major .	-6.4485
“ Most of these headliners began with Caroline , and then became more and more successful until they eventually became known to play in a club , ” Hirsch said .	-5.9052
We have designed this festival so that we can continue to work with them .	-3.3082
At this year ’ s event there will be appearances by Wanda Sykes , Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher , as well as by “ Stand Up for Heroes ” , an annual music and comedy charity event for army veterans at Madison Square Garden , featuring Bruce Springsteen , Jon Stewart , Roger Waters and Bill Cosby .	-4.8726
The festival has also grown the world of comedy .	-2.8791
A number of Comedians attending the festival this year have become familiar with rather unconventional ways , such as broadcasts on smaller television channels such as Comedy Central , FX and Spike .	-5.6389
Nick Kroll became known with a sitcom on cable television ( the ironically sloppy fantasy fan series " The League " on FXX ) and now has his own Sketch show on Comedy Central .	-5.4474
Jenny Slate was part of the cast at both Saturday Night Live and Parks and Recreation , although she is best known for her viral video series Marcel the Shell with Shoes On .	-3.8359
Both Kroll and Slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices ( the surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik , who focused on racial themes W. Kaumau Bell ) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy .	-3.6125
One of the biggest festival visitors is an interview : David Steinberg talks with Larry David .	-4.1259
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian , but has become a respected television and film director and an unofficial comedy historian .	-3.9039
From 2005 to 2007 , he hosted a TV show entitled “ Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg ” on TV Land .	-4.0652
The meeting will take place at Town Hall in midtown Manhattan .	-2.6890
“ The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry 's entire work , ” said Steinberg .	-3.5557
He told me when he is here , then he sometimes goes through the alley between two buildings and thinks : Hey , if I lose all my money , then perhaps I live here .	-3.5818

Drama in Uruguay : Young Killing Toys with Machete	-4.3178
Two children admitted the murder of an 11-year-old in Uruguay .	-2.7008
The two 14 and 12 years old boys had invited their victims to go bird hunting with them .	-7.1934
Armed with machetes and knives , they stole the 11-year-old on Tuesday and threw the corpse into a well , reported the newspaper " El País " on Thursday .	-4.6691
Then they would have played football in front of their homes in a working-class quarter .	-2.8574
The corpse was found on the following night in Cerro Pelado , 15 km north of the exclusive beach resort of Punta del Este .	-3.3477
As an alibi , a five-year-old half-sister of the younger , who took her with her , should say that she was sexually assaulted by the boy .	-5.5818
But when the girl described the action before the police without mentioning an attack against her , the two boys admitted the deliberate killing of the 11-year-old .	-4.4889
One of the reasons for this was that the elderly called a rivalry in the football game .	-6.0863
He was provisionally admitted to a psychiatric youth institution .	-2.8888
Stopping into Prison	-4.5043
The District Court of Konstanz has sentenced a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen to three and a half years in prison for exploitative trafficking , pimping , threat , insult and dangerous bodily injury .	-4.4235
The former Bundeswehr soldier , who worked as a doorkeeper after two missions in Afghanistan , made a confession within the framework of a process agreement .	-5.7618
Thus , in five cases , he met women via Internet or telephone contacts , which he sent out against their will after a few weeks .	-6.4342
He resisted breaking with violence and threats .	-2.8039
He retained the income of women , some of whom had paid for him for years .	-4.9560
By confiscating mobile phones and SIM cards , he tied women ’ s contacts to the outside world .	-3.7969
Together with a colleague who provided the women , he brought them to various brothels in the southwest .	-3.6389
There he had some monitoring of them to control their revenue .	-5.7907
In court , the defendant initially claimed that he was suffering from a serious trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan died in an explosion near him .	-5.4270
After a psychiatric expert implied great doubts about mental constraint and hence limited guilt , the 33-year-old made a comprehensive confession .	-7.1337
The court no longer had to hear any of the injured women .	-3.2270
As a Kripo official reported , at least four more cases of exploitative human trafficking could be identified after a first ad by telephone surveillance measures .	-5.6954
The intercepted talks were marked by high aggression .	-4.2101
In subsequent interrogations , the injured parties would have confirmed their martyrdom .	-2.9197
Another witness , in which one of the women had discovered blue spots throughout the body , has not yet made a statement .	-6.0476
It is a matter of " a completely broken personality " , which sees violence and exploitation in this profession as normal .	-4.5012
The defendant lamented his behaviour yesterday .	-8.9614
" He left these circles and wanted to lead a normal life after being imprisoned , " he said .	-5.2021
Oil prices continue to reach USD 96 per barrel .	-2.9287
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday , as concerns about high supply overshadowed a report that China ’ s energy-hungry manufacturing sector is growing .	-3.4556
In December , the reference raw materials for deliveries in Europe had fallen by 14 cents on the New York Mercantile Exchange in electronic commerce at 96.24 USD per barrel in Europe late morning .	-7.4017
The contract fell by 39 cents on Thursday , which meant a fall in the price of 5.8 % in October .	-3.1414
The large supply of crude oil has burdened prices in recent weeks .	-4.0954
The US Department of Energy said on Wednesday that the US supply increased by 4.1 million barrels last week .	-2.6174
Over five weeks , supply had increased by 25 million barrels .	-2.0809
But on Friday , there was evidence of increased demand through two reports of an increase in activity in Chinese manufacturing .	-3.8846
This suggests a continued recovery in China ’ s economy , with growth rising to 7.8 % in the third quarter , having reached the lowest level in the previous quarter for two decades .	-4.7625
Brent crude oil , a benchmark for international crude oil , also used by US refineries , fell 26 cents to $ 108.58 per barrel on the ICE Exchange in London .	-4.1365
Court blocked decision on the NYPD ’ s Stop and Frisk Directive	-3.3224
On Thursday , a Federal Court of Appeal in the United States blocked the order of a judge who had requested changes to the Stop and Frisk program of the New York Police Department , and released the judge from the case .	-6.4251
The 2nd US Court of Justice declared that Judge Shira Scheidlin ’ s decisions would be suspended until a decision was made on a city appeal .	-5.7132
The judge had ruled in August that the city was violating the Constitution with the way in which the program for stopping and asking people was implemented .	-5.2264
The city appealed against its assessment and the proposed remedies , including the decision to set up a monitoring body to assist the police in amending their directive and training programmes .	-5.9323
On Tuesday , the appeal court heard the arguments for the requested suspension .	-3.8524
The appeal report stated that the judge should be relieved of the case because she violated the code of conduct for US judges by stating that a judge should avoid the appearance of partisanship , partly because of a series of media interviews and public statements in which she publicly responded to the Court ’ s criticism .	-5.9969
The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people because they target inappropriately black and Latin American men with the Stop and Frisk programme .	-4.4284
It appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of major changes , including policy , training and service supervision reforms , and ordered a pilot program with cameras on the body in areas where most controls were carried out .	-6.0548
In August , the city of New York agreed to end the practice of storing names and addresses of people who were released after police control .	-4.0536
An oral hearing on the city ’ s appeal is planned after March 14 , 2014 .	-3.1028
The Stop and Frisk tactics were criticised by a number of civil rights defenders .	-3.6186
Such controls have been in various forms for decades , but the number of recorded controls during the term of the partisan mayor , Michael Bloomberg , has risen to an all-time high of 684,330 in 2011 , most of them black and Latin American men .	-4.7028
In 2004 , four men belonging to all minorities filed a lawsuit that became a collective action .	-5.4658
Supporters of changes to the NYPD ’ s Stop and Frisk program say that the changes will end unfair practices , create a more trustworthy and effective police force , and influence how other police offices use the scheme .	-5.4399
Opponents believe that change would dampen police morals , but not crime ; it would also waste money and not solve the broader problem of a police force that is under pressure after thousands of posts have disappeared in the last decade .	-6.7993
The judge pointed out that she did not end the Stop and Frisk practice , which was constitutional , but only reformed the way the NYPD implemented the controls .	-5.0602

With this knowledge , the first chairman , Wolfgang Henne , described the history and fascination of the association " Helping Hands " .	-3.9649
On Saturday afternoon the 10th birthday of the association was celebrated , which can already have considerable success .	-4.9149
The first chairman Henne reported in detail about the work of the association .	-2.9256
He himself was in Mauritania for the first time in 2004 at the Cheijk-Zajed-hospital in Nouakchott .	-3.1450
As a result , another cooperation was developed and Gynaecology Henne performed numerous operations on site during several trips .	-6.8395
During the speeches , pictures of the interventions were shown on a large screen , so that the guests of the jubilee event could get an idea of the mentioned actions .	-6.4825
The desert vehicle of the association was also shown .	-2.4199
It is a former Federal Border Guard vehicle .	-3.1276
Rainer Prewo , the former OB of Nagold , had proposed to equip this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and is now planning , according to Henne , to work in an advisory role at the association .	-5.3072
In 2008 , the Zimmerei Schleeh from Baiersbronn built the hospital in Socogim , a district of misery on the outskirts of the capital , on a voluntary basis in the record time of just under a week .	-7.3109
Henne also mentioned a new parent child hospital in Nouakchott	-2.3500
Especially interesting in times when the birth clinic is to be rationalised away in Nagold .	-4.0491
One learns a lot in Africa as a medical practitioner , he says , for example decelerating against burn-out .	-4.7048
As a result of the political unrest in the country , it was not possible to travel as many times as planned , but many doctors came to Germany to hospitalize here in various areas .	-7.0461
In addition , containers containing material are regularly sent to Africa , including medical equipment , medicines , association materials , hospital beds and glasses in March this year .	-5.4122
Mitinitiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself supplied plenty of local colour by telling Mauritania about Mercedes cars converted to the mobile Ziegenstal and describing the experiences of the tribal musicians who traditionally support the association during their Mauritania trip .	-6.2383
As his personal motivations , he named his work in the field of auditing as a young Member .	-4.3812
When he realized how much money was lost on the way , he decided to help Africans control a budget by the people .	-3.2010
Fuchtel also emphasized that the global economy is also calling for global human love .	-5.2341
Nor should we forget that Africa is closer than some think .	-2.6405
From Gran Canaria it is not far to Africa .	-2.5534
Coulson used telephone hacking to check a tip .	-2.6532
The former news of the Word editor Andy Coulson reportedly used “ telephone hacking , surveillance , and confrontation ” to try to confirm a false tip about an affair of then-Interior Minister Charles Clarke .	-5.0551
Public prosecutor Andrew Edis QC explained to the court in Old Bailey , News of the World in May 2005 a false rumor that Clarke had a relationship with his “ attractive special adviser ” Hannah Pawlby .	-5.0999
The newspaper commissioned the private detective Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlby ’ s voicemail , and pursued it , but Coulson also called them and left news as the court learned .	-5.8921
“ According to the Public Prosecutor , Coulson , who is now the editor of the NotW , is no one standing in front of the home of people , hoping to catch them up on fresh action , but one who likes to confront people with a story to see their reaction , ” Edis explained .	-6.7639
He said , NotW uses three methods to investigate stories : telephone hacking , surveillance , and confrontation .	-3.4841
The editor is personally involved in the third method .	-1.3462
Obviously he knows of the second , the monitoring , otherwise it can not be .	-4.2011
What about the first ?	-1.0164
Does he know about telephone hacking ?	-2.0465
He denies that , but we say , “ And if he knew . ”	-3.6074
Rumors about a Clarke affair were first picked up by the feature editor of NotW , when a source of sexual interest in Pawlby was said : “ Do not waste your time , it is with Charles . ”	-5.0919
A band with voice emails from their phone of at least three occasions was secured in August 2006 in Mulcaires apartment .	-3.7857
The investigators also found entries on the detective ’ s computer , where Pawlby and her sister were stored as “ projects . ”	-5.6551
At the time of the research , the grandparents of Pawlby received anonymous calls asking for information about them , Edis explained .	-3.9066
Meanwhile , former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weather oversaw surveillance of Pawlby ’ s movements .	-2.5049
On 18 June 2005 , Coulson left her a voicemail with the following content : “ I have a story that we want to bring out tomorrow , which I would like to talk about with Charles . ”	-4.5752
Edis explained that Coulson ’ s actions in this story followed the same pattern as in other major personalities , such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett .	-5.1045
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson Blunkett faced an affair with a married woman when he himself was living with the accused Rebekah Brooks , who had been married at the time .	-5.0346
Coulson and Brooks argue that they have conspired with others to hack phones between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006 .	-3.2701
Mulcaire , Thurlbeck and Weatherup admitted the telephone hacking .	-5.0177
In protest against the planned imperial tax , the French football will in fact go through the first strike since 1972 .	-5.8900
A conciliation meeting ends without results .	-3.2022
In the conflict over the imperial tax , the French government and professional football have become deadlocked after a failed conciliation meeting .	-5.3807
President Fran<unk>ois Hollande received club and association representatives at the <unk>lysée Palace in Paris on Thursday and listened to their complaints .	-4.3478
But he refused to spare football from the planned 75 % levy on income of more than € 1 million per year , which all the country ’ s firms will pay for two years from 2014 .	-5.6460
The other side was also hard .	-4.3879
The strike announced for the end of November will now also be carried out , announced by the head association of the professional clubs ( UCPF ) , Jean-Pierre Louvel .	-5.7412
The game days scheduled between November 29 and December 2 in Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 will therefore expire .	-4.7383
China : No Total Protection	-4.2418
" We want to involve the inhabitants early in the planning , " Mayor Jens Häu<unk>ler opened the civic information event on the flood protection concept in Gechingen .	-4.8557
About 80 participants had come to the Municipal Hall to explain the planned measures , ask questions , express concerns and bring ideas .	-5.4880
Häu<unk>ler made it clear : " The final decisions are made by members of the municipal council " .	-4.2300
The floods that hit Gechingen on 15 May 2009 , unprepared , had been a major event that raised the question of safeguards for the future , according to Häu<unk>ler .	-6.0346
A river basin survey was commissioned with the neighbouring municipality of Aidlingen , which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen .	-3.5067
" Protecting as many cultivated plots as possible is the goal " , says Häu<unk>ler .	-4.0125
The planning of the protection against floods , which are expected to occur every 100 years , according to the German weather service , is . are .	-10.2421
Climate change is taken into account by a 15 % surcharge .	-2.6590
In specialist circles this is called " HQ 100aKlima " .	-3.4385
The water masses , which caused considerable damage in Gechingen in 2009 , were equivalent to 1000 years of flooding .	-4.0719
" There is no absolute protection , but we can achieve a relative improvement , " says Häu<unk>ler .	-3.5327
In order to achieve the HQ 100aKlima protection , approximately four million euros must be invested in Gechingen , with the municipality being able to count on state subsidies of around 70 percent .	-7.3212
However , Häu<unk>ler pointed out that there is only support if an overall concept is implemented .	-4.3724
In order to do this , the community must rely on the participation .	-5.6392
An elaborate planning and approval procedure must be completed .	-2.8085
At best , implementation can begin in 2016 .	-2.2312
Among other things , the protection concept , which was presented last week in the municipal council ( we reported ) , provides for local measures in the flow of the Irm river from the tribal valley .	-5.6478
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept , participants took the opportunity to present their concerns .	-3.2111
Among other things , questions have been raised about why no more dams and retention basins are planned to protect the place .	-5.5607
Gregor Kühn , planner of the commissioned engineering bureau Wald and Corbe from Hügelsheim , who presented the concept , stressed that it requires the interaction of all the measures presented to achieve the desired goal in the sum .	-7.0120
In addition , one should find the most economical solution , according to Joachim Wald von Wald and Corbe .	-3.8327
There was resentment among old town residents who , even in normal thunderstorms , have suffered from overload of the channel network .	-7.9867
The problem is known in the administration and the first measures have already been taken .	-4.0426
However , Häu<unk>ler pointed out that the directives on channel systems are different from those for flood protection and that this cannot be mixed .	-5.6905
The municipality is obliged to interpret the Channel network in such a way that it can cope with rains of two to three years .	-6.7635
Expanding sewers would devour millions .	-3.1955
Heavily injured after a collision	-5.7564
In the early Friday afternoon , two drivers were seriously injured on Landesstrasse 44 near Revensdorf in a frontal collision .	-5.4521
The police immediately blocked the street completely , but could say little about the accident .	-6.2955
However , there are various testimonies which should be evaluated first .	-3.5151
It is clear that the 19-year-old driver of a VW Golf drove towards Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf met her with his Hyundai .	-5.7787
Both vehicles collided , and the woman was so heavily trapped that the fire brigade needed barely half an hour to get them out of the vehicle wreck .	-6.6839
The actual cause of the accident initially remained unresolved .	-4.2192
Both accidents came to nearby hospitals .	-3.0414
The race was closed for about two hours .	-2.5874

And just as Fjodor M. Dostoyewski , with his massive oeuvre , can be understood as the founder and apologist of the Russian soul , is Philip K. Dick read as an American prophet who is true in his own country .	-5.8972
Some titles have been published by Heyne Verlag , the Haffman cassette with the 118 narratives is selling two thousand .	-7.9547
Dick explains America - the realm of breathtaking technological progress , coupled with paranoia , security madness , and the belief of being chosen .	-3.9117
Dick had God experiences , his late books read like a mixture of the revelation of John and a computer manual .	-2.9373
Perhaps he was crazy , had drugs added to his brain .	-3.2671
He has broken , early already , that the computers are divisions .	-4.8485

The former US intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum in the US scout for German Chancellor Angela Merkel .	-4.8290
Representatives of the German Federal Bar Association could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old in Russia personally , the agency Interfax reported .	-5.7254

Under the instructions of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection and Counter-Terrorism ( BVT ) , the German Internal Intelligence Service , he should photograph the roof of the US Post , less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank .	-5.7252
According to the German media , the BVT wanted to prove the presence of surveillance antennas and the action resulted in a change of words between the USA and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin .	-4.3341
James Clapper , US Director of National Intelligence , insisted again in September that the US did not use foreign espionage opportunities “ to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of US firms , so that they could expand their international competitiveness or profits . ”	-5.3795
But , since Edward Snowden , the former Whistleblower , has begun publishing his steward to US surveillance secrets , European governments and business leaders are no longer sure whether they can take the director at his word .	-6.4081
Reports that the American National Security Agency spied Petrobas into Brazil and obtained data from American cloud vendors , including Google and Yahoo , have brought the company paranoia to a new peak for state surveillance .	-6.4529
The fray may have been the revelation that German Chancellor Angela Merkel ’ s telephone was spoiled for ten years .	-6.5976
If the most powerful person in Europe can get targeted , then corporate leaders are certainly also potential targets .	-5.2312

“ Germany must wake up , ” explains Oliver Grün , president of BITMi , who represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany .	-3.1666
German companies believe that the US is now at almost as high a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft , according to a survey published in July by the consultancy company EY .	-5.6425
In the documents sent by Snowden , however , there has been no evidence that the US has passed on the trade secrets of foreign companies to its own companies .	-4.9400
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacks certain IT and Internet capabilities and should reduce its dependence on the US .	-3.4957

A trend : the retro look has returned .	-3.6606
This starts with the wedding dress .	-2.8653
White is must , best covered or in cream .	-1.3606
In the front , the clothes , often worn with embroidery , are closed , often with a veil , but in the back they go down their backs and often end up in a slide .	-9.1124

The parents of the teenager , whose body was found in a concomitant ring-note in the gymnasium of his high school , are convinced that her son was murdered , the family lawyer said on Thursday .	-6.4729
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta in the state of Georgia , USA , was found on 11 January in an upright mat standing behind the grandstand in the school tower hall .	-5.3593
The investigators of the Sheriff of Lowndes County concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident , but the family of the 17-year-old doubted this .	-5.5710
“ They are convinced that their son was murdered , ” Benjamin Crump , the lawyer of Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson , told FoxNews.com.	-3.1239
They would never have believed that he died as the Sheriff concluded .	-3.2286
“ They believe that there is no logic against the laws of physics and common sense , ” said Crump .	-4.2331
Instead , they are convinced that the truth is being concealed in order to protect the person or persons responsible for the death of their son .	-3.9534
“ Her son went to school to learn and came back in her corpse , ” he commented .	-4.5534
On Thursday , US prosecutor Michael Moore said that there would be a formal investigation into the death of Johnson , as a number of important issues remain unresolved .	-4.5020
What was the cause of death ?	-0.7599
Is his death due to a crime ?	-1.4653
Moore explained this at a press conference on Thursday afternoon .	-1.8805
I follow the facts in which direction they lead .	-3.0296
My aim is to find out the truth .	-1.7410
“ I believe there is a sufficient basis for a formal investigation , ” he said .	-2.7413
Moore told reporters that his initial autopsy indicates that Johnson died from the consequences of a “ position-related suffocation . ”	-4.4015
A second autopsy , however , caused another cause of death , Moore says .	-4.7674
“ There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed , ” he said .	-2.2932
Moore added that if there is sufficient evidence for a criminal or civil investigation to Johnson ’ s death , he will commission the FBI to conduct the investigation .	-3.9230

CDC Publish School Allergies	-3.3758
On Wednesday , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) published a series of guidelines for the treatment of food allergies by children in schools .	-3.9890
These are the first such guidelines issued by the US government , as the number of school-age children with food allergies increases .	-4.0041
One in 20 children in the United States now have food allergies .	-2.0915
According to the CDC , the spread of food allergies among children increased by 18 % between 1997 and 2007 .	-2.5861
The guidelines contain information for schools to raise awareness of food allergies in the teaching body and staff and how to deal with children showing allergic reactions .	-5.1689
It is also recommended that schools have epinephrine in stock – the car injection of the epiPen brand is most commonly used – to counter a potentially deadly hypersensitivity reaction .	-5.1554
State-level lawmakers have recently changed the rules to make it easier for schools to hold epinephrine in stock .	-5.3458
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms mentioned by children who have an allergic reaction .	-2.9038
Children may say , “ It feels like something is pressing my tongue , ” “ My tongue feels like a hair is lying on it , ” or “ My tongue cribs ” .	-5.0236
Parents of Intersex Children Can choose “ Gender Unvoted ”	-3.4091
Germany is the first European nation in which a third sex is recognised for children born with unidentified genitals .	-3.7105
Newborn babies are no longer firmly male or female assigned .	-4.1408
Under the new law , parents no longer have to declare sex for such children , but can specify “ indeterminate ” or “ not fixed ” on the birth certificate .	-4.3662
The aim of the law is to take the pressure from parents so that they do not have to take hasty decisions on sex-education operations in newborns , and to combat discrimination against intersex people .	-7.1420
According to the BBC , an intersexual person said , “ I am neither a man nor a woman . ”	-3.6617
I remain mutilated and full of scars .	-4.3305
It is estimated that one in 2,000 children is not born as boys or girls each year .	-6.9500
They belong to the intersex , a group that is under the diagnosis of “ sexual differentiation disorder ” ( DSD ) , a generic term for people with atypical chromosomes , germ glands ( ovaries or testicles ) or unusually developed genitals .	-5.3688
Wallis Simpson may have been sexual .	-2.4885
The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed , but most experts in the US suggest that the best information available should be used for sexual orientation , if a provision is not possible , rather than waiting for the child ’ s psychological and physical development , before deciding – if any – for an operation .	-7.6582
The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher , who specializes in gender identification , said that the new German law “ sounds like a good thing . ”	-3.7312
Intersexual children are an ethical dilemma .	-1.5540
“ Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgery , but most children do not , ” he said .	-3.3421
You can have sexual orientation without surgery and then wait for the identity to develop .	-5.6634
The scientific data on how a child develops its gender identity at all is not very accurate .	-5.6920
Nobody knows why it is happening .	-1.7171
It is like the secret why people are gay .	-1.7944
In a 2011 report to the European Commission , it states that intersexual people should be distinguished from transsexuals or transgenders , because their status is not gender-based , but is based on their biological constitution , which is neither exclusively male nor female , but typically defines both at the same time or not clearly as one of them .	-6.7295
These characteristics were found in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle mass , hair , breasts and stature , priority sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals , or in chromosome structures and hormones .	-4.8243
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination suffered by intersex and transgender persons in professional life , as well as the extent of harassment , violence and prejudice .	-4.5545
Young people who do not agree with the gender picture now have a special camp .	-3.5964
In Australia and Nepal , it is now possible for adults to indicate male , female or “ third sex ” on official documents .	-3.3337
In June , Australia ’ s Norrie May-Welby ( 52 ) was recognized as the world ’ s first “ gender ” person after a court granted lifelong maintenance of a “ unspecified ” gender status .	-4.8188
In addition to M and W , German identity cards will have a third assignment , X for intersexual , according to the Ministry of the Interior .	-5.4235
In neighboring France , gender issues are still controversial , according to news on France 24 .	-3.7579
In 2011 , dozens of French MPs from the strictly Catholic country signed a petition that “ gender theory ” should be removed from school books .	-3.0234
The US site , Catholic Online , has also spoken out against German law , on the grounds that “ If the world is torn into a new state , where gender is a choice , but sexual activity is not , then we are twisting two more pillars of civilisation . ”	-6.9608
The mother of a newborn Maryland told Baby Zone that she would find it better if babies were assigned a gender at birth .	-4.7149
“ Being a parent is already stressful enough without further restrictions , especially if you don ’ t know the sex of your child , ” she said to the parent ’ s website .	-5.3261
Children need stability and security .	-0.6195
Historically , children born with both male and female gender were referred to as hermaphro yields , according to the attractive Greek god who had both sexes .	-4.6965
Ten years ago , medicine regarded gender as something to be extinguished and then rebuilt .	-3.4382
But the ethical foundations of an operation are now in doubt as it is now known how complex gender identity is , and that doctors can be wrong because they do not know how the child feels when growing up with the gender they assign .	-6.4129
“ In the middle of the 20th century , one was called a psychiatric emergency , ” said Drescher .	-4.2137
When such a child was born , one called not the psychiatrist , but the surgeon .	-2.9488
The ruling theory about the treatment of children with non-unambiguous genitals dates back to Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University , who believed that gender was formable .	-5.5127
He coined the term “ gender identity , ” arguing that social and environmental stimuli – as parents educate a child – interacted with a child ’ s genes and hormones , shaping a person as male or female .	-4.3514
But his theories became controversial in a 1966 case known as “ John / Joan . ”	-2.5490
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been separated with a botched circumcision , to caste the child completely and to remove his testicles and then to raise him as a girl .	-6.3253
“ Money presented this case as a successful example of conversion , but it was not , ” says Drescher .	-3.7504
When the boy was about 15 , he moved back to the male sex and married a woman .	-2.3333
At 38 , however , he committed suicide .	-3.3000
According to Drescher , there are still doctors who would practice this model .	-2.6269
But , in the 1990 ’ s , with the advent of the Internet , survivors of these sexual operations came to the public , who are “ not happy with the result . ”	-4.2859
For example , Jim Bruce , a 36-year-old author from Montana born with XY-male chromosomes , but ambiguous genitalia .	-3.4875
Doctors were not clear whether he had a great clitoris or a small penis , and were convinced that he could never lead a “ satisfying life ” as a man .	-4.2608
So his external organ and testicles were surgically removed shortly after birth in 1976 , and he was raised as a girl .	-3.8175
At the age of 12 he received female hormones .	-1.9496
“ I knew I was not a girl , ” he told ABCNews.com .	-2.1273
I was unhappy , but it was really difficult to ask questions .	-1.8483
At the age of 18 he should get a vaginal plasty .	-3.6310
But , as he was depressive and knew that something was wrong , he demanded his medical files .	-6.0572
What he found was shocking .	-1.3450
I was sterilized at my birth – and nobody ever told me .	-4.2492
Bruce was born with a DSD , through which his body could not produce enough testosterone to develop genitals .	-2.4937
After learning the truth , he moved back to the male identity , received testosterone injections and removed his breasts .	-3.7774
It has become infertile as a result of the operation .	-3.8270
Today , he is fighting for others in an organization called Interface Project to see intersexual people as normal .	-4.3827
But Anne Tamar-Mattis , Managing Director of the California legal group Advocates for Informed Choice , is concerned that German law can “ encourage stamping and stigmatizing . ”	-3.7947
“ Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and to refuse to “ allocate ” the child , she said .	-5.2707
We fear that this favours intervention .	-2.6543
We think it would be better to assign the male or female sex and then wait .	-3.3856
But we do not yet know how the law will affect , so we can only speculate .	-3.0522
Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports the Australian law , because “ it allows adults to be recognized as the third sex . ”	-5.0993
“ Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal sex , ” she explained .	-2.5874
German law is about giving birth .	-2.7381
This is not a fight to which small children should be forced at this time .	-3.8869
When they grow up , they can decide their own body .	-3.1243
But Dr Arlene Baratz , a breast radiologist from Pittsburg , who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and who supports hundreds of others in a self-help group , says that German law “ empowers ” both parents and children .	-4.2827
Katie , the daughter of Baratz , was born with male chromosomes , but has a DSD called complete Androgen resistance .	-3.2040
Due to the defective receptor of the target cells for testosterone , Katie developed female characteristics .	-3.2790
She has a vagina , but no uterus and no ovaries .	-1.9765
Today Katie 29 is married ; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as a child psychiatrist .	-3.5335
She is infertile , but hopes to be able to get a child through adoption or a surrogate mother .	-4.1358
“ The law gives room to parents , so they don ’ t have to make hasty decisions , ” Baratz said .	-4.0652
It gives them time to make different tests and clarify things , giving them time before writing “ male ” or “ female ” .	-3.8303
In this way everything is fine – you pull the child big and love it .	-4.7242
You have a wonderful baby and you enjoy the happiness of your parents .	-4.2392
And you don ’ t have to do an operation quickly that can ’ t be reversed .	-5.6832
“ This includes the children in the decision and removes the fear that parents are harassing because they think they are not doing the right thing , ” she explained .	-6.0738
In the end , the child decides on the sex that fits better – and that is wonderful .	-4.7645
This will enable children to make their own choices .	-2.4678
Violate Unknown Girls by Auto Shot	-2.5848
Unknown people have injured a twelve-year-old in Saxony-Anhalt in shots from a car .	-4.2227
The perpetrators had probably fired on a group of children with an air force on Thursday evening in Ghent .	-3.5603
This was reported by the police in Burg .	-3.4106
The girl was slightly injured on the left guard .	-2.7735
Rescue workers brought the girl to the hospital .	-2.7399
The shot came from a small car that had passed a group of six children and suddenly stopped .	-3.4661
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car .	-1.0161
The perpetrators also shot at a bus stop .	-2.4111
A disc broke down .	-2.3185
They then moved away .	-3.0544
Determined the crime police , it was said on Friday . were .	-4.7052
Until now , the police inspection of Kempten can look back on a quiet Halloween night .	-4.1101
Officials were only called to enroll two children , who threw them against house facades .	-6.7715
Since the homeowners recognized this in good time and the ovaries were immediately removed , no material damage should have occurred .	-6.5516
In addition , some New Year 's Eve oil was ignited in the city , but there was no material damage .	-7.6776
A resident in the Bischof Friend 's Way reported that his car was wrapped in cloth-paper and his wheel caps were stolen .	-7.8863
Until the police arrived , however , the man found all his bicycle covers in the immediate vicinity , so the police did not have to continue to work .	-7.5596
Living with a future perspective	-2.8196
Waltraud Ries actually lives dreamlike .	-3.4383
Your house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with lots of greenery , an old tree tree population , nice neighbours and not too much traffic .	-4.8519
The city is just a few minutes away by public transport .	-8.0897
" I hope you are not afraid of spiders ? " asks Waltraud Ries and points to a fat spider on the door frame .	-8.0092
I have been looking for a new apartment for my husband and myself for some time .	-3.0336
But you know how difficult this is in Stuttgart .	-2.1315
The reason , however , is not a phobia , but rather a concern that she can no longer cope with the many steps leading to the house and the apartment in old age .	-8.4603
In addition , since a Meniskus operation , the midfiftieth woman has had to learn at her own pace what it means to move from floor to floor with handicap .	-7.6579
Recently she published a book on ' Happily living in Old Age - Which form of living is the best for me ? ' .	-6.1155
'Our apartment is the best example of what is not possible in old age ' , she begins to tell .	-4.9574
When she moved with her husband to the Maisonette apartment more than 20 years ago , it was simply a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green .	-4.4342
Today , at the age of fifty , Waltraud Ries thinks differently .	-4.1915
She also knows , however , that she is one of the few people who even deal with the subject of ' housing in old age ' .	-4.8039
Most crowd it out as long as it goes .	-2.6235
Old are always only the others ' , she says shimmering .	-5.1458
Only when the pressure of suffering is really great do you think .	-5.0345
" Then it can be too late , " says Ries .	-3.4126
In her book , the interior architect presents 17 living models for self-determined living in old age .	-4.1134
" What form of living you choose is always an individual decision , " she explains .	-4.1094
D i e solution there is not for age .	-1.6037
Even those who can afford retirement in Tuscany or Brittany should always think that they can get sick .	-7.9370
And : ' Without good knowledge of the language of the country , one can also unite in the Dolce Vita , ' the specialist book authors ask for consideration .	-8.3556
Among her models are classic care models , alternative forms of living or the often cited pensioner-WG .	-5.0412
Everyone has his ticks and macks at age .	-5.0794
" For me such a community would be nothing , " she says with a wink .	-4.5044
Not at all like a student WG with a common bathroom and a kitchen .	-4.6298
" At age one simply needs his retractable rooms " , says Ries .	-5.1128
However , the author does not want to rule out the possibility of a senior-living community working .	-5.8334
However , this has to be different from the classic Studenten-WG .	-5.7628
And sometimes you just want to rest , ' she believes .	-3.4282
It is not alone in this view , at least in the state capital .	-4.5289
'Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay as long as they go in their own home ' , is also the experience of Theresa Rütten , the head of the citizen services life at the age of the provincial capital .	-5.2741
Your service advises people around the subject of ' getting older ' .	-5.0065
For this reason , it is precisely older people who would often also accept inconvenience and restrictions , only in order to be able to stay in their familiar surroundings , that is also the experience of the Stiftung Warentest .	-8.5831
Today there are many ways to make the house or apartment accessible .	-3.6155
Ries recommends that all who are concerned with the renovation of their house or apartment in accordance with the age of their home should first inform themselves thoroughly and not appoint the first best craftsman .	-9.5965
Today , there are also specialists for the renovation of old buildings .	-5.7683
Even in the apartment one or two can be realized , and if it is only the increase in the number of toilets , the interior architect will clarify .	-7.7057
But it is not always possible to change the existing flat according to age and thus without barriers , even if it is still so beautiful .	-6.2986
This experience had to be made by Waltraud Ries .	-2.9472
It is possible to install a stairlift inside the apartment , but the path paved with stairs to the door of the apartment would be far more difficult .	-7.9012
She will continue searching until she has found the ideal object for herself and her husband .	-2.8100
Before moving , it greys her more than in front of the spider on her door .	-5.8122
The US wants to pursue Snowden ’ s	-3.6164
The US has not changed its stance on former US intelligence officer Edward Snowden .	-2.4856
He is still accused of having passed on illicit secret information .	-4.7966
As a result , he had to face criminal proceedings in the US , said the US State Department spokesman , Jennifer Psaki , in Washington .	-4.5207
Snowden ’ s recent statements would not change that either .	-2.9114
Previously , German Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele had appealed to the US not to threaten him further with punishment after meeting Snowden in Moscow .	-4.9141
Psaki emphasized that Flubele ’ s remarks were that of a parliamentarian , not a German member of the government .	-5.0491
Secretary of State Edward Snowden is generally willing to talk to German authorities .	-4.5334
First of all , however , he wants to clarify his situation .	-2.7472
The former NSA staff sought by the US made this clear in a non-addressed letter published by Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwarded it to the Federal Government , the Bundestag and the Advocate General .	-5.9183
The letter has the following wording :	-3.6256
Responsible	-5.6159
I have been asked to write to you about your inquiry into mass surveillance .	-2.5118
My name is Edward Joseph Snowden and I used to be a contract or a direct job as a technical expert at the National Security Agency ( NSA ) , the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) and the Defense Intelligence Agency ( DIA ) of the United States .	-4.0728
As a result of my work in these institutions , I have witnessed systematic violations of my government 's laws , which have led me to act on moral grounds .	-5.8646
As a result of the publication of these concerns , I found myself exposed to a serious and persistent hatch that forced me to leave my family and home .	-5.5175
I currently live in exile and enjoy temporary asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation in accordance with international law .	-6.8967
I am encouraged by the response to my political action , both in the US and elsewhere .	-2.4711
Citizens around the world and also senior officials - including the United States - have judged the revelations about a system of all-encompassing surveillance that is accountable to no one as a public service .	-5.0940
These spying revelations resulted in many proposals for new laws and policies aimed at the previously concealed abuse of public trust .	-4.4666
The benefits to society from these insights are becoming increasingly clear ; at the same time , the risks taken were visibly reduced .	-4.6031
Although the result of my efforts has been demonstrably positive , my government continues to treat dissent as a fidelity and seeks to criminalize and indict political expression .	-4.3949
Still , telling the truth is not a crime .	-2.5601
I am confident that the United States Government , with the support of the international community , will abandon this harmful attitude .	-3.5193
I hope that , if the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved , I will be able to contribute appropriately and legally to the responsible clarification of the facts regarding the statements made in the media , particularly with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports .	-5.5631
I look forward to talking to you in your country as soon as the situation has been resolved and thank you for your efforts to safeguard international law , which protects us all .	-4.2874

Kindergarten found a private buyer	-1.8353
" The building is in good hands , " says Winterlingen Mayor Michael Maier .	-2.2463
The community sold the former kindergarten in the Garden Road to a private person .	-7.2339
The Municipal Council approved the sale at its recent meeting in the non-public part .	-4.4236
The building changed its owner at a reasonable price .	-2.1935
" The community is satisfied , " Maier stresses .	-3.6207

Report : Obama ’ s campaign considered replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton	-1.9961
President Barack Obama ’ s closest advisers have secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden in the 2012 campaign with Hillary Clinton , according to the New York Times .	-3.2975
The revelation is the most remarkable surprise of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann ’ s long-awaited work on the 2012 campaign , “ Double Down : Game Change 2012 . ”	-3.3551
The Times has a copy of the upcoming book , and it reported on Thursday evening that the president ’ s top advisers had conducted “ extensive group meetings and polls at the end of 2011 , ” to find out whether Obama ’ s waning hope of re-election would be better if he dropped Biden .	-5.8631
According to Jonathan Martin , the Times ’ national correspondent , the book thoroughly records the history of the efforts of senior campaign and White House staff , notably former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley , to measure the effect of exchanging former Secretary of State Clinton for vice president .	-6.0262
The potential change was a strictly guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office .	-2.4937
Only half a dozen of the president ’ s closest advisers – including Daley , Obama ’ s former campaign leader , Jim Messina , and the former White House senior adviser , David Axelrod , and David Plouffe – knew about the planned change .	-3.3940
In “ Double Down , ” Daley is said to have spearheaded efforts to exchange Biden , despite its “ close , personal relationship , ” before finally deciding against such a move , after data showed that Clinton ’ s candidacy “ would not significantly improve Obama ’ s chances . ”	-5.4226
In an interview with Martin Daley , Daley confirmed that the government had actually considered replacing Biden with Clinton .	-3.0208
“ I said a lot of things to consider , and that was one of them , ” Daley told the magazine .	-3.7188
It must be remembered that the President had terrible ratings at the time , so we thought , “ For God ’ s will , what are we doing ? ”	-4.6229
While Daley called the investigation “ due diligence , ” Martin told CNN ’ s Anderson Cooper that considerable effort was made during the re-election campaign to determine whether such a move would pay off in terms of the ballot boxes .	-5.4043
“ Campaigns don ’ t spend so much money on surveys and focus groups if you don ’ t think seriously about something , ” Martin explained at AC360 .	-4.9335
But it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team was looking for an exchange .	-2.6590
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his former boss knew about the potential change .	-2.5637
Although Daley said that he did not believe that the president was “ aware of the possible change , ” the former chief of staff admitted that it was “ possible ” for Obama to know .	-4.2219
Martin added that “ double down ” does not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether Obama ’ s desk political explorations have reached .	-3.8252
Cooper asked Martin if he thought seriously that Obama knew nothing about the investigation into whether Biden should be dropped in the election .	-4.4897
“ May ” , Martin replied .	-2.4958
What happens to my email ?	-2.8223
Email is actually called electronic letter .	-3.6416
Is it technically the case that mail secrecy has been implemented in the design of the Internet service , similar to that of conventional mail ?	-7.7311
When designing the early Internet services , the focus was on making communication possible .	-4.2199
For this reason , basic technical protocols have not taken care to create a solid foundation for listening safe correspondence .	-5.9835
As a result , a traditional email is more like an open postcard than a sealed letter .	-3.8952
If the user " Anna " sends an email to " Benni " , are the computers of the two connected directly ?	-7.7552
Anna 's e-mail program or browser sends the mail to the mail server of your service provider .	-4.5169
For example , if it has a GMail account , Google would be .	-2.2628
This mail server sends the content to the provider Benni uses .	-2.2537
On the route the mail can run over a number of other servers on the Internet .	-4.4518
Bennie can then call the content to his provider .	-3.1593
Are conventional e-mails read through the network ?	-4.6591
Most mails are read several times by software robots on the way .	-2.7143
The sender 's provider usually checks whether the mail contains a malicious program as an attachment .	-4.7139
A virus check is also carried out on the receiver systems .	-2.2434
In addition , providers check whether this is an annoying and unwanted spam mail that is deleted or at least sorted away into a spam folder .	-5.9614
Do the robots have another task ?	-1.9288
For systems like GMail , the robot also determines the information Google needs to place context advertisements .	-3.4106
If Anna and Benni communicate via GMail about their upcoming holiday trip , Google may link to holiday offers .	-4.3315
Do unknown people also read the emails ?	-4.3391
There is a very low chance that unauthorized people will read a mail .	-5.6112
In theory , however , this is possible .	-2.3080
In companies , administrators often have the opportunity to read electronic mail .	-3.5279
The law enforcement authorities and secret services also have legal opportunities to intercept or take note of e-mails .	-4.1377
In addition , there are possible illegal spillovers .	-4.4135
Is it possible to protect emails from being read ?	-3.2935
Encryption according to the OpenPGP standard can effectively encrypt an e-mail from reading it .	-8.5481
It is also possible to conceal the metadata of an e-mail communication with a high technical effort , so that it is not easy to recognize who has communicated with whom .	-6.9112
How important are Yahoo and Google on the email market in Germany ?	-1.8562
Yahoo and Google play only a minor role in mainly privately used mailboxes , according to a study by Convios Consulting in August 2013 .	-5.2163
While the shares of Yahoo-Mail had last fallen , Gmail could increase significantly .	-5.6977
Mothers languishing in the Forest and Receiving	-6.5081
When his mother died , a man from Wolfsburg forged a plan .	-3.5480
He buried the dead in a forest - and continued to collect their pensions and care money .	-5.5180
A 67-year-old Wolfsburg buried his dead mother in the forest after police investigations .	-4.6277
First of all , he has covered up the death of the 89-year-old , and then he has spent more than a year and a half on the money .	-7.7119
Now the 67-year-old has to answer for fraud , as a speaker said on Friday .	-3.5487
So the man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt .	-2.6338
The man was suspected as early as May , when it was noted that no medicines were needed for the mother in need of care .	-5.6392
The pensioner told the investigators that his mother went to Spain .	-3.1494
Because officials found this strange , they continued to identify .	-4.9691
The two found out that they had lived in a common flat for more than 15 years and that they had last cared for it .	-6.3201
The 67-year-old finally admitted the death of his mother .	-2.3542
According to the police , an overproduction showed no evidence of a capital crime .	-4.5340
Do you want ice cream that shines in the dark ?	-3.6119
A British entrepreneur has developed the first dark ice using jellyfish .	-3.2183
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of the marine animals and created a brilliant delicacy .	-5.2848
The idea came to him after reading a research on jellyfish and convincing Chinese scientists to artificially produce the luminous protein .	-5.0031
The ice cream reacts with the tongue when consumed , increasing the pH value in the protein and releasing the light .	-4.0636
Chris explains that the ice cream responds to the warmth in the mouth and glows – the more you lick , the brighter it gets .	-6.4703
Charlie , founder of the ice cream company “ Lick Me I 'm Delicious ” , says , “ The product is incredible , but still in a very early stage of production , so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds . ”	-4.8463
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH value .	-1.9897
When the mouth warms the protein , the pH value rises and the ice glows .	-2.6152
We have tested it in recent months and it seemed ideal to launch it on Halloween because it has this wonderful light effect .	-4.7800
It is probably the most expensive ice cream I have ever made , because the jellyfish glow is four times more expensive than gold .	-3.7292
Each ball costs me about 140 pounds .	-2.4509
But it tastes delicious .	-2.7788
Charlies experimental company , based in Bristol , is famous for its unusual flavours , including beer , cheese , beef and leaf gold .	-4.0768
But his latest creation is to become even more ambitious .	-2.3172
He says , “ I would like to develop an invisible ice cream . ”	-2.3117
This is , in itself , impossible because of the refraction caused by the ice crystals that make up ice cream ; but I suspect we will find a way to create it .	-5.7966
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish artificially produced by Chinese scientists .	-3.0636
After six days of playing , the TSV Morsum is still without any points in the Handball Association League .	-4.8150
Now , for the team of Ingo Ehlers , tomorrow the Derby against TSV Daverden , who celebrated his first victory last weekend .	-6.2501
With this game the season starts again for us .	-2.4636
" I hope that we will finally have our head free , " Ehler 's attitude is optimistic .	-5.2531
With the exception of the permanently injured Hendrik Blohme , he finally has his complete cadre at his disposal .	-4.8827
Like us , Daverden also relies on temple play .	-5.0907
We therefore need to keep our error rate low .	-2.3824
In the first place , however , we need to increase our coverage , which has left nothing but a safe impression .	-7.2520
Daverden ’ s coach Thomas Panitz is clearly more relaxed after the first season victory against Nordhorn .	-4.7438
The game was of course a house number .	-1.7037
But that ’ s why we ’ re far from being the favourite , because everything can always happen in the derby .	-5.2291
Nevertheless , Panitz now wants to put up in Morsum to start a series .	-4.6799
Missing will be Jan-Malte Jodat .	-1.8124
For this purpose , the A-Jugend Joost Wind<unk>u<unk> , who is active with the right to play at the A-Jugend Bundesliga HC Bremen , celebrates his season debut .	-7.8053
Anyone who is not hot in such a game should stay at home .	-3.6940
Halloween 2013 : In figures	-1.7681
When I was small , Halloween had something magical .	-1.9540
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets , stay late and dress up for the neighborhood .	-2.8097
Today I have become a Halloween muffle .	-3.2620
Over the last two years , I have not agreed to distribute sweets from my home , and I do not intend to do so this year either .	-5.2893
But according to the statistics , I am a black sheep as far as Halloween is concerned .	-2.6917
The majority of Americans – 158 million , to be precise – celebrate Halloween this year , spending a total of $ 6.9 billion on sweets , costumes , and decorations , according to the US Association of retailers ( NRF ) .	-4.1257
One thing I am looking forward to every Halloween is the trend values .	-3.1157
The costumes will account for about 1.2 billion of the $ 6.9 billion spent , according to the NRF .	-2.8349
This year , exciting unlived items are the last cry .	-4.0884
Women no longer need to dress in sexy clothes , they can now also embody seductive food such as pizza , hamburgers , or carrots .	-4.7292
As far as men are concerned , I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead , and I bet that the Daft Punk spaceships will make it into the Instagram feeds this year .	-4.9610
According to Google , the most popular costumes are zombies , batman , pirates and witches .	-2.5876
I suspect there is nothing wrong with tradition .	-1.8767
We dressed our dogs last year and were not alone to my surprise .	-3.8130
Indeed , Americans spend $ 330 million this year on costumes for their pets , according to the NRF .	-1.9555
These are a lot of hot dogs .	-2.1096
With regard to sweets , we are not zimperle .	-4.0027
Americans will spend $ 1.9 billion this year , according to The Nielsen Company .	-2.0526
These are about 270 million kilograms of chocolate bars , lizards , bonbons and rubber balls .	-4.6727
So good news for the 41 million people , according to the US Department of Commerce , who are pulling through the neighborhoods with the phrase “ sweet or sour . ”	-5.0485
In fact , we will buy more than 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and – let us not fool ourselves – eat .	-3.2881
The only thing we do not want to consume is the sugar sweet Candy Corn ; yet 15 million kilograms of it are sold around Halloween , according to the National Association of confectionery Manufacturers .	-3.9944
That is about nine billion maize grains .	-2.7515
It is a mystery that I have not yet been able to solve .	-3.0271
There is nothing more to Halloween than houses where it spawns .	-3.6291
They have great names like “ Terror Behind the Walls ” ( which incidentally is in a real prison ) , “ Howl-O-Scream ” and “ The House of Shock . ”	-3.8577
In fact , there are 1,200 officially recognized Spukhäuser in the United States that generate $ 500 million in revenue , according to America Haunts , and that includes the wonderful photos you are pinning into your pants and then putting your friends on Facebook , where you won ’ t get rid of them again , and then leave a comment like “ nice expression . ”	-8.2741
But let us finally come to the pumpkins .	-2.2454
Charlie Brown familiarized us with the Great Cow when we were children , and lacing a pumpkin lamp is like decorating the Christmas tree – something we did from a small point of view . were . were the .	-7.1636
Fortunately , the “ baby in the pumpkin ” trend only began last year thanks to Pinterest , so most of us grew up carving the pumpkin and not sitting in it .	-3.9348
This year , Americans will spend about $ 106 million on pumpkins , according to the US Census Bureau .	-2.0645
The pumpkin barter , which slowly rotates in the garden , is probably from Illinois , where 245 million kilograms of pumpkin were harvested this year .	-4.9728
If you want to score the right points , call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa , California and make some hips from their 921 kilo pumpkin .	-5.5853
Housing Branding in Helmholtz : Rescue Forces Assets Horned Body	-8.0632
The fire brigade had to move out on Thursday evening in Helmbrecht .	-5.3795
A three-family house in the district of Hof catches fire during the night to Friday .	-4.8762
The rescue forces have a charred corpse from the house .	-4.2934
Rescue forces found a charred corpse in a three-family house during a fire in the Helmholtz law .	-6.5352
Whether it is a resident is still unclear , as a police spokesman said in Bayreuth .	-3.8100
On late Thursday evening it was burned on the ground floor of the house .	-3.7056
When the fire brigade arrived , the flames already hit out of a window .	-3.6680
The forces went to the apartment and found the corpse in a room .	-2.8382
This and another room burned out completely .	-2.7507
The entire ground floor was damaged .	-2.0277
All other residents were not at home during the fire , the police officer continued .	-3.8673
The staff were very friendly and helpful .	-5.1582
The exact cause of the fire was not clear at first .	-2.4380
Germany ’ s largest state church has an offensive party to promote the pastor profession .	-4.2406
The background is a possible parish angel : The Evangelisch-Lutheran Church of Hanover expects that the number of its currently around 1,800 pastors will halve by 2030 .	-6.7096
For young people today , the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects , said Pastor Mathis Burfien ( 43 ) in conversation with the Evangelical Press Service .	-4.1020
It is attractive to be able to determine the working and daily routine .	-4.9344
For the first time , Burfien commissioned a pastor on a full spot to inspire young people to study theology .	-4.9849
At present , fewer and fewer young people choose to study theology after graduation .	-3.7750
Burfien returns this to the process of secularisation : " God 's voice is silent , the world is loud " .	-3.6484
The profession is characterised by great freedom and diversity .	-3.1604
I am the master of my schedule and I can set my priorities where it is important to me .	-4.0377
Pastors could be very close to the people as carers .	-4.1445
They earned as much as teachers and could live well .	-2.2935
To be sure , more is paid in the free economy , but theologians would have a secure employer . are . are . , , , and are .	-7.6186
This comes to the young people of today who are concerned not only with careers , but with meaningful work .	-5.4920
According to the Landeskirche , which comprises three quarters of Lower Saxony , about 60 pastors are currently retired each year .	-6.6438
At the same time , about 40 graduates of a theology course start their Vikiat .	-3.9692
In sparsely populated peripheral areas , such as Harz , Emsland or Wendland , it will be difficult to fill jobs in the future .	-4.4196
Among other things , Burfien wants to organise study days for young people and to invite celebrities who have studied theology .	-5.1980
Theology studies offer a broad education .	-2.8010
You can even become President of the Federal Republic . are . are . are , , , , and are , , , , and .	-7.4518
Land Rover Rally Series	-1.6592
The interior features race seats and six-point belts as well as a hands-free system .	-3.4574
The options range from reinforced brakes , a service package with support for Bowler-Works mechanics and logistical support to vehicle storage between events .	-5.0825
Drew Bowler , CEO of Bowler Motorsport , explains : “ The rally customers coming to Bowler have changed . ”	-3.0279
They are not all experienced racers , but people who are looking for excitement and adventure as well as an accessible route to world-class events .	-5.0372
We are happy to open this way in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format opens up new possibilities to experience the various rally disciplines in the UK and abroad and to prepare newcomers for the strains and the reality of Rally Raid .	-5.6165
We really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge car – it will be an entertaining championship .	-4.0114
The Defender Challenge also features a training and test day in February and the option to participate in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East .	-4.1586
Called fire to save a bitch that was stuck 15 metres above the ground on a dangerous rocky outpost in a quarry .	-6.9376
Cockerspaniel female Ruby ran away after a minor traffic accident .	-4.4790
Three days later , it was discovered by a quarry walker in her predicament .	-3.9797
Firemen sat down on rock walls and saved the dog from safe death .	-4.9467
The fire brigade managed to secure a girl who was stuck on a 15-metre lead in a rock wall .	-6.2945
The nine-month old Cockerspaniel female Ruby ran away after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before being rescued from a quarry on Wednesday .	-5.3134
Scott Alderson , 25 , and his girlfriend Becky Hall , 20 of whom the dog belongs , came to the quarry Flapit in Denholme , West Yorkshire to welcome Ruby and thank the firemen of West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service .	-3.8275
They had desperately searched for their missing bitch and made calls for help on social networks when they had escaped into the quarry after the small traffic accident .	-5.8312
At around 14 : 15 on Wednesday , a walker who carried out his dog saw the stranded Ruby on the 15 meter high paragraph in the quarry .	-6.3630
The technical rescue team at the Cleckheaton Fire Station ran out and took off to rescue Rubys , which was then transported up in a dog box .	-6.0573
Andy Clayton , specialist in the technical rescue team , said , “ She was in a dangerous position .	-2.9910
It was located in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and the ground .	-4.3772
She did not move a muscle during her rescue – she was like frozen .	-3.7941
But now it is doing well .	-1.5691
She then eaten a few dog cakes .	-3.8171
This was a rather unusual effort .	-3.2292
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible .	-2.0453
Peter Lau , specialist in the technical rescue team , said , “ Ruby had a great luck . ”	-3.7359
It was possible that it was very seriously injured or worse .	-2.5091
Ruby was taken to the vet , but he found nothing except exhaustion and dehydration .	-5.4673
Becky Hall from Halifax , West Yorkshire , said , “ watching the rescue was terrifying . ”	-5.6210
I could not believe that she was really up there .	-3.0841
It was wonderful to keep them back in the arms .	-2.4733
The veterinarian explained that if exhaustion had become too great and it had collapsed , she would probably have crashed .	-4.7184
The firemen have done a great job .	-2.4213
What they have done was truly courageous .	-2.6789
We are simply so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible .	-2.4025
Scott Alderson from Keighley added , “ We were afraid that she would fall down , but she stayed up . ”	-3.3876
The firemen were great .	-1.5029
I can hardly believe where it was .	-1.7697
Mick Jagger explains that he never hired Katy Perry when she was 18 .	-2.3060
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week , the pop star said she worked as a background singer on Jagger ’ s song “ Old Habits Die Hard ” from 2004 .	-4.5709
Perry explained that she had dinner with the old rocker and that “ he added me when I was 18 ” .	-4.9468
She added , “ This has been a long time ago and he was very nice to me . ”	-3.7900
In a statement , a representative of Jaggers , 70 , said on Thursday that he “ categorically denied that he had ever attempted to approach Katy Perry . ”	-3.3264
The representative added , “ Maybe she confused him with someone else . ”	-2.8946
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest appearance on the Rolling-Stones tour this year .	-3.2616

George Kerevan : European unbundling gives the Scots the choice .	-2.4999
A new day , a new story of terror about independence .	-2.0361
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland is needed to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership .	-2.2686
This is the key word for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a barbed wire border along the Hadrian Wall .	-3.4278
Indeed , the Strathclyde proposal highlighted the possible economic benefits that would bring more freedom of travel to the rest of Europe , but this was – as expected – irrelevant in the headlines .	-6.0360
No one has also mentioned that EU member states often bend their strict rules when it is cheaper for them .	-4.7325
Given that Scotland is not part of the Schengen area at the moment , continuing disregard for Brussels would be a small concession in exchange for what one really wants from the Scots .	-5.2366
This is not a story . .	-7.0573
And one that has come so far that it is already like a fossil : for the first time I heard the “ independence means passport controls ” duck at least 40 years ago .	-5.0935
An interesting point is lost when this ancient history is constantly repeated .	-5.5783
Why expect an independent Scotland to dance according to the European pipe ?	-3.3532
Why exchange the London yoke for that of Brussels , especially now ?	-2.4255
These are the real European news : the great post-war plan to unite Europe has stalled .	-3.7429
With the euro crisis , the European project has officially died .	-1.9309
Across the EU , parties that are hostile to the EU or want to throw the euro out as a common currency are gaining ground .	-4.1285
Even in Germany , the Euroskeptic Alternative for Germany – founded only this year – could win nearly five million votes in the federal election in September , effectively expelling Free Democrats ( the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats ) from the Bundestag .	-5.0945
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federalist Europe .	-2.3617
But the current economic crisis turns out to be a turning point .	-2.2998
Because of the strict austerity policies imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank , in conjunction with the straitjacket to which the national economy is forced by maintaining the single currency , many people believe that the European project has gone too far .	-5.0953
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments causing excessive budget deficits – only in Greece .	-2.5871
Instead , the Eurosystem has fixated its members on exchange rates , which are beneficial to German exporters – and German policymakers would like to leave that way .	-5.6497
Without the possibility of devaluation of the local currency , southern Europe will find itself with a built-in productivity disadvantage compared to Germany .	-4.7176
The only way is to cut wages and public spending – spurred by Berlin .	-2.3129
Behind the current budget and currency problems lies a deeper European productivity problem .	-2.5754
As a result of the “ green ” energy policies imposed by Brussels – a code for subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – European industry pays twice as much for electricity as the United States , and four times more for gas .	-4.7104
This is a crippling cost disadvantage , as we saw in Grangemouth .	-2.6819
All the world ’ s wage arrears do not protect the European petrochemical industry from being pushed into the corner by cheap American shale gas .	-2.7792
As a result , a revolt is rising , especially in France , the EU ’ s former cheerleader .	-3.1018
After the war , the French political elite saw the EU as a vehicle to keep Germany in check and raise Paris on an equal footing with Washington .	-3.3750
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy , and has pushed Europe on its own economic policy , which is struggling the troubled French economy .	-5.8668
As a result , Marine Le Pen ’ s right-wing , anti-EU National Front has just won a decisive re-election , placing the ruling socialists in third place .	-4.2406
The National Front is now the most popular party in France , with 24 % of the vote – a timely warning to the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a right-wing split would automatically bring benefits to the left .	-4.3476
What does Le Pen do with his newly gained popularity among working-class white French ?	-3.3381
It wants to use the EU elections next year to forge an anti-EU , anti-Community currency bloc in the European Parliament .	-2.8514
If the anti-EU parties do well in these elections – and that is very possible – such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament for the first time .	-3.5840
This is the point I want to make : in the not too distant future , the growing resentment against the EU and the single currency will be combined to abolish the euro .	-4.6531
The EU will not disappear , but it will become something like the “ Europe of ( sovereign ) nations , ” which General de Gaulle favored .	-2.5748
Germany and a few of its satellite economies may hold on to the euro , but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies .	-4.7751
I expect Britain to distance itself from this project in the hope of enlisting itself with the United States .	-3.4982
But Washington ’ s growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain alone will be in Atlantic rain .	-2.5429
Where is Scotland in all this ?	-2.3968
We can decide to be a region of ( ultimately ) Little England .	-2.6606
Or we can defend our own economic interests – including saying Berlin and Brussels what they can do where .	-3.9739
I suspect that , if we retain our own currency , Scotland could do well in a looser European grouping .	-5.1607
Cooperation with other similar countries is easier in a non-federal Europe of nations .	-2.7308
Otherwise , we should consider equating it with Norway and maintaining our economic independence .	-3.2711
The SNP government in Scotland is – remarkably – the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe and won a spectacular majority in 2011 , owing to the rejection of the proposed ( and implemented ) cuts that Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory Lib Dem coalition were responsible for .	-4.9016
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to opt for independence now , only to get austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels .	-3.5766
Early puberty : Growing Up faster	-3.2795
Afro-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white counterparts , as studies show .	-2.7995
Physical changes do not mean puberty immediately .	-2.3835
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible .	-1.5219
Experts believe that epidemic obesity is a catalyst for early puberty .	-2.6903
The trend toward early puberty is less pronounced in boys .	-3.7241
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in child health and family issues .	-2.5727
Should a mother be worried when her daughter grows breasts and shamhaars at the age of seven or eight ?	-4.3554
At the annual American Academy of Pediatrics Conference this week in Orlando , Florida , the pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and were a new norm .	-3.8027
“ I spend a lot of time reassuring parents – usually this is no sign that puberty is now fast , ” explained Kaplowitz .	-5.4853
Evidence of the development , such as growing breasts , scalp and underarm hairs , and body odour , can be seen in girls earlier .	-7.6432
However , there was only a slight shift in the age of the menarch ( occurrence of the first menstrual bleeding ) in the last 40 years .	-4.8889
In the United States , the average age is 12.5 years , slightly less than 12.75 in 1970 .	-1.8229
“ When the development of breasts begins , it will take at least two to three years to reach the Menarch , ” said Kaplowitz , author of the book “ Early puberty in girls : the essential guide to dealing with this common problem ” .	-6.2654
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty progresses .	-2.4766
It is controversial what is actually the beginning of puberty , but it is “ premature ” when breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth boost of eight years ago .	-4.9302
In most cases , the process slows down or stagnates – something that a pediatrician can monitor closely .	-2.5225
With faster progress , tests could be indicated by an endoconologist to prevent serious problems such as tumours or cysts .	-6.2096
There are treatment methods for delaying early menstruation and averting another consequence : premature aging of the bone , which can ultimately lead to growth inhibition and thus small body growth in adults .	-7.4180
The recommendations for medical or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child , development speed , growth rate and emotional maturity .	-3.7477
Psychosocial aspects are also important .	-1.1759
Kaplowitz is cautious about drugs , but he admits : “ The suppression of puberty can alleviate the behavioral problems and feelings of girls , unlike being their peers . ”	-7.7672
The other big problem is understandable : parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have the period .	-1.9752
“ They worry about pregnancy risk or how they handle the hygienic side , ” said Kaplowitz .	-3.6851
“ It was a shock , ” a woman remembers , whose daughter got her days with ten .	-3.8039
Although there were first signs and we had talked about menstruation , she was emotionally unprepared .	-3.4290
She came home scared and excited from school because she was the first in her circle of friends .	-3.0346
There are many widely published theories about the causes of early puberty .	-2.2142
But there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other food , chemicals in the environment , or sexual messages in the media are causative .	-3.2767
Like girls , boys come to puberty .	-3.8502
Kaplowitz believes that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of obesity .	-2.2578
He supported the carrying out of a study in 2001 on girls aged six to nine who establish a link between body fat and puberty .	-5.2802
Other studies support this conclusion , but there are many other factors that played a role .	-2.1197
In that country , African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white counterparts .	-2.2605
There are various explanations .	-2.1499
Globally , early puberty seems to be influenced by all sorts of things , from economic conditions to the climate to genes .	-3.5772
Another mystery : Although boys have been growing face and puberty in the past , the trend toward full-scale earlier puberty is not as pronounced as in girls .	-6.4800
Other doctors at the AAP conference emphasised the complexity of the issue .	-3.2143
The appearance of acne and shamhair is common even in babies and infants .	-3.7746
“ We must be careful about how we identify the true beginning of puberty , ” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman , a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children 's Hospital in Morristown , New Jersey .	-3.3308
Parents should not hesitate to ask their pediatrician how to talk to their child .	-2.8599
“ This can mean that you have to talk earlier than expected , ” said Kaplowitz .	-5.0102
If you stay calm , the child usually responds well .	-3.4704
Girls who bloom early need the insurance that the process is a normal part of life , even if it occurs earlier than intended .	-3.4090
Jumbo manufacturers argue over seat width in the face of large orders .	-3.5688
There has been a dispute between leading aircraft manufacturers about the breadth of tourist class seats on long-haul flights , which sets the tone for a bitter clash on the Dubai Airshow this month .	-5.2221
The dispute revolves around the range of seats offered to passengers on long flights in the tourist class – not always the ones that airlines are most concerned about , but this designated area is the key to the efficiency claims of the latest Airbus SAS and Boeing Co. aircraft .	-7.2271
This week , Airbus called for an industry standard requiring a minimum of 46 cm ( 18 inches ) seat in the tourist class , but the US arch-rival Boeing says that the airlines should decide .	-5.6711
The dispute comes at a time when aircraft manufacturers are competing to sell even larger versions of their two-engine long-haul aircraft , and expect record orders at the event from 17 to 21 November .	-4.9079
The shape of the rear part of the aircraft – especially whether there are rows of nine or ten seats – is crucial to the stated economic results that the new “ mini-jumbo ” design will deliver .	-5.5604
Boeing claims that its modernized “ 77X ” will hold 406 people in tourist class seats that are more than 17 inches wide and thus allow ten per row .	-5.7312
Airbus states that the competing version of the A350 will carry 350 passengers in 18 inch wide seats in the tourist class , with nine per row .	-5.0152
Aircraft giants often report technical details by advertising in the trade press .	-5.3748
Airbus is now appealing directly to the public in front of the Dubai Airshow , where the 777X is expected to take the race with more than 100 orders .	-4.8783
Recently , the company presented an ad that could be the start of a new ad war , showing donors a picture of three people squabbling in a restaurant , with the title : “ Would you accept that ? ”	-6.2849
“ Boeing is proposing long-haul flights in seats that are closer than regional turbo props , ” says Airbus sales manager John Leahy .	-4.1947
People become thicker in the face of changing dietary habits , but aircraft seats have not changed radically .	-4.6888
Between the early 1970s , when the Boeing 747 defined modern long-distance travel , and the end of the century , the weight of the average male American between 40 and 49 years increased by 10 % , according to data from the US Department of Health .	-4.6564
According to US health statistics , the waist number of the average American in the 21st century is 100.8 cm .	-4.1304
Airbus says its rival follows a 1950 ’ s seat concept , when the average body size of the newly baptized “ jet set ” was narrower .	-4.3923
According to Airbus , studies showed that an additional inch ( 2.54 cm ) per seat increased sleep quality by 53 % .	-4.2011
Boeing denies the Airbus figures to the seats and says that it is not at the discretion of manufacturers to decide how airlines can balance fares and facilities .	-6.8691
The company also explains , according to research , the aircraft experience depends on more than the width of the seat .	-5.1594
“ It really amounts to giving airlines flexibility so that they can do what they believe they need to be successful , ” explains Boeing ’ s aviation cabin expert Kent Craver .	-4.9467
They do not want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable .	-1.1991
They know their business better than anyone else .	-1.5582
Passengers are talking about more elbow free , but manufacturers are increasingly becoming an issue that can affect sales .	-5.8262
Behind the contest is a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least $ 700 billion at list prices in the coming decades , which could have a lasting impact on the export balance of the US or Europe .	-5.9419
As Reuters first reported in July , the seating layout is the driving force behind the battle over the new jets .	-2.8758
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest twin-engine long-range designs than the market leader in this segment , the 365-seat Boeing 77-300ER .	-3.1094
Boeings ’ statements on the results depend in part on the 777X being compared with its ten seats per row with the original design of nine seats in the 777 .	-5.0007
The increased costs per unit are still lower than those currently used with ten seats per row .	-3.8971
“ Boeing is queuing more seats in its aircraft to make it more competitive with our products , ” says Kevin Keniston , Head of Passenger Comfort at European Airbus .	-4.8076
On the other hand , analysts say that full cabins with ten seats per row , with existing 777 s , indicated that many passengers decided to move closer , with cheaper fares .	-6.4447
“ Eighteen inch seats would be great for passengers , but the reality is : from an economic point of view , the Airbus offer is controlled by the threat of the 777 , ” says Mary Kirby , cabin equipment expert , founder and editor of Runway Girl Network .	-4.4299
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats , but a catalogue of suppliers from which the airlines can choose .	-3.2171
The world ’ s travelling jet sellers even carry the band ’ s weight to measure the equipment in the competition .	-6.7633
Even if they promote comfort , all manufacturers also offer high-density jets for low-cost airlines and regional flights .	-4.8946
Airbus offers a 10-seat A350 but , according to its own statement , has not yet sold it .	-4.5290
Until recently , Airbus stressed the importance of greater cabin adaptability and offered wide aisle seats for some jets .	-4.5186
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets , experts say that the call for a new industry standard is likely to come to an end , but could be distracted by the wave of 777X sales .	-6.0133
New Anti-nicotine Vaccine could Garnish Smoke	-5.5184
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could spoil the fun of smoking .	-2.2768
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for a lifetime .	-3.4029
Prior to human tests , further tests are needed , which may take several years , but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said that the first results were good .	-4.9591
“ We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to stop using all the methods available on the market , but have experienced that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches , ” says Cornell .	-4.9926
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus , which has been modified to contain genetic information to produce nicotine antibodies .	-3.4044
The virus selectively infects the liver cells , which then produce a permanent stream of antibodies .	-2.6635
The antibodies chase the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain , which means that a smoker does not experience nicotine high .	-3.9999
In trials , vaccinated mice , administered to nicotine , maintained their normal level of activity .	-4.4750
By contrast , mice without vaccination would have taken a “ time-out , ” researchers said , a sign that the nicotine has reached their brains .	-4.4759
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine .	-1.6972
Previously , tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies .	-3.2790
Vaccines had to be given so often to maintain the antibody level that they were expensive and impractical .	-2.4756
But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be significantly lower , as it turns liver cells into antibody factories .	-3.2784
As Professor Crystal said , a future vaccine for people , if it is quite safe , could be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette , thereby preventing nicotine addiction .	-4.6097
But it is more likely that smokers will use him to stop .	-2.9719
“ They know that when they start smoking again , they no longer enjoy smoking because of the nicotine vaccine , and that helps them to take the habit , ” he explains .	-6.5402
British scientists said that the results were interesting , but warned that further research was needed .	-3.0974
Confronted to have been influenced by Obeid	-3.2680
The former minister of the laboratory party Joe Triodoi from New South Wales is being investigated by the state corruption supervisor .	-6.2908
The former NSW minister denies having changed the maritime-lease arrangements at the request of his political mentor , Eddie Obeid , who had covert holdings in three plots of land in state-controlled land .	-5.9374
On Friday , the Independent Commission Against Corruption ( ICAC <unk> Independent Commission against Corruption ) expanded its investigation into whether Obeid had influenced various state ministers to extend lease contracts on the Circular Quay , where the Obeids ran two restaurants and a café , without a call for tender after their expiry in August 2005 .	-6.9366
Now , due to the accusation that Tripadi had known Obeid ’ s hidden interest in the land after Tripadis ’ s former deputy chief Lynne Ashpole had said so on Thursday .	-7.6370
In years of talks that began in 2005 , the government had pushed for public tenders for lease contracts .	-4.3266
The tenants were against it and also wanted longer maturities .	-8.4914
In 2009 , the lease contracts for Circular Quay companies , which contributed $ 2.5 million annually to the Obeids , were extended without a public tender .	-4.8307
Tripadi , who was the port minister from February 2006 to November 2009 , originally called for public tenders .	-4.9814
But he refused to make the changes at Obeid ’ s request , which , as Triodoi confirmed , had pushed for a reorganization of the government ’ s lease arrangements .	-6.2646
A telephone note submitted to the ICAC showed talks from August and September 2007 between Obeid , Triodoi and Steve Dunn , a senior official who had moved to the port ministry after working under Obeid in the fisheries authority .	-6.4387
“ Was the subject discussed in these telephone conversations the elaboration of commercial leasing arrangements ? ” asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy Triodoi .	-8.6306
“ No , ” Triodo replied .	-3.4030
I cannot remember what was discussed , but it was definitely not .	-2.3183
Definitely not between me and Mr Obeid .	-1.3910
Israel ’ s Combat Aircraft Taken Goal in Syria , so Official Sources	-4.5814
Israeli fighter planes had attacked a target in the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday night , a senior government official confirmed to Fox News .	-4.4100
The official did not explain what the goal was , but said it was at least one .	-3.2203
According to Associated Press , the target was Russian SA-125 missiles .	-2.9582
At least twice this year , Israel has already launched air strikes on missile supplies in Syria .	-2.9935
Foreign workers with 457 visas could be subjected to “ authenticity test . ”	-3.4988
The government is considering a “ authenticity test ” for foreign workers with 457 visas as part of expanded measures .	-4.3023
If the test were to be introduced , it would be used by means of a criterion to prevent the 457 being used to fill unqualified jobs or as a back door for family and friends to move to Australia .	-7.8266
Today , a government proposal for discussion was published after former Labour Party MP Maxine McKew condemned the government ’ s comments on foreign workers , because they could be perceived as an insult by Australia ’ s neighbors .	-6.2004
“ Laughter such as “ foreigners are supposed to backfire ” and , Australia first hire , are a very unpleasant setback in times when unions demanded a protected labor market , ” she said to the Australia India Institute today .	-7.9035
Historically , that meant that white workers should be protected – and if some in the region hear an echo of this historic artefact , I would not be surprised .	-4.4169
The proposal for discussion outlines twelve measures that were once devised by former immigration minister Chris Bowen .	-4.0827
Immigration Minister Brendan O 'Connor , who was in Sri Lanka yesterday for talks on human trafficking , has implemented five of the recommended changes , and the others are being considered .	-4.3261
If the “ authenticity criterion ” is accepted , someone applying for a visa could be checked to see whether “ the application is genuine in cases where the applicant is related or personally connected to the owner or relevant person of the supporting company . ”	-6.0321
Companies could also be required to account for the number of 457 visa holders after hundreds of companies in the past that initially wanted to support only a small number of workers .	-5.3263
Meanwhile , a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker probably died of a heart attack after arriving this week with a refugee boat on Christmas Island .	-3.5462
The wounded nine-year-old son of the man who had come to Australia with him has been cared for since his father died on Wednesday by an adult cousin who was also on the boat .	-4.5663
Australian authorities brought the man to the Christmas Island Hospital where he died .	-1.4336
The British Government has announced a study to increase the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland .	-2.9275
HS2 Ltd 's work proposes to implement high-speed links between Scotland and the North of England as early as Phase 1 in 2026 .	-4.5326
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said that the project “ will bring Britain closer together . ”	-2.8532
The Scottish Transport Minister , Keith Brown , said that he was delighted to work with the British Government on this plan .	-5.0131
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail link between London and the West Midlands .	-2.5783
At the end of phase 2 there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds .	-2.9005
In June , the government adjusted the estimated cost of building the high-speed railway between London and North England from <unk> 32.7 billion to <unk> 42.6 billion .	-3.4663
The British Government , which is in talks with Transport Scotland , has commissioned HS2 Ltd to seek further route capacity and travel time improvements for Northern England and Scotland .	-4.6371
This includes the possibility of a journey of three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London .	-3.8477
Baroness Kramer said : ‘ Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network that brings Britain and its cities closer together . ’	-3.1762
We are making progress with HS2 because it brings enormous benefits .	-3.6928
Without it , we face a crisis of capacity in our rail network .	-3.0983
But there is also the link between 18 British cities , including Glasgow and Edinburgh , which is being improved thanks to HS2 .	-2.9098
Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael commented : “ Today ’ s announcement is good news for Scotland . ”	-2.7402
On behalf of the Scottish government , Keith Brown Carmichael called for “ unequivocal ” support for Scottish integration into the HS2 network .	-3.1411
Brown said , “ The high-speed rail link holds the potential for huge economic benefits for Scotland , but at the same time Scotland ’ s economic strength provides an argument for fast rail connections across the UK . ”	-5.3359
We are therefore pleased to work as a partner of the British Government and to examine the options for a high-speed rail link in Scotland , which creates benefits for all and complements the Glasgow Edinburgh link , which the Scottish Government is already planning . are . are , , , and , , , , , , , , , , ,	-8.8999
I look forward to examining the study report with the British ministers next year and to adopting the next steps together .	-4.9190
Regulations on electronic aircraft remain in force for the time being in Australia	-7.2172
Australian air passengers must continue to switch off tablets and smartphones at take-off and landing , despite efforts in the US to loosen regulations on such devices .	-5.1384
The US Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) allows US airlines to change their specifications so that passengers can read , watch , or play e-books during critical flight phases , provided they are in “ flight mode . ”	-5.2277
During most of the flight , passengers are already allowed to do so , but many people find it annoying that they are not allowed to read their E-Books when they start and land .	-8.4796
Australian companies are watching the decision , which US airlines will have to do a great deal of work to implement , but do not have immediate plans to change their rules .	-5.7848
The CASA Air Navigation Authority also stated that the announcement would be considered , but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic equipment in critical flight phases in Australia still apply .	-5.7283
“ At present , CASA has no specific regulations regarding the use of electronic equipment in aircraft , ” was announced .	-4.6637
The subject is subject to provisions whereby airlines must maintain safety at all times and passengers must follow the safety instructions provided by cabin crew .	-4.6375
Virgin has already had discussions with the CASA about extending the use of its Wi-Fi entertainment system on flights and says that you are open to change , but these should be initiated by the legislator .	-6.6364
“ We would welcome a review of CASA ’ s licensing of electronic equipment , because we are convinced that this would improve customer experience after we offer ( wireless entertainment ) during the flight , ” said a speaker .	-5.5469
Qantas explained that they will remain with the current regulations until further notice .	-4.4462
“ Our current policies stipulate that electronic devices must not be used when starting and landing , and we currently have no plans to change this , ” the company said .	-5.4560
FAA regulations apply to US airlines .	-1.9448
However , we are always interested in developments in regulations that can benefit passengers , and we will certainly look closely at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it .	-4.6558
The decision has different effects for US companies depending on the age of the fleet .	-4.5220
They must prove that their aircraft can tolerate mobile radio interference and change manuals , training materials , hand baggage programmes and customer instructions .	-5.2998
“ Once an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet , it can allow passengers to use portable , light electronic devices such as tablets , e-book readers and smartphones at all levels , ” the FAA announced .	-5.3987
In rare cases with poor visibility , the crew will instruct passengers to switch off the equipment during the landing .	-5.1999
The group also recommended that heavier equipment be stowed safely under the seat or in the compartments over the seats when starting and landing .	-4.5856
In front of the Revierderby against Schalke , irritated BVB trailers with light missiles provided ugly scenes in the Veltins Arena .	-7.7544
Borussia Dortmund announced severe consequences .	-2.8823
Before the Friday match of the Bundesliga against the VfB Stuttgart , the Ulters reacted with a silence - first .	-6.4718
It was an unusual , almost ghostly acoustics that offered the viewer in the signal Iduna Park until shortly before the start of the Bundesliga game between the German runner-up Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart .	-5.8863
The audience was mostly listening to their songs .	-4.9613
On the other hand , the southern gallery , where the most loyal and loudest of BVB fans are , was initially exceptionally quiet : no voices , no slaughter calls .	-8.1398
The podest of the Capo , which otherwise coordinates the joint launch , remained unsettled .	-4.8486
And at the very front of the grandstand a large flag was flying lonely , with the inscription " No Stadium " .	-8.4043
Only as a goalkeeper , Roman Weidenfeller , as always , was the first BVB player to enter the place , was a short-lived jubilee .	-7.6109
When his team colleagues followed , there were loud vocals and blowing scarves - but not everywhere .	-5.6256
There was nothing in the central blocks 12 and 13 in the southern gallery .	-3.5394
Also that Stadionsplacher Norbert Dickel once again listed the positive experiences of the last days - DerbySieg , Sieg über Arsenal , Vertragungsverlängerung von Trainer Jürgen Klopp - did not cause Festlaune .	-5.7467
Only five minutes before the kick-off the Capo got his podium - and until then the tension unfolded in a loud scream , when the mood on the ranks in the stadium was as usual .	-10.1312
Finally , as always , the South Grandstand was in the row - and finally the loudest place in the stadium .	-7.2180
And at the latest when the loud call " Derbysieger stands up " came from the southern gallery , everything was as usual .	-7.2388
The silence before me was probably a response to what has happened in recent days .	-4.0858
Just outside of Revierderby at FC Schalke 04 , some of the cheery BVB supporters fired light missiles into the spectators ' tracks and onto the square - almost goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller .	-10.0745
The game was delayed due to the chaotic scene .	-3.9013
BVB-Boss Hans-Joachim Watzke received the top of the Dortmund Ulters in his office - and if you think Wat's words , this was a rather unappointment for the fan representatives .	-6.7521
" There will be massive cuts for the whole ultra-movement , " the BVB-Boss announced on Thursday evening at a panel discussion in Frankfurt .	-4.0798
As an emergency measure , Watzke signed a choreography for the home game against VfB Stuttgart .	-4.1870
'I banned that , ' he said .	-2.9874
We cannot give up the zero tolerance policy on pyrotechnics .	-2.2125
In addition , the Ultras have been shown various possibilities of punishment - until Tuesday they have time to choose one .	-6.8618
Otherwise , Watzke says , the BVB will impose a sanction by the end of next week .	-3.5120
" This is going to be drastic , " said Watzke .	-4.5581
We can look forward to hearing what the reactions in the southern gallery will be .	-5.1350
Pfandhouses are booming in Singapore , as the crisis has reached the middle class .	-5.8179
In a deposit house in the Bendemeer shopping centre in Singapore , Janani Amirthalina exchanged a golden wrist , a ring and a pair of earrings to pay the school fees of her daughters .	-5.5015
“ My husband and I have just bought a house , there is all my money in it , ” says Amirthalinga .	-4.5853
Although she earned 3,000 Singapore dollars ( around € 1,730 ) as an administrative worker every month , and her husband also works , monthly family income is not sufficient , she explains .	-6.7275
Indeed , demand in parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt is increasing – is so high that ValueMax , where it has exchanged itself , became the third Pfandbrief listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week .	-5.2841
Spending jewelry is not only a quick way to get money – 1,300 Singapore dollars in the Janani Amirthalinga case – but also almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan .	-4.7950
Typically , Pfandhouses in Singapore demand an effective annual interest rate of 17 % , which is just over 15.4 % that the United Overseas Bank requires , a local lender with a branch in the same shopping centre .	-5.3025
However , deposit houses offer the advantage that no verification of creditworthiness or proof of income is required , which is why loans are possible faster than in banks .	-6.3770
For this reason , millions of people in the region turn to deposit houses , as families feel the pressure from rising living costs and increasing household and consumer debt .	-5.1171
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap credit due to loose fiscal policies in developed economies , families with lower and middle-income incomes are seeking deposit houses to make up for the difference in stockpiling economies .	-6.1343
This week , the rating agency Standard & Poor 's growing household debt , mainly due to rising mortgages , called a risk factor for Asian banks ' creditworthiness .	-4.4291
Malaysia , Thailand and Singapore , according to the Agency , have the highest budget debt in Asia compared to gross domestic product .	-5.5594
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80 % of GDP , an increase of 60 % in 2008 .	-3.5156
Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand , which this week has barely emerged from a technical recession .	-4.3397
On Thursday , the data showed a continuing weakness in exports and a decline in consumer demand .	-3.3823
“ In the end , this means that , given rising costs , people in the middle to lower segment ( the income scale ) will try to supplement their income wherever possible , ” says Song Seng Wu , economist at CIMB , a Malaysian bank .	-4.8203
Historical gold prices over the past two years have exacerbated the trend of personal belongings , as people use the opportunity to turn family jewelry into cash .	-6.2489
In Singapore , about 70 percent of the pledged objects are gold in the 200 pawns of the city state .	-4.7708

The largest Thai Pfandbrief operator , EasyMoney , has experienced 20 % customer growth in its branches in recent months .	-4.5708
The growth in the Pfandbrief business is so strong that ValueMax , operator of the branches in Bendemeer and 15 others in Singapore , wants to expand not only to neighboring Malaysia – where the company operates four houses – but also outside Asia , according to Yeah Lee Ching , CEO of ValueMax .	-5.1257
The company is financing this with 60 % of the 66 million Singapore dollars it received this week in Singapore .	-4.0398
While some lenders have fallen into the crossfire because of high interest rates , Yeah explains that mortgage houses not only provide cheaper interest rates than other lenders , but also did not directly raise debt .	-7.4402
“ Customers do not offend items they already own , and the liquidation of personal valuables does not increase household debt , ” she explains .	-4.1887
The Pfandbrief business is increasingly socially accepted as short-term secured financing .	-3.8192
Nor are all people using Pfandbriefe in financial difficulty .	-3.7195
Rich people from Singapore also come to ValueMax ’ s stores to store gold bars and Rolex watches , for which they receive up to 60 % of the purchase price in cash .	-3.9389
Customers come to us from any social class .	-3.8264
“ These include wealthy people who lend something in the short term for a business or investment , or small businesses that need to bridge cash-flow bottlenecks , ” Yeah says .	-5.8116

Rescue Package for $ 325 million Australian Health Service	-5.6394
The Australian government insists on the harsh conditions associated with the $ 325 million rescue package for the Tasmanian health care system to ensure that the state government cannot squander the money . are . are . are . , , , , , ,	-8.8195
Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take “ immediate action ” to avert a crisis caused by an aging population of the island state , a higher rate of chronic diseases and system restrictions .	-4.1790
The funding for a period of four years was decided after government consultations with the independent Tasmanian MEP Andrew Wilkie .	-5.5629
“ The government has put together an emergency rescue package that , in our view , addresses the unique challenges facing the state , ” explained Plibersek today .	-3.5376
The $ 325 million package includes $ 31 million in emergency election assistance .	-3.1944
Further 2600 operations , including orthopaedic surgery and treatment for gray star , are intended to eliminate residues .	-5.2984
In addition , there is money for day clinics in Hobart and Launceston , better after-care for in-patient stays , specialist medical education , mental health services and the introduction of a system for electronic recording of health data in local hospitals .	-5.0119
“ These investments correspond to the ideas that affected hospital staff have told me that they are the best way to improve the Tasman health system , ” said Tanya Plibersek .	-4.7857
The Minister insisted on strict reporting and accountability of the Tasman government .	-3.4574
The state must maintain the current level of funding to be able to receive money from the Commonwealth and report monthly where the extra money was spent .	-5.3935
A three-member commission will be set up to ensure that the federal state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible .	-7.1413
As Wilkie said today , the $ 325 million would be of little use if “ they are not accompanied by real reforms that put the public health system on a more sustainable course . ”	-4.1567
Nevertheless , he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent assistance , which he first expressed to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May .	-3.8077
“ I am confident that federal aid will make a major contribution to removing the federal public health system from the care list , ” Wilkie said .	-4.1359
According to the federal government , these benefits will largely compensate for the recent cuts .	-3.8324
But the federal opposition ’ s public-health spokesperson , Peter Dutton , believes that today ’ s announcement is just a “ plaster fix . ”	-4.5916
“ We are in a position today because the Laboratory State Government has withdrawn $ 430 million from the health system , ” he said to ABC TV .	-3.9215
It is not acceptable for a state government to cut nearly $ half a billion out of the system , and for the Commonwealth to put in 300 million and then pretend to be good news .	-6.5399
Dutton asked Plibersek to ensure that not a single dollar of the rescue package is spent on additional bureaucracy .	-3.2451

Syria has destroyed its ability to produce chemical weapons , a monitoring group says .	-4.5872
Syria has destroyed important facilities for the production of chemical weapons and gas-fired ammunition , declared the global chemical weapons monitoring group on Thursday , while in the north of the country there have been severe clashes near one of the sites where toxic substances are suspected to be stored .	-7.5878
Also on Thursday , a Syrian group of activists announced that more than 120,000 people had been killed soon three years since the civil war began .	-3.4614
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons ( OPCW ) was made one day before the date of the meeting .	-4.5423
1 November , which the Hague based organisation , Damascus , had set up to destroy or make “ inoperable ” all chemical weapons manufacturing facilities , including all the machinery for mixing chemicals into poison gas and filling ammunition .	-6.9866
The conclusion of this process , which is essentially the first stage of destruction , is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable aimed at destroying all Syria ’ s chemical weapons by mid-2014 .	-3.8155
Destruction of facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons .	-1.9977
But Damascus still needs to start destroying the existing weapons and supplies .	-3.3425
According to assumptions , there are about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons in the country , including mustard gas and nerve gas sarin .	-3.9949
The announcement came at a time when fighting took place in the city of Safira on Thursday , when experts said that there was a chemical weapons production facility and storage facilities , as the UK-based Syrian Human Rights Observatory reported .	-5.1712
The activist group , which is pursuing the number of deaths through a network of activists in Syria , declared on Thursday that 120,296 people died .	-4.2483
Of these , 61,067 civilians , including 6,365 children .	-1.8368
On the government side , 29,954 of them belonged to President Bashar Assad ’ s army , 18,678 were pro-government fighters , and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militias . were . were . were . were , and 187 were .	-4.4508
Also among the dead are 2,202 deserted army soldiers and 5,375 opposition fighters , many of them foreigners .	-3.8605
On July 25 , the UN estimated the number of deaths in this conflict to 100,000 since March 2011 .	-2.6308
This number has not been updated yet .	-2.2170
The conflict has forced about two million people to flee the country .	-2.1196
Assad ’ s forces have been fighting the rebels in Safira for weeks , many of whom have links with al-Qaeda groups .	-3.0613
The Centre said that there were losses on both sides on Thursday , but did not mention details .	-3.3066
The fighting underscores the danger posed by the chemical weapons inspectors , because their mission to liberate Syria from its toxic arsenal is a race against time in the midst of a raging civil war .	-4.2700
According to the OPCW , which works closely with the United Nations , the team “ is now convinced that it has seen all of Syria ’ s important production and mixing / filling facilities and witnessed their destruction . ”	-4.2290
Therefore , ‘ no further inspection activities are planned at the moment ’ .	-3.8580
Earlier this week , the inspectors said they had completed the first round of checks and visited 21 of the 23 sites indicated by Damascus .	-3.7453
Due to safety concerns , the inspectors said that it was not possible to visit two institutions .	-4.2965
On Thursday , the OPWC declared that the two sites had been “ abandoned ... and the chemical weapons program objects there had been moved to other facilities that were inspected . ”	-5.3342
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two facilities that the OPCW inspectors could not visit .	-3.1654
Syria has presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons , which must be approved next month by the OPWC Executive Committee .	-3.2830
“ I salute the bravery and bravery that you have all shown in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever carried out by this organisation , ” said Ahmed Uzumcu , Director General of the Monitoring Organisation , in a commentary published by OPCW .	-5.4220
For three years now , the mainly Sunni Muslim rebellions in this civil war have been fighting Assad ’ s government and its security forces , which include many members of the Alawites , a secession of Shia Islam .	-4.1993
With regard to further developments , the head of the observation group , Rami Abdurrahman , said that there was a strong explosion on Wednesday in an air defence facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia .	-5.0686
The cause of the explosion was unknown , he explained .	-1.9537
Wrath over the Bali bombers	-4.5673
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who died in the Bali bombings in 2002 were angered by the verdict on the last of the Anstifter , who was brought to justice , because Umar Patek believed that they should be shot steadfastly .	-8.3197
Patek , who was nearly ten years in flight as one of Southeast Asia ’ s most sought-after people , was sentenced to 20 years in prison yesterday for his role in building explosives in the bombing .	-5.1608
He could be released after 15 years of imprisonment .	-3.5786
The 45-year-old was found guilty of the mass murder because of the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta , where 202 people died , including 88 Australians , and many others were injured .	-3.8982
There was also a condemnation in a number of terrorist charges , including a wave of explosives attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000 .	-4.3388
The prosecution had demanded a life sentence , even if it could have applied for the death penalty for the man who , because of his reputation as a master bomber , is also called “ Democracy Man . ”	-5.9619
The decision evoked painful memories at June Corteen , a mother from Perth who lost her 39 years old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the devastation caused by Patek and his co-conspirators almost ten years ago .	-4.5727
With tears she said that Patek should have been sentenced to death .	-3.2426
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys .	-2.0893
" You should put it in front of a firing squad , " Corteen said to AAP .	-4.3248
I have to live every day that I will not get any more grandsons and I will never see my daughters .	-4.6532
The Sari Club was razed to the ground when on 12 October 2002 a huge bomb exploded in a small truck parked in front of the nightclub shortly after 11 p.m.	-5.8209
Peter Hughes was in Paddy 's Bar , where only 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber exploded a rucksack filled with explosives .	-3.1178
He fell into coma for a month after the attack , and “ died ” three times , while hanging on a life-support system .	-4.9745
Hughes said that Patek deserved the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cell Jemaah Islamiah – Amrozi , Mukhlas , and Imam Samurra – who were responsible for the bloodbath and executed four years ago .	-2.8809
In fact , this type should have the death penalty before everyone else .	-4.1971
To keep him alive - no , there is no reason to keep him alive .	-6.6466
Getting 20 years after he killed 202 people and injured many hundreds is not much .	-2.1076
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers to be tried .	-2.4557
He took almost a decade of arrest , but was eventually picked up in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad , where US forces killed former Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden just four months later .	-4.2779
During the negotiations , an FBI agent said that intelligence reports had indicated that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of rebuilding the link between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda .	-4.0670
“ He did not stand up , ” Corteen said .	-3.6683
Until recently , he has shown no remorse for how much suffering he has inflicted on other people .	-3.5663
The verdict was made before the ten-year anniversary of the attack this year , which is commemorated in Bali and Australia .	-4.5958
“ There will be many tears this year , ” Corteen said .	-2.3113
Patek may appeal against his judgment .	-2.4878
FAA : Passengers can now use electronic equipment on aircraft ( but not make mobile phone calls )	-3.1056
Air passengers can now listen to their electronic devices for reading , working , playing , music and viewing movies from departure to landing , but not phone them with mobile phones , according to the new guidelines issued by the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) in the United States on Thursday .	-6.6539
But passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately .	-1.7184
FAA staff Michael Huerta explained at a press conference how quickly they would be implemented .	-3.9687
The airlines must prove to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated the flight staff training manuals and the regulations governing the stowage of equipment in accordance with the new regulations .	-5.6783
The FAA stated that it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic equipment in aircraft .	-4.2091
These airlines also included Delta and JetBlue .	-2.6844
“ Depending on the state of the plan , we could approve the extended use of electronic devices very soon , ” the FAA announced in a statement .	-4.1339
At present , passengers must switch off smartphones , tablets , and other devices when aircraft doors are closed .	-3.1375
You may not restart them until the aircraft reaches a height of three kilometres and the captain gives the green light .	-4.6494
On entering the landing , passengers must switch them off again and must not restart them before the aircraft has landed .	-6.0518
According to the new directives , airlines whose aircraft are safe from electronic malfunctions could allow their passengers to use the equipment at the start , landing and on the rolling field , the FAA said .	-7.1319
Most new commercial aircraft and other aircraft converted to Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria .	-4.0922
Laura Glading , president of the professional association of cabin crew , welcomed the changes .	-3.7437
“ If the new scheme is safely implemented – and we work closely with the airline in this regard – both sides will benefit , ” commented Glading .	-4.5527
To be honest , we are tired of having to feel careless about this issue .	-4.8633
Nevertheless , Internet connections to surf , exchange e-mails , text messages or download data below three kilometres remained prohibited , explained the Authority .	-5.1450
Passengers are asked to bring smartphones , tablets and other devices into flight mode .	-3.3144
So there is still no “ Words With Friends ” online game that the actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 , when he had to leave an American Airlines jet publicly because he refused to turn off the machine while the plane was parked at the boarding gate .	-4.9608
And heavier equipment such as laptops must continue to be stowed , as there is a risk of injury if they fly through the cabin .	-4.9452
Mobile phone calls during the flight will also continue to be .	-3.9408
The regulatory competence for telephone calls lies with the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) , not the FAA .	-2.1523
FAA may lift a ban on certain electronic devices at take-off and landing .	-4.0856
Last month , Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board , a national transport safety expert on CBS News , said that mobile phones are still considered to be a risk .	-4.1871
“ Mobile phones are a real problem not only because they could potentially cause interferences in navigation devices , but because we know from the FCC that transmission from the air can also disrupt transmitter masts , ” says Rosenker .	-5.5198
A industry advisory committee , created by the FAA to investigate this issue , recommended last month that the government allow a broader use of personal electronic equipment .	-4.7397
In recent years , pressure on the FAA has increased to ease restrictions on use .	-3.5903
Critics like Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri argue that there are no valid grounds for the ban .	-3.3846
The restrictions are increasingly difficult to enforce , because the use of the equipment has become ubiquitous .	-4.1621
Some studies mention that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore switching off the device .	-4.2072
The FAA began in 1966 to restrict the use of electronic equipment by air passengers after reports of interference of navigation and communication equipment by UKW radios carried by passengers , which at the time represented the latest technology trends .	-7.7231
New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft , but they are also designed and approved by the FAA that they do not have any electronic interference .	-4.9257
Airlines have been providing passengers with Wi-Fi for a number of years when the altitude is reached .	-5.2552
The planes adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also less sensitive to interference .	-3.6535
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for the greater use of electronic equipment in accordance with the new directives , said Huerta .	-4.2207
Today ’ s electronic equipment generally emits much less radio radiation than previous generations .	-3.6305
E-readers , for example , only emit minimal radiation when you turn around .	-5.2201
However , when downloading or sending data , transmission values are stronger .	-3.5642
Amazon.com is one of ’ ’ of ’ s restrictions on ’ s use .	-4.0306
In 2011 , company employees loaded a passenger plane full of Kindle E-Reader and made a test flight to identify problems but could not detect them .	-5.1509
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using equipment .	-2.3224
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passers said that he thought the device 's disruption was genuine , even if the risk was minimal .	-4.8549
Other committee members have said that there are only isolated reports from pilots who speak for aircraft system disruption by the equipment , and most of them are very old .	-7.5695
However , the committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to arrange for passengers to switch off their equipment in poor visibility situations .	-6.3075
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and described them as a sensible adjustment for travellers who would now be well equipped with technology .	-5.6327
“ We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience does not conflict with safety , ” said Roger Dow , CEO of the U.S. Travel Association .	-3.3997
Unreleased by the air rescue service from North Sea Bay Island	-6.9036
A bird flown by air rescue service to the coast , which had been found exhausted on a North Sea borehole , was released back into nature .	-5.4631
The water rack was flown last month with a helicopter to Aberdeen , where it was duped by the Scottish animal welfare organisation SPCA in its rescue centre in Alloa .	-5.5744
Colin Seddon , head of the center , said , “ This watershed was probably a wintry train bird from northern Europe , held up by the strong winds over the North Sea . ”	-5.9468
Apparently the exhausted bird sought refuge on the drilling island .	-3.0063
He added , “ He could no longer fly , so we were contacted with the request for help . ”	-3.1900
When she was released , the water rack was back fit and healthy .	-5.3132
Is Europe ’ s elite prepared to do business with Britain ?	-1.7555
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy together and defining what those who provide wealth and work in Britain want to change in our relations with the EU .	-3.9417
To this end , we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey among British business leaders , asking them what they think about Britain , the economy , and the EU .	-3.0669
YouGov surveyed more than 1,000 business executives , representing about the UK ’ s corporate sizes , sectors , and regions .	-5.0806
The results of the survey will surprise many .	-1.4615
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now exporting outside Europe and concentrating on countries that modernise and grow while the EU states are stagnating .	-7.3304
They want the government to favor new trade links with countries like China , India , and Brazil , instead of stopping with the long and arduous process of reforming the obscure EU institutions .	-7.5920
In their view , the majority of economic leaders believe that control of these key competences should be brought back to Westminster on certain legally regulated issues – from antitrust to product legislation .	-6.0734
There was widespread dissatisfaction with the internal market , because companies claim that the costs of Brussels ’ rules would now outweigh the benefits of being part of Europe ’ s trade zone – even 40 % of large companies agreed with what has traditionally been the most pro-European .	-5.6728
Finally , and probably the most says , our survey of business leaders found that a clear majority wanted Britain to move towards a change in the agreement , and a relationship with the EU based on trade , not politics .	-6.7515
This insight , found in companies of all sizes and leading corporations , shows that the economy is pushing for a “ meaningful change ” that brings the trade back to Britain .	-5.8748
It is about much – a change in the agreement and better conditions for the UK would lead to a 16 % change of opinion in favor of remaining in the EU in a referendum .	-5.6674
The Prime Minister should have no doubt : this survey shows that the British economy is behind his plan to renegotiate the British conditions for EU membership .	-3.3965
It also shows that companies expect a clear shift in power relations back to Britain from renegotiation .	-3.2377
A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary now that the eurozone is moving toward closer economic and fiscal union .	-2.5737
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK , as the result of our survey shows , which means more attention for businesses to trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels regulatory approach .	-4.1671
Alexei Miller of Gazprom calls pipeline in Bulgaria the beginning of a new gas era	-4.9467
The construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria is the start of one of the largest European energy projects , the Gazprom Executive Board said .	-4.2733
“ Today ’ s event is a milestone : construction work on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline , the largest and most important project in Europe , has begun , ” said Gazprom ’ s CEO Alexei Miller , in a statement on Thursday .	-3.6818
The project is a key element in the energy security of the entire European continent .	-1.8615
South Stream is supposed to create more diversity in Russia ’ s export routes through Europe .	-3.4847
A treaty dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine , where most of Russia ’ s gas is stored for Europe , raises the risk of conventional routes , as officials have said .	-5.1686
Miller said that the direct link to Bulgaria , a member of the European Union , means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries have been “ eliminated forever . ”	-2.7546
Bulgarian consumers receive gas from South Stream at discounted rates when the entire project goes into operation in 2015 .	-3.2993
According to Gazprom , construction works in other secondary countries will begin on the planned route at the end of the year .	-3.9582
The pipeline has an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic metres of natural gas .	-2.2647

German real estate markets profit from the economic strength and favourable economic conditions in the country compared to Europe .	-3.9727
Christian Ulbrich , CEO Europe , Middle East and Africa of Jones Lang LaSalle , pointed this out at the 9th property day of the Stock Exchange newspaper .	-4.0045
The search for German commercial real estate shows the transaction volume , according to Ulbrich .	-5.1552
In the first three quarters of this year , it was 31 % higher than in the previous year .	-3.4014
In the UK , the plus was only 6 % , in France 19 % .	-3.5602
" Real estate investments offer attractive interest rates , " Ulbrich said .	-3.1910
The margin between real estate and federal bonds is historically high .	-3.1311

A hearing before the Royal Commission : Two YMCA staff accused of accusations against Jonathan Lord for sexual offences	-4.6365
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales ( NSW ) were charged with sexual crimes related to children before charges were levelled at the child care worker Jonathan Lord from Caringbah in 2011 , as the Royal Commission for Child Sexual Abuse reported .	-6.1983
But , in the opening statement before the Commission , the YMCA had declared that “ there was never an incident of sexual abuse in the organization . ”	-5.6576
Managing Director Phillip Hare was asked about a case in which a YMCA employee was accused of child pornography offences , and another in which a sports teacher at YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted in 1991 of abuse of children entrusted to him .	-6.0079
Hare said Gail Furness , a lawyer assisting the Commission , that he knew of the first case but did not know the second .	-3.2762
He admitted that the YMCA ’ s opening statement to the Commission was also inaccurate in claiming that “ there had been external YMCA checks that recognized the YMCA as the frontline in child safety . ”	-6.4915
Evidence before the Commission shows , on the contrary , that YMCA was informed that it received the second lowest possible assessment of four in a Quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities ( Ministry of Education ) in August of the year .	-6.0816
Hare , who started with 21 at the YMCA , admitted that the management failed “ from me down ” in hiring Lord and did not ensure that employees were aware of their obligations to report violations of the children ’ s safety guidelines .	-6.4541
Lord was convicted at the beginning of the year for sexual offences against twelve boys during his two years in YMCA .	-4.2656
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison .	-1.4143
Hare , however , denied that the YMCA had a cultural problem that prevented employees from reporting Lord ’ s violations of children ’ s security .	-9.2478
The staff said that they had observed violations , including that Lord was alone with children , privately looked after them as babysitters , let them sit on his lap , said that he loved it , and let children play with his mobile phone .	-6.0198
Danielle Ockwell , whose superiors were Lord and who had asked for a child protection training because she was concerned about his behavior , said that child service leader Jacqui Barnat , who was the superior of Lord in YMCA Caringbah , “ was very intimidating and most of the time very unobtrusive . ”	-8.3808
The managing director explained that he would not accept statements from employees that they had not dared to report to their superiors .	-5.3719
Instead , he said , their friendship with Lord has compromised their judgment , which is why they would not have reported it .	-5.9082
Hare explained that he told the board of the YMCA NSW that the lesson that the organization had to learn from the “ Jonathan-Lord incident ” was “ not reporting ” by staff , and the board agreed .	-6.1621
Hare said that the decision to push staff to sign secrecy obligations shortly after the allegations were made was made by the managing director of the YMCA 's children 's services , Liam Whitley .	-5.8169
He said that it was intended to prevent contamination of the evidence , but that was ‘ over-zealous ’ and poorly implemented .	-4.7840
The YMCA NSW was not a child safe organization when Jonathan Lord was there between 2009 and 2011 , explained Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University , an expert on child sexual abuse , to the Commission .	-4.3070
He explained that there have been “ serious problems ” with staff recruitment , review , familiarisation , training and supervision .	-4.4731
The hearing was postponed until 20 December .	-0.8422
Tony Blair said he would seize the opportunity to return as British Prime Minister , but acknowledges that a comeback is unlikely .	-3.6404
In an interview tonight on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his retirement , the 59-year-old announced his views on various domestic issues .	-3.3673
Since his resignation in June 2007 , after a decade as Head of State , Blair has largely avoided speaking out on British politics , and has mostly confined his comments to foreign policy and his role as envoy to the Middle East Quartet .	-5.9037
When asked whether he would like to return to the Prime Minister , Blair was quoted by the Evening Standard in London as saying , “ Yes , safe , but it is unlikely that this will happen , so ... ”	-5.1427
When the horse show experts arrived in Cardiff in droves to pick the horse of the year , they knew that there was a fierce competition ahead .	-6.2066
But none was prepared for the three-year old Fenton Kirkland .	-3.0176
The Knirps , who is not even in the kindergarten and only made his first steps a few months ago , and his Shetland Pony Toffee roared through the three rounds and won the first prize – leaving 30 adult opponents behind .	-6.9295
The inseparable couple , equal in size , were praised for their performance , behavior , and style in the annual competition organised by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff .	-4.9168
In his performance in competition with men and women with elegant melons , he had placed his leghold pieces in a cheeky angle and led the two years old toffee through the ring .	-7.0602
Fenton was praised by the jurors for his natural skills in dealing with the Pony , which were far above his age .	-4.8527
And toffee received top marks for his appearance and personality .	-2.8416
Fenton had received toffee last March as a gift for his third birthday and since then practiced with the Shetland Pony every day .	-4.3710
His mother , Donna , 30 , said , “ Fenton and toffee are a great trek . ”	-3.6243
They had to compete against the whole of the competition and went away with gold and rosette .	-6.5123
It was only the second time that he had taken part in a competition with toffees , and we were all thrilled when he won .	-4.2512
Exquisite strangers in the arena thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him .	-6.0653
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale , South Wales , follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells , who has been showing horses for over ten years .	-4.1404
Howell said , “ The entire audience was electrified and everyone fired and clapped . ”	-5.2652
He ran on sand all the length of the arena and , although he looked so tiny , he did a fantastic job .	-3.6399
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses , tractors and farms and has two chickens he cares about .	-3.5907
As he started , it will not take long for him to be on the “ horse of the year ” horse – and I am sure he will do well .	-4.4581
One speaker of the annual horse show said , “ Fenton is only three , but he knows how to deal with his pony . ”	-3.2969
Together they are a great team .	-1.3612
The jury judged Fenton and Toffee how well they had beaten and presented themselves in the demonstration ring .	-4.9773
They care about good cooperation between Pony and Guides – and there Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring .	-4.6267
I am sure that Fenton ’ s sweet clothing has played its part in making it really perfect for the occasion .	-6.1765
The Chinese Newspaper ’ s Call for Reform	-4.3228
A Chinese newspaper , which had called on the front page to release a reporter accused of defamation , declared a press regulator .	-4.5831
The New Express , based in Guangzhou , had printed a rare public call for the release of the journalist Chen Yongzhou .	-2.9331
But Chen later admitted on television that he had taken bribes to falsify reports of a state-owned company .	-3.2916
Now , the New Express is undergoing “ comprehensive rectification , ” the regulatory authority declared .	-4.5605
The “ Rectification Order ” was issued by the Ministry of Press and Publications , Radio , Film and Television in Guangdong .	-4.5063
Preliminary investigations revealed that the Neue Express , which is part of the Yangcheng Evening News Group , had published several inaccurate reports about the publicly traded company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013 .	-4.6183
“ The New Express ’ s editorial management was disorderly , ” the regulatory authority announced in a statement .	-3.7386
She said that it was decided to “ impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou and withdraw his reporting license . ”	-4.5706
Moreover , “ Yangcheng Evening News Group has been instructed to carry out a full rectification of the New Express , and has been recommended to identify the relevant officials at the New Express and immediately check the New Express ’ s management team . ”	-7.1417
Chen had written several articles for the Neue Express in which he reported alleged financial irregularities with a manufacturer of construction machinery called Zoomlion .	-3.8235
After being arrested , the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and backed his journalistic work .	-2.9741
But then Chen appeared on state television and admitted that he had published false reports on payment .	-5.1501
“ In this case , I have harmed Zoomlion , as well as the entire news industry , and its ability to win public confidence , ” he told the state news channel CCTV .	-5.5463
I did it primarily because I was looking for money and glory .	-2.6020
I have realised that I have acted incorrectly .	-3.5086
Following Chen ’ s apology , the New Express issued an apology on the front page and declared that it failed to check the reports correctly .	-4.7937
Several well-known suspects have recently filed confessions on television .	-3.3097
Experts say that confessions are still routinely enforced , despite a legislative change at the beginning of the year , in which the authorities were banned from forcing anyone to accuse themselves .	-4.4961
Discovering US-Mexico Drug Tunnel	-4.5223
One of the most sophisticated tunnels for drug smuggling between the US and Mexico , fully equipped with lighting , ventilation , and electric railway operations , has now been discovered .	-4.1827
The US authorities described the 120 cm tunnel as one of the most sophisticated passages they would ever have found .	-3.4923
The tunnel , which runs in a zigzag pattern over a length of almost six football fields , connects warehouses near Tijuana , Mexico , and San Diego , USA .	-3.6496
There are countless unseemly warehouses in the area , which makes it easier to hide drugs-related trucks .	-5.1354
The tunnel had been closed before drugs could be transported uninfluenced in it , the authorities explained .	-14.5043
In the discovery of the tunnel , eight and a half tonnes of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were secured , according to the Court 's records .	-3.5271
Three men who , according to the authorities , worked as drivers were charged with the possession and the intended sale of marijuana and cocaine .	-3.2222
They face prison sentences between ten years and life when they are convicted .	-5.2270
In Nogales , Arizona , smugglers rely on an extensive underground network of drainage channels .	-2.3460
The tunnel is the eighth major passage discovered in San Diego since 2006 .	-2.4333
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after the marijuana harvest in central Mexico in October , which challenges drug cartels how to bring their product quickly to consumers .	-5.0121
In 2010 , authorities found an almost 640 meter long passage with rails , which ran from a kitchen in a house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego .	-4.4953
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love each other .	-1.2576
Actors Orlando Bloom and Model Miranda Kerr want to go in a separate direction .	-4.1039
In an interview , Bloom said that he and Kerr still love themselves .	-2.6624
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents of two years of Flynn .	-2.0610
Actor Orlando Bloom has commented on the separation of his wife , Topmodel Miranda Kerr .	-2.8280
In an interview with US journalist Katie Couric , which was supposed to be broadcast on Friday ( local time ) , Bloom said , " life sometimes does not run exactly as we plan or hope . "	-4.9786
Kerr and he still loved himself , stressed the 36-year-old .	-3.2461
" We will support each other and love it as parents of Flynn " .	-3.0024
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010 , and in 2011 their son Flynn was born .	-3.1737
According to Lexika , veganism is subject to vegetarianism , but it differs significantly from that .	-4.2388
Because while vegetarians allow themselves to eat cream , ice or a strong Edam , these delicacies are not on the menu of a vegan .	-5.1747
Milk , cheese , egg , in addition to the abandonment of meat and fish , the vegan leaves out all consumption of animal products - even honey is denied .	-6.3463
One might wonder what remains , but on closer examination the vegan nutrition world is characterized by a considerable ingenuity .	-6.0493
" Bread spreads are very popular " , explains Ute Henkelmann , the owner of the local Reformation House , who has a variety of special products for vegans .	-5.3091
Reuben Proctor is also happy to visit the shop in the Domgasse .	-6.3788
The native New Zealand vegan has lived for 13 years , in Lammerheim he ( almost ) finds everything he needs to live . " In 1997 I converted my diet and became a vegetarian " .	-7.0404
At the turn of the century the next step was taken and I became a vegan .	-2.7991
" The conviction came not only because of the diet , but also because of the choice of shoes , " says Proctor , who prefers normal leather .	-5.3504
He realized that there are other everyday issues without animal products .	-4.5648
In the first place is vegan be an ethics .	-2.7818
" I don 't want animals to die for me , " Proctor says the maxim of vegans that covers the whole consumption behavior .	-4.6132
Instead of steamers , stirrers or rubberbears , the vegan quickly discovered completely new products , the enthusiasm rose .	-6.0112
" It is a double bonus , " Proctor says today , " vegan does not actually represent a sacrifice , not an askese , but an enrichment . " The presumrather to the power .	-8.2329
And it was precisely these conditions that made some well-intentioned attempts fail .	-5.1091
" The addictive factor is a decisive factor that allows many to quickly quit , similar to smoking , " Proctor makes a comparison .	-5.4531
And applies : " Certain tastes are not fixed to the animal " .	-5.3649
Often it is the spices or the kind of preparation that make up the taste .	-3.2942
" You can create the same effect in another way , " explains the vegan .	-3.8128
For example , Proctor brings eggplants , mushrooms and a few vegan sausages to a grill .	-5.8098
It takes care of a balanced , varied diet , in which it should taste well .	-6.3122
Of course you want to have something between the teeth , that is legitimate .	-3.1771
" It should taste , but that is not just to reduce animal food , " Proctor said .	-3.5057
He has not suffered health damage to food disorders , another widespread assumption .	-5.2409
For me , the changeover had a positive aspect .	-3.3118
I do not take up any foreign cholesterol and have an increased proportion of vitamins .	-3.7194
There are high performance athletes that feed only vegan .	-2.8302
" My blood values are excellent , I 'll check often " , Proctor tells .	-5.2495
In particular , the lack of vitamin B12 is something that many vegan critics warn about .	-5.3751
" Since animals are fed with feed rather than grazing on the pasture , it is questionable whether the vitamin B12 content is high in the meat bought in the refrigerator , " Proctor says .	-6.0324
Vegans can also take the coenzyme in the form of tablets .	-3.2124
" My B12 values are fine , " he explains .	-1.5447
There is no need for Proctor to go far in food procurement .	-4.9243
After all , there are staple foods everywhere and every supermarket now has soya milk and other products .	-6.9970
I find everything I need on site .	-2.5944
From time to time I buy something special .	-2.8870
" Many people overlook the fact that only finished products are expensive , but that is what we all know about " ordinary " finished products .	-4.7041
In any case , the preparation of vegan dishes is much cheaper and less time consuming than generally thought .	-4.2922
" There is a lot to discover in the kitchen , with a few small snacks you can achieve good , if not partially better results , " says Proctor .	-6.1153
Margarine instead of butter , a little more baking powder and carbon dioxide instead of egg , with its vegan cheese cake Proctor could also amaze his son-in-law .	-6.0938
Family celebrations give vegans a new spice .	-3.6805
This has a new meaning when you cook together .	-4.7431
" The situations that can arise are as different as the people themselves , " Proctor says .	-3.7472
Of course , he has already been skeptical .	-3.7193
Does my food no longer please you ?	-4.0983
" Should I feel bad now because I drink milk ? " - if you have such questions , you have to act as a vegan with a sensitivity .	-7.0789
" I do not reject people , I am part of this society , " Proctor does not want to be an enclave .	-3.9886
And , more precisely , the everyday world does not seem as vegan as suspected - and the vegan does not seem as constrained in everyday life as commonly assumed .	-7.7256
Fast food is also permitted .	-1.3988
Pomms are everywhere !	-3.0901
" Many dönermäden offer falafel , or even a vegetarian yufka , " says Proctor .	-4.3677
In a pizzeria he likes pasta , or he orders a pizza without cheese , all a matter of habit .	-5.8086
The restaurants slowly adjust to it .	-4.6290
" When I started eating vegan 13 years ago , everything was much more difficult " , the New Zealand guy can find a development : " You have to talk to people , make them aware of it " .	-6.6460
" If there are enough questions , they may be inclined to supplement the menu , " he hopes .	-4.1267
Vegan restaurants are developing , such as the Mannheim comedies or the Vogelfrei Café .	-4.9475
Proctor wishes that other restaurants have at least a vegan meal on the menu .	-4.3326
Basically there are vegan dishes for everyone .	-2.9975
Everyone can eat them , so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive .	-2.2709
" Meat dishes are exclusive , in the truest sense of the word , because they exclude others , " Proctor notes .	-4.2314
" If you want to avoid food scandals , veganism is a safe way to make the most of them impossible in the first place , " Proctor says .	-4.8322
But buying vegan products could be a bit difficult at the beginning .	-4.1350
Especially when you learn to understand that earth-nuts can contain animal additives as colorants , you quickly seem to have the courage to follow ethics in so many hurdles and traps .	-7.9331
This is not the only reason why Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen have written a book : " Veganissimo - Animal Ingredients and their Alternatives " explains the many ingredients that are used for food and detergents .	-5.1655
" Gradually , you develop a scanner view and know which characters and logos you have to pay attention to " It is sometimes better to do small steps than stay away or stumble " , Proctor knows .	-6.7771
Veganism , it is an important moral finger that beats consciousness .	-4.4761
He may not quite manage to lay down his habits , but at least he can teach consumers to critically question their habits .	-4.8542
The exchange operator Nasdaq OMX keeps its customers in breath .	-2.8326
Trading at the Nasdaq Options Market was suspended on Friday afternoon of German time .	-2.5093
In a communication the operator blamed technical problems .	-2.5642
The other eleven US options markets , including two of Nasdaq OMX , continued their business unhindered .	-2.3286
The latest incident continues a series of smaller and larger breakdowns at the stock exchange operator .	-4.9318
Only on Tuesday the Nasdaq indices were not calculated for an hour due to errors in data transport .	-4.2834
In August of this year , there were two breakdowns in a week alone .	-4.5471
First , because of technical problems , the US investment bank Goldman Sachs had sent massively flawed purchase orders to the options markets .	-3.9826
As a result , stock exchange operators needed almost a whole day to check and cancel orders .	-4.8259
Two days later , half of total US equity trading came to a halt for several hours due to a computer pan at the Nasdaq market .	-4.7707
Last year ’ s Facebook IPO also made a comeback .	-5.4674
The Nasdaq systems were not up to the flood of purchase and sales orders , later found SEC and donated the company to a record $ 10 million fine .	-5.4154
Konstanz : Radler turns 63 years old .	-3.5990
According to the police , the accident occurred when a 26 year old man on Thursday evening , at around 10 p.m. , with a women 's bike on the left sidewalk from the station square , was on the way to the market place .	-8.0243
When a 63 year old man suddenly walked from a restaurant , according to the police , the bicycle driver could no longer slow down in time .	-6.3335
In the following collision , the pedestrian was pressed against the wall of the house , later went to the ground and raised a 15-centimetre long slang at the head .	-9.3250
A rescue car team brought the injured to the hospital for medical treatment .	-3.4750
British police have issued an Assange extradition certificate .	-4.6587
The British police have today handed over an extradition certificate to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange , who has sought refuge and sought asylum at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London .	-4.3973
Scotland Yard explained that the 40-year-old Australian was “ asked to face up , ” prompting him to appear in a police station , and added that if he did not , he would be able to arrest him .	-6.7971
Assange is threatening to extradite to Sweden for the charge of a sexual offence after its capabilities under British law have been exhausted since the Supreme Court rejected its appeal to extradition earlier this month .	-6.0083
As he fears that Stockholm will extradite him to the US , he had sought refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on 19 June and asked the South American country for political asylum .	-4.5315
Scotland Yard “ sent a 40-year-old man an invitation to take part in a police station at a time we chose , ” a spokesman said .	-6.0221
He continues to violate the conditions of his release on bail .	-1.4243
The message did not comment on the delivery of the police request .	-2.7480
Assange fears that he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States for possible charges of espionage after publishing more than 250,000 diplomatic messages on WikiLeaks .	-4.2991
Drivers with 210 km / h and hot drink between their legs get $ 1,000 fine .	-5.3802
A driver was fined $ 1,000 for driving between his legs with up to 210 km / h and a hot drink .	-4.5754
Andrew Howie , 35 , from Tiptree , Essex , was stopped on May 27 with his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree .	-2.7463
After the police stopped him , they discovered the beverage cups between his legs .	-2.8488
Howie was guilty in the Colchester District Court without the necessary care and attention .	-5.7389
He received seven points and a six-month driving ban .	-1.8893
Howie was also convicted of paying $ 90 and a $ 100 sacrifice surcharge .	-4.4151
Tax on Foreign Property Owners Against London ’ s Bubble	-2.6504
The Ministry of Finance has provisionally calculated the CGT measure , but is still waiting for the final decision of Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne , who had imposed a 7 % stamp tax in the 2012 budget on homes that cost more than <unk> 2 million and annual fees for buyers who consider housing as a company and not as individuals .	-6.7437
Already , income from the stamp tax on residential property in the Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea districts , which in 2012 / 13 were at <unk> 708 million , exceeds the proceeds for Northern Ireland , Wales , Scotland , the Northeast , Northwest , Yorkshire and the Humber region combined .	-5.1732
Cook said , “ After the tax increases on high-price housing and the introduction of the associated legislation against circumvention , it is difficult to claim that high-quality property is too low taxed , regardless of the impact of the outdated community tax system . ”	-7.0341
“ But this move could make some foreign investors more cautious about buying real estate in London , or prevent owners from selling it , ” he added .	-4.1763
First-class real estate – the top five to ten per cent of the price housing market – in the affluent London southwest belt , stretching from Fulham to Wimbledon , has increased by 11.8 % last year ’ s record value .	-5.3523
Prices in Central London showed steady annual growth of 5.6 % , but were overshadowed by an emerging “ domestic market , ” with the southwestern part of the city , the north ( 7.4 % ) , and the east ( 6.5 % ) experiencing an upward trend , according to Savills .	-5.6348
Scientists were able to shed more light on the context in which a dog ’ s tail is related to its mood .	-5.3098
Previous research had shown that happy dogs with the tail waved more to the right ( from the dog ’ s point of view ) , while nervous dogs were left .	-9.2270
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive and respond to these subtle differences .	-2.4982
Professor Georgio Vallortigara , a neuroscientist from the University of Trento , said : “ People know well that the left and right brain half react differently to stimuli that generate positive or negative emotions . ”	-4.4071
Here we tried to see this in other species .	-3.1799
He also noted that in dogs , like humans , the right half of the brain is responsible for the left and vice versa , and that the two hemispheres played different roles in feelings .	-4.8766
To learn more about how dogs react to the side swelling of their fellow dogs , the researchers monitored the animals while these films were watching other dogs .	-6.8223
They measured the heart rate of the four legs and analyzed the behavior .	-3.2001
We will probably soon understand why the tail is moving in one direction or in the other .	-4.4108
Professor Vallortigara said : “ We have shown dogs movies with dogs – either a true version of nature or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects , and we have been able to steer the movement of tail more towards left or right . ”	-5.9707
When the animals saw how an otherwise drunk-free dog moved the tail to the right ( seen from the perspective of the dog ) , they remained completely relaxed .	-5.8230
But if the tail was mainly left ( again from the dog ’ s perspective ) , their heart rate rose and they looked restless .	-6.3150
According to Professor Vallortigara , the dogs do not deliberately communicate with each other through these movements .	-3.0037
He is rather convinced that the dogs have learned from experience in which movements they should worry about and when not .	-5.4216
He said , “ If you have different encounters with other dogs , and you are more likely to be associated with the tail in one direction with friendly behavior , and the right side is more likely to produce a less friendly behavior , then you react on the basis of this experience . ”	-9.0245
Researchers say that the findings could help dog owners , veterinarians and trainers to understand the emotions of their animals better .	-4.3710
John Bradshaw , expert in dog behaviour and guest stipendiat at the Faculty of Animal Medicine of the University of Bristol , said that this was not the first study to examine whether left and right are important for dogs .	-5.2045
Last year , a team of the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their head to the left when looking at an aggressive dog , and to the right when it is a satisfied dog .	-4.4631
In another research at the University of Victoria in Canada , “ Dogs are more likely to go to a robot dog if their tail is left and not right , rather than becoming restless – exactly the other way round than in the Italian study . ”	-6.9022
According to his statement , the differences could stem from the fact that the dogs in the various studies did not interpret the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs .	-5.5194
A study on how dogs react to real dogs , he explained .	-4.2806
“ While there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two brain halves are used for various purposes , many of the details still need to be determined – and dogs are no exception , ” says Bradshaw .	-4.1950
But since their behavior can easily be recorded , it will probably not take long to understand why the tail sometimes moves in one direction , sometimes in the other .	-5.4878
Shifting Arctic Monkeys in Glasgow for Alex Turners disease	-4.8687
The rock band Arctic Monkeys moved an appearance in Glasgow after their lead singer was ill with throat headband .	-5.3601
The band from Sheffield should play in the Hydro on Friday .	-2.9859
Due to the illness of lead singer Alex Turner the concert has to be moved .	-3.8594
The band 's announcement came after it had to move an appearance at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday .	-4.4332
In a statement on their official website , the Arctic Monkeys announced : “ After the decision to cancel the show at the LG Arena in Birmingham this evening and on medical advice , Arctic Monkeys must also cancel the show at Hydro in Glasgow on Friday , November 1 . ”	-5.5042
“ At Alex Turner , a throat head infection was diagnosed , which is why he cannot occur . ”	-5.4523
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will take place on November 20th , which was moved to November 21st in the Hydro in Glasgow .	-4.8670
All tickets are valid for these shows .	-1.5214

Pope Francis appoints First Cardinals in February	-1.9317
On February 22 , Pope Francis will first call new cardinals of the Catholic Church , as the Vatican announced on Thursday .	-4.0181
Cardinals are the highest clerics in the Catholic Church after the Pope , and they are also the ones who elect a Pope , so that Francis will appoint the first group of men who will ultimately participate in the election of his successor .	-4.5664
There are currently 201 cardinals .	-1.8376
However , a cardinal who has reached 80 years of age can no longer participate in the election of the papal – this applies to a group of 120 “ eligible cardinals ” .	-5.8880
In a statement announcing the news , Father Federico Lombardi , a Vatican spokesman , said that a meeting of all the cardinals would take place before the ceremony for the appointment of the new cardinals , also known as the Consistorium , was held .	-4.9643
“ Pope Francis has decided to announce in advance his decision to convene the Council in February so that other meetings requiring the participation of cardinals from all over the world can be planned , ” said Lombardi .	-5.1302
Catholic Voices Jack Valero said that the number of eligible cardinals is likely to have fallen by February .	-4.0250
He declared that a pope would normally appoint as many cardinals as necessary , so that the number of eligible cardinals returned to 120 , and so many cardinals over 80 as he would like .	-4.8940
The consensus next year is important because it is the first since the election of Francis in March this year , Valero says .	-4.8140
At present , there is a certain overhang on the part of Europe and , in particular , Italy .	-3.5675
“ It will be interesting to see if the new Pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance , ” he said .	-2.4785
Forty per cent of Catholics live in South America , but they have only a tiny number of cardinals .	-1.8261
The Cardinals will also be the first to be called since the formation of the Council of Cardinals founded by Francis , a group of eight cardinals from all over the world who have the task of finding ways to reform the Church .	-4.9333
In the past , the Pope decided everything alone .	-2.6544
“ Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him , ” Valero said .	-2.5156
He explained that it was “ possible ” for Francis to ask the cardinals for advice .	-3.9895
So far , however , we have not been in this situation – that is all new .	-4.5258
Valero said that the bishops would typically be called to cardinals from large places , but Francis “ stuck with surprises – so we don ’ t know who he appoints ” .	-5.2163
GM Recalls New Pickup Trucks in the US to Repair the Seat Ready	-3.9565
General Motors is calling back nearly 19,000 of its brand new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra Pickup Trucks built in 2014 to address a problem with the manually adjustable seat backrest , according to a communication from the US automotive safety regulator on Friday .	-5.6099
Some of the cars may have a defect in the front seat backrest mechanism .	-3.6173
For this reason , they do not comply with the federal regulations on vehicle safety in headrests .	-4.0536
“ If the vehicle is mounted from behind , it is possible that the head restraint does not properly protect the occupants , so there is an increased risk of injury , ” was read in the message on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ( NHTSA ) website .	-6.4814
The returned models were manufactured between August 1 and September 10 .	-2.9421
The delivery of GM trucks began in June and represents the most important model launch of the leading US car manufacturer since the insolvency restructuring in 2009 .	-5.0391

Obama Voter ’ s Desperate Scream	-3.4516
I voted President Obama twice in the hope that change is possible .	-2.5285
He says Obama has made commendable efforts that have been thwarted by the Republican blockade .	-3.3778
Blockadency does not excuse Obamacare ’ s website problems , Drone attacks .	-4.1059
Obama ’ s memoirs of the 2008 election campaign are a sad reminder of what could have been done .	-2.5852
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second year student at Harvard Medical School .	-1.9002
I am reading a terribly sad book .	-2.8793
It is a book I thought it would enlighten me during my second year of medical studies and give me hope again .	-6.1527
It is called “ The Audacity to Win ” and describes Barack Obama ’ s memoirs for the 2008 presidential election .	-3.0369
When I finish my patients ’ papers in the evening and go to bed , the book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions of people and was able to lift their breath .	-7.6655
The election became a landslide victory , and news spokesmen held to highlight the historic significance of this hour .	-4.7184
My classmates cry with joy and my parents collected all the newspapers they could find .	-2.6576
A young team of visionaries was on the way to the White House and the nation was ready for change .	-1.9824
When Obama left office in 2008 , he had an approval rating of 82 % .	-3.0908
And then I close the book .	-1.1148
Turning back to the present is a bad awakening , as if one is taken out of a dream .	-4.4794
It is hard to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague memory , a sad reminder of missed opportunities .	-2.3561
In the years since I voted for the first time , something has actually changed .	-3.2461
But it is simply nothing I could have imagined .	-2.8604
I recognise the great and versatile things Obama has achieved , from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for Health Insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq , the end of the forced disappearance of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden .	-3.7534
I agree that party political blockade tactics have overturned too many efforts to move our nation forward : immigration reform , a public option for health insurance and the closure of Guantanamo Bay , to name but a few .	-5.5116
But , having defended the Obama administration countless times to colleagues and acquaintances , I have come to the end with my attempts to explain .	-4.2986
I have reached a point of political despair .	-1.2208
Republican blockade policy cannot explain why foreign leaders are allowed to listen or why innocent children are being killed by drones overseas .	-4.9088
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data on Americans ’ private lives , and why whistleblowers are punished to expose state wrongdoing .	-3.3357
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki , an American citizen , was murdered without trial , nor why public funding and spending limits were circumvented during the presidential elections .	-3.2455
It does not justify the results of a report that states that the White House ’ s efforts to calm the media are the “ most aggressive ... since the Nixon government . ”	-3.8830
Finally , it cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website in the more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act .	-3.3798
I do not know if that is what I should have expected .	-1.8840
Whether I should have understood at 18 that government work could contradict the political campaigns that preceded it .	-4.7847
Obviously , the Office of Deputies is not a predictable course , as an opposition party and random events like the Newtown massacre shape public debate .	-5.0755
But when I look at the above examples , they seem to be largely elected by the government itself .	-3.1288
And that bothers me most .	-1.8953
I re-elected Obama in 2012 , not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy .	-1.8753
Mitt Romney was a confusing and unbalanced alternative , and he seemed unable to define his direction and positions .	-4.4090
I had the impression that a second term for Obama , free from the pressure of future elections , would fill the hope that we had heard for so long .	-4.5011
But , with Obama ’ s approval ratings falling to below 45 % this week , this book ’ s return to 2008 has become all the harder .	-3.8999
It awakens in me the yearning for the many promises that have evaporated into air .	-3.2851
This week , I read a section in the book describing how Obama had to embed a heavy loss against Clinton in the Pennsylvania primaries .	-4.4800
In a meeting with the election workers after the decision , he told his staff that they had to get back on track and follow their cause .	-5.0123

Clive Palmer claims that Prime Minister Tony Abbott had a parental conflict of interest .	-5.8999
The billionaire and MEP Clive Palmer says that Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in conflict with his plans for parental leave , because his daughters become pregnant and could therefore benefit from it . are .	-6.5882
The mining magnate , who is in a court dispute over the payment of $ 6 million in carbon taxes , claimed that he wanted to wipe questions from the table whether he was in conflict .	-6.9546
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate , which are important for deciding whether CO2 and mining taxes will be cut or cut .	-3.7682
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest , and Abbott ’ s daughters would personally benefit from the laws .	-2.6967
“ He is in a great conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave , because when one of his daughters becomes pregnant , he has a direct interest in whether or not she is on holiday , ” Palmer said .	-4.4928
Two months after the election , the Palmer Electoral Commission officially declared the winner of Fairfax ’ s Sunshine Coast session , with 53 votes ahead of the recount .	-4.7813

Palmer also criticized the use of pencil when marking the ballot papers .	-2.7784
Is it used because you can erase the results if you don 't like them ?	-3.7931
It is incredible to vote with pencil today .	-4.0031
The Electoral Commission examined the options for an electronic election and recently published a joint legislative proposal with New Zealand .	-3.1796

RBS suspends two Forex traders	-2.1333
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange department , two of whom are familiar with the situation ; this is yet another indication that the worldwide official investigation into alleged manipulation of the currency market is rapidly gaining momentum .	-6.5327
Some of the world ’ s largest banks , including UBS , Barclays , Deutsche Bank , and RBS , have confirmed that they are working with the authorities to investigate the world ’ s largest financial market , where $ 5.3 trillion changes ownership every day .	-4.0873
The two dealers would be the first RBS staff to be suspended in the widening investigation that the Libor Interbank scandal is causing .	-5.5389
The bank , which did not comment on the suspensions , confirmed this month that it received information requests from authorities .	-3.8488
“ Our investigation on this issue is continuing and we are cooperating fully with the FCA and other regulators , ” the Bank said two weeks ago .	-3.9208
Last month , people close to the situation announced that the RBS had forwarded the records of e-mails and instant messages sent by and to a former trader to the British Supervisory Authority , the Financial Conduct Authority .	-5.1731
This trader , Richard Usher , had left the RBS in 2010 and has since been judged by his current position as European head of forex trading at JPMorgan .	-4.6579
Rohan Ramchandani , Head of European Spot Trading at Citi , was judged this week and Matt Gardiner , former leading currency trader at Barclays and UBS , was suspended this week at Standard Chartered .	-4.5469
None of these traders were accused of any wrongdoing .	-3.1361
Usher ’ s instant message group included bankers at Barclays and Citigroup , who were close to the situation .	-3.1804
UBS announced this week that it has taken steps against some of its employees after the Swiss regulatory authority , Finma , had declared that it was investigating alleged manipulation of the foreign exchange market by a number of Swiss banks .	-7.6943
At least six authorities around the world – the European Commission , Finma , the Swiss competition authority Weko , the FCA , the US Department of Justice , and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently considering charges that bankers should have agreed on currency market transactions .	-4.9342
HSBC , Citigroup , JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal investigations or received information requests from authorities , said people familiar with the situation .	-3.6976
Banks comb instant messages and emails from several years in search of malpractice cases .	-3.9493
The news about these investigations has stirred up traders in an area that in recent years has been one of the most profitable trading units of investment banks , but this year has been under pressure , because low currency volatility limits opportunities for speculators .	-5.7594
Some bankers have tried to play down the affair , saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast and highly liquid foreign exchange market , but leading traders believe that this is not necessarily true .	-4.2214
A leading trader noted that , despite the huge daily volume of currency trading , fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use by banks of their own internal platforms means that “ you can influence the market with very low ticket prices . ”	-5.9948
The news came out on the same day when Credit Suisse announced that it had terminated a London Exchange Traded Funds trader this week after causing a loss of nearly $ 6 million at the end of last year .	-5.0235
The Bank promptly informed the relevant authorities and cooperates with them .	-2.2083
“ We are sure that the trader has acted alone and that the matter has been contained , ” Credit Suisse said .	-4.1231
Painted the Bauzaun on the Bechtle Site	-3.8482
A group of citizens ' initiative " Schweizer Wiese " beautified the Bauzaun on the Bechtle site on the spa promenade in Bad Herrenalb .	-4.0589
She also cleaned and widened the footpath , says in a press release .	-4.3344
The planned cover of the crumbling house at the rear of the property was not allowed for security reasons , because the terrain is in danger of slipping .	-6.5223
Alfred Abel , who currently manages the site , had agreed to beautify the site with his colleague Reinhard Domke from the BI .	-4.1573
Before the BI action , a banner with the message " We are for it " had been put in place .	-5.5967
However , this did not bother the 20 or so members of the citizens ' initiative much in their action .	-4.1900
Their motto on the big poster was " We are against ruins " .	-3.6716
In doing so , she wanted to point out the danger of even larger ruins on the Swiss meadow - the giant project should one day fail .	-5.6275
In conversation with many passers-by before the " construction site " it became clear that some citizens believe that the realization of the project of the city will be better for many , although not many have the same questions about the dimension of the presented project as the BI .	-6.4102
But they begin to resignate , because the city continues to delay these responses , says the BI .	-4.6294
As was heard , the mayor ’ s public statements also work .	-5.3791
In May , at the municipal council meeting , he had said that he feared the end of the thermal bath if the public voted against the plans for a spa and wellness complex on the Swiss meadow .	-8.2710
Some people seem frightened , others feel it is a " crude blackmail attempt " against the population , as the BI press release continues .	-9.2452
The BI thanked the donors for the paint and all the helpers .	-2.6650
Rannick Shelt for Shiris : Mane no Swallow King	-5.3741
As pleased as Ralf Rannick is with the current high form of Bundesliga leader Red Bull Salzburg , the sports director of the " Bullen " was disappointed by the referees .	-5.2072
" There is currently a dangerous tendency for Mane and Alan to be pushed into the category of Schwalbenkönige " , he took protection of the two offensive players on Thursday at a press conference in Salzburg .	-6.1596
The most recent occasion for Rangnick ’ s criticism was Gelb for Mane at 3 : 0 against Grödig last Sunday , in which the Senegalese became a supposed showpiece – which was not , however , as the TV pictures showed .	-9.3112
" A stark misjudgment , " said Rannick , the referee named Harkam " completely overstrained " .	-6.4686
Harkam would also have contributed " his part " to the escalation between Salzburg-Coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig-Trainer Adi Hütter after the match .	-3.4223
He decimated his German compatriot : " I would have behaved the same way in every single situation as Roger Schmidt " .	-5.5340
After the skirmish , Schmidt himself does not want to have had contact with his colleague .	-4.7446
I do not know why .	-0.9828
" For I am the one who was offended , " the 46-year-old stressed .	-3.6023
However , in view of the success story , Rannick agreed to a praise hymn .	-7.3592
" For that there are only two words : right , " he concluded .	-5.3376
There is not much wrong .	-2.1776
The way the team plays is particularly impressive .	-2.7668
That should continue .	-4.0845
There will be no changes in the winter transit season .	-4.5918
There are no great reasons to change anything .	-2.2871
" Except for a player , Rangnick made it clear that he wants to leave the club .	-5.8319
Supreme Court corroborates Obama ’ s Health Law	-2.4676
It is a great victory for the Obama administration : the US Supreme Court today ruled that the health law closely associated with Barack Obama is constitutional .	-3.3006
With five to four votes , judges ruled that the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – forcing US citizens to take out health insurance or pay a penalty by 2014 – is constitutional to the state ’ s tax authority .	-4.2001
The chief judge John Roberts sided with the four more liberal members of the chamber , while the judges Scalia , Thomas , Alito , and Kennedy decided against it .	-4.4603
The Court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 2700 pages of the law , and also held that the requirement that states should either extend the eligibility requirements for Medicaid or otherwise remove all government Medicaid subsidies was not unconstitutional .	-7.2282
The lawsuit against the law was initiated by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business .	-2.4371
The law was strongly rejected by all leading Republican presidential candidates , including the ultimate challenger Mitt Romney , in the 2012 pre-election campaign .	-5.5334
Norway : Norway ’ s Giant Miracle of Light	-5.1169
With huge mirrors , the inhabitants of a Norwegian village have brought light into their gloomy valley .	-3.4674
Due to the low level of sunshine , Rjukan , situated in Vestfjord valley , usually falls into the shadow of the surrounding mountains from autumn to spring .	-6.0607
With three gigantic reflectors at an altitude of 45 metres , a room of the century became true on Wednesday .	-5.3003
" Finally ! " , the mayor Steinar Bergsland swore at the start ceremony in the TV2 channel .	-4.8889
Some of the valley ’ s inhabitants recovered sunchairs , while others took sunglasses for safety .	-6.7324
Up to now , sun-worshippers had to take a cable car to a nearby summit in winter .	-4.9369
Ten years ago , the local artist Martin Andersen presented the proposal to channel the rays into the valley with mirrors .	-4.6238
However , this basic idea existed in the village since 1913 .	-4.8262
After several years of debate , the City Council finally adopted the 5 million kroner ( approximately 615 000 Euro ) expensive project .	-5.2005
A similar construction has given the Italian Alpine village Viganella winter sunshine for several years .	-4.6968
Post Leert Hardly Still Sundays	-4.0336
" Many citizens will not have noticed yet , the red dots for Sunday leaching are still on various post boxes in the city center and the parts of the city , but you can read the small print on the yellow containers of Post AG , you will quickly find that the vacancy on Sundays and holidays is no longer taking place " , says the FDP .	-8.8259
A request from the FDP confirmed this .	-1.7127

Whether you are staying in Hofheim and Rosengarten on Sunday will not be answered in the answer to the FDP ’ s question . of are , , and , , and . , , and . are .	-8.6309
The German Free Democratic Party ( FDP ) , Fritz Röhrenbeck , wants to catch up here .	-5.1117
Sunday leaning is an important postal service especially for terminpost .	-5.1105
" This undertaking , despite the price increase for letters on January 2013 , is radically and unreasonable " .	-4.7240
Thomas Bittner , chairman of the Liberal Group and of the City Council , supports his group colleagues : ' What annoys me is the fact that the time of vacancy is being changed or even deleted in secret ' .	-8.2129
The post office is a few miles away from the town centre .	-4.8333
" At least the post boxes in the Neuschlo<unk> and Rosengarten districts must be emptied again on Sundays , " says Bittner and Röhrenbeck unisono .	-3.9432
It is also valid for the core city , especially for non-mobile citizens , to be able to reach a letter box with Sunday leaning on foot .	-8.0612
Röhrenbeck asked in the municipal parliament whether the municipal administration is planning discussions with the post office on this matter .	-6.3607
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the post did not communicate with Lampertheim .	-2.9776
However , there is also a Sunday leaning in Hofheim 's knowledge . were . were . were . were . were . were . were . were . were .	-9.7799

Frankfurt ’ s parking fees are supposed to rise sharply .	-3.6644
The room was very small and the bed was very uncomfortable .	-8.4058
This morning , the city ’ s municipal council will be discussing a presentation of the transport company Stefan Majer ( Green ) .	-6.9299
This means that parking charges will be increased by 50 percent .	-6.4883
The aim is not to increase prices , but to reduce the time interval of parking clocks and parking ticket machines from 30 to 20 minutes .	-5.3986
In December , the municipal council will have to decide .	-3.9876
The retail committee of IHK Frankfurt considers this " not a good idea " .	-3.7871
The staff were very friendly and helpful .	-5.3872
The German Transport Club believes that an increase after two decades is ' appropriate and actually long overdue ' .	-4.4654
Public transport also becomes more expensive .	-2.6046
Freudenstadt : Prompt actions Overrun Hosts	-5.4203
With a narrow cadre , the gentlemen I of the TSV Freudenstadt had to compete against the TG Gönningen from the Swabian Alb in the Schiller-Schulturnhalle in Reutlingen .	-4.1667
The Elders stood with an experienced team on the other side of the net .	-3.6009
Soon , however , it became apparent that , due to their age , they could not fully compete with the fast actions of the Freudenstadt .	-7.2209
With the hard and placed surcharges , the patrons were extremely hard .	-6.6827
They repeatedly missed the passes and attacks given by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz cleanly over the middle of the network and were not there for blocking .	-6.3552
Two high first satirical gains clearly expressed the superiority of the Freudenstadt in all matters .	-5.8996
In view of this overwhelming and game-determining achievement , the third set was then won a little bit lax and merciless to the 3 : 0 final ( 25 : 13 , 25 : 14 , 25 : 22 ) .	-7.3908
On November 2 , the TV Baiersbronn , which was able to assert itself clearly in Nagold , will be a much more powerful adversary . , , , , will , and .	-13.1033
TSV Freudenstadt I : Dominik Bäuerle , Yannik Büchle , Sebastian Dölker , Felix Pälchen , Stefan Rüller , Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz .	-1.8485
In the B-Class the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt stood opposite each other in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn .	-3.3047
They delivered a hard-fought two-hour match .	-2.4353
Nerviousness on both sides caused mistakes and points points points , especially in ballooning ; precision was sometimes scarce , and in some critical game scenes the overzeal prevented the eye from winning any points .	-10.1063
In this highly balanced meeting , Marcus Blasutto ’ s TSV team , however , consistently agreed on the great physical commitment and the positive commitment of both teams .	-7.2243
Care Day at the Small Englishhut	-3.7185
For the fifth day of care following the Natura 2000 project of Upper Hotzenwald , a group of dedicated participants met at the small Englishhütte in Ibach .	-5.6254
Due to suggestions from the population , on that day in the area of the hut the view into the valley should be cut free , said Mayor Helmut Kaiser .	-5.2523
Many hikers , Kaiser said , described this area as the highlight of the Schluchensteig , on which the landscape provides the ideal setting for wonderful views .	-6.8690
He thanked those present for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the day of care was an appropriate instrument for strengthening the link between man and nature .	-5.1271
It offers every citizen the opportunity to set a course in nature itself .	-4.3462
At the same time , ecological considerations can be taken into account with the tourist aspect .	-5.2022
This ecological aspect was explained by Friederike Tribukait of the Department of Conservation of the Government of Freiburg following the welcome of the Councillor Tilman Bollacher , who had taken over the patronage and wanted the action to be successful .	-7.2613
According to Tribukait , the tourist destination of the view coincides with the aim of preserving the old Allmendweidfeld with its specific protected habitat by opening and connecting to the remaining pastures .	-7.2897
Certain species , such as rare butterflies and grasshoppers , cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest land .	-6.0038
You will need these free links to arterhage .	-5.0409
Tribukait said that she would not fail to speak up for the planned biosphere area .	-5.6957
The current measure does not only integrate seamlessly into this planning .	-4.1756
A biosphere area also offers the opportunity for sustainable economic and ecological development on the basis of internationally recognised Unesco status and thus a continuous addition to the achievements for the future with the life project and the care days that have been achieved so far .	-7.1014
After these different versions , the Reviews Christoph Wehle and Life Project Manager Cornelia Bischoff divided the helpers into groups .	-5.9532
The larger trees had already been beaten in advance and the forestry tractor could be called up .	-5.7363
A group of helpers should take care of the release of juniper bushes and the maintenance of a dry stone bar .	-4.1167
The aim was to have a clear view at the vantage point .	-4.3784
Löffingen : Köpfler Still the Only Candidate	-4.2932
Information on the Internet : Although the Baar town of Löffingen with its 7514 inhabitants , an intact infrastructure , a forward-looking school , children 's , youth and senior policy , as well as its own municipal works can be described as an attractive city , no second mayor candidate has yet registered .	-6.6838
The 46-year-old bank clerk and business manager Dieter Köpfler from Löffingen is the only candidate to succeed the mayor , Norbert Brugger , no longer standing as a candidate for retirement .	-6.4187

Google , Samsung , Huawei sued for Nortel patents	-2.2610
The group , which owns thousands of previous Nortel patents , tightened an avalanche of lawsuits against mobile phone manufacturers on Thursday , including Google , the company that was outbid by him in the bankruptcy auction of Nortel .	-9.9103
Rockstar , the consortium that had bought the Nortel patents for $ 4.5 billion , sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd , HTC Corp , Huawei , and four other companies for patent infringement at the US District court in in Texas .	-4.2994
Rockstar is owned by Apple , Microsoft , BlackBerry , Ericsson and Sony .	-1.8951
Google is accused of patent infringement in seven cases .	-1.1501
The patents concern technology that matches search terms on the Internet with relevant advertising , is the claim that hits the core of Google ’ s search engine business .	-5.3502
Representatives of Samsung , Huawei , HTC and Rockstar were not immediately available .	-2.0929
Samsung , Huawei and HTC manufacture mobile phones that work with Google ’ s Android operating system , which is in sharp competition with Apple and Microsoft ’ s mobile products .	-4.0724
In 2011 , Google issued an initial bid for more than $ 900 million for the Nortel patents .	-3.2311
Google increased its offer several times and last offered $ 4.4 billion .	-3.5760
After being outbid by Rockstar ’ s Northern Patents , Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $ 12.5 billion , a deal that was partly motivated by Motorola ’ s patent library .	-5.9892
“ Although Google failed in its attempt to purchase the action at the auction , Google violated the patents and continues to do so , ” he said .	-6.7024
Rockstar claims high compensation from Google because it claims that Google ’ s patent infringement is intentional , according to the accusation .	-4.2419
Egypt ’ s First freely Elected President	-2.6803
Mohammed Morsi is sworn in , but his day of triumph is not likely to mean the end of Egypt ’ s political disputes .	-7.9746
Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised a “ new Egypt , ” when he was sworn as the country ’ s first freely elected president , replacing Hosni Mubarak , who had been expelled from office 16 months earlier .	-4.5000
With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court , Morsi became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and Egypt ’ s fifth head of state since the fall of the monarchy some 60 years ago .	-3.3175
He placed the oath in front of the 18 black robes judges of the court , which is located on the Nile and is modelled on an ancient Egyptian temple .	-5.7122
“ We are striving for a better future , a new Egypt and a second republic , ” said Morsi at the solemn ceremony broadcast live on state television .	-3.4455
“ Today , the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom , genuine democracy , and stability , ” said 60-year-old Morsi , a US-trained engineer and member of the Muslim Brotherhood , a fundamentalist group that , since its founding 84 years ago , had been targeted sharply by the government as a forbidden organization .	-5.5573
Hundreds of soldiers and police guards guard the building when Morsi arrived in a small car convoy shortly after 11 o 'clock local time .	-4.1432
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered in the court to cheer the new president , and , unlike the presidential pomp of Mubarak , traffic was stopped only briefly , so that the motor-convoy could cross the usually busy road that connects the city centre with the southern suburbs .	-7.0122
As an uncharismatic “ substitute wheel ” of the Brotherhood , his personal prestige has increased since his victory and a Friday speech , presenting himself not only as a candidate for Islamists , but also as a candidate for all those who sought to target the 2011 insurgency against authoritarian Mubarak .	-6.6292
“ Egypt is now a civil , national , constitutional , and modern state , ” he explained Morsi , dressed in a blue suit with red tie , to the judges in the wood-panelled chamber in which he pardoned the .	-5.5275
Later Morsi went to the University of Cairo , where he should keep his inaugural address .	-3.3626
He was officially welcomed by an army chapel that played the national anthem , which he listened to in his posthumous capacity .	-6.4747
The military leader Feldmarshal Hussein Tantawi was present .	-2.0880
On his arrival , he was welcomed by hundreds present in the university ’ s largest auditorium with voice choirs of “ The Army and the People are a Hand . ”	-5.6271

Morsi laid off a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahir Square , the birthplace of the insurgency that led to the end of Mubarak ’ s authoritarian rule last year , and vowed to reclaim presidential powers that the military council had assumed from the head of state chased out of office .	-4.8350
But , by placing the official oath before the court , and not before Parliament as usual , he is bowing to the will of the military , indicating that the power struggle will continue .	-5.9348
Morsi ’ s speech in Tahir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures .	-1.6792

Rapists in South Africa : Two-life imprisonment	-4.4549
Nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa , the perpetrator was sentenced to two life sentences on Friday .	-2.7280
This was reported by the channel SABC .	-2.1397
The victim was later killed by the consequences of serious injuries .	-3.3166
Johannes Kana had already been found guilty at the beginning of the week of the crime .	-2.6463
The act had caused horror across the country .	-4.4480
The 21-year-old had raped Anene Booysen in February at an industrial site in Bredasdorp near Cape Town .	-3.1846
The doctors fought for the survival of the victim for 14 hours , but in vain .	-2.8126
The sight of the young people was so appalling that the carers and sisters needed psychological assistance .	-3.8609
Kana admitted during the trial that he had been with Booysen in a bar on Tatnacht .	-3.6591
He also admitted that he had beaten and raped her , but denied that he was responsible for the death of the girl .	-4.3137
The police initially assumed several perpetrators , but released two suspects from prison because the evidence against them was insufficient .	-4.6218
The prosecutor also stressed during the trial that she was convinced that Kana was alone at the time of the attack .	-2.5315
Rape is almost a daily occurrence in South Africa : there are about 64 000 reports per year on sexual violence .	-5.2113
This is almost ten times the amount in Germany , but with 82 million people it has far more inhabitants than South Africa ( 50 million ) .	-4.5077
Police and women ’ s associations in South Africa , however , value the unemployment rate for sexual violence 10 to 25 times .	-5.6569
Jumbo visits the Black Forest ham	-6.1968
Jumbo on the search for the " best ham of the world " : For the TV show " Galileo " the Pro7 star Bonndorf visited .	-4.4299
The speaker makes it clear right from the start : the most important thing for the ham is the pig culls , the turbo-cast is not a good prerequisite .	-7.3750
Can ham that you get in any supermarket be a quality product ?	-3.7661
Uli as head of the big ham factory in the Black Forest explains Jumbo how the company " Adler " works in Bonndorf .	-3.7594
" Germany 's most beloved ham " , as Jumbo announces the Black Forest ham .	-4.3449

Details such as the ph-value of meat also play a role .	-7.6376
The darker the meat , the higher the ph value .	-2.1864
" I am curious if you tell Roberto Blanco what happens then , " says Jumbo cynically .	-4.8053
Here the level of private television in pure culture is presented .	-4.2032
But the audience is worth it .	-3.9298
The viewer sees that the dismantling of the culls is still handcraft .	-5.2188
Because : Black Forest ham is traditionally found without bones on the shelf .	-3.2559
The secret of the ham is the mixture of spices with salt .	-2.4962
Smoking tower and smoke fire remind Jumbo of an " submarine " .	-4.7157
The trick : fir branches provide the special taste of the Black Forest ham in the smoke .	-5.5704
20 days in smoke make the ham almost black .	-1.7813
" Now the disc disappears in the Jumbo " , he announces the test abrasion .	-3.4455

You thought travel agencies are a thing of the past thanks to the Internet ?	-2.9629
Flight Centre seems to oppose the trend .	-1.7711
The company has increased its profit prospects for the full year and expects record earnings from holidaymakers in Australia and the UK .	-4.6527
The travel company now expects adjusted earnings before taxes from $ 325 to $ 340 million , compared to $ 305 to $ 315 million in its previous forecast .	-4.3875
If current targets are reached , that means 12 to 17 % growth compared to the record $ 290.4 million in 2011 / 12 .	-4.8983
As Managing Director Graham Turner announced , Flight Centre made eight percent profit in the first half of the year and made a strong start to the second half of the year , especially in the Australian and British private business .	-5.6290
“ Our ten countries have been profitable since the beginning of the year , and some of them are well on track towards record annual income before interest and taxes , ” he said .	-4.9119
These include Australia and the UK , which are typically among our strongest sources of income .	-3.8172
In Australia , the leisure industry recovered in the second half of the year , which provided a slightly weaker business travel market .	-3.9024
It was similarly good for Flight Centre ’ s leisure activities in the UK , with business customers spending less .	-6.4420
The US business recovered from the weaker first half of the year as a result of seasons , so that a profit for the full year is expected for the third consecutive year .	-6.3720
Flight Centre shares increased yesterday by 3 cents to $ 38.20 .	-2.7670
Maintaining schools ’ focus on mathematics , spelling , and grammar	-4.0428
In English literature , students will have to deal with at least one piece of Shakespeare , a 19th century novel , romantic poetry , and contemporary British novels from 1914 .	-4.8185
The examination also includes “ unseen texts ” to encourage broader reading .	-5.1974
The combined course of English literature and language will be abolished .	-2.5628
From 2015 onwards , students will have to pass an independent GCSE exam for language , with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification .	-4.3477
The Ministry of Education will publish the new curricula for English and Mathematics tomorrow – the first subjects that were radically redesigned .	-4.1675
Other core subjects will be changed next year .	-2.0089
In a separate initiative , Ofqual , the supervisory authority for examinations , will announce a reorganization of the GCSE structures , including a new approval system and less course work .	-4.4860
In a speech in the summer , Education Secretary Michael Gove said that there is “ a broad consensus that we need to reform our auditing system to restore public confidence , ” stressing that the GCSEs would become “ more challenging , ambitious , and stricter . ”	-5.2528
Studies show that less time is spent on mathematics in English schools – 116 hours per year or three hours per school year – than in most other countries . indicate that are less than in most .	-4.6751
By contrast , Australian schools teach an average of 143 hours a year and students in Singapore receive 138 hours .	-3.7343
While there will be no formal requirement to spend more time on mathematics in the timetable , coalition circles say that the comprehensive math test , combined with a stronger ranking of the subject , will probably encourage schools to start more hours .	-6.5261
The curriculum focuses more on “ real-life problems , ” including financial mathematics .	-3.3607

Salem : Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical Dialogue Forum	-1.6721
The next Ecumenical Discussion Forum on Monday , 21 October , in the New Museum of the Castle , is about the topic " To hell with hell - Theological reflections on today 's handling of the last things " .	-6.6936
Lecturer is Professor Johanna Rahner .	-1.4686
The Ecumenical Dialogue Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Evangelical Church communities of Salem , the Salem Castle and the Bodensee Cultural Office .	-4.2568
Johanna Rahner wants to investigate in the forum how people today classify the " last things " after death .	-4.1481
If people had known too much about this over the past centuries , relying on the images of heaven and hell " that have shaped our ideas to this day " , the contemporary prophetic doctrine of the hopes for completion would have been more marked by a certain embarrassment or even lack of speech .	-8.6119
" The greater hope has been thoroughly exploited by Christians by religious criticism , " says the speaker .	-5.1479
She ' provided us with so many question marks that we seem to have lost the exclamation marks ' .	-3.4552
Johanna Rahner goes on to say : " But the crucial challenge remains the annoyance of death . of , , and . of , of , of , of , , , of , ,	-10.2579
That is the question of the yearning , ' which dreams that everything will be good in the end ' .	-9.1349
Johanna Rahner , born in 1962 in Baden-Baden , studied Catholic theology and biology from 1982 to 1989 at the Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg .	-2.2996
She received her doctorate in 1997 for Dr. theol . , also in Freiburg .	-3.2844
The Habilitation for Fundamental Heology and Ecumenical Theology followed in 2003 at the Westphalian Wilhelms University .	-3.4468
Since 2010 Johanna Rahner holds a Chair of Systematic Theology at the Institute of Catholic Theology at the University of Kassel .	-3.1560
Geislingen : More than 100 young Catholics from Klein Heuberg reaffirm their faith in the firm .	-4.7305
In two religious services , 101 15- and 16-year-old youths from the Seelsorge Unit Am Klein Heuberg were filmed .	-5.6613
The service was accompanied in the morning by the group Laudato-Si , in the afternoon by the youth choir The Spirit .	-4.0305
With the reception of the Chamber of Firms , the young people said yes to their baptism and ask for the power of the Holy Spirit .	-6.5733
During the last months , the Firmlings had prepared themselves for the big festival , under the direction of Diakon Reiner Dehner and the help of many members of the local community .	-8.0154
In various projects they met different tasks of Christian community life and together they experienced the Youth Day in Untermachtal .	-6.7909
Illmensee : Second Mountainbike Race Enthusiastic Participants	-2.5685
With wonderful weather , 214 cyclists came to Illmensee to complete the round course across the hills around the lake .	-5.7855
Ulrich Knobel of the organizing sports association Illmensee shares this .	-4.8085
Among the participants , especially at a short distance of more than 15 kilometres and 300 metres of altitude , were also numerous cyclists who once wanted to practice their hobby in a competitive atmosphere .	-8.7916
Two top German junior-riders were also at the start of this competition : Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came to the German Championships with the recommendation .	-5.9600
These two could , as expected , decline from the field .	-5.5028
As in the previous year , Felix Bader was able to save a small advance to the goal and defended his title as the overall winner of short distance .	-4.9093
In second place Pascal was once again able to place himself in trust .	-10.1454
For the ladies , it was Theresa Duelli from the team nightmare that made it to the top of the winning streak .	-5.2637
On place two and three came Anne Adel from Illmensee and Leonie drivers from Owingen .	-2.8764
A pleasant development is the increasing number of drivers who live or work in the municipality .	-3.6025
Not only in terms of performance , the whole range of athletes was represented .	-3.8274
The age structure also reached the oldest starters from ten years of age for the youngest to over 70 years .	-7.0745
In the main race even more top athletes were at the start this year .	-4.5368
Four drivers were able to take off from the regional top drivers .	-9.6034
Among them Philipp Pangerl , a mountain bike semi-pro from the Black-Tusk Racing team .	-3.4726
Together with a team member , Pangerl was twice world champion in twelve hours driving .	-4.7100
This year he became European Champion in this special discipline .	-3.0709
Roland Ballerstedt , who already owns two German championship titles in the duathlon .	-4.2896
After 45 kilometres and 900 metres of altitude , the finishing line in front of the three-seater hall was reached .	-6.0106
Pangerl was the first to hit the finish line .	-3.4831
Only one second behind it was the Router Ballerstedt who secured second place in the overall standings .	-5.8024
At the same time Hermann and Warthmann came to the finish as third of the overall standings .	-4.3022
In the women 's race Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest time in the main race .	-3.5974
Areane Blersch from Binzwillen took second place in front of Natascha Werner from Stuttgart .	-3.8450
Athletes and helpers were very satisfied with the smooth and well organised course of the event .	-3.6108

Dr. Georges Bwave brings free medical assistance to remote villages in Cameroon	-3.6168
Bwave and his team spend almost every weekend treating hundreds of patients .	-3.1875
In the West African country , there are not many doctors , only one for 5,000 people .	-3.0639
Vote here or with your mobile device	-1.6816
Dr. Georges Bwave is one of the top 10 of the “ CNN Heroes of 2013 ” .	-3.1241
You can vote for him or any of the other heroes in the top 10 to vote for the CNN Hero of the Year .	-3.4518
The winner receives $ 250,000 to continue his extraordinary work .	-2.5440
For 21 years , Georges Bwave saw his sick father always losing consciousness and travelling to hospitals that did not have the means to help him .	-4.8297
Jamef Bwave was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé , the capital of Cameroon .	-3.1899
At first , he had only one broken arm , but then an inflammation spread to his brain , causing a hematoma that would affect him for the rest of his life .	-5.6105
“ There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon , ” says Georges Bwave .	-2.7602
We would have taken him out of Cameroon if we had the money .	-2.6849
Instead , Bwave spent years supporting his father in overcrowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer .	-4.5046
“ It ’ s not easy , ” says Bwave .	-2.6471
You can leave the house at five o 'clock in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first , but you are not the first .	-4.3658
There are many patients .	-1.6272
Some people even die because they have to wait .	-1.5529
The situation has hardly changed since Bwell 's father died in 2002 .	-2.3841
In Cameroon , there is only one doctor per 5,000 people , according to the World Health Organization .	-2.8574
On the other hand , the relationship in the United States is with a doctor for 413 people .	-3.1841
But even if there was a doctor for them , most cameramen could not afford to visit .	-4.4365
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line , and nearly three-quarters of the country ’ s health spending is private .	-3.2138
“ The only problem they have is poverty , ” says Bwave .	-2.8089
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life .	-0.9407
His father and so many of his fellow countrymen suffered the decision in Bwave to do something about it .	-5.3677
Dr. Georges Bwave and his team of volunteers performed 700 free operations last year .	-3.5345
He himself became a doctor and works as a vascular surgeon in the Central Hospital in Yaoundé .	-3.4042
He also founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME , which travels to rural areas at weekends and offers free medical care .	-4.1135
Since 2008 , he and his voluntary group have helped almost 32,000 people .	-2.6241
Almost every Friday , he and up to 30 people forced themselves into minibuses and ride the cramped medical equipment on the roof over unpaved terrain into the villages that need help .	-6.7712
Not always everything runs smoothly .	-2.7238
More than once they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud .	-2.4862
But when they arrive , they will be welcomed as heroes : a feast , singing and dancing , and the best accommodation the place has to offer .	-4.6161
In these villages , free medical care is really a reason to celebrate , and Bwave – with its broad smile and unlimited energy – is happy to attend the happy celebration .	-6.3026
The next morning , the team will start investigating hundreds of patients .	-3.1002
“ We treat 500 people per ride , ” says Bwave .	-3.4215
They come from a radius of 60 kilometres around the village – and that on foot .	-4.4552
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas .	-2.7918
Many people are treated for malaria , tuberculosis , malnutrition , diabetes , parasites , and sexually transmitted diseases .	-1.3589
Others receive crutches , donated glasses , or free birth certificates – a document that is necessary for the school , but many poor families simply cannot afford .	-5.6780
In the evening , the team performs simple operations with local anesthesia .	-3.2385
The operations usually take place in a school , town hall or apartment ; after the surgery patients get up and go to the recreation area to make room for the next person .	-5.8194
The lighting for the operation and disinfection equipment is supplied by the group 's generator and so Bwave and its volunteers work until the early morning hours on Sunday .	-4.9885
It is a tiring pensum , but the village musicians usually help keep the team motivated .	-8.1285
“ They drummer all night so that we can keep awake and continue our work , ” says Bwave .	-6.5233
On Sunday the team goes back to the city , tired but proud of the work done .	-3.7230
The group – a mixture of Cameroon doctors and foreign medical students – carried out 700 free operations last year and knows that its work makes a huge difference for the people it helps .	-5.0064
A man explained that the free operation of a breach of service he received now allows him to work again .	-4.5567
“ This is changing my family ’ s future , ” the man said .	-2.7317
Besides the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital , Bwave also works at night in private clinics in Yaoundé .	-4.2380
With this second job , he finances 60 % of his charitable activity , says Bwave ; the rest comes from private donations .	-5.3615
“ I really don ’ t know when he sleeps , ” says Katie O ’ Malley , who is studying medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia for the second year and who volunteer to work in Bwell Group .	-5.6965
He is always either in hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so that he can go to these campaigns .	-4.3018
For medical and health care students like O 'Malley , who come from the US and Europe and support Bwave , this is an opportunity to gain practical experience that they would never get at home .	-5.1709
" We can be involved in operations where we help to clean blood or to keep the instruments for Dr. Bwave , " explains O 'Malley .	-6.1235
This would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year .	-2.1664
Students usually pay for their trip to Cameroon themselves and bring frequently donated medical material .	-4.9438
Once in Yaoundé , however , Bwam takes care of the accommodation , transport and instruction .	-5.6334
" He is undoubtedly a hero , " says O 'Malley .	-2.6983
He devotes his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroon people knows no bounds .	-3.1089
For Bwave , the almost constant work is not a burden .	-4.2903
Helping others to live a happier life , thereby fulfilling a promise he made to his father , gives him great pleasure .	-5.1855
“ I am so happy to do this work , ” says Bwave .	-3.6091
And I am thinking of my father .	-2.4620
I hope he sees what I am doing .	-3.5032
I do it to make people laugh again and to relieve the pain .	-2.4848

Excellent Fighting	-3.6938
The role of Santiago , the old man in Hemingway Novelle " The old man and the sea " , Horst Janson is cut on the body .	-3.9626
Janson is himself an old hare in his profession , acting .	-3.8308
The old man Santiago cannot be accused of fishing .	-4.2042
So the two simply complement each other magnificently .	-3.9963
It is almost thought to be able to see the wrinkles in the old man 's neck , of which the fisherman 's young Manolo speaks .	-6.2252
When Santiago is sitting on the chair tired of life , it is real for Janson .	-5.6758
In addition , the role of the old fisherman through and through is a character role that Janson plays excellently .	-5.5190
Hemingway told the story of a fighter , a brave man who does not give up and who ultimately wins the battle against the fish through his knowledge and his will .	-4.8455
Janson is on stage for a long time .	-5.0650
He manages to focus the audience ’ s attention on himself , so that his monologues are not bored for a moment .	-3.7920
His efforts to finally pull the fish to the surface of the water are so real that the spectators forget that the sea is only made of blue light water bottles .	-5.9256
Director Jens Hasselmann lets the old man act in the boat in front of the fishing village .	-2.3063
In the course of the performance , he sets out the active scene : the hut of Santiago , the bar of the singer Marie-Luise Gunst , who , with her songs and her magnificent voice , enjoys Cuba ’ s sense of life .	-7.8910
The four musicians play Cuba 's rhythm and are also guests of the bar .	-2.9507
Tourism : Down to the Romans	-2.3349
A waste water channel from the Roman era is preserved below Cologne at approximately 120 metres in length .	-5.0335
If you visit Cologne , don 't miss the cathedral .	-4.0015
Around 157 metres , the two towers rise into the sky and make it the second highest church building in Europe .	-3.8196
But few visitors who admire the two filigree church towers have the idea that there is a lot to discover under the cathedral .	-7.4354
Rainer Schulze is an expert in matters of Cologne underworld .	-2.2403
Meeting point for its guided tours is the Köln-Tourismus Service Centre directly at the Dom .	-4.5077
The tour begins unspectacularly : " We start in the underground car park " , says Schulze .	-3.8188
In the seventies , the city fathers wanted an autochthonous city , and therefore , from the remains of the old city wall , only that was not too big .	-7.6646
Most of the users of the multi-storey car park now also pass the Roman remains and only park their car .	-7.7097
But if you look more closely , you will find an archaeological site separated by metal baskets on the D2 parking deck .	-6.3958
You can see about five meter high ruins of handmade stones .	-7.8611
" There are remains of the Roman city wall built in the second half of the first century AD , " says Schulze .	-4.1109
Before it goes back to daylight , Schulze lets the participants at the upper level take a look at a dark 15 meter deep shaft .	-5.8295
This is the fountain of the old cathedral , which unfortunately is hardly noticed .	-4.5472
The next stop of the tour is the Praetorium , where the participants get back down to the depth .	-5.7722
Here we see the seat of the once most powerful man north of the Alps , the head of the CCAA .	-4.6576
What CCAA means is that a visitor wants to know .	-5.0180
" The abbreviation stands for " Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium " , which in good German means " city of Roman law and city of the Agrippinensians , founded under Emperor Claudius in the place of the altar for the Emperor " .	-5.8694
And the Praetorium is the former imperial palace , the power center of the Roman empire on the Rhine .	-4.3113
From the entrance of the exhibition there is a tunnel access to the Roman wastewater channel , which is about 120 metres long .	-5.3977
" You can walk along the Cloaca Maxima if you like " , Schulze cheers up the guests .	-5.2540
Schulze still has one surprise .	-2.1274
After taking the key at the box office , he leads the group to a 16 meter deep walkable shaft .	-4.8662
" We are now in the Mikwe , a ritual Jewish bath , " he explains .	-1.8954
The Jewish community built its bath deep into the ground to come to the groundwater that was indispensable for ritual washing .	-4.1936
To this day , at the lower end of the Mikwe , whose origins date back to the eighth century , different water levels can be seen through changing levels of the Rhine .	-5.1515
The Mikwe will be part of an archaeological area on the Town Hall Square , for which construction work is due to begin shortly .	-4.8192
However , a few years will go by before completion .	-3.9410
Almost hacked : Reproduction of the Rocker Process	-4.2241
A bloody attack in the Rockermeieu is rolled up after more than four years .	-4.6078
A trial of attempted slaughter , dangerous bodily injury and damage to two 30-year-olds has begun in Frankfurt ( Oder ) District Court .	-6.2736
It is accompanied by strict security measures .	-2.5760
The defendants remained silent to the start .	-3.5178
They are supposed to have been active in the rock scene and then belong to the bandidos .	-3.9382
The public prosecutor accuses them of having stowed in a car three men together with unknown accomplices in Finowfurt in June 2009 .	-4.9721
All the victims were seriously injured , a man almost lost his leg .	-2.4459
The victims are said to have belonged to the competing group of Hells Angels .	-5.9535
One is said to have been a senior member from Berlin .	-2.1623
Apparently , a chase with several cars had gone ahead .	-3.9904
According to charges , it was about retrenchment and a demonstration of power .	-4.8102
The two defendants were acquitted in an initial trial at the beginning of 2012 .	-2.5814
A court spokesman said at the time that it was not possible to prove that the men were actually involved in the bloody feud .	-4.5657
The perpetrators had worn masks and had not been recognized .	-2.4462
The Federal Court of Justice revoked the judgment after the Public Prosecutor 's review and referred it back to the District Court for further negotiations .	-6.2495
One of the defendants is currently in open execution for another offence .	-2.4655
The first step was to reconstruct the procedures on the Tatnacht .	-4.8300
The Commissioner who was investigating at the time was invited as a witness .	-4.2746
In the centre were mobile phone calls from the defendants and other people who had stopped the police .	-4.9287
It is difficult that rockers in court almost always comply with - and not tell - a law that is firm for them .	-7.3432
This also applies to the victims .	-1.8721
In the first process , only one of the victims had unpacked .	-3.5144
Public prosecutor Stefan Golfer of the Frankfurt Public Prosecutor ( Oder ) said on demand that new traces had appeared since the last trial .	-5.4145
Eleven further negotiating days are scheduled for the process .	-3.5749
The Dispute Society Not Thinking	-4.4320
The night was long , the music was loud and the mood was good , but eventually it goes home .	-4.1129
The only thing is that people on the front-passenger and back seat are starving .	-6.0233
Of course , one or other cocktail or champagne may be responsible for this !	-4.4939
What is closer than to driving chilled to the next drive-in to treat yourself a little bit ?	-5.9141
I admit , I am happy to be with you when it comes to late nights or early morning to fast food holes .	-7.2475
A few chips , a cola , a Burger - and then nix like home and bed !	-5.0197
But on the way home , the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco goers are noticeable .	-4.7029
After all , what is missing is the fact that you always throw your fast food bags out of the car window ? !	-10.1963
Especially at weekends , paper bags are thrown away at street edges and at parking places .	-7.2865
" Why ? " I wonder .	-1.9780
Are the people too doof to take the bags home or to the next bin ?	-3.2758
It is not just the case that the paper shakes the landscape .	-3.9992
Bags have also covered up transport facilities such as control barriers , causing accidents .	-7.2994
But what does not think about this " disposable society " , it probably does not even know what this word actually means .	-5.8584
If you are on the road more often in the evening , especially with several people in the car , you will know what a back seat can look like after nights that are going through : cloths , bottles and other garbage are there .	-10.1259
There would be a few bags , more or less , making it even nicer - in contrast to the street , where no one wants to trample on the food remains of others .	-9.5492
I can already see the day when cities and communities are being made to block the way out - and the fast food chains have to demand a deposit for their bags .	-7.6627
Obama ’ s Health-Policy Divide	-3.4288
After much criticism , President Obama yesterday retracted his often-repeated , clear promise : “ If you like your health insurance , you can keep it . ”	-4.6089
After hundreds of thousands of their insurers received a letter of notice , the Republicans have told the president in recent days that he has misled the American public .	-4.3725
Yesterday , Obama relativized his original promise .	-2.0674
“ The vast majority of citizens who have functioning health insurance can keep them , ” he said in a speech in Boston .	-3.9468
In response to the numerous media reports on the dismissals , Obama called on those Americans who received such communications to look around the free market for new insurance .	-4.1086
Most citizens could thus obtain better , more comprehensive health insurance at the same price or more cheaply than predicted .	-4.3614
“ You get a better deal , ” he said .	-2.6518
The government considered it unsurprising that the five per cent of the population who have insurance themselves would have to look for a different rate , because their contract did not comply with the new standards under the Affordable Care Act .	-10.6433
“ I would like to say straight to these Americans that they deserve better , ” Sebelius said at a hearing before the House ’ s Energy and Trade Committee in Washington .	-4.5223
Sebelius , responsible for implementing the Affordable Care Act , explained that the launch of the online platform has been “ miserable ” since October .	-4.2534
“ I am as frustrated and angry as everyone else , ” she said .	-2.2650
I am determined to regain your trust .	-1.4529
This statement by an inflated Sebelius as a consultant behind her at yesterday ’ s hearing in the House of Representatives was received after a dispute with Republican MP Billy Long from Missouri about whether she should be required to participate in Obamacare .	-6.9644
After more than three hours of hearing , Long Sebelius repeatedly asked why the “ architect ” of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily dispensed with government-sponsored insurance in order to buy a tariff at HealthCare.gov , which it now wants to sell to millions of Americans .	-6.6980
Jerusalem Government Confirmed Attack on Syrian Air Base Not	-7.1198
An American government official who wanted to remain anonymous said to the American CNN on Thursday that Israeli combat aircraft had attacked an air base in Syria ’ s Latakia one day earlier .	-5.7849
The aim was ' rockets and related equipment ' , which the Israeli government feared had been destined for Lebanese Hezbollah , according to CNN .	-4.7899
Syrian and Lebanese media , as well as the Arab broadcaster Al-Arabiya , had previously reported that the base in the port city of Latakia was bombed on Thursday night from Wednesday to Thursday , and the Israelis blamed it .	-5.5134
The Israeli television channel Channel 2 showed satellite images of the Latakia base where Russian S-125 Newa defence missiles and a SA-3 battery could be seen , which , according to Channel 2 , have a range of 35 kilometres and can transport warheads of up to 70 kilograms .	-7.4021
Unsure The government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack .	-2.8936
However , the Reuters news agency quotes an Israeli government official who is also anonymous , saying that he believes that Israel has carried out the attack , but is not sure .	-5.2456
In any case , one speaker from the Israeli Ministry of Defence said : ' We are not commenting on these reports ' .	-3.2716
The journalist Ron Ben-Yishai emphasized in Yedioth Ahronoth ’ s daily newspaper that the Syrian regime had already tried , partly successfully , to deliver ground air missiles to Hezbollah .	-4.4824
The Israeli government had repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to supply Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons would mean crossing a " red line " that would be followed by a military response .	-3.7011
John Kerry , in an unprecedented admission that US espionage has gone “ unduly far . ”	-3.5988
John Kerry , with an unexpected admission , suggested a softening of the US ’ s defensive stance on its surveillance programs by saying that espionage has “ gone too far ” in some cases .	-5.5975
The Foreign Minister also admitted that he and Barack Obama shared the responsibility for “ autopilot ” when the explosive revelations by the whistleblower Edward Snowden about NSA spying activities became public .	-5.6944
The leaked information has led the US government into a diplomatic storm of outrage by its allies .	-3.7983
In a video-linked speech at the Open Government Conference in London , Kerry said : “ There is no question that the President and I , as well as others in the government , have learned of some things that have almost happened by autopilot simply because there was the ability to do what was going on from World War II and the difficult years of the Cold War , and , of course , from September 11 . ”	-7.9369
He then admitted , as the first senior member of the US government , that US espionage had crossed a border , but also stressed that no rights had been abused .	-4.5518
He said , “ In some cases , this has gone unduly far . ”	-3.2387
The President is determined to provide clarity and is therefore conducting a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel that abuses are taking place .	-5.4138
I assure you that the rights of innocent people will not be affected in this process .	-2.3113
Kerry insisted , however , that the NSA was a force of good , and that its surveillance had saved many lives .	-4.2580
He added , “ We are dealing with a new world in which people are prepared to blow themselves up . ”	-2.7710
There is a radical extremism in the world that is intent on killing people , blowing up the air and attacking governments .	-3.7256
So what if we were able to catch and stop it before it happened ?	-3.3557
We have indeed prevented aircraft crashes , attacks on buildings and the murder of people because we have learned about such plans in advance .	-4.6005
Meanwhile , US lawmakers will travel to Europe to allay concerns about alleged American espionage , and to convince Europeans of the need to continue working with the US on anti-terrorist efforts , as the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said on Thursday .	-5.0163
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said that he spoke to representatives of the European Parliament and other people this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorism organisations because of the frustration of the National Security Agency 's monitoring .	-5.5140
“ It is very important for US national security interests that Europeans remain on board in our joint efforts against terrorism , ” said Murphy , who , as a democrat , is in the Senate for the first time and as chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Relations and European Affairs , in an interview in Washington .	-5.6374
I also go to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism , regardless of their anger over the NSA programmes .	-3.8454
Media reports that the NSA has collected millions of telephone data in Europe have strained relations with some US allies , although the head of the intelligence service this week stated that the reports were inaccurate and were based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and exchanged with the United States .	-4.8424
Other revelations quoted from Snowden ’ s documents that the NSA had monitored Chancellor Angela Merkel ’ s mobile phone and up to 34 other world leaders .	-4.7710
The head of the national intelligence services , James Clapper , defended the espionage of allies as necessary and declared that this was customary on both sides .	-4.3184
In all this turmoil , Murphy said that his authority was preparing for the visit of the Congress to be held this year , and hoped that the delegation would include members from both parties and chambers .	-5.1585
The names of the other participating Members will be published in the coming days .	-2.6201
He said that the exact itinerary is still being prepared .	-3.6133
While Murphy emphasized that the purpose of the trip was to improve relations , he also said that there would be some “ serious words . ”	-3.2903
He said that European governments should be honest with their people about the kind of spying programs they have been using for years .	-4.2013
“ While we can change our surveillance programs and thus better protect the rights of Europeans , they must also agree with the fact that we are not the only ones to spy , ” according to Murphy .	-5.1807
Meanwhile , John Kerry is on a weekend trip to the Middle East and Poland to deal with the resentment over US strategy in Syria , Egypt , and Iran , and US surveillance activities .	-4.0794
A persistent injury at the jump wheel threatens to prevent the deployment of Nicolai Müller in the FSV Mainz 05 Bundesliga game at FC Augsburg .	-5.4775
Mainz bent on a commitment from Nicolai Müller .	-4.3490
Tomorrow he will try to train with the team .	-1.1428
Until now he could only do this individually .	-3.5435
" We will decide on his bet in the short term , " said coach Thomas Tuchel .	-4.8382
The 40-year-old hopes to have his best goal guards with six hits .	-3.9528
Mainzer already has to give up the injured performance carriers Niki Zimling , Julian Baumgartlinger and Niko Bungert .	-8.0624
Australia Appeals Prison in Thailand	-3.2648
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney , sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for falsely claiming to have been raped by a taxi driver , appealed against the sentence and was released on bail .	-3.9747
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty by a provincial court in Phuket on June 15 , to have taken a miscarriage after she told the Thai police that a local taxi driver raped her in the morning hours on Sunday , June 10 , while two other men held it .	-6.4543
Later , however , the recordings of a video camera showed that she had safely entered her hotel after being separated from her Australian friend .	-4.7494
The police in Phuket interrogated Bamford for two days until they allowed themselves to think about history .	-4.9611
She was in police custody until the trial .	-3.2659
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a low-security prison on the edge of Phuets , instead of in a prison for adult women .	-4.7425
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks , a former Australian Rubgy League player , who contacted the Foreign Ministry in Canberra to help his daughter .	-4.4343
Tunks told the Sydney Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was “ extremely concerned ” about the welfare of his daughter and wanted to have them back in Australia .	-4.1126
“ Of course , we are very concerned , but we hope it will be back home as soon as possible , ” said Tunks .	-3.9416
Bamford has appealed against the ruling and is free on bail of 50,000 Baht .	-3.9959
In Australian reports it has been reported that she is on holiday in Krabi in South Thailand .	-5.7287
On the part of the court , it was said that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and had been warned that the appeal could also lead to the imposition of a higher penalty of up to two years in an adult prison .	-5.2030
However , it is also possible that , following the recent assassination of the travel clerk Michelle Smith in Phuket , Thailand might try to improve its damaged tourist image , and so there is a claim .	-7.6174
