Welsh agents ' look like Dödel '	-3.5617
There is consternation among some members of the Assembly about a proposal to change its title on MWPs ( member of the Welsh Parliament ) .	-4.5839
This was due to plans to change the name of the National Assembly in the Welsh Parliament .	-2.7458
Members of all parties to the National Assembly are concerned that they may be making mockery .	-4.0932
A Labour MEP said that his group is ' caught up with Twp and Pwp ' .	-4.1197
Note for the reader : “ twp ” in Welsh means “ taxed ” and “ pwp ” means “ tick . ”	-3.8004
A meeting member of Plaid Cymru said that the group as a whole was ' not happy ' and proposed alternatives .	-2.6889
A Welsh Conservative said that his group was “ open ” to a change in name , but pointed out that it is only a short verbal leap from “ MWP ” ( a member of the Welsh parliament ) to “ Muppet . ”	-5.1721
Note : The Welsh letter W is pronounced similarly to the U in English .	-2.2926
The National Assembly Commission , which is currently working on a bill for the name change , said : ‘ The final decision on the name of the members of the National Assembly is , of course , the members themselves . ’	-5.1432
With the Government of Wales Act 2017 , the Welsh Parliament was given the opportunity to change its name .	-2.2178
Last June , the Commission published the results of a public hearing on the proposals , according to which the name change was widely accepted in the Welsh Parliament .	-4.2484
On the issue of the title of meeting members , the Commission preferred Welsh MPs or WMPs , but the MWP option received most support in a public survey .	-4.6048
Members of the Welsh Parliament seem to be proposing alternative options , but the fight to reach consensus could cause headaches for Chairman Elin JONES , who is expected to submit a bill for these changes in the coming weeks .	-5.5613
The reform legislation will involve changes in the functioning of the Assembly , including the rules governing disqualification of members of the Welsh Parliament and the organisation of the exclusion system .	-5.2772
Members of the National Assembly can decide how they should be called in the debate on the law .	-4.1021
Macedonians hold a referendum on changing the country 's name .	-2.4118
On Sunday , eligible voters voted to change the country ’ s name to the Republic of North Macedonia .	-4.0120
The referendum is being held in order to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece , in which a province bears the name of Macedonia .	-3.8562
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour is a right to its territory and has repeatedly objected to its application for admission to the EU and NATO .	-3.6919
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov , an opponent of the referendum on the change of name , said that he would ignore the vote .	-5.5434
But proponents of the referendum , including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev , argue that the change in name is quite simply the price to pay for EU and NATO membership .	-3.9877
The bells of St. Martin are silenced , as churches in Harlem have problems .	-3.3791
" Historically , the old people with whom I spoke said that there was a bar and a church at every corner , " said Mr Adams .	-3.6343
" Today there is neither . "	-2.8388
He said that the disappearance of pubs is understandable .	-1.5472
" People make comets in a different way , " he said today .	-3.0368
" Kneipen is no longer a living room in the neighborhood where you meet regularly . "	-4.0611
As for churches , he fears that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders expect .	-3.1952
Churches could be replaced by multi-family houses with condominiums filled with the kind of people who will not help the remaining sanctuaries of the district .	-3.8846
The overwhelming majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will know , he said , ' and will therefore speed up the day when these churches are closed completely , because it is unlikely that most of those people who move into these condominiums will become members of those churches ' .	-5.8016
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became the black metropolis in 1870 – Metropolitan Community , St. Martin 's a decade later .	-2.4758
The original white Methodist community withdrew in the 1930s .	-3.7949
A black community , practising a religion nearby , acquired the building .	-4.3720
St. Martin 's was taken over by a black community under the pastor John Howard Johnson , who led a boycott of retailers in 125 Street , a main street for shopping in Harlem , which opposed the recruitment or promotion of blacks .	-4.5123
A 1939 fire left the building seriously damaged , but when Father Johnson 's community members made plans for reconstruction , they charged the bell game .	-5.3053
Father David Johnson , son of Father Johnson and successor to St. Martin 's , proudly called the bell game " the bells of the poor . "	-3.7701
The expert who played the bell game in July called it something else : " A cultural treasure " and " an irreplaceable historical instrument " .	-3.3721
The expert , Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan , also noted that it was the first Glockenspiel in the world to be played by a black musician , Dionisio A. Lind , who , 18 years ago , switched to the larger Glockenspiel at the Riverside Church .	-5.4496
Mr Merriweather said that St. Martin 's has not replaced him .	-1.9242
What has happened in the last few months at St. Martin has been a complicated history of architects and builders , some of whom have been brought in by the church ’ s Laienführer and others by the bishop ’ s diocese .	-7.2986
The sacristy – the head of the parish , which is composed of lay leaders – wrote to the diocese in July with the concern that the diocese would " try to pass the costs on to the sacristy " , even though the sacristy was not involved in the appointment of the architects and diocese contractors .	-6.9812
Some members complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese .	-3.1069

On Saturday , a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and injured him while in California on the opening day of the Hummer season , officials said .	-4.1428
The attack took place just before seven o 'clock in the morning near the Beacon beach in Encinitas .	-2.3901
Chad Hammel said KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy cry for help , and he was then stuck with the others to save him from the water .	-6.6014
“ First I thought someone was happy because he caught a lobster , ” Hammel said , but then I noticed that someone shouted , “ I was bitten ! ”	-4.6961
I have been bitten !	-2.3814
His entire key leg was ripped up , Hammel said , he found this when he came to the boy .	-5.9964
I shouted at everyone to get out of the water : " There is a shark in the water ! " said Hammel .	-3.4552
The boy was taken to the Rady Children 's Hospital in San Diego , where his condition was critically documented .	-2.6450
The shark responsible for the attack is unknown .	-2.2368
Rescue swimmer Larry Giles said in a media interview that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier , but it was discovered that it was not a dangerous shark .	-5.4596
Giles added traumatic injuries to his victim 's upper body .	-1.9532
Officials closed the access to the beach of Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami 's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for security reasons .	-2.4075
Giles noted that there are more than 135 sharks in the area , but most are not considered dangerous .	-2.3508
Sainsbury plans to conquer the British beauty market .	-1.7769
Sainsbury 's takes over Boots , Superdrug and Debenhams with shelves of beauty products in department style , which are filled with professional assistants .	-6.0153
As part of an extensive push to the UK beauty market , which continues to grow and is worth $ 2.8bn , fashion and home ware sales will fall back , the larger 11 stores that have tested the country and brought it back to more stores next year to show success .	-6.8195
The idea of investing in the beauty market was born out of the fact that supermarkets are looking for ways to use the shelf space used for television sets , microwaves and household goods for new products .	-5.5865
Sainsbury announced that the range of beauty products will be doubled to 3,000 by including brands such as Revlon , Essie , Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw in the product portfolio for the first time .	-4.0007
Existing varieties of L 'Oreal , Maybelline , and Burt 's Bees will also have more space in branded areas , similar to those found in shops like Boots .	-4.7882
The supermarket chain is also relaunching its own boutique make-up brand , which offers a wide range of popular vegan products from young buyers .	-5.9957
In addition , the perfume dealer Fragrance Shop is testing concessions in two Sainsburys shops , the first of which was opened last week in Croydon , South London , while a second end of this year will be opened in Selly Oak , Birmingham .	-5.4745
Online shopping and a shift to the daily purchase of small food in neighborhood shops mean that supermarkets need to do more to get people to visit .	-4.9870
Mike Coupe , the head of Sainsbury 's , has said that sales outlets will increasingly look like department stores , as the supermarket chain is trying to fight discounters like Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food .	-4.3860
Sainsbury 's has placed Argos-Outlets in hundreds of stores , and has also introduced a number of habitats since it bought both chains two years ago , supposedly strengthening food sales and making acquisitions more profitable .	-4.2128
The former attempt by the supermarket to revise its beauty and pharmacy departments ended in failure .	-3.6255
Sainsbury has tested a joint venture with boats in the early 2000s , but it ended unetschieden , and revenue from the stores of pharmacies could not be shared .	-4.0714
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury 's sold $ 125 million in its 281 pharmacy business three years ago to Celesio , the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain .	-4.6628
Lloyds is also said to be involved , and four Lloyds stores are set to expand the range of luxury skin care products from brands such as La Roche-Pisay and Vichy .	-6.4033
Paul Mills-Hicks , Head of Advertising at Sainsbury , said : “ We have changed the appearance of our beauty products shelves to improve the equipment for our customers .	-4.8457
In addition , we have invested in the training of employees to advise the customer .	-4.3126
Our brand portfolio leaves nothing to be desired .	-3.1021
Peter Jones ' furious ' after Holly Willoughby broke off the $ 11 million deal .	-3.1839
Dragons The star Peter Jones went " angry " after TV presenter Holly Willoughby left the $ 11 million veto with his lifestyle brand to focus on their new contracts with Marks and Spencers and ITV .	-4.3438
Willoughby has no time for her home wear and accessories brand Truly .	-2.2604
The business of the two was compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow .	-3.5054
This Morning Moderator announced on Instagram that she would go .	-3.4685
Holly Willoughby made Dragons ' Den-Star Peter Jones angry because at the last minute she had withdrawn from her common lucrative lifestyle brand to focus on her new own crazy contract with Marks & Spencers and ITV .	-5.1779
Sources say that Jones was angry when the Goldmaid of TV admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow , Buckinghamshire , that her new business , worth up to <unk> 1.5 million , meant that she had not had enough time to devote herself to her homewear and accessory brand Truly .	-5.4307
The deal was compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow and it was assumed that it would double Willoughby ’ s assets of an estimated <unk> 11 million .	-3.6913
When Willoughby , 37 , announced on Instagram that she would leave Truly , Jones left Britain and flew to one of his homes .	-2.3469
One source said , " It was really high on Holly 's list of priorities . "	-3.1099
It should be their long-term future and secure it for the coming decades .	-3.0335
Your decision to withdraw completely dismayed everyone involved .	-4.3086
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday – so close to the start .	-2.9128
" Marlow HQ has a warehouse full of goods that can be sold . "	-2.8764
Experts believe that the move of the " This Morning " presenter , one of the most bankable stars in the UK , could cost the company millions because they invested heavily in products such as pillows , candles , clothing , and homewear , and because of the potential for further delays in market launch .	-6.4442
And it could mean the end of a long friendship .	-1.7221
Willoughby and his husband , Dan Baldwin , Jones and his wife Tara Capp have been close to him for ten years .	-5.3763
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones , 52 , as president in March .	-3.0466
The couples go on holiday together and Jones has a 40 % stake in Baldwin ’ s TV production company .	-4.0729
Willoughby is to become a trademark ambassador for M & S and replace Ant McPartlin as the host of ITV 's I 'm A Celebrity .	-2.7049
A source of information around Jones said yesterday evening : ' We would not comment on his business ' .	-4.2402
Tough Talk , and then we fell in love .	-0.9545
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the news media , because he would have made a comment that some would consider " unprivileged " and because he judged the North Korean leader so positively .	-6.0954
Why has President Trump made so many compromises ?	-1.5309
Trump said this in his mocked “ news spokesperson ” vote .	-3.7019
“ I have not made any compromises . ”	-2.3293
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump welcomed her first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step toward North Korea ’ s denuclearization .	-3.1411
But the denuclearization negotiations are blocked .	-1.6832
More than three months after the Singapore summit in June , Ri Yong Ho , North Korea ’ s leading diplomat , told United Nations leaders that the North does not see a “ corresponding response ” from the US to North Korea ’ s early disarmament measures .	-5.1984
Instead , he noted , the US continues sanctions to maintain pressure .	-3.0629
Trump adopted a much more optimistic stance in his Kundengebirge speech .	-3.5780
“ We are making good progress with North Korea , ” he said .	-1.4437
“ We wanted to wage war with North Korea .	-1.5720
Millions of people would have been killed .	-0.9944
Now we have this great relationship . ”	-1.8405
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have produced positive results , such as ending missile tests , freeing hostages , and bringing home the mortal remains of American soldiers .	-3.6420
And he defended his unusual approach when talking about relations with Kim .	-2.8139
" It is so easy to be presidential , but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this packed arena , about 200 people would be standing right there , " Trump said , pointing to the crowd right in front of him .	-5.5074
In Indonesia , a tsunami and an earthquake kill hundreds and devastate an island .	-1.7942
After the earthquake in Lombok , for example , foreign NGOs were told that they were not needed .	-2.6825
Although more than 10 % of Lombok ’ s population was resettled , no national disaster was declared , a condition for catalyzing international aid .	-3.8038
Sumbing said : ' Unfortunately , in many cases , they have made it very clear that they are not asking for international aid , so it is a small challenge ' ,	-5.1733
While Save the Children creates a team to travel to Palu , it is not yet certain whether foreign staff can work on site .	-4.6232
The spokesman for the National Civil Protection Agency , Mr Sutopo , said that Indonesian officials would assess the situation in Palu in order to see whether international organisations can contribute to aid .	-4.0226
Unfortunately , in the face of the earthquakes that Indonesia constantly suffers , the country is not well prepared for the forces of nature .	-5.2622
While the tsunami shelter was built in Aceh , what is not common for other coastal lines .	-5.5007
The apparent absence of a Palu tsunami warning , even though a warning was already in force , is likely to have contributed to the loss of life .	-4.3086
Travelling between the many islands of Indonesia is difficult even under favourable conditions .	-3.5223
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated .	-0.8780
A Lazarett ship , which was stationed for the treatment of the earthquake victims in Lombok , is on the way to Palu , but it will take at least three days to arrive at the place of the new disaster .	-5.9345
President Joko Widodo has made improving Indonesia ’ s tired infrastructure a core of his campaign , and he has spent a lot of money on roads and railways .	-3.9512
But financing deficits have plagued Mr. Joko ’ s government , even though he faces re-election next year .	-2.9524
Mr Joko is also under pressure from continuing religious tensions in Indonesia , where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith .	-2.7382
More than 1000 people were killed , and tens of thousands were driven out of their homes when Christian and Muslim gangs delivered street fights with machetes , arrow , and bow , and other primitive weapons .	-4.5306

A police officer confirmed that the woman was from Birkenhead and her body was found on her site .	-3.7130
This afternoon , friends who believe they know the woman arrived at the scene to ask questions about her site this morning .	-4.0077
The investigation is still under way , as the police have stated that they are in the process of informing the next members of the victim .	-4.7873
A taxi driver who lives in the Grayson Mews and just tried to come back to his home was informed by the police that no one can enter or leave the building .	-4.2834

Cromwell ’ s Statue will rewrite the most recent historical success of the “ History ” series .	-4.1987
His exile would be poetic justice for his taliban-like destruction of so many cultural and religious artifacts of England by his fanatical Puritan followers .	-3.6642
However , the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick 's proposal as " folly " and as " an attempt to rewrite history . "	-3.0248
John Goldsmith , Chairman of the Cromwell Society , said : “ Given the current debate about removing statues , it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell ’ s figure would be targeted before the Westminster Palace . ”	-3.6223
The British Civil War ’ s iconoclasm was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell .	-6.2379
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the last century .	-3.0423
Sir William Hamo Thornybroft ’ s magnificent depiction of Cromwell attests to the view that prevailed in the 19th century and still dominates parts of history : that Cromwell is worth celebrating .	-5.5949
Mr Goldsmith said on Sunday Telegraph : ‘ Cromwell is seen by many , perhaps more in the late nineteenth century than today , as a defender of Parliament against external pressure , in his case , of course , monarchy .	-4.4294
Whether this is an absolutely correct representation is the subject of the ongoing historical debate .	-3.2273
This is certain : the conflict in the mid-17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation , and Cromwell is an individual figure that stands for one side of the divide .	-5.3455
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth remembering and celebrating . ”	-1.7402

Hurricane Rosas ’ aftereffects bring heavy across-the-board rain to the southwest of the US	-5.5580
As predicted , Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves toward the cooler waters of Mexico ’ s northern coast .	-3.4045

Rosa was at 5 o 'clock in the morning wind speeds of 137 kmh , equivalent to a Category 1 hurricane .	-6.0402
Rosa is expected to continue north on Sunday .	-2.0864
In the meantime , a Trog is beginning to form over the Pacific Ocean and to move eastwards towards the west coast of the US . When Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday , she will begin to squeeze deep tropical moisture north into the southwest of the US .	-7.4184
Rosa will rain up to 10 cm in parts of Mexico on Monday .	-2.2922
The tropical humidity will interact over the coming days with the approaching low , causing widespread rainfall in the southwest .	-4.1603
Local rains of 2.5 to 10 cm will cause dangerous floods , debris flows and possible landslides in the desert .	-3.9041
High tropical humidity causes precipitation rates of between 5 and 8 centimetres per hour , especially in the south of Nevadas and parts of Arizonas .	-4.1635
About 5 to 10 cm of rain is expected in parts of the southwest , especially over large parts of Arizona .	-3.4238
The highly dispersed nature of the tropical rainforest makes it possible to flood the flood situation quickly .	-4.2835
It is strongly advised to go to the desert as there is a risk of tropical rain .	-5.9532
Strong rain could lead to ravines becoming raging rivers and thunderstorms bringing local gush winds and blowing dust .	-5.2935
The approaching low will bring with it some local heavy rainfall for parts of the southern California coast .	-4.9642
Precipitation of more than 1.3 cm is possible , which could lead to small rocky debris and smooth roads .	-5.9445
This is the first rainfall in the region that begins the wet season .	-2.6965
Some treacherous tropical showers will approach Arizona on late Sunday and early Monday before the rain spreads late on Monday and Tuesday .	-4.8284
Strong rain will spread from Tuesday to Wednesday to all sides .	-2.8664

In the meantime , there has been no change in the political situation , and television stations were undermining their regular programme on Friday , owing to an unexpected last-minute twist : an agreement by Jeff Flake of the Arizona Senate that the FBI should carry out a one-week investigation of the allegations .	-11.0341

He had so many heroes .	-0.8795
Captain Halkett provided an exceptionally organized defense , while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall kept on their toes all the time .	-5.1844
The Rangers lacked ideas , however .	-8.2991
As good as they were sometimes under Gerrard , they fell far behind these standards .	-2.7210

Meanwhile , China launched its plan last year : it wants to be the number 1 in the area of AI innovation by 2030 . .	-9.5596
“ Doubling spending on AI research would be a good start , given that all other countries are well behind the US , and a breakthrough in AI research is just around the corner , ” Lee said .	-3.8233

Lee has recognized the US government ’ s earlier technology competitions , such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency , and asked when the next one would take place to identify the next visionaries .	-4.2344
“ Researchers in the US often have to work very hard to obtain government grants , ” Lee said .	-3.5519
“ It is not China that is responsible for the outflow of high-level scientists , but companies , ” Lee said .	-3.6415
Facebook , Google , and other technology companies have in recent years hired university luminaries to work on AI .	-3.9150
Lee said that changing immigration policies could also help the US strengthen its AI efforts .	-3.0979
“ I think green cards should automatically be offered to doctoral students in AI , ” he said .	-2.5940
In July 2017 , the Chinese State Council presented its next-generation artificial intelligence development plan ( Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan ) .	-3.3480

On Sunday , the people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on whether their name should be changed to the Republic of Northern Macedonia , a step which would resolve a decade-long dispute with Greece , which had blocked its membership offers for the European Union and NATO .	-5.2045
Greece , which has a province called Macedonia , insists that the name of its northern neighbour represents a territorial claim to the Greek territory and has vetoed the country 's entry into NATO and the EU .	-3.6329
The two governments concluded an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name , but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia ’ s Slavic majority population .	-2.7146
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he would not vote in the referendum , and in the face of a boycott campaign there is doubt as to whether the result will create the 50 % threshold , which is a prerequisite for the validity of the referendum .	-5.1400
The question on the referendum ballot was : ' Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with the adoption of the agreement with Greece ? '	-3.2771
Supporters of the name change , including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev , argue that it is worth continuing to include Macedonia in institutions such as the EU and NATO , one of the countries to emerge from the collapse of Yugoslavia .	-4.1600
“ I have come today to vote on the future of the country , and it is a decision for the young people of Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union , because that means a life in greater security for all of us , ” said Olivera Georgijevska , 79 , in Skopje .	-4.9330
Although not legally binding , enough Members have said that they will abide by the outcome of the vote to make it decisive .	-3.9202
A two-thirds majority in Parliament is required to change the name .	-2.2668

“ We live in a poor country , but we also have our dignity .	-1.9784
If you do not want to join us as Macedonia , we can turn to others , such as China and Russia , to join us in Euro-Asian integration . ”	-3.0836
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia , a country with an unemployment rate of more than 20 % .	-1.8729
“ I believe that a large majority will vote in favour , because more than 80 % of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO , ” Zaev said after giving his vote .	-4.4135
According to him , the “ yes ” outcome would be a “ reinforcement of our future . ”	-3.2232
Last Monday , the Macedonian Institute for Political Research published the results of a survey : between 30 and 43 % of voters would thus vote – less than necessary .	-3.2102
Another poll conducted by Macedonia 's Telma TV found that 57 % of respondents will vote on Sunday .	-2.9013
Of those who want to participate , 70 % said yes .	-3.1382

Notification : Sergio Agüero of Manchester City overcomes the entire Brighton defense on his way to the gate .	-4.8435
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling completed Brighton 's defense at Saturday 's Manchester City 2-0 victory at Etihad Stadium in Manchester , England .	-3.1711
Aguero made his hits look incredibly easy in the 65th minute .	-3.6788
At the beginning of the game sequence , the Argentine striker received a pass in the middle field .	-3.4943
He tricked out three defenders of Brighton to play free .	-4.1967
Then Agüero was surrounded by three green hedges .	-2.9122
He bypassed a defender before he ran several players on the edge of the Brighton Sanctuary .	-4.3330
Then he made a pass to the left and handed down to Sterling .	-3.4352
The English striker used his first contact to play the ball back to Agüero , who then shot with the right – past Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan on the right side of the goal .	-5.0142
“ Aguero has foot problems , ” said City Manager Pep Guardiola to the reporters .	-2.1932
" We talked about it ; he played 55 , 60 minutes .	-2.6359
That has happened .	-1.1892
Fortunately , he shot a gate at the moment . ”	-2.8063
But it was Sterling who first led the Sky Blues at the Premier League duel :	-3.6664
The gate came in the 29th minute .	-2.3392
In the game , Aguero was played the ball deep in the territory of Brighton .	-2.2152

Scherzer ’ s Play for Rockies	-2.8150
Because the national players were excluded from Playoff competition , there was little reason to force another start .	-3.4886
But the hard-fought joker hopes to climb the hill against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday , but only if there are still Playoff implications for the Rockies that have a lead from a game in front of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West .	-5.2383
The Rockies secured at least one place ahead with a 5 : 2 victory over the Nationals on Friday evening , but the title win in the first league is still not certain .	-6.2863
" Even if we play for free , we can at least get in the way because we know that the atmosphere here in Denver with the people and the other team will probably be the best that we have to offer this year .	-6.1494
Why should I not want to make an effort ? '	-3.2338
The Nationals have not yet announced a start for Sunday , but are supposedly inclined to let jokers throw in such a situation .	-5.0598

Trump continues : “ You see this terrible , terrible radical democrat group , you see that it is happening right now .	-4.2270
And they are determined to regain power with all the necessary means , and do not stop at flashing and commons .	-6.7614
They do not care about whom they injure , whom they have to pass over in order to gain power and control , that is what they want , power and control , we will not give it to them .	-5.1535
“ The goal of the democrats is to oppose and block , ” he said .	-3.0740

The Labour Party is no longer a broad community .	-4.7266
It is intolerant of those who say what they think .	-0.7792
When momentum activists in my local party voted to criticize me , it was hardly surprising .	-2.2714
Finally , I am the last of a number of Labour MEPs who say that we are not welcome - just because we have said our opinion .	-5.3541
My group colleague Joan Ryan has been treated similarly because she has resolutely opposed anti-Semitism .	-3.7663
In my case , I was criticised by the motion of censure because I do not agree with Jeremy Corbyn .	-2.1361

The communication on Friday for the East Labour meeting in Nottingham says : ' We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive ' .	-3.3654
Most of my time as a local Labour MEP over the eight years was exactly the same as the GC meetings on Friday evening .	-4.2171
Unfortunately , it is not the tone of many meetings today , and the promise of a ' more friendly , softer ' policy has long been forgotten if it has ever begun .	-3.9944
It has become increasingly clear that different views in the Labour Party are not tolerated , and each opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to the party leadership .	-4.4748
This began shortly after Jeremy took office , because the colleagues with whom I had previously thought that I had a similar political attitude expected me to turn a blind eye and adopt positions with which I would never otherwise have agreed , whether in terms of national security or the EU internal market .	-6.1901
Whenever I speak publicly – and it does not matter what I say – there is a tirade of abuse in the social media , which calls for dismissal , denounces the centre ’ s policy and tells me that I should not be in the Labour Party .	-6.0130
This experience was not only my experience .	-4.1927
I know , in fact , that there is more luck than some of my colleagues , because the comments that are addressed to me tend to be political .	-4.6564
I appreciate the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who are subjected to a flood of sexist or racist abuse every day , but never shy away .	-3.7976
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the scale of abuse has normalized .	-2.4589
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that Labour should promote a culture of tolerance .	-1.3479
The reality is that we are no longer the broad church and , with every motion of censure or amendment of the selection rules , the party becomes smaller .	-4.3264
I have received plenty of advice over the last two years to pull my neck in , not to be so loud , and then I would be “ right . ”	-5.4740
But that is why I did not come into politics .	-2.9075
32 years ago , as a student , I joined Labour because of the neglect of the Thatcher government , which neglect meant that my classroom had literally collapsed , and so I tried to work for better public services for those who need it most , whether as a council or minister .	-6.5106
I have never hidden my political views , even at the last election .	-2.4692
As far as my political positions are concerned , no one in Nottingham East should have been confused in any way , and the same applies to areas where I disagree with the current leadership .	-4.3429
To those who supported the request on Friday , I just want to say that I do not understand why they are wasting time and energy in order to remain loyal to me and the Labour Party when the country is heading for Brexit , which is damaging households , businesses , and our public services .	-6.7603
But the only message I have is not about Nottingham Momentum , but about my constituents , whether Labour Members or not : I am proud to serve you , and I promise you that no threats to vote or political opportunities will deter me from working in what I believe is the best interest of all of you .	-5.7014

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose : Ayr beating at the top	-3.4231
Two late tries may have distorted the final result , but there is no doubt that Ayr deserves to win this wonderfully entertaining Tennt 's Premier Match of the Day .	-3.9304
They are now the only undefeated of the ten teams to lead the table .	-5.7437
In the end , it was due to the superior defense of the host , but also to the better use of opportunities .	-6.0308
" We have been tested so far through our games , and we are still unbeaten , so I must be happy , " he said .	-3.6186
Robyn Christie of Melrose said , “ Thanks , Ayr , they have made better use of their opportunities . ”	-2.7211
Grant Anderson 's attempt in the 14th minute , altered by Frazier Climo , brought Ayr forward , but a yellow card for Scotland 's captain Rory Hughes , given for the game of Warriors , allowed Melrose to let numbers speak , and Jason Baggot an unaltered attempt to obtain .	-5.4556
Climo pushed Ayr ’ s leadership with a penalty before he scored a match at the midway , and then went on a solo tour with him in the 17 : 5 break for Ayr .	-9.0078
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson 's attempt , transformed by Baggot , reduced the lag to five points .	-3.7768
After a long break with Ruaridh Knott , who left the field on a payload , Ayr set off the lead when a relay McDowall-transformed by Climo .	-11.1195
Ayr 's current captain Blair Macpherson then got the yellow card , and again Melrose made the extra man pay with an untransformed Bruce Colvine attempt , at the end of a curse of intense pressure .	-4.6120
However , the homeside came back , and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card out of the prison line because of a tackling without a ball from Climo , MacPherson made a touchdown , the advancing Ayr in his back .	-6.5754
Climo converted almost after the reboot , after Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong 's boxkick and sent the wingman Gregor Henry per pass in the direction of Try number five .	-6.5988

“ We are on the verge of regaining access to the Pacific Ocean , ” he vowed at the end of August .	-2.4863
However , some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in favour of Bolivia , and believe that even a positive decision for Bolivia will not change .	-4.4153
The Dutch UN body has no authority to grant Chilean territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of any talks .	-4.2261
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice came about only six months after hearing the final arguments shows that the case was ' not complicated ' , said Paz Zárate , a Chilean expert on international law .	-4.0150
Far from advancing Bolivia ’ s cause , the last four years may have postponed it .	-2.8528
“ The question of access to the sea is being used by the current Bolivian government for their purposes , ” said Zárate .	-4.9651

Independent schools in Scotland have a track record of academic excellence , which continued in 2018 with once again excellent reviews , along with individual and group success in sports , art , music and other collaborative ventures .	-7.0229
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland , these schools , represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools ( SCIS ) , are striving to offer their students and parents the best level of service .	-5.9821
Independent schools are designed to prepare students – for secondary education , including at universities , for their desired career and for their role as a global citizen .	-5.5474
In the education sector , we have the opportunity to develop and implement a tailor-made school curriculum , noting that modern languages are still popular and desirable in schools .	-4.8858
Nelson Mandela once said this : “ When you speak to a person in the language he understands , you get your mind . ”	-4.7523
When you talk to him in his own language , it goes to his heart . ”	-3.5294
This is an impressive illustration of the fact that we cannot rely only on the English language if we are to build relations and trust with people from other countries .	-4.0979
This year ’ s audit results show that languages are at the top of the tables with the highest standing rates in independent schools .	-4.4578
68 percent of students who have studied foreign languages have reached the so-called Higher grade A class A .	-5.8241
The data collected by SCIS ’ s 74 member schools showed that 72 % of students reached a “ Higher grade A ” in Mandarin , while 72 , 69 , and 63 respectively reached grade A among the students who learned German , French and Spanish .	-6.0188
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are promoting foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future .	-2.9784
Language subjects rank the same in independent schools and elsewhere as MINT subjects ( mathematics , information technology , science , and technology ) .	-3.4950
A 2014 survey by the UK Employment and Qualifications Commission found that 17 % of the reasons why employers had difficulty filling vacancies were due to a lack of language skills .	-4.2904
As a result , language skills are becoming increasingly necessary to prepare young people for their professional future .	-3.0786
With more promising employment opportunities that require languages , these skills are essential in a globalised world .	-3.2988
Regardless of the career that someone chooses when he has learned a second language , he will have a real advantage in the future with a lifetime ability like this .	-5.1226
By allowing people to communicate directly with people from abroad , a multilingual person will automatically be ahead of the competitors .	-7.2233
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013 , 75 % were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to talk , and French is the only language spoken at a two-digit percentage , namely 15 % .	-3.6512
That is why the current investment in language teaching is important for today 's children .	-3.2352
When children learn to speak several languages – particularly those of developing countries – they will have better chances of finding meaningful employment in the labor market .	-4.1134
The schools in Scotland are different in terms of their language .	-3.3694
Some schools focus on traditional modern languages , while others will teach the most important languages for the UK in 2020 , such as Mandarin or Japanese .	-4.3784
Whatever your child ’ s interest , there will always be a number of languages available in independent schools , with teachers specialized in this field .	-4.3156
Independent schools in Scotland want to provide a learning environment that is well prepared for children , and they should be given the necessary tools for their success , whatever the future may bring .	-5.2484
In today ’ s global business world , languages are undeniably still important for the country ’ s future , and that must also be reflected in education .	-3.8681
Indeed , modern languages should really be regarded as “ international communication skills . ”	-2.9089
Independent schools will continue to offer young people in Scotland this choice , diversity and quality .	-2.4591

Trump ’ s Rally in West Virginia , YouTube Channel	-1.2758
President Donald Trump begins tonight in Wheeling , West Virginia , with a flood of campaign events .	-2.5396
It is the first of five scheduled election events next week , with Trump visiting the Republican-friendly states of Tennessee and Mississippi on his tour .	-4.8476
While his candidate ’ s approval of the vacant Supreme Court is still pending , Trump must mobilize his electorate for the upcoming midterm elections , because otherwise it is feared that the Republicans will lose the congressional majority if elected in November .	-6.2704
When is Trump ’ s West Virginia Rally tonight , and how can one view it online ?	-2.8314
Trump 's rally in Wheeling , West Virginia , is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight , Saturday , 29 September .	-3.6189
You can watch Trump ’ s West Virginia Rally live on YouTube below .	-2.9026
Trump will certainly address this week ’ s hearings on charges of sexual abuse against his Supreme Court nominee , Brett Kavanaugh , whose confirmation in office must be carried out by the Senate has been postponed by at least a week until the FBI ’ s investigation is completed .	-6.4169
But the main goal of these election events is to mobilize the Republicans , who face a crucial election in November .	-5.2468
According to Reuters , the goal of Trump ’ s campaign is to mobilize volunteers and supporters next week ’ s five ballots to defend and expand the majority of Republicans in the Senate and House of Representatives .	-4.3022
“ The majority in Congress is at the top of the president ’ s agenda , and so , just before the start of the turbulent campaign , he visited as many states as possible , ” a Trump campaign spokesman , who does not want to be named by name , said Reuters .	-5.6229
According to West Virginia MetroNews , this evening ’ s polling event at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract support from Ohio and Pennsylvania to attract the attention of Pittsburgher media .	-4.6379
On Saturday , Trump will visit West Virginia , the state that he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016 , for the second time this month .	-2.3442
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the Senate of West Virginia , Patrick Morrisey , who lags behind in polls .	-3.3761
According to Reuters , Simon Haeder , a political scientist at West Virginia University , said that it was not a good sign for Morrisey that the president had to come to improve his poll ratings .	-4.0872
Ryder Cup 2018 : The US team is ready to fight to maintain the hope of Sunday ’ s singles .	-5.3465
After three unilateral encounters , the four players on Saturday afternoon were probably exactly what the Ryder Cup needed .	-3.8283
The swing pendulum is a freely invented sports concept that players have internalized , especially in competitions like this .	-4.0983
So where would they say is the momentum now ?	-1.7897
“ They had a six-point lead , and now there are four , so we probably have a bit of momentum , ” Jordan Spieth said when he retired for the day . ”	-5.0916
Europe , of course , is in the advantage of four points , with twelve more to play .	-6.0651
But , as Spieth says , Americans feel a little wind in their sails , and there was much encouragement for them , not least the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas , who played together all day long and each have three out of four points .	-5.7959
Spieth was superior from the beginning and set a good example .	-3.6223
These cunning cheers became louder when his round went on , he threw a decisive putt to win a draw in game 4 after he and Thomas left 2 points after 2 games .	-8.0139
His delight at the 15th hole putt , with which they won the game , was such that one thought he still believed in the victory of the Americans .	-5.5397
" You really have to focus your attention and worry about your own game , " Spieth said .	-4.4855
This is all that remains for each of these players .	-3.9019
18 holes to leave an impression .	-1.9470
At this Ryder Cup in the last two days were undeniably Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood the only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas .	-2.8943
Europe ’ s strange , but admirable couple play flawlessly and just do everything right .	-5.2728
" Moliwood " was the only pair that did not achieve a bogey on Saturday afternoon , but it also avoided the bogey on Saturday morning , Friday afternoon and Friday morning the rear nine .	-6.2510
This race and the way in which their energy seems to flow from this missed crowd makes them the favourites on Sunday , and when the sun goes down over Le Golf National , there would be no more popular player to seal a possible European victory than Fleetwood or Molinari .	-7.4546
Probably both at different holes at the same time .	-2.4226
To speak now of a European victory would be too hasty .	-2.8952
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short trials with Sergio Garcia , who won with his partner Alex Noren in the morning .	-3.1293
With a bogey and two Doubles on the first nine , the Spaniards and the Swedes were buried in a hole from which they never came out again .	-6.8837
On Sunday there is no one to help you out of your hole .	-3.3964
Because of the interactions between the mations , the given advice , the ungiven advice and the way a strategy can change in the blink of a eye , it is very fascinating to watch the Fourballs and Foursomes at close range .	-9.5537
Europe has played better as a team and taken a clear lead in the last day , but this Foursome-Session has also shown that the USA team has the desire to fight , which some , especially Stateside , have doubted .	-6.4799
Europe Leads 10-6 at the Ryder Cup Final Day	-3.0421
Europe will take advantage of a solid advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after it emerged from Saturday 's fourth and fourth games with a 10-6 lead over the United States .	-4.7384
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the group with two victories over a struggling Tiger Woods to score four points in the Le Golf National .	-3.7417
The European team of Thomas Bjorn , who took part in the maintenance of the trophy she lost two years ago in Hazeltine , dominated an American team fighting with dropouts and won the series with 3-1 .	-6.3354
The US offered more resistance in the fours and won two games , but they could not digest the deficit .	-2.8999
The team of Jim Furyk needs eight points from the 12 singles of Sunday to keep the trophy .	-3.8352
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row while he and Molinari , after a sensational weekend called " Molliwood " , are only the second pair to win four points from their first four games in the history of the Ryder Cup .	-3.5157
After breaking Woods and Patrick Reed in the Fourballs , it was considered certain that they would beat a sobered Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau through an even clearer 5 & 4 .	-4.9697
Woods , who moved through two matches on Saturday , occasionally showed brilliant actions , but he has lost 19 of his 29 matches in four and four , and seven in a row .	-6.2306
Justin Rose , rested for the Fourballs , returned to his partner Henrik Stenson in the Foursomes and beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka in a 2 & 1 defeat – place one and three in the world .	-4.9219
However , on a pleasant , airy day southwest of Paris , Europe did not have it in its own way .	-2.6646
The three main winners , Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas , set the standard for Americans on Saturday with two points .	-6.9788
They won a courageous 2 : 1 victory against the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-pack and returned later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 : 3 in the four-pack after losing the first two holes .	-5.0851
Only twice in the Ryder Cup history a team returns from a four-point deficit to singles , although Holder Furyk 's side only needs a draw to keep the trophy .	-3.7865
After two days of second best time , however , a Sunday account looks like it would go beyond it .	-5.4584
North Korea says that there will be a unilateral disarmament without trust .	-3.0109
North Korea ’ s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions would deepen its distrust of the United States , and that under no circumstances would it unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons .	-3.6443
Ri Yong Ho said to the world body 's annual general assembly that last year North Korea took " significant goodwill measures " , such as the suspension of nuclear and missile tests , the dismantling of the nuclear test site , and the obligation not to spread nuclear weapons and technology .	-6.0266
" There is no answer from the USA , " he said .	-3.2865
“ Without any confidence in the US , there will be no confidence in our national security , and in such circumstances , there is no possibility that we will first disarm unilaterally . ”	-4.1170
While Ri revisited the well-known North Korean complaints about Washington ’ s opposition to a “ gradual ” approach to denuclearization , whereby North Korea would be rewarded with gradual steps , his statement seemed significant in that it did not completely reject unilateral denuclearization , as Pyongyang did in the past .	-4.8714
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a first summit between a incumbent US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12 , when Kim committed to working towards " denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula , " while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea 's security .	-4.4618
North Korea has sought a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War , but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons .	-3.1680
Washington has also resisted calls for a relaxation of tough international sanctions against North Korea .	-3.5817
The US insists on " denuclearization first " ( first denuclearization ) and increases the pressure through sanctions to achieve its purpose in a compelling way , even rejecting the " declaration of the end of the war , " Ri said .	-5.2092
" The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a pipe dream for people who are ignorant of us .	-2.9237
But the problem is that continued sanctions exacerbate our distrust . ”	-2.4890
Ri did not mention any plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump , which the US president emphasized at the United Nations earlier this week .	-5.1449
Instead , the minister pointed out three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the last five months , adding that if the party were South Korea and not the US on this issue of denuclearization , denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have reached such a dead end .	-5.3909
Nonetheless , the tone of Ri ’ s speech was dramatically different from last year ’ s when he reported it to the United States . The General Assembly , which targeted the US mainland with North Korea ’ s missiles , was inevitable after “ Mr. Evil President ” Trump called Kim a “ rocket man ” on a suicide mission .	-5.0813
This year , at the United Nations , Trump , who threatened last year to “ completely destroy ” North Korea , praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm , but he also said that much work still needs to be done , and sanctions must remain in place until North Korea destroyed denuclearization .	-4.8321
On Wednesday , Trump said that he had no time frame for doing so , saying , “ It doesn ’ t matter whether it takes two years , three years , or five months . ”	-3.7539
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken .	-1.4803
However , in the United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday that : ' The enforcement of the Security Council 's sanctions must be continued vigorously and without any deficiencies until we achieve full , definitive and verified denuclearization ' .	-5.9699
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in order to prevent the financing of the Pyongyang nuclear and ballistic missile programmes .	-2.8842
Pompeo met Ri on the edge of the UN General Assembly and then said that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit .	-3.2238
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year , but his last trip was not good .	-2.3792
He left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made , and only a few hours later , North Korea condemned him for “ gangster claims . ”	-5.3411
This month , at a meeting with Moon , North Korea promised to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the United States " takes action " .	-4.6162
He said that Kim told him that the " appropriate measures " he sought were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore , and steps to normalize relations with Washington .	-4.0246
Harvard students take part in the course to find enough rest .	-3.0661
With a new course at Harvard University this year , all students will have more sleep to fight against the growing macho culture of studying coffee intoxicated nights .	-4.4552
A scientist has found that students at a world leading university are often unsuspecting when it comes to helping themselves , even when it comes to very simple mechanisms .	-4.2332
Charles Czeisler , professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women 's Hospital , designed the course , which he considered to be the first of its kind in the US .	-4.0911
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the impact of sleeping shortages on learning .	-3.4900
In the end , a girl came to me and said : " Why is it said to me only now , in my final year ?	-4.1419
She said that you have never told anyone about the meaning of sleep – which surprised me , " he told the telegraph .	-4.1728
The first course this year explains to students how good sleeping habits promote academic and sporting performance and improve their general well-being .	-5.5254
Paul Barreira , professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and managing director of the university ’ s health service , said that the university decided to take the course after finding that students had slept extremely little during the week .	-4.9493
The 1-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks .	-3.2664
In one section there is a picture of a sleeping room where students click on coffee cups , curtains , trainers and books to be informed about the effects of caffeine and light and how the sporting performance is influenced by a lack of sleep and the importance of a sleep time routine .	-6.1251
Another section explains how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack , stroke , depression , and cancer .	-3.1565
A map of the campus with interactive symbols encourages participants to think about their daily lives .	-3.2368
We know that it will not change the behaviour of students immediately .	-2.4766
" But we believe that they have a right to do so , just as you have a right to know the health impact of the decision to smoke cigarettes , " added Prof. Czeisler .	-4.1133
The culture of pride still exists , he said , and added that modern technology and increasing pressure on students and students makes sleeping deprivation a growing problem .	-4.2712
Having good quality sleep should be a student 's " secret weapon " to combat stress , exhaustion and fear , he said - also to avoid accepting it , as sleeping deprivation puts the brain into starvation mode and makes it constantly hungry .	-6.2582
Raymond So , a 19-year-old Californian who studied chemical and physical biology , helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes last year at Harvard .	-3.0083
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to push for a campus course .	-2.7323
The next step , he hopes , is to call on all Doctors to undertake a similar study programme before they enter the university of competition .	-5.5208
Prof. Czeisler recommended the students to set an alarm when they should go to bed and when they should wake up , and to be aware of the harmful effects of the " blue light " broadcast by electronic screens and LED lighting , which can trigger their circular rhythm from the clock , which leads to problems when sleeping .	-7.8852
Livingston 1-0 Rangers : Mengas Goal Erds Gerrard ’ s Men	-2.7368
Rangers ' forward problems : After a match of Dolly Menga , Livingston lost 1-to-0 for the team of Steven Gerrard .	-6.6765
The Ibrox team wanted to record their first victory since the 4 : 1 victory in February in St. Johnstone , but added to Gerrard ’ s second defeat in 18 games , leaving his team eight points behind the disappointed leader Hearts .	-5.8209
Menga landed a hit seven minutes before the midway , and an inspirational Ranger listing did not look like it could strike a balance .	-7.5654
While the Rangers now fall back to sixth place , Livingston climbed to third , only behind Hibernian because of the difference in the goal .	-7.2547
New difficulties for the Rangers are emerging , as regular judges Calum Spence had to be given a headscarf after being hit by a throwing object – apparently thrown out by the sector of race fans .	-9.5894
Gerrard made eight changes to the side , passing by Ayr , and directly entered the semi-final of the Betfred Cup .	-6.1296
Holt , on the other hand , raised the same Livi-Elf , who took the Hearts one point last week , and he should have been thrilled by how his well-trained team never left the opponents room for action .	-6.8461
The Rangers dominated the ball , but Livingston had a better chance .	-5.2320
They should have met after only two minutes , when Menga ’ s first offender , Scott Pittman , sent to Allan McGregor ’ s Gate , but the midfielder had his big change past the gate .	-7.0535
A deep blow from Keaghan Jacobs went to Captain Craig Halkett , but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only shoot far in the direction of the back of .	-4.5553
The Rangers took control , but there seemed to be more hope than screaming into their own game , in the last third .	-3.5681
Alfredo Morelos was clearly of the opinion , after the end of the first quarter of an hour , that he deserved an elf meter after he and Steven Lawless collided , but referee Steven Thomson did not respond to the Colombian appeals .	-6.5307
The Rangers get only two shots in the first half , but the former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was hardly to bring from Lassana Coulibalys head jump and the hit of a bislose ovie Ejaria out of peace .	-6.3309
Although Livi ’ s inaugural meeting in the 34th minute may have been contrary to the course of the game , no one can deny that they deserve it for their efforts alone .	-5.2015
Again , the Rangers failed to master a standard Jacobs situation .	-3.3938
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher Scott Robinson played the ball , keeping the rest and picking Menga for a simple finish .	-4.7264
Gerrard acted during the break when he exchanged Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the change immediately affected the game when the winger played to Morelos , but the impressive Kelly ran from his line to block .	-4.9056
But Livingston always drew guests to play exactly the kind of game they like , with Lithgow and Halkett wrestling long balls after long balls .	-4.8276
Holt ’ s team could have expanded their leadership in the final phase , but McGregor was well placed to refuse Jacobs before Lithgow left the corner .	-5.9237
The Rangers representative Glenn Middleton had another delayed claim to a punishment , as he was hiding with Jacobs , but he saw Thomson look away again .	-6.9236
Almanach : Inventor of the Geiger Counter	-2.0079
And now a page from our Almanach “ Sunday morning ” : September 30 , 1882 , that was more than 136 years ago ... The day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm , called Hans , was born in Germany .	-4.8607
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity , an invention that eventually produced the device known as the violin meter .	-3.7061
The violinist has since become a mainstream of science , as in the 1950s of the film " Bells of Coronado " , which apparently improbable Cowpoke scientist Roy Rogers and Dale Evans stirs up :	-7.0157
Man : ' What about all this in the world ? '	-2.4500
Rogers : “ It is a violin counter used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium .	-3.3954
If you set up these headphones , you can actually hear the effects of the atoms released by radiation in minerals . ”	-4.2788
Evans : “ Say , but now it is cracking ! ”	-4.1853
Hans Geiger died in 1945 , just a few days before his 63rd birthday .	-2.0407

New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to " see " and kill malignant cells .	-2.0043
Vaccine teaches the immune system to detect malignant cells as part of treatment .	-1.8546
The procedure includes extracting immune cells from a patient , changing them in the laboratory .	-4.0107
You can then see a protein that is common to many cancers and then inject it again .	-2.8372
A study vaccine shows promising results in patients with a number of cancers .	-2.8353
A woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to detect rogue cells saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months .	-2.9343
The method consists of extracting immune cells from a patient , changing them in the laboratory , making a protein called HER2 “ visible ” , which occurs in many cancers , and then injecting the cells again .	-4.8018
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda , Maryland said : ' Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine . '	-2.5239
HER2 “ promotes the growth of various types of cancer ” , including breast , ovarian , lung and colorectal cancer , explained Prof. Berzofsky .	-4.1436
A similar approach to taking patients immune cells and teaching them how to attack cancer cells has worked in treating a kind of leukemia .	-3.7950
After his performance at Saturday Night Live , Kanye West , dressed with MAGA hat , left a pro-Trump facade from the pile .	-6.2378
Not Good	-2.4739
Kanye West was picked up in the studio during a Saturday Night Live broadcast after a sweeping speech praising the US . President Donald Trump said that would in 2020 .	-6.4139
After playing his third night song , Ghost Town , while wearing a Make America Great hat , he was anti-Democrats and reaffirmed his support for Trump .	-5.3849
" As often as I speak to a white person , she says , “ How can you like Trump , he is a racist ? ”	-3.4883
Well , if I were concerned about racism , I would have been out of America long ago , " he said .	-3.4690
The Saturday night live show started with a sketch in which Hollywood star Matt Damon made fun of Brett Kavanaugh 's statement to the Senate Judicial Committee on Christine Blasey Ford 's accusations that Kavanaugh had sexually coerced her .	-5.0621
Although it was not broadcast , the film material of Wests Geschlectz was shared by the comedian Chris Rock in the social media .	-5.9633
It is unclear whether Rock has tried to mock West with the post .	-3.1340
West , too , complained to the audience that he had difficulty behind the stage because of his headgear .	-4.7077
" They harassed me behind the stage .	-1.6469
You said : ' Don 't get away with your hat ' .	-4.1204
You annoyed me !	-2.0497
And then they say that I am in an abandoned place , " he said , according to the Washington Examiner .	-2.3159
West continued : " Do you want to see the sunken place ? " and said that he would " put on my Superman cloak , because that means you cannot tell me what to do , you want the world to move forward ?	-4.9069
Try it with love . ”	-1.2276
His comments were received at least twice by the audience with boobs and the comedians of Saturday Night Live seemed to be embarrassed , Variety reported and quoted a person in the words : “ The whole studio was dead style . ”	-6.4022
West was later used as a replacement for the singer Ariana Grande , whose former friend , rapper Mac Miller , died a few days ago .	-5.4040
West surprised many with a performance of the song " I Love it " , dressed as Perrier Bottle .	-2.5096
West received support from the leader of the conservative group TPUSA , Candace Turner , who tweeted : " This is for one of the bravest spirits : DANKE , DASS DU DICH OF MAFIA WIDERSETZT HAST . "	-4.3098
But Talkmaster Karen Hunter twisted that West is simply " what he is , and that 's absolutely wonderful " .	-3.2371

What have we taught men in their youth about the problem we are now seeing ?	-3.4562
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for the rise in toxic masculinity due to its very masculine characters .	-3.2897
He continued : What is innate and what is taught ?	-3.4187
What is taught on television and on the street gives the young boy the feeling that they must have this particular side of being a man ?	-4.3940
I think that is really one of the big questions in our time – how can we change that ?	-3.9152
After all , something has obviously gone wrong for young men .	-3.1243

According to health authorities , 820,000 people are affected in the country .	-2.6284
In the second quarter of 2018 alone , 40,000 new cases were reported .	-1.1802
In the vast majority of new cases , the virus was transmitted through sexual intercourse , which is a change from the past .	-3.6621
Usually , HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions .	-3.1161
But the number of people affected by HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero , Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province .	-3.4950

Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the site was associated with Waters ' Office and published the information of a Waters employee .	-4.1933
“ This unfounded charge is completely wrong and an absolute lie , ” says Waters .	-3.9061
“ The employee of my employees – whose identity , personal information , personal data , and security were compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false claims – was in no way responsible for the fact that this information was read . was . , , , , and , , , and , , , , , , ,	-7.3085
This unsubstantiated claim is completely wrong and an absolute lie .	-4.0516
Waters ’ statement quickly led to criticism online , including by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer .	-4.2357
“ It is extremely annoying that the matter is denied , ” he wrote .	-4.1508
“ This suggests that she is unsuitable as a congress member .	-2.9129
If someone is accused of doing something , he must not be evil .	-3.0179
They must not be rash .	-3.2892
They must not question the motives of the plaintiff .	-1.7802
They must be calm and calm ” .	-3.0464
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters ’ response with the Democrats ’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh , who was accused by critics of appearing too angry during Thursday ’ s hearing .	-4.0339
Omar Navarro , a Republican candidate who runs in midterm elections alongside the sedentless waters , also expressed his thoughts on Twitter .	-5.0157
“ Big , if true , ” he has tweeted .	-4.3550
In her statement , Waters said that her office ' informed the competent authorities and law enforcement authorities of the fraudulent claims .	-3.9970

Review of " Johnny English - Only three lives " - poorly occupied parody with Rowan Atkinson	-5.3934
It is a tradition to look for insinuations in every new film with a British tendency to Brexit , which seems to be applicable to this revival of the Johnny English Action Spoof franchise , which began in 2003 with Johnny English and was re-launched in 2011 with " Johnny English Reborn " .	-6.6358
Is ironic self-satire about the abyss humanity the nation 's new export opportunity ?	-3.7243
In any case , for the second time , the glorious , rubber-looking and incompetent Johnny English has been licensed to remake things .	-6.1939
He is , of course , the stupid secret agent who , despite his bizarre claims to Smoothie-Glamour , got a bit of clouseau , a splinter Mr. Bean and a bell from this guy who contributed a single note to the signaling of the firefighters at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London .	-7.6122
It is also based on the traveller and international , mysterious Atkinson , who once participated in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV shows , leaving behind chaos .	-5.6287
There are one or two beautiful moments in this latest Johnny English comedy .	-2.3807
I loved Johnny English , who is approaching a helicopter in a medieval armor and the main actor beat his helmet .	-5.4546
Atkinson 's talent for body comedy is to be seen , but the humor feels rather weak and strangely superfluous , especially as the " serious " film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible offer self-confident comedy as an ingredient .	-7.7607
The humor feels as though it is directed towards children rather than adults , and for me the crazy misfortunes of Johnny English are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson ’ s Mr. Bean films .	-4.4973
The everlasting premise is that Britain is in great trouble .	-2.9144
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the highly secret British network of spies and revealed the identity of all British agents on the ground , to the horror of the serving agent – a small role , sadly , for Kevin Eldon .	-5.1041
Emma Thompson is doing her best with this quasi-teresa-May-figure , but there is not much in the script you can work with .	-4.5142
Their intelligence advisers tell them that , as every active spy has been compromised , they must take someone out of retirement .	-5.1029
And that means the great pathetic Johnny English himself , who is now employed as a schoolmaster in a noble institution , but gives unsurpassed lessons about how to operate as an Undercover Agent : some nice gags here , while English offers a School of Rock Academy on espionage .	-5.6637
English is returned to Whitehall for an emergency strike and reunited with his former long-suffering Kumpel Bough , played again by Ben Miller .	-4.3789
Bough is now a married man who meets a submarine commander , an outmoded , burschikose role in which Vicki Pepperdine is not fully respected .	-6.1964
So the Batman and Robin des Chaos at Her Majesty 's Secret Service are back in action and meet Olga Kurylenko 's beautiful femme Fatale Ophelia Bulletova .	-2.6680
Meanwhile , the prime minister is dangerously caught by the charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain ’ s computer problems : the sinister Jason Volta , played by Jake Lacy .	-3.6888
English and Bough begin their odyssey of the colourful Highjinks : dressed as waiters , they ignite a French Flash Restaurant ; they create chaos by smuggling themselves on board Volta ’ s luxury yacht ; and English triggers pure anarchy when he tries to familiarize himself with a virtual reality headset with the interior of Volta ’ s house .	-5.4474
All the records have certainly been drawn for this last sequence , but as amicable and abandoned as it is , the whole is reminiscent of children 's television .	-7.5837
Quite moderately .	-2.1716
As with the other Johnny English films , I could not help but think : can the British film industry not give Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice to his talent ?	-4.4939
Labour denies having developed a plan for Britons for a four-day week for which five days are paid .	-3.3418
Jeremy Corbyn ’ s Labour Party is examining a radical plan in which British workers work only four days a week but are paid for five .	-3.7199
According to reports , the Party wants corporate leaders to pass on the savings made by the AI revolution to workers by giving them an extra day .	-4.0806
Staff would enjoy a three-day weekend - but still bring the same money home .	-3.6060
Sources said that the idea would fit with the party 's economic agenda and plans to tilt the country for the benefit of workers .	-3.8591
The trade union congress approved the transition to a four-day week as a way for workers to make use of the changing economy .	-4.8051
A senior Labour source said to the Sunday Times : policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year .	-3.8820
A four-day week is an objective which is in line with the party 's approach to restoring economic balance in favour of workers and the Party 's overall industrial strategy , but this objective will not be realised overnight .	-5.6821
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea , as the Green Party promised a four-day working week during its 2017 election campaign .	-3.1702
At present , however , the whole Labour Party does not support this move .	-4.7467
A Labour spokesman said : ' A four-day week is not party politics and is not intended by the party ' .	-2.9739
Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to flesh out his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy .	-2.9778
Mr McDonnell said that he was determined to regain the power of ' faceless directors ' and ' profiteers ' in utilities .	-2.9412
The shadow Chancellor 's plans also mean that the current shareholders of water companies may not get their full share back , as a Labour government could " withdraw " because of alleged misconduct .	-6.5656
He also confirmed the plans to appoint employees to the management boards and to create inclusive ownership funds to distribute 10 % of the equity capital of private sector companies to employees receiving annual dividends of up to <unk> 500 .	-5.8593
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk in “ 60 Minutes ” about whether the FBI ’ s investigation of Kavanaugh could change their mind .	-2.9394
An ongoing FBI investigation into allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh postponed the final vote on the judge ’ s appointment to the Supreme Court by at least a week , and raises the question of whether the FBI ’ s findings might lead Republican senators to give up their support for Kavanaugh .	-5.8018
In a Sunday interview , Scott Pelley , “ 60 Minutes correspondent , ” asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI ’ s findings might encourage them to change their minds .	-3.9325
Kennedy appeared more open-minded than his South Carolina colleague .	-1.8595
" Anyway , " Kennedy said .	-3.5023
" I said at the beginning of the hearing that I have spoken with Judge Kavanaugh .	-1.7638
I called him after that , after that statement came out , I said : ' Have you done it ? '	-4.5012
He was determined , purposeful , unequivocal . '	-3.2562
Graham 's voice , however , seemed to be carved in stone .	-3.1645
" I have an opinion about Brett Kavanaugh and it would take a bomb attack , " he said .	-3.5184
“ Dr. Ford , I don ’ t know what happened , but I know Brett was vehemently opposed to the charge , ” Graham added with a reference to Christine Blasey Ford .	-4.4090
" No one she called could confirm it .	-2.8780

" What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it ensured that poverty is reduced ? "	-2.6814
This Saturday , the Global Citizen Festival will take place in New York , an annual music event with an impressive selection of stars and an equally impressive mission to end poverty in the world .	-3.8212
At this year ’ s seventh Global Citizen Festival , tens of thousands of people will gather at the Great Lawn in Central Park to experience not only stars like Janet Jackson , Cardi B , and Shawn Mendes , but also to highlight the true goal of the event : ending extreme poverty by 2030 .	-4.0865
The Global Citizen Festival , which took place in 2012 , is an extension of the Global Poverty Project , an international interest group that aims to combat poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it .	-3.8398
In order to get a free ticket to the event , the concert visitors had a whole series of tasks or " actions " , such as voluntary work , an email to a leader in the world , a telephone call or another meaningful way of raising the goal of poverty reduction and raising awareness of it .	-7.2682
But how successful was Global Citizen at the age of 12 to achieve its goal ?	-2.8687
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a real way of persuading people to call for action , or just another case of so-called " clicktivism " - people who feel like sending a tweet by signing an online petition or an online application ? ? ? ? ? . , . , and , , . , . , . , , and , and , , . . , , and . . , . . , . , , and . . . , , and , . , and	-26.6668
Global Citizen says that it has recorded more than 19 million “ actions ” from its supporters since 2011 , pushing for a variety of different goals .	-2.9803
It is said that these actions have motivated world leaders to make more than $ 37 billion in financial and political commitments that will affect the lives of more than $ 2.25 billion by 2030 .	-3.7079
At the beginning of 2018 , the Group launched 390 wagers and announcements from its actions , of which at least $ 10 billion has already been paid or financed .	-5.4152
The group estimates that the funds provided so far have had a direct impact on almost 649 million people around the world .	-3.4790
One of the key commitments is The Power of Nutrition , a UK-based partnership of investors and executive organizations committed to “ helping children to develop their full potential . ” The organization has pledged to help Rwanda end malnutrition in the country at $ 35 million , after Global Cities has received more than $ 4,700 tweets .	-6.0064
“ With support from the British government , donors , other state governments , and global cities like you , we can make the social injustice of malnutrition history one day , ” The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman announced the crowd in a live concert in London in April 2018 .	-4.0951
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions in the United Kingdom aimed at improving maternal and child nutrition , the government will reach the funding of the Power of Nutrition project of 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions .	-4.8299
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on their website , “ Why do you think we can end extreme poverty ? ”	-2.6434
Global citizens responded : it will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will fall and fail .	-3.2291
Like the great civil rights and the anti-apartheid movements before us , we will succeed , because we are more powerful together .	-3.2951
will include the stars Janet Jackson , Weeknd , Shawn Mendes , Cardi B and Janelle Monáe at this year ’ s event in New York , hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman .	-3.6535
US could use the Navy to create a “ blockade ” to impede Russian energy exports – Interior ministers	-4.1298
Washington can use its navy “ if necessary ” to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets , including in the Middle East , US Secretary of State Ryan Zinke is quoted by the Washington Examiner .	-3.7415
Zinke suggested that Russia ’ s involvement in Syria – particularly in activities at the legitimate government ’ s invitation – was a pretext for exploring new energy markets .	-4.9959
“ I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is as follows : they want to negotiate energy as they do in Eastern Europe , the southern part of Europe , ” he said .	-2.9926
And , according to the officials , there are ways to circumvent it .	-3.3584
" The United States has this ability to use our navy to ensure that maritime routes are open and , if necessary , to block them to ensure that their energy does not come onto the market , " he said .	-4.8886
Zinke spoke to the participants of an event of the Consumer Energy Alliance , a non-profit organization that calls itself the “ voice of energy consumers ” in the US .	-3.5623
He compared Washington ’ s approach to Russia and Iran , and found that they are actually the same .	-3.1906
" The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less to use and replace fuels , " he said , while calling Russia a " one-trick pony " with a fossil-fuel-dependent economy .	-3.2435
Opinions come while the Trump administration was on the mission to boost exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe and to replace Russia , the much cheaper option for European consumers .	-3.9302
So members of the Trump administration – including US President Donald Trump himself – are trying to push Germany to stop the “ inadequate ” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project , which , according to Trump , would turn Berlin into Moscow ’ s “ prisoner . ” of , , , , and , , , and , , and , . . of , and . of . , and	-13.2108
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion dollar pipeline Nord Stream 2 , which is supposed to double existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres , is a purely economic project .	-3.3023
The Kremlin argues that Washington ’ s opposition to the project is simply driven for economic reasons and an example of unfair competition .	-2.5905
“ I think we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument for exerting pressure , and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers , ” said Russian energy minister Aleksandr Novak , after a meeting with US energy minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September .	-6.8191
The US stance has provoked a backlash from Germany , which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project .	-3.3295
Germany ’ s leading industrial organization , the Federal Association of German Industries ( BDI ) , has called on the US to refrain from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow .	-3.8452

Warren ’ s criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court ’ s candidate , Brett Kavanaugh , has not spoken out .	-5.5860
In a tweet on Friday , Warren said : ' Of course we need an FBI inquiry before we vote ' .	-3.1232
A poll published on Thursday , however , showed that a majority of Warren ’ s own voters do not believe that they should run in 2020 .	-3.0659

He was arrested and accused of domestic violence on Monday evening .	-2.4520

Palin called his arrest “ the elephant in the room , ” and said about her son and other veterans : “ They come back a little differently , they come back harder , and they wonder whether the work of their fellow soldiers and the air force and all other military members for the country is being respected . ”	-6.7524

18 states and Washington , D.C. support a legal challenge to a new US policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence .	-3.0027
According to NBC News , representatives from the 18 states and the district filed an Amicus Curiae ( Friend of the Court ) on Friday in Washington to assist an asylum seeker in challenging the law .	-4.4293
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace case against Sessions filed in August by the American Civil Liberties Union against the Federal Law is not known .	-2.9260
She said that her partner " and his violent sons of gang members " had abused them , but on July 20 , US officials refused to apply for asylum .	-7.1988
She was arrested in Texas .	-0.7512
The state ’ s lawyers who support Grace called El Salvador , Honduras , and Guatemala , which include a large number of asylum seekers in the US , nations that have deep problems with gangs and domestic violence .	-4.7727
The new US asylum policy has reversed a decision by the 2014 Board of Appeals for Immigrants that undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence can seek asylum .	-4.7535
The District of Columbia Justice Minister Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new law ignored decades of national , federal , and international law .	-4.2008
The Amicus Curiae states that , according to federal law , all applications for asylum must be assessed in accordance with the circumstances of the respective case and that such action is contrary to this principle .	-5.9111
Lawyers continued to argue in the sentence that the policy that denies immigrants entry harms the US economy , because it is more likely that these immigrants become entrepreneurs and “ do necessary work . ”	-4.8167
In June , Attorney General Jeff Sessions instructed immigration judges not to grant asylum to persons fleeing domestic or gang lawyers .	-4.9452
“ Asylum is for those who have to leave their home country for persecution on grounds of race , religion , nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political opinion , ” said Sessions in his Declaration of Law on 11 June .	-5.6252

US ambassador accuses China of bullying with “ propaganda advertising . ”	-3.1368
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page newspaper on the mutual benefit of US-China trade , the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda .	-4.7350
US President Donald Trump referred to the China Daily ’ s paid supplement in the Des Moines Register – the state with Iowa ’ s best-selling newspaper – last Wednesday , after accusing China of meddling in the November 6 congressional elections , which China denies .	-5.3969
US officials claim to Reuters that Trump ’ s charge that Beijing sought to meddle in the US election is a new phase in an escalating Washington campaign to put pressure on China .	-3.2036
While it is normal for foreign states to advertise to promote trade , Beijing and Washington are currently mired in an escalating trade war with several rounds of tariffs on imports .	-4.2958
At an early stage of the trade war , China ’ s retaliatory tariffs , according to Chinese and US experts , were supposed to hit exporters in US states like Iowa , where many supporters of Trump ’ s Republican Party live .	-3.5661
Terry Branstad , US ambassador to China and former Governor of Iowa , a major exporter of agricultural products to China , said that Beijing violated American workers , farmers , and businesses .	-3.3873
China , Branstad wrote in an opinion article in the Des Moines Register on Sunday , “ this bullying is now vigorously using propaganda in our own free press .	-6.3797
“ By spreading propaganda as a paid ad in the Des Moines Register , China ’ s government is exploiting the valued American tradition of freedom of expression and freedom of the press , ” says Branstad .	-4.6347
" By contrast , you will find only limited dissenting voices at the newspaper stand in Beijing ’ s streets , and you will not see any real opposition to different opinions that the Chinese people might have about China ’ s troubling economic development , given that the media are firmly in the grip of the Chinese Communist Party , " he wrote .	-6.9104
He added that " one of China 's most prominent newspapers contradicted the offer to publish , " although he did not say which newspaper .	-3.4000
The Republicans grumble with the Kavanaugh debacle voters against the Midterm elections , warn analysts	-4.7393
Many of the top Republicans defended Brett Kavanaugh , a nominee to the Supreme Court , even though he was accused of sexual assaults , and analysts warn that they will see a backlash , especially from women , in the upcoming elections .	-5.1642
Emotions were high , and most Republicans have already said they want to vote for him .	-2.9882
These things cannot be returned , said Grant Reher , Professor of Political Science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University , on Saturday in an article published by The Hill .	-3.0289
Reher said he doubted that last minute support from Jeff Flake ( Republican MP for the State of Arizona ) for FBI investigations was sufficient to reconcile angry female voters .	-4.7764
“ Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow and not in November , ” said Karine Jean-Pierre , senior consultant and national spokeswoman for the progressive MoveOn group on Friday , as a Washington newspaper reported .	-4.1573
On Friday morning , the protesters sang , “ November comes ! ” while they demonstrated in the Senate ’ s corridors , when the Republicans who control the Judicial Committee decided to continue with Kavanaugh ’ s nomination , despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford ’ s statement .	-5.6790
“ Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be immeasurable , ” said Stu Rothenberg , an impartial political analyst , the journalist .	-2.3839
“ People say that it is quite advanced , that ’ s true .	-4.0325
But the number could be higher , especially among the working-class and younger voters , 18-29 years old , who may not suffer the president , but often do not vote . ”	-6.3922
Even before Ford ’ s public statement , in which she argued her charges of sexual violence against the Supreme Court ’ s candidate , analysts noted that a backlash could follow if Republicans push for the candidacy .	-6.3259
“ For the GOP , this has become a confused mess , ” said Michael Steele , former Chairman of the Republican National Committee at the beginning of last week , according to NBC News .	-3.5325
“ It ’ s not just about the committee election or the final election , or whether Kavanaugh is put on the replacement bank , it ’ s about how the Republicans have handled it and how they treated it , ” said Guy Cecil , Director of the US priorities , a group that helps the Democratic election , the news station .	-7.2654
The Americans , however , are divided over what Ford and Kavanaugh said .	-2.5901
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 % of respondents believed Ford ’ s testimony was definitely or probably believed , while 35 % said that they believed definitely or probably Kavanaugh .	-8.7861
In addition , 38 percent said that they thought Kavanaugh was probably or definitely lying during his statement , while only 30 percent said the same about Ford .	-3.9089
At the initiative of Flake , the FBI is currently investigating the allegations of Ford and of at least another prosecutor , Deborah Ramirez , reported The Guardian .	-3.4624
Ford said last week in front of the Senate Judicial Committee under Eid that Kavanaugh had attacked her drunk at the age of 17 .	-4.2035

The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning a new Internet to challenge Google and Facebook .	-2.5561
Tim Berners-Lee , the inventor of the Internet , is setting up a start-up company to compete with Facebook , Amazon and Google .	-2.9202
The current project of the technology legend , Inrupt , is a company that builds on Berners-Lee ’ s Open Source Solid platform .	-3.7881
Solid allows users to determine where their data is stored and which people can access what information .	-4.0972
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company , Berners-Lee joked that the aim of Inrupt was to take over world domination .	-4.1563
“ We must do it now , ” he said about the startup .	-2.2498
“ It is an historic moment . ”	-1.3773
The App uses Solid technology to help users create their own personal online data storage or POD .	-3.5517
The data storage can contain contact lists , task lists , calendars , music libraries and other personal or professional tools .	-2.4780
It is like Google Drive , Microsoft Outlook , Slack and Spotify all available on a browser and all at the same time .	-1.6577
The special thing about the personal online data storage is that it is entirely up to the user to decide which kind of information is possible .	-4.7465
The company calls it “ people capable of data . ”	-2.9969
According to the CEO of John Bruce , Inrupt will provide resources , processes and relevant know-how to make Solid accessible to a broad audience .	-4.1573
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee , Bruce , a security platform acquired by IBM , some employees involved in the project , and a community of voluntary programmers .	-3.5455
As of this week , technology developers worldwide can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the interrupt website .	-3.5095
Berners-Lee said that neither his team nor he himself will talk to Facebook and Google about the major changes that will upend all previous business models overnight .	-4.1173
“ We will not ask them for permission ” .	-2.3387

Lieutenant Colonel and Reverend Bernard Vann received the award on September 29 , 1918 during the attack in Bellenglise and Lehaucourt .	-4.7878

A memorial stone was unveiled on Saturday at a parade in Rushden , Northamtonshire , by its two grandchildren .	-3.1280
One of his grandsons , Michael Vann , said that it was “ incredibly symbolic ” that the stone was unveiled just 100 years after his grandfather ’ s exploits .	-3.5362
According to the London Gazette , Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion over the Saint-Quentin channel in September 1918 , “ with very dense fog and heavy fire through field guns and machine guns . ”	-8.3369
Later , he stormed to the firing line , leading the line forward with the “ biggest galanterie ” , before moving a field gun with one hand and holding off three times .	-7.3356
Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4 , 1918 – just a month before the end of the war .	-2.9370
Michael Vann , 72 , said his grandfather 's actions were ' something I know I could never do justice to , something that instils humility ' .	-3.5323
After the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band , he and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid down a wreath .	-3.4225
Michael Vann said he felt “ very honoured to participate in the parade , ” adding : “ The bravery of a real hero is reflected in the support he receives from many people . ”	-3.4908
MMA fans woke up all night to see Bellator 206 , instead they got Peppa Pig .	-2.5879
Imagine you stayed awake all night to watch the complete Bellator 206 event , just to avoid seeing the main event .	-4.8992
There were 13 fights on the plan in San Jose , including six major fights and was shown live in the UK on Channel 5 .	-5.1678
At 6 am in the morning , just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other , viewers in the UK were stunned by how the coverage was changed to Peppa Pig .	-6.3923
Some were unimpressed after they remained awake until the early hours of the morning , especially for the fight .	-5.0765
A Twitter fan described the transition to child cartoon as " any sick joke " .	-3.6489
" It is a state regulation that these contents were not suitable at 6 o 'clock in the morning so they had to switch to children 's programmes , " said Dave Schwartz , Bellator Senior Vice President of Marketing and Communication , when he was asked about the transfer .	-5.5310
" Peppa the pig , " yes . "	-2.8586
Bellator ’ s managing director , Scott Coker , said that they will be working on their plans in the future to involve British viewers .	-5.7355
" If I think about the repetition , we will somehow get it , " Cocker said .	-4.0037
“ But it ’ s 6 in the morning on a Sunday there and we ’ ll be able to fix it only on Sunday of our time , Monday of their time .	-4.9124
But we are working on it .	-1.6218
Believe me when it was switched on , a lot was written and the content was all not friendly .	-2.9939
We tried to fix it , we thought it was a technical error .	-2.2340
But that was not , it was a problem for the government .	-2.3460
I can promise you that next time it will not happen .	-2.4735
We will reduce it to five rather than six battles - as we usually do - and we have tried to outperform the fans and have simply gone over .	-4.7507
It is an unfavourable situation . '	-1.6678
Desert Island Discs : Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality .	-2.0131
The Olympic diver Tom Daley says that he grew up with the feeling of being inferior to everyone because of his sexuality - but that gave him the motivation to be a success .	-4.2932
The 24-year-old said that he first became aware at secondary school that “ not everyone is like me . ”	-3.3816
In the first edition of Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 presented by Lauren Laverne , he said that he had spoken publicly about the rights of homosexuals to give others “ hope . ”	-3.9607
He also said that winning the Olympic Games after the birth of his first child would have become less important to him .	-2.9025
The regular presenter of the long-running show , Kristy Young , released several months due to illness .	-3.3187
Daley appeared in Laverne ’ s first program , saying that he felt “ less worth ” than the others , because “ it was not accepted by society to stand on men and women . ”	-6.1321
He said , “ To this day , these feelings of Weniger Wert and Anderssein have given me the strength and strength I needed to be successful . ”	-5.3796
He wanted to prove that he was “ something , ” he said , in order not to disappoint anyone when he felt his sexual orientation .	-4.5708
The two-time bronze medal winner has become a high-profile LGBT activist and used his appearance at this year ’ s Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality .	-4.3342
He said he spoke because he was lucky enough to live openly and without consequences , and because he wanted to give others ' hope ' .	-4.3855
The world champion three times said that he fell in love with a US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black , whom he met in 2013 , which he was very surprised about .	-4.2345
Daley married the Oscar winner , who was 20 years older than him last year , but the age difference was never a problem .	-4.4215
“ If you go through so much in such a young age , ” he first took part in the Olympic Games at 14 , and three years later his father died of cancer , if , according to him , it was difficult to find someone at the same age who experienced similar highs and lows .	-6.7563
The couple was parents of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June , and Daley said his " whole perspective " has changed .	-2.6962
“ Last year everything revolved around winning a gold medal for me , ” he said .	-2.6184
“ But you know what , there are more important things than Olympic gold .	-2.0622
My gold medal is Robbie . ”	-1.0117
His son is named after his father Robert , who died in 2011 at just 40 years after a cancer diagnosis .	-3.4231
Daley said that his father did not accept that he would die , and one of the last things he asked was whether they had their tickets for London 2012 - because he wanted to be in the front row .	-2.8709
“ I could not say to him : <unk> You won ’ t see it sitting in the front row , Dad <unk> , ” he said .	-4.9437
“ I held his hand when his breathing was suspended , and only when he was really no longer breathand dead , I that he was not invincible , ” he said .	-4.7495
The following year , Daley joined the 2012 Olympic Games and won bronze .	-3.1294
“ I had dreamt of it all my life – diving into the water in front of the local audience at the Olympic Games – there is no better feeling , ” he said .	-5.9134

The Weak Mickelson sat on Ryder Cup Saturday at the Bank	-3.4221
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game , but he needs to dramatically improve his shape so that it doesn 't become a sad milestone .	-4.9790
Mickelson , who played for the 12th time at the event , which takes place every two years , was put on the bench by Captain Jim Furyk for the Fourballs and Foursomes on Saturday .	-3.9870
Instead of being , as so often happens for the US , at the heart of what happened , the five-time Major-winner divided his day between fires and exercise rounds on the golf course in the hope of overcoming his low .	-8.2801
Even at the height of his career , the 48-year-old is never the most straight driver and is not suitable for the narrow Le Golf National Square , where the long Rough regularly punishes failures .	-5.2614
In the ninth match on Sunday , Mickelson meets the British-Open Champion Francesco Molinari , who won all four matches this week together with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood .	-5.5942
If Americans lag four points at the start of the 12 single games and have a hot start , Mickelson ’ s match could be absolutely crucial .	-4.7728
Furyk expressed his confidence in his man ; what else was left to him .	-5.0033
" He fully understood the role he had today , gave me a clamp on my back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow , " Furyk said .	-3.6157
“ He has a lot of self-confidence .	-2.0255
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has done so much for these teams in the past , and this week .	-2.2710
I probably did not think he was playing two games .	-3.4156
I had hoped for more , but that is how we felt we had to deal with it .	-5.6266
He wants to be out there , just like everyone else .	-2.0627
So far Nick Faldo holds the record for most matches played at the Ryder Cup , which will break Mickelson on Sunday .	-5.3025
This could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career , which has never fully reached the heights of its individual record .	-5.0717
Mickelson won 18 times , lost 20 times and played seven times in a draw , but Furyk said that his would have been invaluable to the .	-6.1336
" He is funny , he is sarcastic , funny , he loves to entertain people , and he is a great guy he can have in the team room , " he explained .	-3.7361
I think the younger players were also happy to compete with him this week , which was nice to look at . ”	-5.7286
It offers much more than just the game . ”	-1.5121
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a big lead can soon disappear .	-3.4836
Thomas Bjorn , the European captain , knows from experience that a big lead in the individual games of the last day can quickly become an uncomfortable ride at the Ryder Cup .	-4.5330
The Dane debuted in 1997 in Valderrama , where a team trained by Seve Ballesteros had a lead of five points over the Americans , but only reached just over the finish line and won a very thin lead of 14 <unk> to 13 <unk> .	-6.9594
" We remember that we were in the lead in Valderrama ; we had a big lead in Brookline where we lost , and in Valderrama we won but only , " said Bjorn , after he the Class of 2018 , now leading 10-6 in Le Golf National , Friday and yesterday at a 5-3 victory .	-6.5606
The story will show me and everyone in this team that it is not over yet .	-3.2112
You will be absolutely bored tomorrow .	-2.1552
Go out and do the right things .	-1.7633
It is only over when the points are displayed on the table .	-3.7658
Our aim is to win this Cup , and we are focusing on that .	-3.4656
I have always said that I strongly believe in the 12 players in our team , but we are dealing with a strong opponent , the best players in the world . ”	-3.1598
Enthusiastic as his players played on a hard golf course , Björn added : " I would never be too fast .	-4.2833
Tomorrow is also a day .	-1.7937
Tomorrow are the personal appearances , and that is another matter .	-3.7019
It is great to be out there with a partner if things are going well , but if you are out there alone , your skills as a golf player will be tested on the whole .	-5.7125
This is the message you have to convey to the players : get the best out of you tomorrow .	-4.3597
Now you are handing over to your partner and he has to do just like you . ”	-5.9011
In contrast to Björn , the opponent Jim Furyk will strive for his players to perform better on their own than they do as a partner , with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas , who won three out of four points .	-5.7303
Furyk himself experienced such a sensational turn on the final day , when he was part of the winning team in Brookline , now he is one of the losers after the European team accomplished the “ miracle of Medianah ” .	-6.4602
" I remember every damned word , " he said on the question of how Ben Crenshaw , the captain of 1999 , had gathered his players on the way to the last day .	-3.8423
We have 12 important games tomorrow , but you want to start as soon as possible as you saw it in Brookline , in Media close .	-5.2908
Once a dynamic has developed , the high pressure on the middle matches is exerted .	-7.1428
We have built up our assembly accordingly and brought the guys out as we felt , you know , we are trying to create something special tomorrow . ”	-5.7292
Thomas , together with Paul Casey , Justin Rose , Jon Rahm , Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter , the other European in the top positions in the ranking , should lead the backlash against Rory McIlroy in the top game .	-4.7782
I set up this group of guys in this order because I think it covers the whole way , " said Bjorn about his individual selection .	-3.4090
Germany ’ s New Warship ’ s Timetable	-3.3412
The German navy ’ s latest frigate should have been launched as early as 2014 to replace warships of the Cold War era , but , according to local media reports , it will take at least until next year , owing to flawed systems and escalating costs .	-6.7628
The commissioning of the “ Rheinland-Pfalz ” , the flagship ship of the brand-new frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class , has now been postponed to the first half of 2019 , according to the newspaper “ Die Zeit ” , calling for a military spokesman .	-5.4748
The navy should have launched the ships in 2014 , but serious problems after the first delivery were strained by the ambitious project .	-5.4777
The four frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class ordered by the navy in 2007 will replace the older vessels of the Bremen class .	-4.2434
They are expected to have a powerful cannon , a range of anti-aircraft and anti-aircraft missiles , and some stealth technologies , such as reduced radar , infrared and acoustic signatures .	-4.9020
Another important advantage is longer maintenance intervals : the latest frigates should be used for up to two years without starting the home port .	-5.3896
However , the ultra-modern warships that are supposed to enable Germany to project power overseas will already be outdated by the constant delays when they are finally put into service , as the weekly newspaper “ The Time ” notes .	-6.7527
The unfortunate F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German navy officially refused to launch the ship and returned it to the Boatyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg .	-4.4799
This was the first time that the navy returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery .	-3.5609
Little was known about the reasons for the return of the ships ; German media mentioned a number of critical “ software and hardware tools ” that would make the warship useless in combat operations . and were of .	-6.5635
Software defects were particularly important , as the Baden-Württemberg class ships are served by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half of the crew on older brigades in the Bremen-class .	-5.7404
It also turned out that the ship had a considerable overweight , which would limit performance and make future upgrades more difficult for the navy .	-5.3746
It is believed that the 7,000-ton " Rhineland-Palatinate " is twice as heavy as ships of the same class used by the Germans during World War II .	-4.2060
In addition to faulty hardware , the price tag of the entire project - including training of the crew - is also addressed .	-5.1293
Instead of the originally estimated EUR 2.2 billion , the costs now seem to have reached the staggering amount of EUR 3.1 billion ( around $ 3.6 billion ) .	-4.0818
The problems with the latest frigates are particularly important in light of recent warnings that Germany ’ s maritime power is dwindling .	-4.1345
Earlier this year , Hans-Peter Bartels , Chairman of the German Parliament ’ s Defence Committee , admitted that the war fleet is in fact “ operating ships . ”	-4.3401
The official said that the problem grew in a latin-like manner over time , because old ships were put out of service without any replacement .	-7.0735
He complained that none of the Baden-Württemberg regattas were put in service by the navy .	-3.1056
The National Trust besieged the secret life of bats .	-1.6058
New research on a property in the Highlands of Scotland is trying to find out how bats use the landscape to find food .	-5.1773
It is hoped that this will provide new insights into the behaviour of the unique flying mammals that can guide future measures to protect animals .	-5.3212
The study by scientists of the National Trust for Scotland will be common and soprano pistols as well as brown long-eared and DaubBurton bats in the Inverewe Gardens in Westerner Ross .	-5.2408
Special recording devices are placed at the main points of the accommodation to follow bats throughout the year .	-5.4591
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys with hand detectors .	-2.4969
An expert sound analysis of all recordings determines the frequency of bat calls and assigns calls to species .	-4.8193
The habitat map to be drawn up and the corresponding report should provide a detailed overview of the behaviour .	-4.8578
Rob Dewar , National Trust for Scotland ( NTS ) , hopes to find out which areas of habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by their species .	-4.8474
This information will help to identify the benefits of habitat management , such as how meadow formation and how forests for bats and other related species are best preserved .	-5.1018
In Scotland and the UK as a whole , bats have declined sharply over the past hundred years .	-5.0369
They are threatened by construction works that affect their sleeping places and the loss of living space .	-3.3622
Wind power plants and lighting can also pose a risk , as well as fly catchers and some chemical treatments of building materials .	-5.2657
The bats are not blind .	-2.8372
Depending on their nocturnal hunting activities , their ears are more useful than their eyes .	-4.2978
They use a sophisticated echo tracking technique to locate errors and obstacles in their route .	-4.5333
The NTS , which is responsible for managing more than 270 historic buildings , 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country , takes the bats very seriously .	-3.0866
There are ten trained experts who regularly carry out surveys , inspect sleeping spots and sometimes also carry out rescues .	-5.1795
The organization has even set up Scotland ’ s first and only dedicated bat reserve in the Threade estate in Dumfries and Galloway , home to eight of Scotland ’ s ten bat species .	-4.2423
According to David Thompson , the property is an ideal habitat for them :	-2.9801
“ Here in Threave we have a great area for bats . ”	-2.5564
" We have the old buildings , many old trees and all the good living space .	-2.4411
But there is still much unknown about bats and the work we do here and on other plots helps us to understand better what they need to live . ”	-3.6076
He stresses that it is important to check whether bats are there before maintenance work in buildings ; according to him , it is possible that the accidental destruction of a single sleeping place may kill up to 400 females and young people – a whole local population may be wiped out .	-7.4103
Fledermice are protected ; it is forbidden to kill , harass or disturb them and destroy their sleeping places .	-3.8787
Elisabeth Ferrell , Scottish employee of the Bat Conservation Trust , has encouraged the public to help .	-1.9145
She said , “ We still have much to learn about our bats , and for many of our species we simply do not know how their populations are . ”	-2.5554
Ronaldo rejects rape claims when lawyers sued the German magazine	-2.9687
Cristiano Ronaldo branded rape claims against him as " fake news " and claims that people " want to promote themselves " by using his name .	-2.9727
His lawyers will sue the German news magazine “ Der Spiegel ” , which published the allegations .	-2.8952
The Portuguese and Juventus striker was accused of raped an American named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009 .	-3.5190
He is said to have paid her $ 375,000 to keep quiet about the incident , The Mirror reported on Friday .	-10.0954
Hours after the allegations were reported , Ronaldo , 33 in an Instagram live video to his 142 million followers , rejected the reports as “ fake news . ”	-3.6748
No , no , no , no .	-0.9347
What they say today , fake news , ” said the five-time Ballon D 'Or winner in the camera .	-3.1831
“ You want to apply yourself by using my name .	-2.2351
“ That is normal .	-1.4973
They want to draw attention to themselves when they say my name , but it is part of the job .	-2.6392
I am a happy person , and everything is good , ” added the player smiling .	-2.7510
Ronaldo ’ s lawyers are suing “ Der Spiegel ” because of the allegations ; according to Reuters , you spoke of “ an inadmissible reporting of private suspicions . ”	-6.2649
Attorney Christian Schertz said that the player will demand compensation for “ immaterial damage equal to the severity of the violation , which is probably one of the most serious violations of personality rights in recent years . ”	-4.4361
The alleged incident was reported to have taken place in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in June 2009 .	-3.2054
According to documentation submitted to the Clark County District Court in the state of Nevada , Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player ’ s room at a nightclub , where he raped her anal .	-9.3593
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo had fallen to his knees after the alleged incident , saying that he was “ 99 % ” a “ good guy ” who was let down by the “ 1 % . ”	-4.6463
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex , but it was consensual .	-1.4969
Mayorga also claims that she had gone to the police and had photos of her injuries in a hospital , but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was " afraid of retaliation " and worried about " being humiliated publicly " .	-5.7928
The 34-year-old says that she is now trying to invalidate the agreement because it is still traumatised by the alleged incident .	-4.1589
Ronaldo was on the verge of his change to Manchester United Real Madrid at the time of the alleged attack and moved to the Italian giant Juve this summer with a € 100 million deal .	-6.1916
Brexit : The UK of Los	-6.7478
“ The UK would regret it for life if it lost its position as the world ’ s leading automobile manufacturer after Brexit , ” said Economics Minister Greg Clark .	-4.4535
He added that it is ' worrying ' that Toyota UK told the BBC that they would temporarily stop production at their plant in Burnaston , near Derby , if Britannia left the EU without a deal .	-4.4439
“ We need an agreement , ” Clark said .	-0.9808
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the effects of border delays in the event of no-deal Brexit could cost jobs .	-3.7727
The Burnaston plant , which produces the Auris and Avensis brands for Toyota , produced nearly 150,000 cars last year , 90 % of which were exported to the rest of the European Union .	-2.9858
“ If Britain leaves the EU at the end of March without an agreement , I think we will see production stops in our plant , ” said Marvin Cooke , CEO of Toyota in Burnaston .	-4.5190
Other British car manufacturers have expressed concerns about leaving the EU without agreement on the modalities of cross-border trade , including Honda , BMW and Jaguar Land Rover .	-3.2361
For example , BMW has already announced that it will close its Oxford plant for a month after Brexit .	-2.9107
The main concerns relate to what automobile manufacturers say about the risks of the supply chain in the event of no deal Brexit .	-3.9127
Toyota ’ s production facilities are based on needs-oriented manufacturing , which means that the parts are delivered every 37 minutes by UK and EU suppliers for special production .	-5.7710
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March , there may be delays at the border which , according to industry data , may lead to supply shortages and partial shortages .	-4.4626
It would be impossible for Toyota to hold more than one day of stock at its Derbyshire plant , said the company , and so production would be stopped .	-3.3266
Mr Clark said that Theresa May ’ s Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is “ precisely calibrated to avoid border controls . ”	-3.1073
We must have a deal , and we want the best deal , which not only allows us to achieve the present success , we also want to seize this opportunity , ” he said to the BBC Radio 4 programme today .	-6.1638
“ The suggestion not only from Toyota , but also from other manufacturers , is that we must be able to continue with what has become a very successful series of supply chains ” .	-4.9255
Toyota did not provide any information on how long production could last , but warned that , in the long run , the increase in costs would hurt the factory ’ s competitiveness and eventually lose jobs .	-7.4485
Peter Tsouvallaris , trade union representative , who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years , said that union members are increasingly worried : “ In my experience , once they have been dismantled , jobs are lost forever . ”	-5.3443
A government spokesman said : ' We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU ' .	-3.2577
Trump ’ s Rosenstein meeting could be postponed , the White House says .	-3.5751
Donald Trump ’ s high-profile meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “ postponed another week , ” as the battle for Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues , the White House reported on Sunday .	-4.6617
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller , who examines Russia ’ s electoral interventions , Trump ’ s ties with Russia , and the president ’ s possible obstruction of justice .	-3.8437
Whether or not Trump will fire the Deputy Attorney General , and thus jeopardize Müller ’ s independence , Washington has had a lot of gossip for months .	-5.1096
Earlier this month , the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wearing a cable to record talks with Trump and make it possible to remove the president from the 25th constitutional amendment .	-3.3832
Rosenstein rejected an opinion .	-1.5324
But last Monday he went to the White House , while reports hailed that he was about to resign .	-3.5407
Instead , a meeting with Trump , then at the United Nations in New York , was announced for Thursday .	-5.6703
Trump said that he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein , but then the meeting was delayed in order to avoid a clash with the Senate Judicial Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women , Dr. Christine Blasey Ford , who accused him of sexual malpractice , had sat .	-4.7187
On Friday , Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into claims against Kavanaugh , and continued to delay full Senate votes .	-3.3892
Donald Trump ’ s press secretary , Sarah Sanders , was on Fox News on Sunday . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-4.4007
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting , she said : " A date has not yet been set , it could be this week , I could see that I went back another week , given all the other things that go before the Supreme Court .	-5.8988
But we will see and I always keep the press up to date ' .	-4.7616
Some reporters would challenge this claim : Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10 .	-2.3269
The guest Chris Wallace asked why .	-0.9359
Sanders said that the lack of briefings was not due to an aversion to television reporters who behave like self-performers , but she also said : ' I will not be against them standing in the gallery ' .	-5.3729
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase .	-2.5131
'The President gives more questions and answers than any president before him ' , she said and added , without any evidence , ' We have looked at these figures ' .	-5.0828
Briefings will still take place , Sanders said , but if the press has the chance to ask the President of the United States the questions directly , that is infinitely better than talking to her .	-4.8476
We are trying to do a lot of that , and you have seen how we have done it in recent weeks , and it will replace a press conference if you can speak to the President of the United States itself . ”	-5.0855
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House , or participates in public meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries .	-6.9126
Press conferences with one person are rare .	-0.8085
In New York this week , the president perhaps showed why , by making a free-running and sometimes bizarre appearance in front of assembled reporters .	-4.7740
Brexit Fears : Letter by Health Minister to EU Workers in NHS Scotland	-3.5919
The Minister for Health has written EU staff in Scotland ’ s NHS to express the country ’ s gratitude and the desire to remain after Brexit .	-4.2847
Scottish MP Jane Freeman wrote her letter less than 6 months before Britain left the EU .	-3.0809
The Scottish Government has agreed to cover the costs of the agreed status applications for EU citizens working in their decentralised public service .	-3.7068
In her letter , Mrs Freeman wrote : ‘ During the summer , the negotiations between the UK and the EU on leaving continued , drawing attention to anticipated decisions in the autumn .	-5.6448
But the British government has also intensified its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario .	-2.6441
I know that this must be a very worrying time for all of you .	-2.1809

“ He came to the side line and simply collapsed somehow , ” said Reed .	-3.7387
Trainers and medical staff provided oxygen to Abercrombie on the side line before being placed on a stretcher and taken along for further investigation .	-5.5257

Foreign buyers are charged with a higher stamp tax rate when buying property in the UK - the additional money will be used for homeless people , Theresa May announces today .	-5.7693
This move is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn ’ s effort to attract young voters with promises to offer more affordable housing and seek high incomes .	-3.6060
The stamp fee is levied on people and businesses that do not pay taxes in the UK , and the additional money will help the government fight homelessness .	-4.5803
The premium - which is raised in addition to the current stamp tax , including the higher rates introduced two years ago for second home and rental - could be up to 3 % .	-6.3219
The Ministry of Finance expects an increase of <unk> 120 million per year .	-3.0137
About 13 % of the new buildings in London are acquired by non-UK buyers , driving up prices , making it difficult for first-time buyers to buy property .	-4.8791

The new policy comes only a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a stamp tax cut to help more young people to own their first home .	-4.4552
He accused large construction companies of keeping home prices high by buying cheap land but not cultivating it , and asked Mrs May to abolish affordable housing quotas in order to end the UK ’ s housing mess .	-7.8627
Mr Corbyn has announced a concise series of proposed housing reforms , including rental controls and the termination of non-debt clearing .	-5.0467

Jack Ross : “ My ultimate goal is to manage Scotland . ”	-1.0127
Jack Ross , currently manager of Sunderland , says that his “ ultimate goal ” is to become a Scottish manager at some point .	-3.8113
The Scot , 42 , is facing the challenge of bringing the North-East Club up again .	-5.3709
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer , having led St Mirren back to the Scottish first league last season .	-4.2247
“ I wanted to play for my country as a player . ”	-2.4914
I got a B-cap and that 's what it was , " said Ross on BBC Scotland 's Sportsound .	-3.9918
" But I have often observed Scotland at Hampden with my father as a child , and it is always something that has brought me back .	-3.0174
" This chance would only come if I were successful in club management . "	-4.3061
In front of Ross were Dick Advocaat , David Moyes , Sam Allardyce , Martin O 'Neill , Roy Keane , Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio Manager of Sunderland .	-4.6869
The former manager of Alloa Athletic says that he was not afraid to follow in the footsteps of these established managers in such a big club .	-5.3550
" The success for me is currently defined by the question " Can I bring this club back to the Premier League ? "	-3.2774
With its structure and facilities , this club undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League , ” he said .	-2.9470
" Creating it there is no easy task , but I would probably only see myself as successful if I could bring the club back there . "	-5.2064
Ross is only three years in his management career , after a time as co-trainer at Dumbarton and a 15-month spell for Hearts ' coaching staff .	-3.3457
He then helped Alloa to recover from the release to the third class , and made St. Mirren a master title from the release in the following season .	-5.4448
Ross also says that he never felt as comfortable as he was at the moment during his career at Clyde , Hartlepool , Falkirk , St Mirren and Hamilton Academic .	-5.4973
" It was probably a real crossroads , " he remembered when he took over the leadership of Alloa .	-3.3607
" I really thought that the position as manager is right for me , more than that of a player .	-4.0683

The summer heat wave has increased revenue for the battered British pubs , but has increased pressure on the restaurant chains .	-3.7269
Pub and bar groups experienced an increase in sales of 2.7 percent in July - but the income in restaurants decreased 4.8 percent , according to the figures .	-5.2227
Peter Martin , from the CGA management consultancy , who compiled the figures , said : " Sustained sunshine and England 's continued participation in the World Cup longer than expected , led to July following a similar pattern as in June last year , when the pub visits increased by 2.8 percent , only that the restaurants were even more affected .	-8.1925
The 1.8 % decline in catering business in June only worsened in July .	-4.3379
Drink-dominated pubs and bars were by far the strongest , with the Like-for-Like numbers rising more than the restaurants fell .	-8.4980
The pubs dominated by food also suffered under the sun , though not as dramatic as the restaurant operators .	-3.9361
It seems that people just wanted to go out for a drink .	-2.5727
In the managed pubs and bars , sales for drinks increased by 6.6 % this month , while food fell by 3 % . '	-6.3989
Paul Newman , an RSM analyst for leisure and hospitality , said : " These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April .	-3.1122
The weather and the effects of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to selling outside the home market .	-4.0857
It is not surprising that the restaurant groups are still under pressure , although a 4.8 % decline in sales compared to the previous year will be particularly painful , along with ongoing cost pressures .	-5.8809
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food operators , and time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will provide the much-needed break .	-5.0448

Milk pump advertising , comparing mothers with cows , has led to controversial online discussions .	-3.4787
A dairy pump company has caused controversial online discussions , owing to an ad comparing breastfeeding mothers to milking cows .	-4.5122
On the occasion of the launch of the allegedly " world 's first silent and portable milk pump " , the consumer-driven company Elvie published an ironic advertising inspired by music videos to show what freedoms mothers are offered with this new pump .	-5.0640
Four real mothers dance in a haystack in the middle of cows to a number with the following lyrics : " Yes , I melk myself , but you see no tail " and " If you did not notice that it is not a udder , it is my breasts . "	-7.5829
The slogan goes on : ' pump off , pump off , I feed the babies , pump off , pump off , pump off , I milk my ladies ' .	-4.1177
However , the ad published on the company 's Facebook page has caused online controversy .	-4.3844
With 77,000 calls and hundreds of comments , the video has received mixed reactions from viewers , many of whom say that it highlights the " horrors " of the dairy industry .	-3.6354
'It is a very bad decision to advertise this product with cows ' .	-2.6757
Like we must also become pregnant and give birth to produce milk , except that their babies are taken away from them within a few days after birth , " wrote a person .	-4.4435
The Elvie milk pump unobtrusively fits into a still bra ( Elvie / Mother ) .	-3.6547
Another commented : " Understandably traumatic for mother and baby .	-1.6003
But yes , why should we not use them to promote a milk pump for mothers who can keep their babies ?	-3.2822
Someone else added : ' This is an outsider rating ' .	-4.4737
Others defended the advertisement , including a woman who confessed that she found the song “ funny ” .	-4.9737
I think that is a great idea .	-1.4421
I would have got one if I had been breastfed .	-3.5818
By pumping I felt like a cow .	-3.5282
The ad is a bit crazy , but I took it as what it was .	-2.2937
This is a brilliant product , " wrote a person .	-2.3283
Another commented : ' This is a funny advertisement for mothers who are pumping ( often at their workplaces or toilets ) and feel like ' cows ' .	-5.1907
This is not an advertising that the dairy industry praises or assesses . '	-3.2086
At the end of the video the group of women reveals that they all danced with the decent pumps in their shoes .	-4.8696
The concept of the campaign is based on the recognition that many women pumping milk say that they feel like cows .	-3.2047
The Elvie Pump , however , is completely silent , has no wires or hoses , and unobtrusive fits in a still bra , giving women the freedom to move , keep their babies and even go out of pumps .	-6.1734
Ana Balarin , partner and ECD at Mother commented : " The Elvie-Pump is such a revolutionary product that deserves a bold and provocative introduction to the market .	-4.3066
By drawing a parallel between the expression of women and dairy cows , we wanted to focus on breast pumps and all its challenges while , in an entertaining and comparable way , demonstrating the incredible feeling of freedom that the new pump will bring .	-4.2507
This is not the first time that the Elvie-Pump has hit the headlines .	-3.4965

Hundreds of migrant children moved quietly into a tent camp on the Texan border .	-3.1063
The number of migrant children in prison rose , though the monthly border crossings remained relatively unchanged , partly because the Trump administration ’ s hard rhetoric and policies made it harder to find sponsors for children .	-4.2129
Traditionally , most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves , and fear that they will risk being expelled from the country when they fight for a child .	-4.4772
The risk increased in June , when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members would have to fingerprint their households , and that the data would be passed on to immigration authorities .	-4.2306
Last week , Matthew Albence , a senior official within the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Authority , testified to the Congress that the Agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to support unaccompanied minors .	-6.7276
The agency later confirmed that 70 % of those arrested had no previous criminal records .	-2.7609
" Almost 80 % of people who are either sponsors or household members of sponsors are illegal here in the country , and a large part of them are criminal aliens .	-4.1297
" We are continuing to pursue these people , " Albence said .	-3.6366
In an effort to process applications for children more quickly , officials introduced new rules that require some of them to appear in court within a month of imprisonment , and not after 60 days , which was the previous standard , according to the accommodation staff .	-5.9516
Many will not appear personally , but via a video telephone conference to plead for legal status with an immigration judge .	-5.0554
Those who are not eligible for discharge are quickly deported .	-2.6210
The longer children remain in prison , the more likely they are to be scared or depressed , which can lead to violent outbreaks or escape attempts .	-4.2519
Advocates have said that these concerns are being reinforced in a larger institution like Tornillo , where signs of a child ’ s struggle are more likely to be overlooked because of their size .	-5.7291
They added that moving children to the tent city without having enough time to prepare them emotionally or leave friends could make a trauma that many are already struggling with .	-4.9994
Syria calls on US , French , and Turkish “ occupation forces ” to withdraw immediately .	-2.7416
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called before the UN General Assembly for Syrian refugees to return home , even though the war in the country has now lasted for eight years .	-3.4981
Moualem , who is also Deputy Prime Minister , said that foreign forces are illegal on Syrian soil under the pretext of combating terrorism , and “ they will deal with it accordingly . ”	-5.1305
“ You must immediately withdraw unconditionally , ” he said to the Assembly .	-2.4549
Moualem argued hard and firm that the “ war on terror is almost over in Syria . ” More than 360,000 people have died in the country since 2011 , and millions more have been displaced from their homes .	-5.0001
He said that Damascus will continue to “ fight this holy battle until we have liberated all Syrian territories ” from both terrorist groups and “ any illegal foreign presence forces . ”	-3.3898
The US has around 2,000 soldiers in Syria ; most of them train and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad .	-4.0243
France has deployed more than 1,000 ground soldiers in the war-torn country .	-3.2501
On the question of refugees , Moualem said that the conditions for return were in order , and he accused “ some Western countries of inciting irrational fears ” that led refugees to stay away .	-5.5169
“ We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate their return , ” says Moualem .	-2.8724
“ You are politicizing a purely humanitarian issue . ”	-2.8307
The US and the European Union pointed out that there could only be reconstruction aid for Syria if there was a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to an end to the war .	-4.3315
UN diplomats have said that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib ’ s last major rebel stronghold provides an opportunity to advance political talks .	-4.8318
The Russian-Turkish deal prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian troops on the province where three million people live .	-2.8800
Moualem , however , stressed that the agreement was “ clear deadlines , ” hoping that the military intervention will be directed against jihadists , including those from the Nusra Front connected with al-Qaeda , who are “ wiped out . ”	-7.2756
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections .	-3.6856
Moualem called conditions for the Syrian government ’ s participation in the committee : he said that the body ’ s work should be limited to “ checking the articles in the current constitution , ” and warned against interference .	-4.2230

External money flows into the worst midterm elections to the House of Commons	-7.2417
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania ’ s 17 June saw a flood of cash , thanks to a rebalancing of a congressional district that two incumbents reached in a race for the same seat .	-6.0057
For this new district in the suburb of Pittsburg , the Democrat Conor Lamb – who won a seat in another district in a special election last spring .	-3.9691
Lamb is opposed to another incumbent , the Republican Keith Rothfus , who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania , which clearly overlap with the new 17th district .	-4.6895
The cards were rebuffed after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January decided that the old districts were unconstitutional rigged in the sense of the Republicans .	-4.5718
The race in the new 17th has triggered a campaign finance exchange between the major party finance groups , the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee ( DCC ) and the National Republican Campaign Committee ( NRCC ) .	-3.9437

The Rangers are the host for Rapid Wien on Thursday , knowing that the victory over the Austrians , after the impressive match in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month , puts them in a strong position to qualify for the European League from Group G .	-4.6864
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance in the season until 2 : 2 draw against Villarreal , but he believes that the Rangers can use this result as a springboard for larger things .	-6.0261
“ This was a good point for us , because Villarreal is a capable team , ” said the 31-year-old .	-3.0304
“ We went into play in the belief that we can achieve something and took one point with us .	-4.7186
Perhaps we could have let it go in the end , but all in all , a draw was probably a fair result .	-4.2270
They were probably better in the first half and we mobilized in the second half and were the better side .	-1.6719
On Thursday there will be another great European evening .	-3.0490
Hopefully we can get three points , but that will be a tough game because they had a good result in their last game , but with the amount behind us , I am sure that we will make progress and achieve a positive result .	-4.8138

Federal Attorney Calls for the Rare Death Penalty for the NYC Terrorist Attack	-4.1073
Attorneys in New York call for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov , suspected of the terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people – a rare punishment that has not been carried out in the federal state since 1953 .	-4.1591
Saipov , 30 , allegedly used a Home Depot car in October for his attack on a cycle path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan , where he devised a pedestrian and cyclist path .	-5.6995
To justify a death sentence , prosecutors must prove that Saipov has “ intentionally ” killed the eight victims and inflicted “ intentional ” serious physical injuries , according to the memorandum of understanding in the southern district of New York to apply for the death penalty .	-5.8044
According to court records , both charges may be confiscated with death .	-4.3292
Weeks after the attack , a jury of German chancellors sued Saipov on 22 points , including eight charges for murder in connection with protection money blackmail , typically used by federal lawyers in cases of organised crime , and a charge for violence and the destruction of cars .	-6.6974
The attack required " substantial planning and precaution , " the prosecutors said , describing the way Saipov did it as " disgusting , cruel and spoiled . "	-5.1365
“ Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has done damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini , Nicholas Cleves , Ann-Laure Decud , Darren Drake , Ariel Erlij , Hernan Ferruchi , Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco Unheil , ” says the memorandum of understanding .	-3.8270
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina .	-0.9351

He demanded that the ISIS flag be placed in his hospital room , said the police .	-3.3058
He pleaded on innocent to the 22 charges .	-1.9538
David Patton , one of the Bundes 's duty defenders , representing Saipov , said that he was ' obviously disappointed ' by the decision of the Public Prosecutor .	-4.7226
" We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty , instead of accepting a debt to life in prison without the possibility of release , will only prolong the trauma of these events for all concerned , " said Patton .	-5.3763
The Saipov Defense Team had previously asked prosecutors not to demand the death penalty .	-2.2997

Rowlett said he received location data from several phones that showed that Tellis was on the evening of her death with Chambers , which contradicted his earlier claims , The Clarion Ledger reported .	-3.8180
The analysis of the data on Chambers mobile had revealed that he was in the company of his friend Michael Sanford , and Sanford was interrogated by the police .	-5.8589
Sanford said on Saturday and said that he was not in the city on that day .	-3.1969
When asked the prosecutors whether Tellis had spent the night in Sanford ’ s truck , he replied that he lied because his truck was in Nashville at that time .	-3.7887
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said that he knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died .	-2.5595
According to mobile phone recordings , they only knew each other for a week .	-3.7825

A nanny from New York sues a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a letter from the mother not intended for her , who complained that she was " another black person " .	-5.3426
The couple denies that they are racist and considers the case to be ' blackmail ' .	-7.4325
Lynsey Plasco Flaxman , a mother of two children , was dismayed when she found that her new child care , Giselle Maurice , was black when she arrived at her first working day in 2016 .	-4.1775
Mrs Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a short message : " Neiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii	-2.9374
Instead of sending him to her husband , she sent him twice to Mrs Maurice .	-2.2673
Having noticed her father , a " inconvenient " Plasco-Flaxman dismissed Mrs. Maurice and explained that her outgoing nanny , who was Afro-American , had done a bad job and that she wanted to hire a Filipino instead , according to the New York Post .	-6.3155
Mrs Maurice was paid for her work on one day and then sent home for a Uber .	-3.2338
Now , Maurice is suing the couple for compensation for dismissal and demanding compensation of $ 350 a day for the six-month full-time job for which it was originally hired , albeit without a contract .	-5.5049
" I want to show them , they look , they don 't do anything , " she said to the post on Friday , adding , " I know that this is discrimination . "	-4.9657
The couple opposed the claims , and said that ending Maurice ’ s employment relationship was reasonable and that they acted for fear because they could not trust her after offending her .	-4.8374
" My wife had sent her something she didn 't want to say .	-4.4132
It is not racist .	-0.4919

Paddington ’ s publishers feared that readers could not identify with a talking bear , revealing a new letter .	-3.2649
Bond ’ s daughter Karen Jankel , born shortly after the acceptance of the book , said about the letter : It ’ s hard to get in a position for someone to read it for the first time before publication .	-5.0658
“ It ’ s very amusing – now that we know about Paddington ’ s great success . ”	-4.2311
She said that her father , who had previously worked as BBC cameraman and was inspired to write a children ’ s book from a small toy bear , would have remained optimistic if his work had been rejected , adding that the 60th anniversary of the book publication was “ bittersweet ” after his death last year .	-4.8497
On Paddington , whom she calls “ a very important family member , ” she says that her father was still proud of his ultimate success .	-4.7658
" He was a rather quiet man , and he was not a bostache person , " she said .	-3.3495
" But because Paddington was so genuine for him , it was almost as if you had a child that achieved something : you are proud of the child , although it is not really your doing .	-5.5362
I think he saw Paddington ’ s success a little like that .	-3.6343
Although it was his creation and imagination , he always paid tribute to Paddington . ”	-3.7262
My daughter died and I had to leave the phone .	-2.0654
When they landed , their daughter had been brought to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice , where doctors tried in vain to save their lives .	-4.1256
" Nad called regularly to say that it was really bad that she probably did not do it , " said Ms Ednan-Laperouse .	-5.5307

The medicine , which had given her anger to pump her heart further , slowly descended and left her body .	-6.1487
She had died some time before and that brought everything to a halt .	-3.3634

Shaping Women on Bridge Postcards to Prevent Suicide	-4.7451
Two women who have lost a loved one by suicide want to prevent others from taking their lives .	-3.0503
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring news and phone numbers that people can call if you need assistance .	-3.7588
Ms Davis 's son Tyler was 13 years old when he suffered from depression and at the age of 18 he was killed .	-4.0312
“ I want no parent to feel as I do every day , ” she said .	-2.7957
Mrs. Davis , 45 years old and from Lyney , described her son as a promising cook with contagious smile .	-3.3864
" He was known for his smile .	-1.7321
Everyone always said that his smile lit every room . ”	-3.8750
But he had abandoned his job before his death , because he was “ mentally very badly off . ”	-4.3265
In 2014 , Tyler , who was 11 years old , found his brother after taking his life .	-2.8585
Mrs Davis said : ‘ I am constantly concerned that this could have a domino effect . ’	-3.1368
Mrs Davis has designed the cards ‘ to let people know that there is someone they can talk to , even if it is only a friend ’ .	-4.5814
Do not sit still - you have to talk . '	-3.0408
Mrs Humphrey , who has been a friend of Mrs Davies for years , has lost her partner Mark , with whom she had been together for 15 years , and his mother had died just before .	-5.5411

The FBI investigation has begun , and Brett Kavanaugh ’ s future is at stake .	-2.0884
“ I thought that if we could actually get something like what he asked for – an investigation that is limited in time and scope – we could perhaps reach a little agreement , ” Mr Flake said on Saturday , adding that he fear that the committee “ falls apart ” in the midst of a deep-rooted party political blockade .	-7.5895
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate ?	-1.5436
Their reluctance is simply due to timing .	-2.2159
It is only five weeks before the midterm elections , and on November 6 , if Republicans do badly , as expected , they will be severely weakened in an attempt to advance the man who wants to go to the country ’ s highest court .	-6.5470
George W. Bush phoned with senators to persuade them to support Mr Kavanaugh , who had worked for Mr Bush in the White House and met through him his wife Ashley , who was Mr Bush 's personal secretary .	-3.7784
What happens after the publication of the FBI report ?	-1.4558
The Senate , which currently holds 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats , will vote .	-1.9979
It remains unclear whether Brett Kavanaugh can win at least 50 Senate votes .	-9.1918
The number of North Korea ’ s Republicans has fallen under Kim	-4.5639
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago , a South Korean MP said .	-3.3561
According to data from the South Ministry of Unity , Park Byeong-seig stated that there were 1,127 trustees last year – compared to 2,706 in 2011 .	-5.7858
Park said that tighter border controls between North Korea and China and an increase in prices for human traffickers play a key role in this .	-4.0592
Pyongyang has not spoken publicly .	-2.0366
The majority of refugees from North Korea are finally granted South Korean citizenship .	-3.4079
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953 .	-1.7151
Most are fleeing China , which has the longest border with North Korea , which is easier to cross than the tightly guarded demilitarized zone between North and South Korea .	-2.9885
China regards the survivors as illegal migrants , not refugees , and often forcibly returns them .	-3.6888
Relations between the North and the South , which are formally still at war , have improved significantly in recent months .	-2.7583
Earlier this month , leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the stalled negotiations on denuclearization .	-3.0373
This happened after the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore , when they largely agreed on the nuclear-free Korean Peninsula .	-3.7149
But on Saturday , North Korea ’ s foreign minister , Ri Yong-ho , blamed the US for the lack of progress since then .	-2.5111

Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh hysterical and says that he is unsuitable for Supreme Court service .	-2.9222
The leader of the minority democratic group , Nancy Pelosi , called Brett Kavanaugh , the nominee for a Supreme Court seat “ hysterical , ” saying that he was temperamental to serving at the Supreme Court .	-4.4758
Pelosi made the comments at an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin , Texas .	-1.3265
“ I could not but think that if a woman had ever behaved that way , she would have called it “ hysterical , ” Pelosi said about her response to Kavanaugh ’ s statement before the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday .	-4.5768
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the claims that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both young .	-4.8151
During his opening speech , Kavanaugh was very emotional , sometimes he almost shouted and fought with tears when he talked about his family and his high school years .	-3.5920
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in committee , calling the charges against him a “ grotesque and coordinated reputation campaign ” organized by liberals angry at Clinton ’ s loss of the 2016 presidential election .	-4.6495
Pelosi said that she believed that Kavanaugh ’ s statement proved that he could not serve before the Supreme Court , because he showed that he was biased against democrats .	-3.5309
“ I believe that he disqualifies himself with such statements and the way in which he can be influenced by the Clintons and Democrats , ” she said .	-3.9800
When she was asked whether she would seek an official prosecution against Kavanaugh if it was confirmed and a democratic majority in the House of Representatives , Pelosi hesitated .	-5.6952
“ I want to say this : if he does not tell Congress or the FBI the truth , he is not only unsuitable for the Supreme Court ’ s service , but also for the service in the court where he is currently engaged , ” Pelosi explained .	-6.2945
Kavanaugh is currently district judge in D.C. Appeal Court .	-2.9786
Pelosi added that as a democrat she was concerned about possible Kavanaugh judgments against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. , since he stands for conservative justice .	-3.5513
In his confirmation hearings , Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions .	-4.6661
“ It is not time for a hysterical , biased person to go to court and expect us to say , “ Is this not wonderful , ” Pelosi said .	-4.0152
And women must stand by it .	-3.1559
It is a veritable hoax , months and years full of anger , and she cannot cry without .	-5.9052
" We cry when we become angry , " Mrs Steinem said to me 45 years later .	-2.8219
'I do not think that is unusual , or ? '	-3.1366
She continued : “ I was once helped by a woman in the executive who told me that she was crying when she became angry , but she developed a technique where , every time she became angry and began to cry , she said to the person she spoke to : “ You may think that I am sad because I am crying .	-6.9587
I am angry . '	-1.2903
And then she just continued .	-2.1425
And I thought it was brilliant . ”	-1.3630
Tears are allowed as a valve for anger because they are fundamentally misunderstood .	-3.4508
One of my strongest memories of an early job in a male-dominated office , where I once cried with indescribable anger , was that I was caught by an older woman , a disgusting manager of whom I was always somewhat frightened - who dragged me into a stairway .	-7.3047
" Let them never see you cry , " she told me .	-2.4365
" They do not know that you are angry .	-2.1854
They think that you are sad and will be happy because they have caught you . '	-3.5034
Patricia Schroeder , then a Colorado Democratic Congressman , supported Gary Hart in his presidential campaign .	-2.7539
In 1987 , when it became known that Mr. Hart had an extra-marital affair on board a boat called “ Monkey Business ” , he was out of the race .	-3.6151
“ It was not a well-thought out decision , ” she told me with a laugh 30 years later .	-3.3078
" There were already seven more candidates in the race , and the last thing they needed was another .	-2.1625
Someone called it ' Snow White and the Seven Dwarves ' .	-2.8629
Because the campaign was already underway , it was behind in raising funds , and so it swore that it would not participate in the race unless it collected $ 2 million .	-5.6944
It was a lost battle .	-1.3337
She found that some of her supporters , who gave $ 1,000 to men , would give it only $ 250 .	-4.4740
“ Think , I get advance lore berries ? ” she wondered .	-4.6652
When she delivered her speech and announced that she would not launch a formal campaign , she was so overwhelmed by emotions - gratitude to the people who supported her , frustration with the system that made it so difficult to collect money and appeal to voters rather than delegates , and anger about sexism - that she was stifled .	-4.6363
“ You might think I had a nerve breakdown , ” Schroeder recalls how the press responded to it .	-3.8543
" It would have been thought that Kleenex is my corporate sponsor .	-2.2798
I remember thinking about what they would write on my gravestone .	-2.0546

How the China / US Trade War might be advantageous to Beijing	-4.3557
The opening salvages of the US-China trade war were deafening , and there is no prospect of an end to the dispute .	-5.7771
US President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year , taxing important Chinese exports , such as solar panels , steel , and aluminum .	-7.0271
The introduction of new tariffs on imported Chinese products worth $ 200 billion ( <unk> 150 billion ) has led to a dramatic escalation this week .	-3.0995
Beijing has reciprocated each time in the form of tangible benefits , and most recently tariffs of 5-10 % on US goods worth $ 60 billion .	-6.8006
China is responding to every US blow , and it is unlikely that the world ’ s second-largest economy will yield in the near future .	-4.6161
Bringing Washington back means giving in to demands , but publicly bowing to the United States would be far too blameless for Xi Jinping , the president of China .	-5.6948
But if Beijing makes good use of its opportunities , the trade war with the US can have a long-term positive impact on China by reducing the interdependence of the two economies , experts say .	-5.0995
“ The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing can create the conditions for economic turbulence in one of the two countries is much more dangerous than observers previously assumed , ” said Abigail Grace , a researcher at the Center for New American Security , a think-tank focusing on Asia .	-4.3290
Syria is " ready " to return refugees , the Foreign Minister says .	-3.0012
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help in rebuilding the country that has been devastated by more than seven years of war .	-3.9829
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said at the United Nations General Assembly that conditions in the country are improving .	-2.4343
" Today , the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism , " he said .	-3.5698
The government continues to clean up areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normality .	-3.5395
Now all the conditions are in place for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods .	-4.4817
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the 2011 war .	-1.8975
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid .	-2.2002
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would welcome aid in rebuilding the devastated country .	-2.7934
But he emphasized that he would not accept conditional support or assistance from countries that financed the uprising .	-2.7922
