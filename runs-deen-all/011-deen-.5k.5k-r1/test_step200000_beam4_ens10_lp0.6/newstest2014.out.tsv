Gutach : More security for pedestrians	-2.1778
They are not 100 metres from each other : on Tuesday the new B 33 pedestrian traffic light at the village parking lot was opened in Gutach - in sight of the older town hall traffic lights .	-5.5293
Two equipment so close to each other : intention or stroke of thieves ? ? ... ! ! ! ..! ..	-11.3086
This question was clearly answered by Gutachs Mayor yesterday .	-2.2664
" The town hall traffic lights were installed at the time because they secure the school path " , explained Eckert yesterday .	-3.8470
The Kluser traffic lights safe both cyclists and bus passengers and the Bergle inhabitants .	-3.0759
Yesterday 's officially operated plant is important for the Sulzbachweg / Kirchstra<unk>e intersection .	-3.5526
We have the museum , two churches , spa park , the bus stop , a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area <unk> Grub <unk> .	-3.1995
" At the high traffic and pedestrian volume , another traffic light had to be safe , " says Eckert .	-9.7570
This also confirms Peter Arnold from the Offenburg Landratsamt .	-2.5465
" According to current measurements , approximately 12 000 vehicles pass through the municipality of Gutach on the B 33 daily , of which approximately ten percent heavy goods traffic , " emphasizes Arnold .	-5.0013
Therefore , the construction of another traffic light is more than necessary : " Safety is simple here , " says Arnold .	-4.4320
A total of four road shows had been carried out , and a roundabout was also considered , however , because of the closeness in the crossing area Sulzbachweg / Kirchstra<unk>e .	-5.9953
According to Arnold , when the traffic lights were selected , everything was tested before : " With an extra traffic loaded for us with particularly long wooden tribes , we have determined whether these vehicles can exit from the Sulzbachweg to the B 33 without changing the traffic lights ' .	-6.7615
The approximately EUR 15 000 expensive traffic lights themselves is the " most modern what is currently available on the market " , explained Arnold .	-4.1202
The complex is equipped with coloured LEDs that shine so powerfully that the lights of drivers are well recognized even in deep sunshine .	-5.6747
And it is also economical : the older light systems consume about 100 watts , the new just eight watts .	-3.6525
There are three light systems per direction .	-2.3645
Arnold explained the technology of the new plant : this is equipped with two radar sensors .	-2.6835
If the pedestrian presses the traffic button , the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation .	-2.6874
If the road is free , it takes about 15 seconds to get green for the pedestrian , if not .	-11.2021
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase can be terminated for the pedestrian .	-2.7100
" If a group or handicapped people go across the road , the green phase is extended , so everyone comes safely via the road , " explained Arnold .	-4.4026
Of course , the driver must think here as a partner and watch the road .	-3.5609
This was not the case yesterday : hardly showed the traffic lights for pedestrians green , rushed a upper class vehicle - with bright red .	-4.3839
Josef Winkler has written the needs of his childhood and youth from the soul for more than 30 years .	-3.1781
The Carinthian poet has often described the disasters of his Catholic village childhood - the language lack , the slope to raw violence and blunt sexuality , the narrow and joylessness .	-4.6544
The Büchner Prize winner is known primarily as a prosauthor , theatre texts are rare in his work .	-3.8358
Collage from prosatextes Gerhard Fresacher puts together a collage of prosatextes for his performance " Weather lights on the tongue " , which is now visible in garage X at St. Peter 's Square .	-5.0860
The theatre maker , for example , combines elements from the autobiographically characterised novel " Der Leibeigene " ( 1987 ) with prosaminiatures from " Leichnam , his family " ( 2003 ) .	-4.2813
On the largely empty-cleared stage - important requisite : a crunchy sofa on which the eight-headed ensemble is copulated and masturbated indicatively - fills through the text material .	-5.9945
Director Fresacher does not seem to trust the text .	-9.5415
The 70-minute performance exceeds the template with a wealth of directors , known from the repertoire of post-dramatic forms of play .	-3.8552
Above all , the actresses come up with sometimes somewhat questionable scenic implementations .	-4.5023
They are touched hard with the head dived under water , tackled with their evening samples to the wall .	-4.4489
Constrained in cellophane or tenants , they staksen on dangerously high stockings through the staging , either monologize them loudly or lie completely silently on the stage floor .	-5.2166
However , the text does not convey itself in this hard way .	-3.6907
The best moments have the evening when sung - the bandwidth ranges from Deep Purple to popular songs .	-3.0623
Only towards the end the overturned performance comes somewhat to rest , and Winkler ’ s afterwards absurd humor flashes up .	-6.4035
A blackbox in the car ?	-1.4323
US street planners are looking for a source of money to repair the declining highway system , and believe that the solution has been found in a small black box that can be found in the fitting board of each car .	-4.3941
The equipment that records every kilometre driven and reports to the authorities is at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and the state planning offices to revise the outdated system for financing US roads .	-4.2553
The usually boring area of road planning has suddenly created an intensive debate with colourful alliances .	-3.1332
Libertarians have allied with environmental groups , and advocate that the government can use the small boxes to record the driven kilometres – and possibly where they were driven – and then use the information to calculate tax modes .	-4.1880
The Tea Party is appalled .	-1.4194
The American Civil Liberties Association ( ACLU ) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of data protection concerns .	-2.1997
But while agreement cannot be reached in Congress , several states no longer wait .	-3.0335
They are currently examining how they can change over the next ten years to a system where drivers pay per driven mile .	-3.8291
Thousands of drivers have already tested the tachographs , some of which have GPS monitoring .	-2.0233
This really is a must for our country .	-1.8878
“ It is nothing we may only use , ” said Hasan Ikhrata , Managing Director of Southern California Assn. of Governments , who plans to record the miles driven by all Californian drivers in the state from 2025 .	-4.0625
The way we pay these taxes will change .	-1.4736
The technology is there .	-1.8959
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund , which is financed from taxes paid by US Americans at the fuel pillar , is bankrupt .	-4.0543
But America no longer recharges as much as before .	-3.3851
Cars consume less petrol .	-1.2215
The state oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallone ( less than 4 euro cents per litre ) has not increased for 20 years .	-2.4885
Politicians do not dare to raise taxes at high prices , even to .	-10.4339
“ The petrol tax is simply unsustainable , ” said Lee Munnich , an expert in transport legislation at the University of Minnesota .	-2.9506
Its state recently equipped 500 cars with tachographs to test a mile-based payment system .	-2.1667
“ This is the long-term most sensible alternative , ” he said .	-2.1293
Bureaucrats call it a mile-based user fee .	-1.5618
Not surprisingly , the idea of urban liberals is appropriate , because the tax could be used to influence driving behaviour in such a way that congestion and climate-harmful exhaust gases are reduced .	-4.5497
The Californian planners rely on the system for developing strategies aimed at achieving the ambitious , legally enshrined goals of the state on climate change .	-4.2041
But the Republican Bill Shuster from Pennsylvania , chairman of the House Transportation Committee , has also stated that he sees the most viable long-term alternative .	-9.2002
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are also driven by the idea of paying drivers after track .	-3.9677
“ This is not a tax that disappears in a black hole , ” explains Adrian Moore , Vice-President of Reason ’ s guidelines .	-2.5691
People pay directly for what they get .	-1.2053
The movement is also supported by two former American transport ministers who , in a 2011 report , asked Congress to move towards mile-based accounting .	-2.9107
The US Senate approved a $ 90 million pilot project last year , which covers 10,000 cars .	-2.7037
But the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the progress , responding to the concerns of members of rural areas who represent people who often have to travel miles on a daily basis to work or to the city .	-5.0146
Nevertheless , several states and major cities are moving in this direction on their own .	-3.4423
The most committed is Oregon , which currently hosts 5,000 drivers for the country ’ s largest experiment .	-3.3021
These drivers will soon pay the mileage fees instead of the mineral oil tax to the state .	-3.1173
Nevada has already completed a pilot project .	-1.1021
New York City is also considering such a thing .	-1.8739
Illinois tests it with lorries to a limited extent .	-7.6969
And the I-95 coalition , which includes the transport ministries of 17 states on the east coast ( including Maryland , Pennsylvania , Virginia and Florida ) , is currently examining how to introduce the change .	-2.8743
The concept is not a universal hit .	-1.1190
In Nevada , where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with the equipment , drivers were sceptical about the idea that the government could pursue any of its movements .	-11.0074
“ Concerns about Big Brother and such things were a major problem , ” explains Alauddin Khan , head of strategy and result management at the Ministry of Transport of Nevada .	-3.0865
People did not want it .	-1.2287
When the test started , Nevada ’ s ACLU warned on its website : “ It would be relatively easy to turn tachographs into full-scale monitoring devices . ”	-3.7721
There is no need to build a gigantic , blocked technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals .	-2.9859
Nevada belongs to a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology that allows the state to capture the driven kilometres , but not exactly when and where .	-4.2374
As Khan said , the public would also be more reassured .	-3.2156
Hunting for this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California .	-2.3445
The company originally did not start to help states tax drivers .	-3.4233
Rather , it was their aim to foot in an emerging market for car insurance , where drivers are to pay on the basis of driven miles .	-5.0170
But the devices she tested are also interesting for the street planners , because they do not work with GPS and provide limited information that is regularly uploaded by modem .	-4.1893
“ People are more willing to participate if their speed and sites are not recorded , ” said Ryan Morrison , Managing Director of True Mileage .	-2.7149
Some of these public pilot programmes have made major mistakes .	-2.1665
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement this .	-1.9355
In Oregon , the planners experiment with giving drivers a number of choices .	-2.7345
You can choose a device with or without GPS .	-1.7236
Or they do not choose any device at all and instead pay a package fee on the basis of the miles driven by all state inhabitants on average part .	-11.9373
Other places hope to sell the concept of a suspicious public by equipping the devices with more functions than with less .	-3.1072
In New York City , transport officials want to develop a tax device that also pays parking fees , insurance must be paid only for driven kilometres , and speed data collected by other vehicles in real time thanks to which drivers can avoid congestion .	-5.1486
“ Drivers would be motivated to participate by the added value of the benefits the system offers , ” says in a city planning document .	-3.8725
However , some transport planners wonder whether all the talk about paying per mile is not just a huge distraction manoeuvre .	-3.3476
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay , officials declared that Congress could simply solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund by increasing the fuel tax .	-3.2849
An additional one-off fee or annual tax could be imposed on drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume little petrol , so that they too pay a fair share .	-3.8745
“ There is no reason for an operation if an aspirin is sufficient , ” explains Randy Rentschler , the head of legislation and public affairs of the Commission .	-3.2386
If we do that , hundreds of millions of drivers worry about their privacy and many other things .	-2.3474
Royal Field : Small Team Beats Waker	-3.5830
The volunteer fire brigade managed its autumn sample despite the lack of personnel with bravour .	-4.1124
Only 11 man took part in the exercise .	-2.2847
Department Commander Hans Kammerer had chosen the property Feder in Burgberger Stra<unk>e in his practice assumption .	-3.8145
A short circuit should have arisen during sawing .	-3.8027
Two people were injured by the emerging fire and smoking development , but one of them could send an emergency call .	-3.9273
After the first review of the situation by Hans Kammerer , two respiratory protectors of the Wohr were prepared to enter the building .	-4.7100
After a short period of time , the first person managed to find and lead into the outdoor .	-4.8855
The second person had to be worn .	-1.4236
This was not so easy because a narrow staircase was to be overcom.	-10.6618
The building , a workshop with an integrated stables for two horses , was not easy to secure .	-12.4499
It stored a lot of wood and also straw balls .	-2.5150
There were also electrical machines for woodworking .	-2.6242
The first extinguishing attack was done via the tank in the vehicle .	-2.7195
Another line was carried out via an overfloor hydrant at about 100 metres distance .	-4.1054
Three extinguishing attacks could now be designed .	-11.8554
A hollow jet pipe was also used in the building .	-3.2828
Hans Kammerer was also concerned with the exercise to show what to do with little staff available .	-4.8624
In case of seriousness , support is given through the Königsfeld Daily Betting Grougroup .	-5.1470
The commander was satisfied with the exercise .	-1.9164
Networking of universities and companies Important	-2.4269
During his visit to the Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald district , President Guido Wolf also enlightened himself in Titisee-Neustadt about where the workforce comes from tomorrow .	-4.4751
At the Förderzentrum Hochschwarzwald he went together with the managing directors of vocational schools and the circle gymnasium and the parental advisory board chairs of this important issue .	-5.0757
" Education is an important location factor " , underlined Claudia Stehle , director of the Hans-Thoma School , which presented the networked school project education centre Hochschwarzwald .	-3.4781
Wolf was impressed by the model projects for training .	-2.8225
Since 2011 , there has been successful cooperation between Förderzentrum , Kreisgymnasium and Vocational School Centre in the Forest City .	-3.4408
He also praised family friendliness in the county .	-2.5636
" It is important not only to look at the family phase , but also to maintain the care of members due to demographic change , " said Wolf .	-4.2174
He also indicated that more and more employees were concerned about the care and care of their families .	-4.1014
" Without the support of employers , the resulting burden on employees can lead to an end to the employment relationship , " said Wolf .	-3.3870
But nobody could afford to lose skilled workers , he continued to s. lililililililililililililililililili	-14.7682
Another , particularly important factor is the networking of universities and companies .	-2.3874
" For anyone who has already met the benefits of the region during his studies , with his acquired knowledge and his abilities often receives the regional economy , which contributes to the strengthening of the region , " the President of the country showed himself convinced .	-6.0143
Only if sufficient training places were offered could the skilled needs be met .	-4.0039
In his opinion , the location advantage of the district is its advantageous location in south-west Germany , close to France and Switzerland .	-3.4704
He also experienced on his railway journey from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg the efforts already made to expand public transport .	-3.8463
" Stay persistent and ensure that public transport becomes better " , he explained to the address of the local politicians present .	-3.3971
Experiencing an Entertaining Afternoon with Music !	-9.8950
For 15 years , the Kaul family has been inviting the Dietinger seniors to coffee , cakes and then a Vesper .	-3.5288
Previously , the elderly were held in the restaurant .	-3.4012
Meanwhile this afternoon takes place in the care home St. Josef .	-3.7492
The inhabitants looked forward to the delicious cakes and cakes .	-2.4814
Later there was salad .	-2.1888
With common melodies , Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich entertained .	-2.6225
The more than 100 years old natural stone wall as the front line of the old school courtyard to the Kirchstra<unk>e is to be replaced with the recovery cost plan of the city of Bräunlingen .	-5.7698
During the days before the Kilbig , a small angle wall was built in the first works of the rehabilitation of the front school courtyard , for stabilization and static discharge of the over one hundred years old natural stone screen with Balustrade .	-5.5411
The further procedure provides for Alexander Misok of the Bräunlinger Stadtbauamt to include the State Monument Office in the planning and to create a reconstruction concept for the old wall .	-4.9912
A cost calculation will then be made by professionals who will then be put on the table to the Council of Municipalities for decision-making and determining further action .	-12.2965
A decision will probably be taken next year .	-2.8624
Following the rehabilitation , paving and tree planting of the old school courtyard within the two side wings of the school built in 1912 , it is necessary , in the foreseeable future , to restore the needy limitation wall from scratch and to rebuild it .	-6.2210
The historical , one hundred years old demarcation wall of the old school courtyard to the Kirchstra<unk>e is mainly due to water and frost damage , since no drainage is available , needs to be repaired and has a signature propensity forward .	-6.1690
Deep cracks in individual stones testify to weather damage , but the wall is not currently at risk of collapse .	-3.0905
A stable wall is a prerequisite for a student using school courtyard , which has been done by the current fastening work .	-5.0889
Originally , school rehabilitation was already planned in 2008 / 2009 , but high unscheduled expenditure brought a shift .	-16.5492
An important word in the historical rehabilitation of school walls , which has even been used for film photographs , will speak with the National Monument Office .	-5.3022
If prescriptions come from this site , the city of Bräunlingen hopes for subsidies from the monument protectors .	-3.9467
The students of the Bräunlinger primary school who are now teaching again in a well-renovated old school building with new aula can soon use the old school court .	-10.7045
<unk>zdemir wants to receive jazz training in Stuttgart	-2.0761
In the ongoing discussions on the future of the music colleges in Baden-Württemberg , Cem <unk>zdemir , German Chairman of the Greens , has now turned on .	-4.5143
" I think it is wrong to abandon integrated training at the Stuttgart University of Music , " said <unk>zdemir the " Stuttgart News " .	-4.0269
Jazz and classics belong together at the jazz location Stuttgart .	-3.3837
This contradicts <unk>zdemir , who in Stuttgart is the favorite for a direct mandate in the federal election on 22 September , the Green Red National Government .	-4.6559
On the basis of an expert study , this is forcing a reorganisation of the five music colleges in Baden-Württemberg .	-4.5956
Afterwards , the jazz and pop courses will be shifted from the Stuttgart University of Applied Sciences to the Musikhochschule Mannheim .	-5.1562
Discovering the US border : " Super Tunnel " to drug smuggling	-3.0554
At the border between Mexico and the US , investigators discovered and closed a " super tunnel " to drug smuggling .	-2.6576
As the US customs authorities announced , the more than 500 metres long tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity , railway tracks and a ventilation system .	-3.6109
Three suspects were therefore arrested , eight tonnes of marijuana and almost 150 kilograms of cocaine were seizsei. lililililililililililililililililili	-14.7258
According to the tunnel , it has not yet been used .	-3.2526
" These cartels are stupid if they think they could dig through under the radar , " said the prosecutor of the US district Southern California , Laura Duffy , at a press conference in front of a warehouse in San Diego , where this had been discovered an end to the tunnel .	-4.2112
Duffy assured to the drug gangs : " If you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them , we are determined to make this a huge waste of your dirty money " .	-4.2526
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a permanent fight against the drug cartels .	-2.1132
Since 2006 , more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug crime .	-2.0016
Constructed by Experts	-7.8875
Due to the expensive equipment of the tunnel , the investigators assume that he was designed by architects and engineers and that the construction took about a year .	-12.8134
The track system was equipped to use electrically powered carves .	-15.0125
On the Mexican side , access is located in a building 80 metres from the border .	-3.0837
According to the authorities , a ladder leads 20 meters into the depth to the actual tunnel entrance .	-3.6095
The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 metres height and 90 centimetres width .	-2.7272
It would have been appropriate to promote illegal immigration towards the US .	-2.5756
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine find .	-1.8090
The third , a Mexican , was captured because of the confiscated marijuanas .	-10.4870
All three threaten as a maximum penalty of lifelong withdrawal , as officials said .	-3.3876
Since 2006 , eight such tunnels have been discovered , and continued at the press conference in San Diego .	-3.0593
But it is the first time that cocaine was found in such a tunnel construction .	-2.8427
Normally , cocaine is smuggled in smaller quantities , not by tunnels .	-11.6205
This shows the " desperation " of drug gangs , whose traditional routes have now been cut off , Bill Sherman said about the DEA in San Diego .	-3.8058
They would do everything to get to the US .	-2.1633
No details were announced about those arrested , at least one Mexican , it was called .	-4.3804
You must expect sentences of up to ten years .	-2.7678
2014 Geisinger Festyear	-2.5437
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250 .	-2.1846
Repeat of the first documentary mention is getting closer .	-3.4712
When the year comes to an end in almost eight weeks , the anniversary year stands .	-3.6551
Geisingen and Kirchen-Hausen were first mentioned together in 794 .	-3.3215
A document was produced in churches where both places are mentioned .	-2.9888
On 15 March there will be an official start to the anniversary year , and since Geisingen currently has no hall , this event takes place in the place where both were first mentioned 1250 years ago , in church houses .	-4.9774
During the anniversary several events are planned in both Geisingen and Church Houses .	-3.6805
Church houses will be held in July at a festival weekend from 18 to 20 July the 1250 .	-4.4490
Celebrate return .	-2.0464
On Friday with a celebration , on Saturday and Sunday with a feast around the Church Hall .	-3.2319
This festival weekend is also the Church House Church Festival .	-4.0502
Director of the city music Rudolf Barth wrote an order composition for the city on the occasion of the anniversary , listed at three dates .	-4.5038
On June 21 together with the sunny celebration of the Black Forest Association , on July 12 in the Arena with fireworks and on December 13 as the first concert of city music in the new Festhalle .	-3.8407
It will be completed and inaugurated in the anniversary year , the official date will be on the last September weekend , on 27 and 28 September .	-9.7651
On the occasion of the Geisinger Stadtjubiläum , a new chronicle will also be released live on the occside lililililili	-10.2488
" However , a chronicle should not only be made by Geisingen himself , but a printed work about the spirit of today , which consists of Geisingen , Church Houses , Leipferdingen , Aulfingen and Gutmadingen , " said Mayor Walter Hengstler .	-5.3184
And today ’ s Geisingen celebrates 2014 birthday , and in 1974 today ’ s space was carried out with the communities .	-4.7817
The new chronicle will be presented in the new Festhalle in Geisingen on 21 or 22 November .	-2.7252
However , 2014 is also a year with many anniversaries list.	-10.4072
Strohglonki ’ s fool generation begins on 8 February with a custom sandwich on the occasion of its 60th anniversary , the harmony of Gutmadingen will be 90 years and has the festival banquet on 29 March and then celebrates the district music festival from 1 to 4 May .	-6.2694
The Altenwerk Leipferdingen will be 40 years old , the Geisinger Schule has been at the new site for 50 years and celebrates this on 10 May , the music association Polyhymnia Leipferdingen will be 150 years old and celebrates this in the framework of the Brunnenfest from 4 to 7 July .	-8.0971
The city of Geisingen was first mentioned in 764 in a donation certificate owned by the monastery St. Gallen .	-3.1797
The certificate was produced in churches ( houses ) , which was then a court place .	-3.8052
Both communities are therefore mentioned in the same document .	-1.9306
Because of this 1250-year-old celebration in 2014 , the municipality reform is also 40 years behind .	-13.8946
The Council targets track plants	-6.2537
Should the railway crossing " Am Hirschen " be expensively converted to increase road safety ?	-4.2466
Yes , the municipal councils have decided .	-2.1996
Schiltach must take EUR 220 000 into its hands .	-3.1103
Deutsche Bahn wants to improve the Kinzigtal railway line next year .	-2.7541
In particular , the safety of railway crossings is to be increased - there are regular collisions of trains with other vehicles throughout Germany .	-4.8608
If the municipalities agree to the reconstruction measures , they must participate with a third in the costs , the rest share the railway and the federal government .	-4.9952
Schiltach ’ s city master Roland Grie<unk>haber explained to the Council the specific features of the railway transition “ Am Hirschen ” .	-4.8057
There the city plans to build a booking in the amount of the tunnel mund there west of the railway track . lines are lilili. , lili, lililililililililililili	-17.0353
There , too , larger vehicles , such as those that transport long wood , could stand in counter-traffic without having to block the track .	-4.0364
Greekeepers therefore proposed constructing a necessary support wall in such a way that the city could spread the subsequent road in due course in order to ensure a smooth flow of transport .	-15.7813
This was discussed controversially in the Council of Municipalities , because some Councils doubted the need for road dissemination : Thomas Kipp put the mood of the critics on the point : ' Do we have to take so much money on account of so few vehicles ? '	-5.0086
Mayor Thomas Haas contradicted : The railway crossing " Hirschen " is regularly used for long-wood transport .	-3.6045
Even wood from the " Kuhbach " area is partly transported over this route , because the vehicles up to 20 metres long could not use the route at the Häberlesbrücke , because they could not turn into the main road .	-11.0289
In addition , the route serves as a redirection for those vehicles that cannot use the tunnel when the main road is locked , argued Haas .	-3.8407
Apart from the fact that Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnels need to be rebuilt and renovated , as is currently the case in Wolfach , the railway transition " Am " Hirschen " could also be important for a longer period of time .	-5.2479
The Councils agreed to investigate the costs of the intended widening of the road .	-3.3895
Nevertheless , the majority agreed to the reconstruction of the railway transition with the measure that the necessary support wall is built in such a way that the city could expand the subsequent road towards " Bahnhofstra<unk>e " , if necessary , to around 5.5 meters for meeting .	-6.6744
By contrast , the reconstruction of the Trautwein railway transition could lead to a completely different problem concerning access to the sharply rising " Geroltzhäuser Weg " .	-5.0482
The administration had investigated the reconstruction plans of the railways by the Breinlinger engineering agency , because it had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhäuser Weg would then be possible without further delalimits linkto the lin.	-12.3734
The investigation came to the conclusion that it should not be ruled out that the tendency of the road could lead to longer vehicles sitting .	-4.7792
The responsibility for this , in turn , bears the city as a street builder .	-4.6335
Reconstruction could therefore result in liability disputes .	-3.5528
Because both the wood and turning in the current state of expansion worked , one should not agree to the conversion of the railway transition , Haas argued .	-5.6456
At this point , too , the risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle on the transition is significantly lower than at the other railway crossings , because it is right next to the stop center , where there is a good visibility connection .	-6.0671
Even trains from the central railway station would have to be braked at this point so far that no collision threatens .	-4.7961
The majority refused to approve the conversion of this railway transition because the city of Schiltach had to " bathe out " the problem with sitting vehicles , according to the Councils , as the railway could withdraw from the responsibility after the construction work was completed .	-6.4154
The body considers the conversions to the railway crossings " Vor Heubach " and " Before Kuhbach " , for which crossing agreements have already been made with the ra.	-10.7476
Esa decides on Great Space Missions : Missions for Billions	-2.5485
Remote planets , gravitational waves or black holes - European Space Agency experts must now agree on two major projects they want to start in the coming years .	-3.6077
30 suggestions were made , five are still in the race .	-2.9784
Far worlds .	-1.5195
More than 1000 planets in other stars have already found astronomers .	-1.8888
Whether there are at least some of them living , nobody knows .	-3.1226
The selection is hard : Should you search for gravitational waves ?	-3.1928
Or prefer to explore the origin of the cosmos ?	-2.3075
Or flagging after a similar planet and perhaps discovering alien life ?	-4.2611
These questions are precisely the responsibilities of the European Space Agency Esa .	-3.1150
For their " Cosmic Vision " programme , they are looking for ideas for two major space projects that are intended to make significant progress in research .	-4.0446
The budget for such ' L missions ' is approximately EUR 1 billion each .	-2.5320
The start is expected to be 2028 and 2034 .	-2.0118
In early September , the elite of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions .	-2.1698
30 ideas have been debated , five of them have now come into the closer election .	-3.4795
Many bodies review the proposals , follow up with researchers .	-4.2595
Over the next few days , a final decision will be taken by the Scientific Programme Committee .	-10.2393
A total of four major questions have been selected by the Esa to which the missions of the 2007 Cosmic Vision programme will find answers .	-3.8551
What are the conditions for the creation of planets and lives ?	-1.7522
The exact processes in the creation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus also the emergence of planets circling these stars - are still in the proverbial dark .	-4.3788
A large infrared telescope in all could penetrate this dark .	-2.3607
And if a star has planets , under what circumstances can life arise there ?	-2.7064
To investigate this issue , 2017 will launch the space telescope " Cheops " , which will investigate 500 already known planetary systems in our nearby environment .	-4.4734
The possibilities are limited , however , cheops is a small mission with a budget of EUR 150 million .	-2.5255
With larger instruments , astronomers could depict similar planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres , thereby looking for " biomarkers " : gases considered indicative of biological activity .	-4.0536
How does the solar system work ?	-1.1592
This question , too , should ultimately indicate the conditions for the emergence of life .	-4.6101
An important role is the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field , as well as the particle radiation it produces with the planet system .	-4.3303
These processes can be examined exemplarily in our solar system .	-2.8309
With the " Solar Orbiter " , the Esa has already granted a M-class mission ( there is the budget of about half a billion euros ) for this issue .	-4.0285
The probe will start in 2017 and observe the surface and activity of the sun .	-2.9692
Jupiter and his moons are of great interest to the researchers .	-2.7444
You want to find out what role the giant planet played in the development of the solar system .	-2.6680
For this purpose , Esa provides for the first of the three L missions of the Cosmic Vliline lililililililililili	-8.8761
The probe " Juice " ( Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer ) is expected to begin its journey in 2022 .	-2.2491
Eight years later , Jupiter reached Jupiter and was to examine the atmosphere of the planet as well as the icy moon of Europe , Kallisto and Ganymed .	-4.2169
What are the basic physical laws of the universe ?	-1.2303
The world offers many opportunities to study matter under extreme conditions and to examine whether the natural laws we know are still valid there .	-4.1831
Perhaps there are also deviations that could show physicists the way to a new theory under which all known natural laws can be combined .	-14.9239
How did the universe come into being , and what is it ???	-3.9418
13.7 billion years ago our cosmos emerged through the big bang .	-2.8129
In addition to the common matter , which consists of stars , planets and living beings like us , there are dark matter whose gravity holds galaxies and galaxy clusters together , and dark energy , through which the expansion of the world accelerates .	-4.9158
So far , researchers do not know what physical laws were valid in the first second fractions of the big bang , nor what dark matter and dark energy consist of .	-3.9107
With " Euclid " the Esa has already approved an M mission , which is scheduled for 2020 .	-4.6199
With a special telescope , the probe is intended to study the distribution of the matter in the universe for the first time in the entire sky , allowing conclusions on the nature of dark matter and dark energy .	-4.5225
Who Could Race	-2.0435
Of the 30 proposals , only two will remain at the end of the selection procedure .	-2.0309
The best opportunities for an authorisation as a L mission has , in the opinion of many experts , " E-Lisa " , a demanding concept for detecting gravitational waves .	-4.7814
These include physicists ’ changes in the structure of space time , which Albert Einstein predicted almost 100 years ago .	-3.0954
They have not been proven to date .	-2.4894
Elisa could do this , hope the scientists behind the project .	-2.6129
The mission provides for a detector consisting of two or three probes , which is stationed in all .	-3.0911
Unlike plants on earth , he could also prove waves of gravitation that were created at the big bang , providing new knowledge of the emergence of the cosmos .	-14.8587
Four other proposals compete for the second L mission : a large X-ray telescope called " Athena " , which is intended to explore black holes , " Icy Planets " , another mission to the outer planets of the solar system , " Prism " , a mission to measure cosmic background radiation , and the " Exoplanet Finder " , which is intended to detect and investigate similar planets .	-4.9485
Already left are proposals for sample return from Mars , for research into moon , venus and asteroids and for solar physics .	-5.1046
Snowden ready to “ cooperate ” with Germany on US surveillance	-2.2341
Edward Snowden , the whistleblower of the US intelligence service , has declared that he is prepared to travel to Berlin and to tell before the German Bundestag if the American National Security Agency and her director Keith Alexander do not give answers to their activities .	-4.0504
German MEP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden on Thursday in Russia , where this asylum was received to discuss with him the statement in Germany .	-2.8852
In a letter from Snowden , presented to the media in Berlin on Friday by Ströbele , he writes : “ Even though the outcome of my efforts was demonstrably positive , my government continues to treat a different opinion as a faithful and tries to criminalize political expression with a threat of penalty that cannot be defended . ”	-13.0213
But saying the truth is not a crime .	-2.0114
In the letter , Snowden writes that he is convinced that the international community ’ s support could persuade the American government to fall the charge against him .	-11.5525
The charge made by the US Department of Justice includes spying and theft of state ownership .	-3.0263
German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich said to time online : “ If Mr Snowden is prepared to talk to German representatives , then we find ways to make this possible . ”	-3.8705
Relations between the US and Germany are burdened by claims that the NSA has heard Chancellor Angela Merkel 's mobile phone .	-3.0487
Thomas Oppermann , the honourable Member who leads the parliamentary committee responsible for the secret service , said that we should seize the opportunity to listen to Snowden as witnesses , if possible , “ without jeopardising him and completely ruining relations with the US . ”	-4.9375
Ströbele , a Green Member , published a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed .	-2.3352
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia .	-1.6161
Ströbele explained that , according to the lawyer of the former NSA employee , Snowden could not return to Russia when he left the country .	-14.1036
When Snowden says in Germany , he needs an assurance that he is “ safe ” there , the Member says .	-10.4310
In his letter , Snowden explains that he would be subject to a “ serious and ongoing ” persecution campaign that displaced him from his homeland . lilililililililililililililililili	-11.3677
However , he is affected by the global response to “ my act of political expression . ”	-2.5380
Citizens around the world and high-level politicians – including in the United States – have described the revelations of an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance as a merit of the general public .	-3.5995
In his letter , Snowden makes the German authorities an offer of cooperation “ when the difficulties around the humanitarian situation have been resolved . ”	-2.7719
Frontier Airlines charges for hand baggage	-1.7227
Frontier Airlines plans to demand up to $ 100 of passengers who want to store hand baggage on their flight .	-3.0294
Frontier Airlines intends to calculate up to $ 100 for a piece of hand baggage and $ 2 for coffee or limonade , even though the announcement on Wednesday readed that passengers should keep the whole dose .	-10.1175
The new fee applies to hand baggage in the baggage compartment above the seat , small bags under the seat are still free .	-3.2750
Frontier explained that if the fee is paid in advance , USD 25 will be charged , and USD 100 for travellers who only paid at the pas.	-13.6093
Frontier spokesman Kate O 'Malley said that the $ 100 fee is aimed at moving travellers to take care of payment in advance .	-3.4836
“ We do not want to calculate this sum , ” she explained .	-2.5255
In 2008 , airlines began to demand charges for the first and second checked baggage p.	-3.8072
Passengers who tried to circumvent them have therefore plugged into their hand baggage as much as possible , which means that the baggage subjects are often overcrowded above the seat .	-4.4793
Fees are a way to encourage passengers to take less on board .	-2.7005
O 'Malley said that the new fee is not really about earning money .	-1.7542
It is about the most faithful customers of Frontier who would have clearly expressed that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find room in the compartment above the seat .	-4.8348
Passengers who buy your tickets on the airline website do not have to pay .	-2.6796
This means that a passenger may take a piece of baggage free of charge at the Frontier passenger , but the next person will have to pay $ 100 for a comparable baggage .	-4.6254
O 'Malley explained that the site of Frontier and the check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers are informed about the fee before they come to the passenger .	-3.9727
The new Frontier hand baggage fee will only enter into force in summer , there is no exact date yet .	-3.8904
Passengers often take advantage of baggage surcharges and other charges , but airlines like to take advantage of it .	-4.0435
They argue that the transport of baggage should cost money and passengers should pay this service if they wish .	-13.1818
Many at Wall Street regard the new baggage fees as a sign that airlines take enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of loss .	-3.6014
However , most people leave the fingers of hand baggage charges .	-4.3185
Spirit Airlines Inc. required first hand baggage charges three years ago and later Allegiant Air , also a cheap flier .	-3.7225
The only other airline with such a fee is Hungarian Wizz Air , explained by airline consultant Jay Sorensen , who closely follows the additional fees .	-8.9494
In a December 2011 report , he estimated that the hand baggage fee Spirit costs $ 50 million per year .	-3.5640
Sorensen , who previously held a leading position at Midwest Airlines , has recently flown with Spirit and was curious , which would expect him at the passenger if passengers were faced with the unusual hand baggage fee of the company .	-4.5336
“ The boarding process was among the most smooth I experienced in my career in aviation , ” he said .	-13.4376
I expected to see teeth glaciers and hands-on discussions at the climb .	-4.3661
“ The plane was full , ” he said , “ and the boarding ran as lubricated . ”	-2.7738
Frontier also follows the 2 dollars required for coffee , tea , limonade or juice .	-2.8346
The company explained that passengers who bought limonade or juice should keep the whole dose and fill coffee free of charge .	-3.9918
Water is still free .	-1.4251
US Airways sought to demand money for refreshment drinks in 2008 , but reversed this seven months later , after passengers had complained and no other major society had followed .	-4.6133
Frontier 's step towards charging hand baggage if passengers do not buy directly from the airline is the recent initiative with which customers are to be directed to their own website .	-10.7768
Airlines pay online travel agencies like Orbitz 10 to 25 USD per ticket sold .	-2.3948
This gives all companies an incentive to move passengers to direct purchase from them instead of via an online travel agency service listed abolistlinlilisted lililililililililili	-8.8092
However , Frontier has gone further in this area .	-2.5580
In September , the company began to award only half as many frequent flyer miles when booking through an online travel agency .	-3.1049
On Wednesday , miles were reduced to 25 % of the flight track .	-3.0582
A flight travel booked by a third party with a frontier of more than 1000 miles therefore brings customers only 250 miles .	-4.4113
Passengers may also reserve places only when purchasing directly from the Frontier website .	-3.7170
Frontier has a loyal customer base at its headquarters in Denver , but the business shrinks and the company loses money .	-2.7585
The proceeds fell by 9 percent , and the flight capacity shrinked almost 13 percent in the first quarter , as read in the financial report published on Wednesday by the parent company , Republic Airways Holdings Inc . .	-14.1541
Republic has tried to manage the finances of frontiers within the framework of the sale of society .	-3.7432
Proverbs come from the Bible	-2.3295
About 40 women visited the last women 's breakfast this year in the Protestant parish of Bisingen .	-3.2399
The topic of the day in the municipal house was " proverbs from the Bible " and " speeches from the Middle Ages " .	-3.7172
Zita Köhler , chairman of the Church Community Council , entered the biblical proverbs after breakfast .	-3.6030
" Proverbs contain wisdoms , regulations or warnings , " she explained .	-2.9980
She compared several proverbs with the corresponding bible stations and explained the meaning .	-9.1729
She called proverbs like : wood eyes be vigilant , as scales fall from the eyes , throw an eye on someone who gives His in sleep , wash his hands in innocence .	-4.5183
Several times the speaker also advised her listeners what the saying was .	-3.8749
The phrases from the Middle Ages took the church municipality of Christel Dehner : all good things are three , blue , making something hidden .	-5.2786
She explained the importance and origin of the speeches she called ' bridges to the past ' .	-2.9123
Finally , a raffle was raffled .	-2.5771
The prizes were covered on a table and were described humorously before they were passed to the winners .	-9.3235

Learning rather than unemployed : Pilot project for Unlearned Tourism	-2.9801
A pilot project for the tourism industry starts today at the Mecklenburg Lakes Plate .	-3.7694
Under the leadership of the Federal Labour Agency , 49 women and men who are already working as unskilled in the industry are to be qualified over three winters to professionals for hotels and restaurants .	-4.2155
" New is that the six-month courses end with degrees , " said Carmen Wiechert of the working agency Neubrandenburg .	-3.1884
The benefit is varied : participants would not be unemployed , companies would get trained professionals who were increasingly lacking in hotels and restaurants , and the agency does not need to finance unemployment .	-4.5181

NSA explains that an “ internal mistake ” and not hackers are guilty of the crash of the site	-19.2145
The shadowy National Security Agency explained late Friday that a mistake paralysed its public site several hours and not hackers , as was claimed online .	-3.8704
“ NSA.gov was unavailable for several hours this night because an internal error occurred during a planned update , ” explained the spy agency in an e-mail message .	-4.0958
The problem will be fixed this evening .	-1.6434
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed Denial of Service attack ( DDoS ) was not true .	-2.6266
During the early evening hours , online server trackers noticed that the NSA website was not available for at least six hours , and this is still not available for some users .	-3.9277
Previously , a NSA spokesman told ABC News that the authority ’ s sensitive internal network was “ in no way ” compromised .	-2.9931
Secret information is not in danger , according to the speaker .	-2.4989
At least one group of hacktivists claimed to have paralysed the NSA website with a DDoS attack .	-2.4062
In such attacks , the target website is flooded with page calls until the servers are overloaded and the website collapses .	-3.0364
Cybertactics are relatively simple and attacks do not serve to penetrate into the internal network of the target system .	-10.1877
The former super-secret NSA , whose nickname once was No Such Agency ( no such authority ) , is now in the bright light of the public and sees itself exposed to sharp criticism following the revelations that have become known in recent months about its extensive monitoring program at home and abroad – a result of the secret NSA data stolen and published by the disillusioned former NSA staff Edward Snowden .	-5.5607
The growing controversy over the intelligence service fired initial speculation that the incident today is the result of a targeted cyperoperation .	-3.5059
The number of people without a job in October has easily fallen by 22 to 1,307 .	-2.7974
While the 3.1 % quota is better than last year and better than in September , " we would have hoped for more " , says Monika Felder-Bauer , Deputy Managing Director of the Agency for Labour in Sonthofen .	-3.8833
Many businesses have so far behaved in settings .	-4.1151
One reason for this is , according to Felder-Bauer : " We have hardly any professionals in crafts , health care and care for the elderly " .	-4.8465

Profit losses in bombardiers after decline in delivery numbers and orders	-3.5922
On Thursday , the Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15 % decline in net profit after coming under pressure from declining orders and deliveries in aircraft in the third quarter and contract problems in the railway sector .	-4.5374
Bombardier , based in Montreal , did not publish any flight test data for his brand new CSeries aircraft and did not give any new information on whether the aircraft could go to commercial use in accordance with the ambitious timetable next September .	-4.6276
Only three more starts were followed up on the jungflight of the test aircraft one and a half months ago , which makes it questionable whether the test phase is running as planned .	-5.5034
The results remained behind the forecasts and resulted in a fall of more than eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange .	-3.9111
On Thursday , Cameron Doerksen , analyst at National Bank Financial , reduced its assessment from “ outperform ” to “ sector perform ” with a view to the fact that the share has limited price potential in the next one to two quarters .	-4.1158
“ Although weaker delivery numbers were expected as much as possible for aircraft , we are clearly disappointed by margin development in the transport sector , ” said Doerksen in a customer letter .	-4.7882
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries when the aircraft test program proceeds .	-2.9648
However , if no new orders are announced in the coming months , we expect the market to become more sceptical about the program .	-3.3798
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft series can catapult the company into the lower market segment currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus .	-2.6479
The first test aircraft was presented to the public in March and flew for the first time in September following months of delay. , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-12.9746
But so far binding orders for the CSeries with 177 are moderate , because potential buyers wait for the results of the flight tests and want to see if the company ’ s claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost saving potential of the new jet aircraft are true .	-4.6757
There are currently a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and complies .	-16.5122
CEO Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will reach his target of 300 binding orders at the beginning of commercial use of the jet .	-3.0188
The management also insured analysts and media on Thursday , and the program is in the schedule .	-3.7149
“ The test aircraft has no longer remained on the ground than expected , ” Beaudoin said at a telephone conference and added that during the aircraft ’ s location , soil testing and software updates were scheduled .	-4.3387
Each manufacturer plans differently .	-1.4425
We have decided to take a first flight and then append a revision period , which we have done .	-3.1231
This is happening throughout the flight programme .	-2.2267
The second of five test aircraft will probably start in the next few weeks , the remaining shortly afterwards , it was said by company side .	-4.1099
Nevertheless , analysts remain sceptical whether 12 months after the Jungfernflug the first customer can operate a CSeries plane .	-9.5761
Bombardier explained that it checks the planning for commissioning ( EIS ) and will update them in the coming months .	-3.2794
“ The slow progress of the flight test – even though it appears to correspond to bombardiers of internal planning – reinforces our view that commissioning is shifting to the first quarter of 2015 , ” said Doerksen .	-4.3416
In the third quarter at the end of September 30 , Bombardier ’ s net profit fell to $ 147 million , or 8 cents per share of $ 172 million , or 9 cents per share a year earlier .	-3.3728
The customized profit per share is unchanged to 9 cents .	-2.6931
Sales were slightly lowered , dropping from $ 4.2 billion to $ 4.1 billion .	-3.4580
Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and a turnover of $ 4.56 billion , according to Thomson Reuters I / B / E / S.	-2.6928
The world ’ s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer indicates that he has delivered 45 aircraft in this quarter , a decline of 57 last year .	-3.0556
The net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26 .	-1.5818
The order book in the aerospace sector was $ 32.9 billion on September 30 , and was thus unchanged compared to December 31 .	-3.4883
“ In the field of aerospace , the results were within the framework of our requirements , but the low order intake and the overall market conditions were disappointing , ” said Beaudoin .	-3.5347
Sales in the aerospace sector fell by 13 % to $ 2 billion .	-2.0486
Bombardier , the world ’ s largest railway manufacturer , announced that sales in this sector increased by almost eleven percent to $ 2.1 billion .	-2.9772
The order book in the transport sector was $ 32.6 billion on September 30 , and was thus slightly increased compared to December 31 .	-3.4417
The profit range in the transport sector has been affected by settlement problems in some major contracts .	-3.7162
According to corporate governance , there will be new requirements for the fourth quarter .	-2.6447
In the afternoon trade on Thursday , the bombing share reached 8.5 % and reached 4.83 Canadian dollars , after it was also announced that the Google Financial Board will switch Patrick Pichette to the Board .	-5.2199

Cocaine-dependent lawyer , who warned drug bosses against police investigation , needs to be in prison	-11.0822
Basharat Ditta , 42 , passed on information to underworld size Neil Scarborough	-9.8852
The Lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction could come to light	-2.8195
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpooler Crown Court .	-2.3774
A well-known criminal defender who warned a drug baron against a major police investigation because he feared that his secret drug addiction could be detected was sentenced to three years in prison .	-3.5866
Basharat Ditta , 42 , supplied underworld size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information on his activities in drug trafficking after compromising his own cocaine addiction .	-3.3307
The lawyer , praised by criminalists as “ first-class ” with the nickname “ Bash ” , was arrested in his house in 2011 after the police had monitored Scarborough , whom he represented in a previous drug procedure .	-4.6752
Officials observed how Scarborough ( 32 ) delivered three bags cocaine at the house of the attorney in Blackburn , Lancashire , while he was with colleagues at a meal of the attorney chamber .	-3.3620
The investigations showed that Ditta regularly consumed class A drugs after testing traces of cocaine had been found in his hair , his wallet and credit cards .	-4.0615
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011 , he tried to obtain unauthorized information on the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners .	-7.4665
All four suspects were monitored by the police in the context of a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trading in Lancashire , Cumbria , Merseyside , Berkshire and West Yorkshire .	-3.0531
Together with 32 other people , they were arrested later , after the police secured heroin and cocaine in a number of household searches worth 1.5 million pounds and 200,000 pounds of cas.	-11.1595
Ditta , 42 , passed on information to the criminals because he feared that his drug addiction could become public .	-2.7035
Today , Ditta , who works for Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn , was found guilty and condemned at the Liverpooler Crown Court after a three-week proceedings in two charges for the disability of justice .	-9.8432
He admitted cocaine ownership in an earlier survey .	-2.9899
The lawyer was transferred after the police found out in their investigations against Scarborough that he had regularly contacted Ditta in February 2011 .	-8.4032
Two investigative officials followed the suspect and saw how he went to Ditta ’ s house and put drugs under the lawyer ’ s rubbish with a purity of 60 % in a black golf glove .	-4.1837
Shortly after he had delivered the drugs , Scarborough regularly called Ditta , who was at the football stadium of the Blackburn Rovers in Ewood Park at the dinneend . listening to the listenweather lists .	-11.4807
The lawyer returned home , fetched the drugs , and then nine communications were exchanged between the two .	-12.3378
In court , it became known that Ditta was a “ regular consumer ” of cocaine after tests of class A drugs had been discovered in his hair , wallet and credit cards .	-4.6024
Ditta was arrested later , but denied cocaine and said that he spoke to the alleged dealer because he was his client , and claimed that her discussion was subject to “ lawyer secrecy . ”	-4.4047
During his arrest , Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards , but they were ensured and his hair sample was taken .	-3.3429
At the police interrogation he said that he operated an office and client at home for legal matters , both at his private address and at work .	-5.6300
It was announced in court that he had called important drug trafficking players , some of whom he had previously represented , for significant arrests and informed what the investigators knew about them .	-4.6836
Public prosecutor Anne Whyte said : “ A lawyer should know better than anyone else that the law is not breaking . ”	-2.8966
Ditta is accused of misuse of his position as a criminal defender , because he has engaged with certain clients too much .	-4.1137
The relationship in question is not just that of a drug trafficker , but of a drug trafficker who provides his lawyer with drugs .	-2.8641
Some of his communications were undoubtedly legitimate because he was the lawyer of these people .	-10.7205
But that went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between lawyer and client .	-2.2814
He contradicted police investigations as far as possible , so that they could continue to follow up their criminal activities .	-12.4272
Mr Ditta brought his profession into disrepute .	-2.6335
He was too close to certain clients , especially Scarborough , and he allowed his independence to be compromised .	-2.2246
Ditta pointed out every misbehaviour of himself , claiming that “ If I were a corrupt lawyer , which I am not , and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough , I would not wait 15 hours , but do so immediately . ”	-4.8320
But after the hearing , Superintendent Lee Halstead said from the police in Lancashire : “ Mr Ditta has taken the step from a criminal defender to a criminal at the moment when he began to acquire drugs from organised criminals . ”	-3.7015
His cocaine dependence led to hopeless compromise and made him susceptible to the motives of leading members of organized crime commissioned him to obtain valuable information on police investigations .	-3.8270
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure public confidence and confidence .	-2.1155
Ditta has left this confidence and tried to hide behind the facade of his profession .	-4.0566
The Serious and Organised Crime Unit of Lancashire headed the investigations against Ditta , which also led to condemnation in three cases because of the possession of cocain and judicial disability , which underlines our determination to bring criminals to justice .	-3.9771
This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that no one can escape the arm of the law .	-2.3502
We will find you and bring you to court .	-1.9018
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after he had declared himself guilty of the conspiracy to heroin , cocaine and cannabis trade .	-3.1126
Thirty-five other drug trafficking involved — people were sentenced to total penalties of 153 years for drug offences .	-9.4571
On his website , Ditta published an area with questions and answers about himself , in which he indicated that his dream job is to represent clients in the death cell in America , his ultimate guest at dinner is Mohammed Ali and inequality of opportunity is the motivation for his work .	-4.0970
Revolutionary Work of Church Music	-1.5056
At the end of the celebrations of its 160-year-old existence , the song crane Dunningen will surround two services with the " Deutsche Messe " by Franz Schubert .	-4.3903
After the great success of the musical " Rock my Life " , which enthusiastically inspired the spectators in the spring of this year , the song writer will enrich two services of divine performance at the German Fair of Franz Schubert at the end of the anniversary of e e . e lelee e e e e leles leleles les les les	-13.5140
On Saturday 26 October , this extraordinary exhibition will be heard from 19 a.m. during the evening at the St. Martinuskirche Dunningen and on Sunday 27 October , at 10.15 a.m. at the service of divine at the St. Johannes Baptistkirche in Lackendorf .	-4.9630
The so-called Deutsche Messe with the original title " Gesänge zur Feier des heiliges Victiges der Messe " , D 872 , is a spiritual music work by the composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was almost revolutionary at the time of the creation .	-4.6765
The trade fair is listed in the framework of services , as the client Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind .	-3.9930
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider , the choir is accompanied by the brass group of the Musikverein Frohsinn Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi on the organ .	-3.0596
Haslach : Skepticism Grows Confidence	-2.9428
The 2015 parish council elections will , for example , change fundamentally in the Haslach Sealcare Unit ( SE ) .	-4.1708
There is only one common parish council for all six parishes .	-2.3511
At a joint meeting on Saturday the bodies of Haslach , Hofstetten , Mühlenbach , Fischerbach , Steinach and Welschensteinach prepared for the changes .	-15.4837
After all , there is nothing to change the fundamental decisions of the diocese and it is up to the parish councils to implement them as satisfactorily as possible .	-4.4232
Over the course of the day it became particularly clear : the scepticism of the new , however , is increasingly soft in confidence .	-5.3037
From the ideas and expectations of the innovations in 2015 to concrete proposals on the future composition and the size of the parish council , the extremely constructive discussions of the six bodies with the main officials of the sea care team ranged .	-4.4700
Regionaldekan Georg Schmitt explained the new guidelines for sea care units in the Archdiocese Freiburg through a presentation .	-4.0885
After that , the SE Haslach as a church community will in future form a corporation of public law that enters into the rights and obligations of the six individual church communities .	-4.9059
There will only be a common parish council and a board of foundations in which the Pastor is represented .	-4.9392
At least two elected members are to be represented from each parish ; in the six parishes so-called community teams are formed on the ground .	-4.5237
Their task will be to promote church life in the place .	-3.1789
The question of the finances of the individual parish community then showed considerable needs for discussion .	-4.6879
The innovations provide for accumulated credits to be maintained in the parishes .	-4.1005
The liabilities , on the other hand , are transferred to the community as a whole .	-3.4239
There were great concerns about the major planned investments , whose commitment then affects all parishes .	-4.3913
" Also in the past was invested only in projects that could be managed by the individual parishes alone " , relativised Haslach 's parish chairman , Bruno Prinzbach .	-4.4405
Practical experience with a common body for five parishes described Barbar Knights , the chairman of the body in the Sealcare Unit Shutterwald-Neured .	-10.4064
They had made themselves the task in 2006 , " One will , five remain " and they had to note that this is not so simple .	-6.0050
The Haslacher Seelsorgeunit bodies then answered questions about the future composition and size of the common parish council and the practical work of the local teams .	-4.3073
The preparations will be concrete in further meetings and will be adopted at another joint meeting of all six bodies next spring .	-3.6787
At the end , Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the soul unit , which was approved by a clear majority .	-4.1391
In Pfullendorf , the Electricity Gets Expensive	-8.0410
The citizens of Pfullendorf must adjust to higher electricity costs .	-12.7845
As confirmed by the Managing Director of the Stadtwerke , Jörg-Arne Bias , opposite the S<unk>DKURIER , a four-person Pfullendorf family costs 70 to 90 euros per year .	-4.2720
The main reason for the upcoming price increase is the increase in the so-called EEC levy from 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt hour .	-3.5904
Every year in October , this levy is redefined by the four operators of the major electricity roads .	-4.3512
These indicate the additional costs incurred by the energy change , which they can collect through a levy over the electricity price .	-5.6863
The Pfullendorf town plants form the last link in this chain .	-2.8241
In its forecasts , the Supervisory Board of the Energy Company was even based on a higher levy , as Jörg-Arne Bias reports .	-3.5366
Now the concrete payments would have to be calculated before the urban plants could inform their customers about the exact price increase next week .	-3.8231
" We go from an increase of 1 cent plus x " , says Bias , with the number rather close to the 2 cents .	-4.0744
Long-term traffic lights : Expect waiting time	-5.2474
Sometimes a traffic light is simply not green .	-2.0370
The contact loop in the street does not react , or the light character is broken .	-2.7994
What should you do - drive at red ?	-3.8685
If a stakeholder has been waiting long enough at a red traffic light and the intersection is free , he can continue , explains the Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine " Motorrad " .	-10.9159
However , the waiting time must be ' appropriate ' , which may be interpreted differently from case to c.	-8.6056
Becker advises you to persist at least five minutes before the traffic lights are disturbed .	-4.0174
However , anyone who continues the journey despite red light must be aware that he is fully responsible for an accident caused by it .	-4.5946
Anyone who tolerates less than five minutes may not wait long enough , warns Becker and refers to a decision by the Upper Land Court Hamm .	-10.0443
In the negotiated case , a driver had ignored the traffic lights after about three minutes of permanent red and had to account for a negligent red light breach .	-3.8948
The traffic lights were not broken , but jumped to green a little later .	-3.0747
A driving ban saved him because of the particular situation - but not the fine .	-3.7053
The Council of Municipalities is pleased with a solid budget	-3.4276
Whenever it comes to the budget in the Council of Municipalities , mayor Ralph Gerster has laughed well .	-3.8805
The municipal bag in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and the administration has not known since 2005 .	-3.4905
The 2012 financial year can also be considered to be a full success in this sense .	-3.4659
This became clear when the annual accounts were presented for 2012 .	-3.2212
As Andrea Rothmund explained , the administrative budget was about EUR 7.6 million higher than planned .	-2.4913
The surplus of the administrative budget , too , is about EUR 1.8 million above the approach .	-2.7109
The surplus is due , above all , to higher trade tax revenues and the local share of income tax .	-10.1262
The asset budget was also clearly above the planned values .	-3.1153
Instead of the EUR 1.5 million envisaged last year , it amounted to EUR 2.5 million .	-2.5325
" This is essentially due to the higher administrative budget supply , " said Rothmund .	-3.4444
As fewer investments have been made than planned in the 2012 financial year , reserve feeding has also been higher .	-4.2275
A total of EUR 2.1 million in the general reserve has been increased to EUR 4.9 million now .	-12.9592
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for their good work .	-1.5786
" Such a work is not just shaken out of the sleeve , " Gerster praised with a view to the annual account .	-4.1865
He and the municipalities were visibly pleased with the good figures .	-3.0674
It may sound paradoxical , but precisely these good figures could soon be expensive for citizens .	-3.1696
The good financial situation has led the municipality to abandon high lifting rates in the past .	-4.5934
According to Gerster , however , subsidies have been cut by the country many times .	-4.0870
There are conditions for these subsidies from various compensatory sticks .	-3.4280
Among other things , the cities and communities that apply for subsidies must show certain lifting rates .	-3.8019
" We need to look at the issue of lifting products , because in the coming years investments for which we would like subsidies " , Gerster announced in this context .	-5.3063
Nagold : Hugo Wermter for 60 years in the Choir	-1.9226
With 60 years as a singer , Hubert Wermter ’ s history at the men ’ s singer Cäcilia is almost twice as long as that of the autumn festival , in which he was solemnly honored .	-4.3723
Hubert Wermter stood on stage as usual in the colors of his male song club .	-3.0616
Even after 60 years , singing with the choir now probably more than dear is still great fun .	-4.8380
Wermter was also active in the association , including 28 years as a member of the committee .	-2.6392
He received several awards for his commitment and his faithfulness : Jörg Kohr , Pastoral Referent on behalf of the Cäcilienverband Rottenburg-Stuttgart , presented him - since the choir is also a church choir - a document of the association and an honorary letter signed by Bishop Gebhard Prince .	-11.2303
His singer colleagues handed over to him the certificate of the German Choir Association as well as a grave tin tender .	-4.9522
In addition to the honour , the 31st autumn festival was in usual tracks : With the MGV Betra , the songwriter Salzstetten , the singer department Baisingen and the local music association , the full maringers had loaded a colourful mixture of different choirs and singing styles , which maintained around 400 visitors .	-6.2902
The MGV Full Maringen opened with atmospheric songs such as " In the Wine Paradise " and " Lustig , their Brothers " .	-3.5229
Her honorary singer Hubert Wermter prepared for honor a small stand - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart 's " Bundeslied " .	-4.4017
The men ’ s singing association Betra also sang classical choral songs such as “ Jägerwerben ” by Julius Wengert , “ Far away ” by Hubert Goisern and the folk song “ When you go through the valley ” .	-4.5315
With its mixed choir and its women 's group - the " Impulschor " - the songwriter Salzstetten provided the women 's quota of the festival .	-5.4100
The mixed choir kidnapped with the Neapolitan nation " Santa Lucia " and " Eviva Espana " of Antos Gus in foreign countries , while the " Impulschor " also used foreign languages : " Liberatio " and " Hey Jew " belonged to their program .	-4.4055
The singer department of the Baisinger Sportsverein came back to home with " What the Schwob ? " by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Papperts " Bierlied " , where the Full Maring Music Association offered the crowning musical degree .	-9.8390
For the children there was a small by-program - " Oma Hanne " alias Hannelore Stollsteimer listed a Casperlsteimer theatre and read a few stories that children were busy at noon .	-5.0043

Kenya ’ s Press Indignates Media Act	-3.6802
“ We are in a frightening position and we can ask ourselves what does Parliament stop simply abolishing judicial independence tomorrow ? ” was the newspaper that does not consider the draft law to be constitutional ?	-8.8938
“ The law is draconian and very punishing and we reject it , ” said Cyrus Kamau , Managing Director of the Capital Group , including CapitalFM , one of the most prestigious independent radio stations and news sites in Kenya .	-3.3064
He said that the new media tribunal “ will always be biased , because it is an extended arm of the government , ” and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya ’ s position in the global economy .	-11.0358
“ I hope the President listens to us and we appeal to him to reject this draft legislation and send it back to Parliament , ” he said .	-3.1702
According to the newspaper The Star , the government takes “ the media effectively into a dictatorship , ” while The Standard , Democracy , and Freedom of Speech in Kenya suffered “ a serious blow , ” and titled the draft as “ draconian . ”	-5.1616
The adoption of the law is part of a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security after the attacks by armed Islamists to the Western Gate Shopping Centre in September .	-3.4031
The Kenyan media raged authorities ’ anger because they published recordings of safety cameras on which to see how the units sent to the cathedral allegedly robbed the luxurious shopping centre .	-5.3087
Police chief David Kimaiyo responded to this by including two journalists and a leading media representative , interrogating even though the submission was withdrawn after an outcry of the media .	-4.2088
According to the new law , media houses can be punished with a penalty of up to 20 million Kenyan shillings , and individual journalists with up to a million and the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from an official press accreditation .	-12.6800
The tribunal also has the right to confiscate the possession of those affected if a penalty is not paid .	-3.1642
According to Daily Nation , “ a single punishment can push most radio stations into bankruptcy . ”	-2.5712
Moreover , the newspaper believes that these measures could have a destructive impact on Kenya ’ s description of “ lively blogosphere . ”	-2.8669
If they were to silence the media , politicians could do whatever they want .	-2.3256
“ Nobody will ever know , ” wrote Mutuma Mathiu , a journalist at the nation who calls the Kenyan media a crucial control factor in public life .	-3.6236
“ If politicians are left to themselves , they lead the country into bankruptcy and return to the time of hunters and collectors , ” he commented .	-13.0132
Kenya ’ s legislators have already raised public anger in the past .	-3.3943

Bad Dürrheim : A Dream True for the FC	-1.8023
The official inauguration ceremony for the Kunstrasensportplatz , despite the cold weather and rain , could not lose any significance for the city and the football club .	-5.1947
A more pleasant celebration last Saturday probably all wanted , but Peter did not want to play with it .	-13.3361
For example , all those who came without a umbrella or who could not keep one for some reason .	-4.8411

Already 15 years ago , there were the first considerations about solving the problem when constructing a third place at the terrain of the football club or at the real school at the Salinensee .	-5.4117
Both were rejected .	-9.2034
Six years ago , thoughts arose to create an artificial grass place , which was generally considered the ultimate solution .	-4.0548
Specific plans were included two years ago , when the FC took over the Herbpacht Schabelstube , promised a share of EUR 100 000 for the construction of the square and approved the country funding of EUR 104 000 .	-4.8488
In October 2012 , the Council decided to take over the remaining EUR 356 000 at the total cost of EUR 560 000 , Klumpp summarised .	-3.0048
The construction start of the 68 times 108 metres large artificial grass square was held on 4 June .	-5.1644

There were threats of avoidance on roads that are already accident priorities .	-4.3974
The introduction of a toll for all cars would also be a first step from the point of view of Pronold .	-3.0824
" There is a danger that the compensation for Germans will be deleted at a later date , " he said .	-2.9869

Vienna Airport abolishes passenger calls	-2.2371
Mr Max Maier , please come to Gate 24 .	-1.1469
Like this , there will no longer be at Vienna-Schwechat airport .	-11.3209
Much of the speaker passages fall away - the noise level should be reduced significantly .	-4.4240
To create a more relaxed atmosphere is the aim of this innovation .	-2.2063
As Airport-Speaker Peter Kleemann announced to Radio Vienna , Vienna Airport follows an international trend with the recruitment of cases affecting individuals .	-3.8795

By removing these cancellations - on average sound around 200 personal calls by the speakers on one day - it is intended to be more calm at the airport in fut.	-14.1408

Half crushed , mature banana , for example , can replace an egg as a binder in a cake .	-2.7280
Also 50 grams of apple or a tablespoon ground linen plus three tablespoons of water are suitable for this .	-12.0811
For example , eggs are easily mixed with a mixture of a teaspoon baking powder , a tablespoon of dining starch and three tablespoons of mineral water .	-5.7721
But even 50 grams of soyajoghurt or silk tofu can meet this purpose .	-7.9808
According to the Vebu , some 800 000 people in Germany are currently feeding vegan , i.e. purely vegan .	-3.7095
Sleepless in New York	-1.0326
On the way to their host families in Weymouth , Massachusetts , the students of the Black Forest Gymnasium met the American city of New York .	-3.2069
After eight hours of flight , it started to Brooklyn Bridge , which was reached on foot the heart of the city , Manhattan .	-4.0180
Already there was a fascinating view of the world-famous skyline , which is a special charm in the evening light .	-4.4135
By the time shift , students were almost 24 hours on their legs , but faithful to the motto " The city does not sleep " the day was decided on Times Square .	-4.6029

The newly designed opschlag shines with a new cafe .	-2.4276
One that invites you to stay and return .	-2.7499
One that wants to make the name of the program .	-2.7303
According to Lexicon , Déjà Vu is a psychological phenomenon that expresses itself in the feeling that a new situation has already experienced or seen .	-3.4629
In the case of visiting the homonymous café at the Opschlag in the district town of Kleve in view of the Rhine-Waal University , it does not have to stay with the pure Déjà Vu feeling .	-5.2832
After all , the café with its beautiful name is designed to make a real stay not only thoughtful but handful of repeated experiences .	-5.8285
Because it 's just fun and simply is beautiful .	-2.6785
A look into the inner life at Opschlag 8 gives the viewer a good feeling at high speed .	-4.0148
The state-of-the-art but not cool café ambience looks like a place to feel good .	-3.1630
Here , the team spoils the guest with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the top with various coffee or cocktail variants .	-3.7486
There are delicious cakes or individually occupied fresh baguettes .	-2.7743
The owners , both 33 years old , have already made a name before the opening of the jewellery café at the Opschlag as gastronomers : in Kranenburg they led the " Art Lounge " .	-8.6393
From moving to Kleve to the Opschlag , the friendly café lovers hope for more audiences .	-17.5769
Last but not least through the university .	-2.2670
" While we do not have a specific target group , " Daniel Büttner emphasizes .	-2.9456
Rather , the two students here want to mention just as much as senior citizens and all ages bet.	-12.7484
Apropos Café lovers .	-3.1314
The friendly owner couple stands behind coffee pleasure .	-3.6296
Enjoy the fragrant hot brew in the most diverse variations .	-13.0529
Express Fan	-1.5828
Daniel Büttner is more the Expresso fan and Mirjam van der Stelt the Cappuccino drinker .	-2.2784
" A baguette - this is my thing " , she tells the NRZ .	-3.6289
Two events were also available in the bright café.	-10.7008
Better to say one thing .	-1.9795
Because the port festival took place outside - the Café Déjà Vu did not benefit from it .	-3.9844
But there was also the Ringelnatz evening .	-2.7619
" Beautiful , successful and funny " , found the two 33-year-olds .	-2.5553
But not everyone 's thing .	-2.4806
Perhaps Daniel Büttner is not a pronounced fan of event evenings either : " You cannot make all the right " .	-4.9583
And with an event I only address those who are interested in the special event .	-11.1881
That is why events will be rather the exception to us .	-3.7715
" We want to disturb the normal operation as little as possible " .	-8.2136
Déjà Vu also stands for reliability .	-2.8597
With regard to the quality of the products offered here , as well as to the team and the beautiful surroundings at the Opschlag in Kleve .	-9.9131
The road that is becoming more and more a gastronomic mile .	-3.8027
For the pleasure of many Klever , the guests from near and far and the students who discover the gastronomy and thus also the Café Déjà Vu for themselves .	-4.8415

UN Announces New Goals in the fight against poverty	-3.2815
The United Nations is now beginning to draw up a series of new objectives to replace the Millennium Development Goals announced 12 years ago to combat poverty .	-3.5723
In the run-up to the UN Summit on Sustainable Development , which began in Rio de Janeiro in the evening , Australian diplomats played a key role in advancing “ Sustainable Development Goals ” to replace the 2015 Millennium Goals .	-3.3531
They were included in the final draft document adopted by global leaders , including Mrs Gillard , at the summit .	-2.5565
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon declared in the evening at the summit that the time had come to “ think beyond national interests . ”	-3.4689
“ I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to tackle a process to agree on universal , sustainable development objectives , ” he said .	-3.0402
“ These objectives will be based on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and will form an integral part of the post-2015 framework .	-10.7805
I will spare no effort to implement this mandate given to me by the Member States in order to achieve our vision of the sustainable development objectives based on the success of the Millennium Goals . ”	-3.5700
Although the SG Achim / Baden has been without victory for four days , the Handball Oberligists continue to have a good mood .	-3.6228
Tomasz Malmon has no doubt about this .	-3.1938
All of them are still fully motivated .	-2.8833
Nevertheless , I hope that we will finally win again .	-3.1403
" Because I don 't know how such a victory tastes anymore , " Malmon expects a success experience from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II .	-3.6999
Although the third League reserve from Fredenbeck has not currently destroyed trees , Malmon is warning in advance the finger .	-15.6296
I have trained many players myself in the A youth .	-3.6127
Therefore they will certainly be motivated against their ex-coach .	-9.9339
" It is also necessary to wait for the first time to be reinforced , " explains the SG-Coach .	-5.9744
In order to finally return to the success track , the Malmon team must certainly increase compared to the past performances .	-4.4637
Above all , in the cover work and in the switching game , it happened enormously .	-6.0083
Exploitation of opportunities must definitely improve .	-10.2774
Therefore , I hope that my players will finally have the head free during the short break .	-3.8374
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing in the face of clashes between influential personalities	-11.8561
Thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo under the watchful eyes of the statue of Samora Machel , the state founder and first president of Mozambique to vote for peace calls in a rare public demonstration .	-3.7863
“ We want peace again , we want stability , ” said Vanessa de Sousa , Managing Director of an investment company .	-1.9233
Fear of the country ’ s future , she has exchanged her business clothing for a T-shirt with the inscription “ We demand security ” in Portuguese and joined the quantity on Thursday on the independence square of the capital .	-4.7048
For two weeks , there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo , one of the worst fights since the peace agreement over 20 years ago .	-3.7469
Renamo was once an infamous rebel movement , supported initially by the White Rhodesia and later by the South African apartheid government in an effort to destabilize the country ’ s independent government .	-3.9965
After the 1992 peace treaty , it became an opposition party .	-1.8617
Analysts think it is unlikely that the country will fall back into a full conflict , but recent events have worried foreign investors and locals .	-3.2107
The rapidly growing economy is at stake , because the discovery of huge gas deposits off the coast and coal bearings in the north-west could bring investments of more than $ 50 billion in companies like Rio Tinto , Vale from Brazil , Eni from Italy , and Anadarko from the United States in the coming years .	-4.8137
The ruling Frelimo Party , since 1975 the dominant force , and Renamo blame each other for tension .	-2.5160
Renamo claims that the government has provoked the recent clashes by attacking its members in the province of Sofala , a traditional Renamos castle on 17 October .	-3.1394
The attacks on the previous rebels escalated when Renamo forces attacked and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama , the leader of the group , Renamo ’ s spokesman against the Financial Times .	-3.7116
The government blames Renamo for the clashes and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers .	-2.1175
President Armando Guebuza has tried to downplay concerns about instability .	-1.6728
On Wednesday , he said to AFP , the French news agency , that Dhlakama regards himself as “ losers ” who wants to “ use all his remaining forces to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government . ”	-9.1761
Both Frelimo and Renamo point out that they want to avoid war .	-8.7941
But concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted in the words that Renamo abandoned the 1992 peace agreement .	-8.4637
He explained to the FT that he meant that Frelimo no longer respects the agreement .	-2.7284
“ Our vision is to resume negotiations seriously , ” said Mazanga .	-2.2974
Previous talks between the parties have contributed little to resolving the tensions that have been fired by a number of clashes this year .	-3.4321
“ We have two adult men here ( Guebuza and Dhlakama ) who collide the heads ” , says Joseph Hanlon , lecturer at the Open University and Mozambique expert .	-3.3229
None of them is well negotiated and none is prepared to make the necessary concessions .	-2.1842
Renamo , pushing for electoral reforms , has already stated that it will boycott local elections in November .	-2.7505
Presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for next year .	-1.8091
Some commentators have interpreted the use of force as an attempt by a sickening movement to obtain concessions and financial benefits from the government .	-3.0270
Renamo ’ s electoral success has been shrinking since 1992 , while a newer party , founded by a former Renamo member , Movimento Democrático de Mo<unk>ambique ( MDM ) , is likely to improve in the elections .	-3.2140
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – whose resignation is due when his second term ends next year – wants to destroy the country ’ s democracy .	-2.7090
“ He does not want multi-party democracy , he does not want transparent elections , he does not want peace because he does not want to give up the presidency , ” says Mazanga .	-6.8674
It is unclear what Renamo capacity has , but it has undertaken unrest attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important North-South connection .	-3.9149
Most of the struggles took place in the province of Sofala , which is located a few hundred kilometres north of Maputo , but in which Beira is located , the port , the mining companies like Rio Tinto and Vale use to export coal .	-4.9321
In June , Rio interrupted the use of the railways for a month after Renamo had announced an attack on the route .	-12.7329
Mazanga responded cautiously to the question of whether Renamo would repeat this threat .	-3.0078
Renamo wanted to “ warn the international community that things are not good in Mozambique , ” said Mazanga .	-2.0392
Instability has increased frustration over the government , says Fernando Lima , head of Mediacoop , an independent media company , because many people have already worried about corruption , slow progress in development and a recent abduction wave .	-3.3311
“ People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country , and that he should be the one who finds solutions to the problems , ” he explains .	-2.9351
Omar Sultane , a demonstrator , said that people simply wanted stability .	-1.6388
“ No interest Renamo and Frelimo , they just want peace and usable streets again , ” he explained .	-3.4018
Children should be taught myths and legends as “ models for life , ” says an author .	-3.0942
Thor ’ s stories showed that “ brutal power has no chance of clever tricks , ” and the Artus legend demonstrates how important it is to have a dream .	-2.8767
Many of the myths , however , are “ far too wild , too offensive , and in some cases too dirty to be taught at schools , ” which is why Crossley-Holland argued for a “ careful selection ” of old works .	-3.7536
“ I find it wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education , ” he said .	-2.1870
I have been proposing this as a plan for twenty years .	-1.9374
He added that , among authors and teachers who are “ excessively didactic , ” children would “ disable ” completely , because in entertaining stories , the messages would be “ sublime . ”	-4.4948
Crossley-Holland , who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon , and is the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myth and the British Folk Tales , said : “ You can pursue certain intentions , but you should keep them in the background as possible . ”	-3.4920
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an author writing for children is the need to give hope .	-2.8155
Not everything must be simplified or lead to the happy end , but there is an immanent sense of good and evil .	-2.3310
This must be underthrown , revealed by history and not explained .	-4.0004
This is the old story of showing instead of telling .	-2.3466
Hansjakob Draws Once again in Freihof	-3.1222
A hundred years ago , Heinrich Hansjakob retired in Haslach , and his last years in the " Freihof " became alive on Sunday .	-4.9531
The many spectators were enthusiastic about the very short scene game .	-3.3115
From the arrival to the award of honorary citizenship to his death , screenwriter and actor Hansjakob Alois Kraftzcyk had designed an entertaining piece of applause under the direction of Cornelia People .	-4.3073
Marcus Zagermann took the audience as a spokesman with the ten different scenes , explained connections and bridged jumps from youth to nearby retirement .	-3.6170
On October 22 , 1913 Hansjakob comes home in his children 's sky , in his Freihof .	-3.9242
And then began the scene game in which Alois Krafczyk once again shined in his paraderolle as a great son of the city .	-3.2271
He followed his style with the two-spanner and " Black Forest Foxes " by Erich Becherer from Mühlenbach .	-5.2874
He was not only received by the audience with a lot of applause , but his sister Philippine also welcomed him .	-3.2427
Billy Sum-Hermann understood it incredibly well to put himself in the role of the sister and awarded her huge life in mimic and gesture .	-4.0028
Between the individual game scenes , the Mühlenbach Farmers ' Chapel played appropriately selected pieces of music and rounded off the performance .	-10.1852
Haslach ’ s mayor , Heinz Winkler , gave himself the honour to award the honorary citizenship , which , in representation of the then incumbent of Hättich , together with a part of the City Council , made his appearance .	-6.6689
Their expectations then made the three-kings who led Hansjakob to the exclamation : " Ah how beautiful , there are young memories of my own three-kingdom . "	-6.7865
With their song " O Jesulein " they enjoyed the audience in the Freihof as well as the stork day children with their noisy " public out " .	-4.3630
His criticism of the Official Church had expressed Hansjakob as much as his concerns about the excesses in agriculture , the consequences of industrialization or the effects of war .	-4.1340
In his hometown , behind his tomb chapel on the fire at Hofstetten , he found his resting place .	-4.1128
" A troubled spirit had finally found its peace and had gone home forever , " it was said at the end of the scene .	-4.1791
Much applause and many praising words were made by the audience for performance .	-3.4931
Basketball : The Hope of Neckar Giants Grows	-2.3081
The opportunities for the league of the sporty descending Ludwigsburg Bundesliga basketballers have increased .	-3.9574
For if there is a wildcard procedure , then there is a competitor less for the Neckar giants .	-3.4920
The basketball project Hamburg Towers refrains from applying for a possible retrofitting place .	-3.8407
" We will not participate in the Wildcard procedure , " said ex-national player Pascal Roller , who since 2012 has set up the concept for a professional club in the Hanseatic city .	-3.6530
Nevertheless , a first breath was not to be heard from Ludwigsburg .	-3.7110
" We didn 't deal with the wildcard procedure until it is established that Düsseldorf does not receive a license , " said Neckar-Giant Boss Alexander Reil of our newspaper .	-4.0979
Until 23 May , Aussteiger Düsseldorf Baskets can submit documents to the Arbitration Court and demonstrate its economic suitability for .	-11.2758
So far , the Rhinelands have been refused the license twice .	-3.1399
The arbitration court is the last instance .	-1.9047

As a contribution of the city to the 150th anniversary of the Evangelical Church in Haigerloch , the Cultural and Tourism Office of the City dedicates the last of its public topics this year on Sunday , October 27th , the Church of Abendmahlskirche .	-4.9122

Rhenus Midgard has also invested strongly on land .	-2.3009
They distribute the coal coming from the ships into the hold .	-3.9051
The company has several iron in the fire at the location .	-9.3738
In addition to coal imports , Rhenus Midgard relies , among other things , on wind plant logistics .	-3.6272
Black shimmers the coal in front of the dike .	-3.7529
Two massive blue shaker and backload devices distribute or load coal here as required .	-4.6421
Every movement of the envelope sounds a shrill warning noise over the terrain .	-4.2864
" The signals serve security and are required by law , " says Matthias Schrell , Managing Director of the Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven .	-2.8246
Unfortunately , in the case of unfavourable winds , this is widely heard - and so there have already been some complaints from the city north .	-4.7174
He takes the complaints very seriously and has therefore made contact with those affected , says the 40-year-old .	-3.3859
In close consultation with the authorities , we must now keep the warning signals more quietly with technical measures .	-3.5160

Court blocks decision on the NYPD Stop and Frisk Directive	-2.9191
On Thursday , a federal appeal court in the USA blocked the arrangement of a judge calling for changes to the stop-and-frisk program ( “ Stop and search ” ) of the New York police department , and revoked the judge of the case .	-4.6372
The 2nd US Appeal Court declared that the decisions of Judge Shira Scheindlin would be suspended until the city was decided on appelin.	-5.2991
The judge had judged in August that the city violated the Constitution with the way in which the programme for the stopping and surveying of persons is implemented .	-3.8461
The city appealed against its assessment and the remedial measures ordered , including the decision to establish a monitoring body to support the police in amending their directive and the corresponding training programme .	-4.5084
The Appeal Court heard the arguments for suspension on Tuesday .	-2.4593
The Appeal Report stated that the judge must be excluded from the case , as she violated the code of conduct for US judges by determining that a judge should avoid the appearance of partiality ; this was partly justified by a number of media interviews and public statements in which she had publicly responded to the criticism of the Courlililililililililililililililililililililili	-11.4352
The judge had judged that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people , because they inappropriately target black and Latin American men with the stop-and-haircut programme .	-9.9912

Opponents believe that the changes would dampen the morality of the police , but not crime ; money would also be wasted and the broader problem of a police force that is under pressure after the disappearance of thousands of jobs in the last decade .	-4.8104
The judge pointed out that she does not end the stop and hairdressing practice , which is constitutional , but only reform the way NYPD controls are implemented .	-4.1708

Coulson used phone hacking to check a tip	-2.1694
The former News of the Word editor Andy Coulson allegedly used “ telephone hacking , monitoring and confrontation ” in trying to confirm an incorrect tip about an affair by the then Interior Minister Charles Clarke .	-4.1131
Andrew Edi ’ s QC prosecutor told the court in Old Bailey that News of the World heard a wrong rumour in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with his “ attractive special advisor ” Hannah Pawlby .	-3.6757
The newspaper commissioned the private detective of Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlby ’ s voicemails , and pursued them , but Coulson also called them and left news , as the court learned .	-8.4623
“ According to the Public Prosecutor ’ s Office , Coulson , who is now publisher of NotW , is no one who is in front of people ’ s housing and hopes to tap them freshly , but one who likes to face a story to see their response , ” Edis explainlilik.	-12.3725
He said NotW used three procedures to investigate stories : telephone hacking , monitoring and confrontation .	-2.4295
The publisher is personally involved in the third method .	-1.5160
Obviously he knows of the second , the monitoring , otherwise it cannot be .	-2.7496
What about the first ?	-1.1195
Does he know about the telephone hacking ? ???????li	-7.5600
He disputes this , but we say , “ And whether he knew about it . ”	-2.9455
Rumors about an affair of Clarkes were first taken up by NotW ’ s feature editorial , when a source that was sexually interested in Pawlby was said : “ Do not waste your time , she is together with Charles . ”	-11.3570
A volume of voicemails from her phone of at least three occasions was secured in August 2006 in Mulcaires apart.	-10.3083
The investigators also found entries on the computer of the detective where Pawlby and her sister were stored as “ projects ” .	-2.9739
At the time when the research was running , the grandparents of Pawlby received anonymous calls in which they were asked for information about them , Edis explained .	-3.8684
Meanwhile , former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup overseen the movements of Pawlby .	-2.1781
On 18 June 2005 , Coulson left her a voicemail with the following content : “ I have a story that we want to publish tomorrow , which I want to talk about with Charles . ”	-3.4325
Edis explained that Coulson ’ s activities in this story followed the same pattern as other important personalities , such as former interior minister David Blunkett .	-3.3964
The juries heard on Thursday that Coulson Blunkett faced a married woman due to an affair when he himself lied with the co-accused Rebekah Brooks , who had been married at that time .	-4.3465
Coulson and Brooks dispute having conspired to hack phones between October 3 , 2000 and August 9 , 2006 .	-2.8834

Gechingen : No absolute protection possible	-2.1536
" We want to involve the inhabitants early in planning , " opened the citizens ' information event on the flood protection concept in Gechingen .	-3.9671
Around 80 participants had entered the community hall to explain the planned measures , ask questions , express concerns and bring forward ideas .	-4.0428
Häu<unk>ler made it clear : " The ultimate decisions are made by the members of the Council of Municipalities " .	-11.0631
The flood that Gechingen met unprepared on 15 May 2009 was a significant event that raised the question of safeguards for the future , said Häusler .	-4.2393
A river area investigation had been commissioned with the neighbouring community of Aidlingen , which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen li.	-12.9204
" The protection of as many built plots as possible is the goal , " said Häu<unk>ler .	-3.3057
The planning of protection against a German weather service is based on statistics every 100 years of expected floods .	-3.9824
Climate change is taken into account by a 15 % surcharge .	-2.1362
In specialist circles this is called " HQ 100aKlima " .	-2.8787
The water masses that had caused considerable damage in Gechingen in 2009 corresponded to a 1000-year-old flood .	-3.3899
" There is no absolute protection , but a relative improvement can be achieved , " said Häu<unk>ler .	-2.6988
In order to achieve the protection of HQ 100aKlima , Gechingen needs to invest around EUR 4 million , with the municipality expecting around 70 % of national subsidies .	-4.8878
However , Häu<unk>ler pointed out that there is promotion only if an overall concept is implemented .	-4.1153
To this end , the municipality depends on the participation of citizens .	-3.7043
An expensive planning and authorisation procedure must be completed .	-2.2001
In the best case , implementation could begin in 2016 .	-2.1167
Among other things , the concept of protection , which was already presented in the Council of Municipalities last week ( we reported ) , provides for local measures influencing the river Irm from the Stammheimer Valley .	-4.2119
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept , participants took the opportunity to bring in their concerns .	-3.0882
Among other things , it questioned why no more dams and restraint basins are planned to protect the place .	-3.8902
Gregor Kühn , specialist planner of the engineering agency Forest and Corbe from Hügelsheim , who presented the concept , stressed that it needs to interplay all the measures presented to achieve the desired goal in the sum .	-5.1372
Furthermore , the most economical solution is to be found , according to Joachim Forest of Forest and Corbe .	-3.8206

The problem is well known in administration and first measures have already been taken .	-2.7752
However , Häu<unk>ler pointed out that the directives on channel systems are others than flood protection and this must not be mixed .	-4.2172
The municipality is obliged to interpret the channel network in such a way that two to three years of rainfall could be forced .	-4.0127
To dimensionize the wastewater channels larger would devour millions .	-3.8662

However , there are several witness statements that should only be evaluated .	-2.9957
It is certain that the 19-year-old handler of a VW Golf drove towards Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf came her with his Hyundai .	-13.7148

James Clapper , US Director of National Intelligence , insisted in September once again that the US did not set up opportunities for foreign spying “ to steal the operating secrets of foreign companies commissioned by US firms to expand their international competitiveness or profit . ”	-12.1379

Parents of a Georgian teenager who died in tragic accidents believe in murder	-2.3321
The parents of the teenager , whose body was found in a rolled ringer mat in the gym of his high school , are convinced that her son was murdered , explained the lawyer of the family on Thursday .	-3.9938
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta in the US state of Georgia was found on 11 January in an uprightly situated mat behind the gallery in the school gallery .	-4.2193
The investigators of the sheriff of Lowndes County concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident , but this doubts the 17-year-old family .	-3.5402
“ They are convinced that their son was murdered , ” said Benjamin Crump , the lawyer of Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson , against FoxNews.com.	-2.5447
They would never have believed that he died as the sheriff concluded .	-2.8128
“ They believe that there is no logic to violate the laws of physics and common sense , ” said Crump .	-3.5147
Rather , they are convinced that the truth will be covered up to protect the person or person responsible for the death of their son .	-9.4117
“ Your son went to school for learning and came back in the lightweight bag , ” he commented .	-4.1589
US Prosecutor Michael Moore said on Thursday that there will be a formal investigation into Johnson ’ s death , as a number of important issues remain unresolved .	-3.4314
What was the cause of death ?	-0.9170
Is his death due to a crime ?	-1.9241
The declared Moore at a press conference on Thursday afternoon .	-1.8839
I follow the facts in whatever direction they take .	-2.3887
My goal is to find out the truth .	-1.7491
“ I believe there is a sufficient basis for formal investigation , ” he said .	-2.0556
Moore explained to reporters , the initial autopsy suggested that Johnson died of the consequences of “ position-related suffocation . ”,	-11.6261
A second autopsy , however , resulted in a different cause of death , according to Moore .	-2.8475
“ There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed , ” he said .	-1.8384

CDC Publishing Allergy Guidelines for schools	-7.1359
On Wednesday , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) published a number of guidelines for dealing with food allergies from children at schools .	-2.8010
These are the first such directives issued by the US Government , as the number of children with food allergies is rising .	-3.6478
One of 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy .	-1.9852
According to the CDC , the spread of food allergies among children has increased by 18 % between 1997 and 2007 .	-8.6821
The guidelines provide information for schools to raise awareness of food allergies in the teaching body and employees , and to deal with children who show allergic reactions .	-4.2658
It is also recommended that schools have Epinephrin stock – the EpiPen auto injection is most commonly used – in order to counter a potentially deadly oversensitivity response .	-4.1954
Legislators in the states have recently changed the rules so that schools can keep Epinephrin simpler .	-3.4271
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms mentioned by children who have an allergic response .	-2.1362
Children may say : “ It feels like pressing something on my tongue , ” “ My tongue feels like a hair on it ” or “ cribbling my tongue . ”	-3.7129
Parents of intersexual children can choose “ Gender Undetermined ”	-2.8317
Germany is the first European nation in which a third gender is recognised for children born with unclear genitals .	-2.4606
Newborn is no longer assigned rigidly male or female .	-2.5840
According to the new law , parents no longer need to explain gender for such children , but can specify “ undetermined ” or “ undetermined ” on the birth certificate .	-4.1725
The objective of the law is to take the pressure from parents so that they do not have to take hasty decisions regarding gender assignments among newborn people and combat discrimination against intersexual people .	-11.2721
According to BBC , an intersexual person said , “ I am neither man nor woman . ”	-2.4815
I remain the patchwork created by doctors mutilated and full of scars .	-1.9879
It is estimated that one of 2,000 children each year is neither a boy nor a girl .	-3.1147
They are among the intersexuals , a group falling under the diagnosis of “ sexual differentiation disorder ” ( DSD ) , a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes , germs ( ovaries or hodes ) or unusually developed genitals .	-3.9874
Wallis Simpson may have been intersexual .	-1.6967
The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed , but most experts in the US advise that the best available gender information should be used if a provision is not possible , and not wait for the psychological and physical development of the child before choosing – if anything – for an operation .	-4.5324
The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher , who specializes in gender identification , said that the new German law “ sounds like a good thing . ”	-2.8178
Intersexual children are an ethical dilemma .	-1.4013
“ Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgical intervention , but most children do not do so , ” he said .	-3.0339
Gender allocation can be carried out without operation and then wait to see how identity develops .	-4.1370
The scientific data on how a child even develops its gender identity are not very precise .	-2.7240
No one knows why it is happening .	-1.5374
It is like the secret why people are homosexual .	-1.8886
A report to the European Commission in 2011 states that intersexual people should be distinguished from transsexual or transgender people , because their status is not gender-based , but because of their biological constitution , which is neither exclusively male nor female , but typically defines both simultaneously or not clearly as one of them .	-4.5645
These characteristics were shown in subsequent sexual characteristics such as muscle mass , hairing , breasts and stature , priority sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals , or chromosome structures and hormones .	-4.0233
The report also provides an overview of discrimination facing intersexuals and transgender people in professional life and the extent of harassment , violence and prejudice crime .	-3.3021
Not consistent with the gender image have a special camp now .	-3.5083
Meanwhile , in Australia and Nepal it is possible for adults to specify male , female or “ third sex ” on official documents .	-3.1392
In June , Australian Norrie May-Welby ( 52 ) was recognised as the world ’ s first “ genderless ” person after a court had granted lifelong retention of “ undetermined ” gender status .	-3.9497
In addition to M and W , German ID cards will have a third assignment , X for intersexual , according to the Ministry of the Interior .	-4.0499
In neighboring France , sexual issues are still controversial , such as a news report on France 24 .	-10.4336
In 2011 , dozens of French members of the strictly Catholic country signed a petition to remove the “ gender theory ” from school books .	-2.3837
The US website Catholic Online also opposed the German law , explaining : “ If the world is broken into a new state where gender is a decision , but not sexual activity , then we twist two other pillars of civilisation . ”	-4.3850
The mother of a newborn from Maryland explained to Baby Zone that it would be better if babies were allocated a gender at birth .	-3.2631
“ Parental being is already stressful enough without further restrictions , especially if you don ’ t know the sex of your child , ” she said to the parental website .	-4.1898
Children need stability and safety .	-0.9997
Historically , children born with both male and female sexual parts were called Hermaphrodites , after the attractive Greek God who had both sexes .	-3.0140
Ten years ago , medicine regarded gender as something that could be erased and then rebuilt .	-3.5143
But , in the meantime , the ethical foundations of an operation are being doubted , after knowing how complex gender identity is , and that doctors may be wrong because they do not know how the child feels when growing with the gender they assign .	-5.0191
“ In the middle of the twentieth century , one called the “ psychiatric emergency ” , said Drescher .	-3.6682
If such a child was born , it was not the psychiatrist , but the surgeons .	-8.5919
The prevailing theory about the treatment of children with non-clear genitals dates back to Dr John Money of Johns Hopkins University , who believed that gender is formable .	-3.9767
He shaped the term “ gender identity ” and argued , social and environmental impetus – such as parents educate a child – interacted with the genes and hormones of a child , characterizing whether a person considered male or female .	-4.0932
But in a case of 1966 known as John / Joan , his theories were controversial .	-3.2304
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been separated by a covered circumcision , to castrate the child completely and also to remove his hodes and then to grow him as a girl .	-5.7543
“ Money presented this case as a successful example of a conversion , which he was not , ” said Drescher .	-2.8545
When the boy was about 15 , he changed back to male sex and married a woman .	-10.9687
With 38 he committed suicide .	-2.3997
According to Drescher , there are still doctors who would practice this model .	-1.9960
But in the 1990 ’ s , with the Internet ’ s entry , survivors of these sex operations have come to the public , who are “ not happy with the result . ”	-11.0404
For example , Jim Bruce , a 36-year-old author from Montana , born with XY-male chromosomes , but ambiguous genitals .	-2.4881
The doctors were not clear about whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a “ satisfactory life ” as a man .	-3.0956
So his external organ and hodes were surgically removed shortly after birth in 1976 and he was greatly greeted as girls .	-4.4299
At the age of 12 he received female hormones .	-1.7817
“ I knew I am not a girl , ” he explained to ABCNews.com	-2.0480
I was unhappy , but it was really difficult to ask questions .	-1.4922
At the age of 18 he should receive a vaginal plastic .	-2.2835
But , as he was depressive and knew that something was not true , he demanded his medical files .	-3.0543
What he found was shocking .	-1.2988
I was sterilized at my birth – no one ever told me .	-9.3787
Bruce was born with a DSD that could not produce his body enough testosterone to develop genitals .	-2.6848
After learning the truth , he switched back to male identity , received testosterone injections and let his breasts remove .	-11.0978
The operation made it infertile .	-2.3776
Today , he fights for others in an organization called Interface Project for intersexual people to be perceived as normal .	-2.9338
But Anne Tamar-Mattis , Managing Director of the Advocates for Informed Choice legal group based in California , worries that the German law could “ encourage stamping and stigmatising . ”	-3.1484
“ Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make rapid decisions and to assign the child to the child , ” she explained .	-4.0638
We fear that this will favour interventions .	-2.4411
We think it would be better to allocate the male or female sex and then wait .	-2.3598
However , we do not know how the law will have an impact , so we can only speculate .	-2.8068
Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports the Australian law , because “ it allows adults to recognize as a third gender . ”	-2.8898
“ Adults should be able to make their own decisions on their legal sex , ” she explained .	-9.2930
The German law is about assigning birth .	-2.7907
This is not a battle at which small children should be forced at that time .	-3.4137
When they are grown up , they can decide on their bodies themsel.	-4.2290
But Dr. Arlene Baratz , a breast radiologist from Pittsburg , who has a daughter with a sexual disorder and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group , says that the German law “ authorized ” both parents and children .	-3.1358
Katie , the daughter of Baratz , was born with male chromosomes , but has a DSD called complete androgen resistance .	-2.2429
Katie developed female characteristics because of the receptor defect of the target cells for testosterone .	-3.0870
It has a vagina , but no uterus and no ovaries .	-7.0555
Today , Katie 29 is married ; she is working at the University of Pennsylvania as a staff in child psychiatry .	-3.4177
Although it is infertile , it hopes to get a child through adoption or a surrogate mother .	-3.1743
“ The law gives parents space , which does not require them to make decisions overwhelmingly , ” said Baratz .	-4.0770
It gives them the time to make different tests and clarify things and gives them time before they write “ male ” or “ female ” .	-3.1363
This way everything is fine – you draw the child big and love it .	-10.3668
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy parental happiness .	-2.2677
And you don 't have to do an operation that can no longer be reversed .	-4.2694
“ This includes children in the decision and eliminates the fear that parents are driving because they believe they would not do the right thing , ” she explained .	-4.0418
Ultimately , the child decides about the sex that fits better with him – and that is wonderful .	-2.9555
This enables children to take the decision themselves .	-2.2457
Unknown Injured Girls by Shot of Car	-7.5914
Unknown people have injured a twelve-year-old in Saxony-Anhalt for shots from a car .	-3.7929
On Thursday evening in Genthin , the perpetrators probably fired with an air pressure weapon on a group of children .	-2.9707
This was informed by the police in castle .	-2.7648
The girl was easily injured on the left wade .	-2.5800
Rescue forces brought the girl to the hospital .	-2.2129
The shot came from a small car that had passed a group of six children and suddenly stopped .	-2.7937
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car .	-1.4509
The perpetrators also shot on a bus stop .	-1.8907
A disc broke .	-1.6458
They then drove from it .	-2.4369
The criminal police determined it on Friday .	-2.3260
Until now , the Kempten police inspection can look back on a quiet Halloween night .	-2.5471
Officials were called only twice to throw children against house facades .	-4.0973
Since the house owners recognized this in good time and removed the egg remains equally , no material damage has been caused .	-5.2542
Furthermore , some Sylvester Böllers have been ignited in the urban area , but no material damage has occurred here .	-5.2507
A resident in the Bischof-Freundorfer-Weg reported that his car was wrapped with clopaper and his wheelchairs were deployed .	-4.7145
Until the police arrived , however , the man found his wheelchair blends in the immediate vicinity , so the police did not need to continue to act .	-14.0774
Living with a Future Perspective	-2.2074
Actually , Waltraud Ries lives dreamfully .	-2.6935
Your house is situated in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with much green , an old tree stock , nice neighbours and not too much traffic .	-3.3007
The city is only a few minutes away by public transport .	-2.7291
" Hopefully you have no fear of spiders ? " , asks Waltraud Ries and points to a fat spider on the door frame .	-3.2638
I have been looking for a new apartment for my husband and me for some time .	-2.2404
But you know how difficult it is in Stuttgart .	-1.8026
The reason , however , is not a spider phobia , but the concern that at age the many staircases can no longer cope with the house and apartment , she explains .	-5.0040
Moreover , since a meniscus operation , the mid-fifties have had to know their own body what it means to move with handicap from floor to floor .	-4.3609
Recently , a book from her appeared on the subject of ' happy living in age - What form of residence is the best for me ? ' .	-4.7355
'Our apartment is the best example of what does not go at all at the age ' , it begins to tell them .	-4.6753
When she moved to the maisonette apartment more than 20 years ago , it was simply a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green .	-3.1801
Today , with the middle of fifty , Waltraud Ries thinks differently about it .	-2.8551
However , she also knows that she is one of the few people who are dealing with the issue of living in age .	-4.2708
Most penetrate it as long as it goes .	-3.2132
Old are always only the others ' , she says smiling .	-3.3144
Only when the pressure of suffering is really great will one think about it ?.	-10.8144
'Then it can be too late ' , says Gies .	-3.5651
In her book , the interior architect presents 17 residential models for a self-determined living at age .	-3.1556
'What form of residence you choose is always an individual decision ' , she explains .	-3.2324
D i e solution does not exist for age .	-2.2425
Even those who can afford to retire in Tuscany or Brittany should always think that they can also become ill .	-4.0030
And : ' Without good knowledge of the country language you also join in Dolce Vita , ' the author of the book gives consideration to settlements .	-6.0296
Their models include classic care models , alternative forms of living or the often cited Rentner-WG .	-4.2214
At the age , everyone has his Ticks and Macks	-8.2279
'For me , such a community would be nothing ' , it means with an eye winker .	-3.8920
Already not like in a student WG with a shared bath and a kitchen .	-9.5616
'At age you simply need your retreat rooms ' , says Gies .	-4.5845
Nevertheless , the book author does not want to rule out the fact that a senior housing community can work .	-4.0968
However , this should be different from the classical student EC .	-4.4801
And sometimes you just want your calm , ' she believes .	-4.0835
With this opinion , at least in the capital , it is not alone .	-3.9894
'Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own apartment as long as they want , ' is also the experience of Theresa Rütten , the head of civil service life at the age of the capital .	-4.1871
Their service advises people around the subject of ' becoming older ' .	-4.0032
For this reason , the elderly would often take inconvenience and restrictions only to remain in their usual environment , which is also the experience of the Warentest Foundation .	-5.4447
Today there are many ways to make the house or the apartment accessible .	-3.3028
Ries recommends to anyone who deals with the age-oriented reconstruction of their house or apartment to inform themselves thoroughly and not to commission the first craftsman .	-6.4717
Today there are also specialists for age-oriented reconstruction .	-3.3323
Even in the rental apartment one or two can be realized , and if it is only the toilet seat increase , the interior architect explains .	-4.8586
But it is not always possible to redesign the existing apartment age-friendly and thus accessible , even if it is still so beautiful .	-5.2723
This experience had to make Waltraud Ries .	-1.5981
Although you could install a staircase lift within the apartment , which would also be paved with staircases to the door of the apartment , the much bigger obstacle .	-5.5863
She will continue to search for the ideal object for herself and her husband .	-2.6441
Before moving , it grays more than in front of the spider at its door .	-3.6327
US Wants to Prosecute Snowden	-2.5093
The US has not changed its attitude to former US intelligence staff , Edward Snowden .	-2.6804
He is still accused of having passed on unauthorized secret information .	-3.2646
He therefore needs to face a criminal proceedings in the US , said the spokesman of the US State Department , Jennifer Psaki , in Washington .	-3.5493
Nor would the recent statements made by Snowden change anything abin . lilililililililililililili	-9.0101
Previously , German Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele called on the US not to threaten him with punishment after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow .	-2.9116
Psaki emphasised that Ströbele 's statements are that of a parliamentarian , not that of a German member of government .	-3.9985
Intelligence reveller Edward Snowden is fundamentally ready to discuss with German authorities .	-12.4080
First , however , he wants to clarify his situation .	-2.8776
This has been made clear by the former NSA employee sought by the US in an unaddressed letter published by the Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwarded it to the Federal Government , Bundestag , and General Attorney .	-4.8518
The letter has the following wording :	-2.7606
Responsible	-1.8281
I was asked to write to you about your investigation into mass monitoring .	-2.8833
I was named Edward Joseph Snowden and used to be a direct employee of the National Security Agency ( NSA ) , the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) and the Defense Intelligence Agency ( DIA ) of the United States .	-3.2841
In the course of my employment in these institutions , I witnessed systematic violations of the law of my government , which led me to act from a moral duty .	-4.3870
As a result of the publication of these concerns , I was faced with a serious and continuing heterogeneity that forced me to leave my family and home .	-4.2446
I currently live in exile and enjoy temporary asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation under international law .	-2.0940
I am encouraged by the response to my political action , both in the United States and elsewhere .	-1.8402
Citizens around the world and also high officials - including the United States - have judged the revelations of a system of all-encompassing surveillance , which is not accountable to anyone , as a service to the public .	-8.1569
These spying revelations led to many proposals on new laws and directives aimed at the previously covert abuse of public confidence .	-4.0956
The benefits for society from these findings are becoming increasingly clear ; at the same time , the risks incurred were visibly reduced .	-4.0835
Although the outcome of my efforts was proven to be positive , my government continues to treat dissent as a faithful and seeks to criminalise and charge political expression .	-4.0032
However , the truth is not a crime .	-10.2927
I am confident that the United States Government , with the support of the international community , will take this damaging position .	-2.7745
I hope that if the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved , I will be able to participate appropriately and legally in the responsible clarification of the issues concerning the statements made in the media , particularly with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports .	-4.4200
I look forward to discussing with you in your country as soon as the situation is clarified and thank you for your efforts to maintain international law that protects us all .	-3.4830

Kindergarten Found a Private Buyer	-1.5619
" The building is in good hands , " says Winterlingen 's mayor Michael Maier .	-1.9086
The municipality has sold the former kindergarten in the Gartenstra<unk>e to a private person .	-3.1258
The Council of Municipalities agreed to sale at its recent meeting in the non-public section .	-3.9286
The building changed its owner to a " reasonable " price .	-2.4783
" The community is satisfied " , emphasizes Maier .	-2.3721
In the budget , EUR 100 000 were set .	-3.2563
It is not yet clear how the new owner wants to use the former kindergarten .	-2.7318
The mayor is right that winterlings handed over responsibility for the building before the winter to someone else and therefore no longer have to pay for the entertainment of the house , how to heat , look for the garden and clear the walk .	-4.7975
" This effort is now away " , Maier is pleased .	-3.0234

Report : Obama Campaign considered replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton	-1.8066
President Barack Obama ’ s closest advisers secretly considered replacing Vice-President Joe Biden in the 2012 election campaign with Hillary Clinton , according to the New York Times .	-11.2264
The revelation is the most notable surprise of the long-awaited work by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann about the 2012 election campaign , “ Double Down : Game Change 2012 ” .	-2.8218
The times have been presented with a copy of the book that will be published soon and she reported on Thursday evening that the president ’ s top advisers would have “ conducted extensive group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011 ” to find out whether Obama ’ s declining hope of re-election would look better if he dropped bids .	-6.2624
According to Jonathan Martin , the Times national political correspondent , the book thoroughly shows the history of the efforts of leading employees of the campaign and the White House , namely the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley , to measure the effect it has on the poll values to exchange former Foreign Minister Clinton for Vice-President .	-4.6420
The potential change was a strictly guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office .	-2.4181
Only half a dozen of the president ’ s closest advisers – including Daley , former Obama ’ s campaign leader , Jim Messina , and former White House leader , David Axelrod , and David Plouffe – knew about the intended change .	-3.8585
In “ Double Down , ” Daley claims that he has been at the forefront of the efforts to exchange Biden despite its “ narrow , personal relationship , ” before eventually opting for such a move , after the data showed that Clinton ’ s candidacy “ would not significantly improve Obama ’ s chances . ”	-5.7681
In an interview with Martin , Daley confirmed that the government actually considered replacing Biden with Clinton .	-2.0401
“ I expressed a whole series of things that should be considered , and that was one of them , ” Daley explained to the magazine .	-3.0643
We must remember that the President had terrible survey values at the time , so we thought , “ For God ’ s will , what do we do ? ”	-3.8726
While Daley called the investigations “ commanded care , ” Martin said to Anderson Cooper of CNN that during the campaign for the re-election of considerable effort had been made to find out whether such a train pays off in the ballot box .	-5.1255
“ In campaigns , not so much money is spent on surveys and focus groups if you don ’ t think seriously about something , ” said Martin on AC360 .	-3.6216
But it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team thought about an exchange .	-2.2372
Martin said to CNN that he asked Daley if his then boss knew about the potential change .	-2.7891
Although Daley said that he did not believe that the president of the possible change was “ aware , ” the former chief of staff admitted that it was “ possible ” that Obama knew about it .	-3.6137
Martin added that “ Double Down ” does not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether Obama ’ s political explorations would have reached a desk .	-9.5848
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought that Obama did not know anything about whether to let bids fall in the elections .	-3.5622
“ Possible ” , Martin replied .	-1.7611
What happens on the road with my email ?	-1.8929
E-mail actually means electronic letter .	-2.4643
Was technically implemented the letter secrecy when designing the Internet service similar to the usuin the traditisection ?	-12.7589
In the conception of early Internet services , it was important to make communication possible .	-3.8792
Therefore , the basic technical protocols did not take care to create a stable foundation for a consultative exchange of letters .	-4.1928
Therefore , a conventional e-mail is more like an open postcard than a sealed letter .	-3.1977
When user " Anna " sends a mail to " Benni " , are the computers directly connected ?	-3.3854
The e-mail program or browser of Anna sends the mail to the mail server of your service provider in the first step .	-9.1764
For example , if she has a GMail account , the Google would be .	-2.7925
This mail server sends the content to the provider that Benni uses .	-1.9581
On the route the mail can run over many other servers on the Internet .	-3.6001
Bennie can then call the content with his provider .	-2.5457
Will conventional emails be read through the network ?	-2.2738
Most mails are read several times by software robots on the way . ... ! !!	-10.6137
The sender provider usually checks whether the mail leads a malicious program as an attachment .	-10.2320
A virus check is also made on the receiver systems .	-2.1232
Furthermore , the providers check whether this is an annoying and unwanted spam mail that is equally deleted or at least sorted into a spam folder .	-4.3318
Do the robots have another task ?	-1.6838
For systems like GMail , the robot also determines the information Google needs to place context advertising .	-2.7018
If Anna and Benni communicate via GMail through their upcoming holiday trips , Google may display links to holiday offers .	-3.7900
Read also unknown people with the emails ?	-2.7489
The probability that unauthorized persons read a mail is extremely low .	-2.8975
Theoretically , however , that is possible .	-8.3133
In companies , administrators often have the opportunity to co-read electronic mail .	-3.5952
The law enforcement authorities and intelligence services also have legal opportunities to intercept or take note of e-mail. lililililililittype lililililili	-9.4661
In addition , possible illegal spawning actions are being set up .	-11.9450
Is it possible to protect emails against reading ?	-1.6605
With an encryption according to the OpenPGP standard , an e-mail can be effectively encrypted against media .	-8.3124
With high technical effort , it is also possible to conceal the metadata of e-mail communication , so that it is not even possible to detect who has communicated with whom .	-4.8226
How important are Yahoo and Google on the email market in Germany ?	-1.4424
According to an investigation by Convios Consulting from August 2013 , Yahoo and Google play only a subordinate role in the mainly privately used mailboxes .	-3.7551
While the shares of Yahoo mail had last fallen , Gmail from Google could clearly increase .	-3.7141
Mothers in the Forest and Pension	-4.3063
When his mother died , a man from Wolfsburg forged a plan .	-2.4838
He buried the dead in a forest - and continued to collect their pensions and care money .	-3.1798
In order to be able to cash on pensions and care money , a 67-year-old Wolfsburg buried his dead mother after investigation by the police in the forest .	-4.4347
First , he covered the death of the 89 years , then he collected the money for more than a year and a half .	-3.6732
The 67-year-old must now be responsible for fraud , as a spokesman said on Friday .	-2.6943
So the man hidden the woman in a forest near Helmstedt . little is .	-13.6321
The man was already suspected in May : at the time , it emerged that no drugs were needed for the mother who is in need of care .	-5.2311
The pensioner told the investigators that his mother had travelled to Spain .	-2.4197
Because the officials were strange about this , they continued to identify it .	-4.7706
It emerged that the two had lived in a common house for more than 15 years and he last maintained it .	-4.2363
The 67-year-old eventually granted the death of his mother .	-2.7141
According to the police , there was no evidence of capital crime .	-3.4029
Are you looking for ice cream shining in the dark ?	-3.2127
A British entrepreneur has developed the first shining ice in the dark – using torques .	-4.0276
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent characteristics of the sea animals and created a shining delicacy .	-3.9896
The idea came to him after reading a research work on quals and convincing Chinese scientists to artificially manufacture the bright protein .	-4.4103
The ice cream responds with the tongue , raising the pH value in the protein and triggering the light .	-3.4610
Chris explains that the dining ice responds to the warmth in the mouth and shines – the more you lick , the brighter it becomes .	-3.8119
Charlie , founder of the ice cream company Lick Me I 'm Delicious , says : “ The product is incredible but still in a very early production phase , and so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds . ”	-3.4430
The protein used in the ice cream responds with the tongue at a neutral pH value .	-2.3058
When the mouth heats the protein , the pH value and the ice shines .	-2.4989
We have tested it in recent months and it seemed ideal to put it on the market in Halloween because it has this wonderful luminaire effect .	-3.4704
It is probably the most expensive ice cream I have ever manufactured , because the quality light is four times more expensive than gold .	-3.3033
Each ball costs me about 140 pounds .	-1.4707
But it tastes delicious .	-2.3368
Charlie ’ s experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual flavours , including beer , cheese , beef and gold .	-2.9850
But his latest creation is to become even more ambitious .	-2.2496
He says : “ I would like to develop an invisible ice cream . ”	-1.9781
This is , in itself , impossible because of the breakup of light caused by the ice crystals , which consist of ice cream ; but I suspect we find a way to create it .	-4.8606
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a source artificially manufactured by Chinese scientists . lililililililililililililili	-11.0371
The TSV Morsum is still without any point in the Handball League after six playing days .	-3.2127
Now the Derby team of Ingo Ehlers comes tomorrow against the TSV Daverden , who celebrated his first victory last weekend .	-4.9062
With this game the season begins new for us .	-2.7795
" I hope that we finally have the head free , " Ehlers behaves optimistically .	-3.2934
At last , with the exception of the permanently injured Hendrik Blohme , he has his complete cadre available .	-4.2295
Daverden also relies on tempo games .	-3.8666
We must therefore keep our error rate low .	-2.4856
Above all , however , we need to increase coverage , which has last left anything but a safe impression .	-4.4010
Daverden ’ s Coach Thomas Panitz is far more relaxed after the first season victory against Nordhorn .	-3.1198
The game was of course a house number .	-1.7552
But that 's why we are far from favorite , because everything can always happen in the Derby .	-9.5329
However , Panitz now wants to launch a series in Morsum .	-2.9582
Missing Jan-Malte Jodat .	-2.2499
For this purpose , the A-youth Joost Windsu<unk> , who is active with double playing rights at the A-youth federal ligists HC Bremen , celebrates his seasonal debut .	-5.4980
Those who are not hot in such a game should stay at home .	-2.5348
Halloween 2013 : In Figures	-1.2386
When I was small , Halloween had something magical .	-1.5654
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets , stay late and dress us for the neighbourhood .	-2.7577
Today I became the Halloween Muffel .	-2.8588
Over the last two years , I have not agreed to distribute my home from sweets , and I am sure I will not do it this year .	-11.1117
But according to statistics , I am a black sheep in Halloween .	-2.4729
The majority of Americans – 158 million to be precise – celebrate Halloween this year , spending a total of $ 6.9 billion on sweets , costumes , and decorations , according to the US Retailers Association ( NRF ) .	-2.8146
One thing I look forward to every Halloween is the trend values .	-2.7306
The costumes will represent about $ 1.2 billion of the $ 6.9 billion spent , according to the NRF .	-2.9545
This year , invigorating unlively items are the last shrine .	-4.0152
Women no longer have to cloth in sexy clothes , they can now also embody seductive food such as pizza , Hamburg or carrots .	-4.3135
As far as men are concerned , I expect a lot of Zombies thanks to The Walking Dead , and I bet the Daft-Punk space men will make it into the Instagram feeds this year .	-3.4792
According to Google , the most sought costumes are zombies , batman , pirates and witches .	-2.2235
I suspect there is nothing wrong with tradition .	-2.1127
We dressed our dogs last year and were not alone to my astonishment .	-3.2915
Indeed , Americans spend $ 330 million this year on costumes of their pets , according to the NRF .	-2.1989
These are a lot of “ hot dogs ” .	-2.1813
As far as sweets are concerned , we are not pretty .	-2.8422
Americans will spend $ 1.9 billion this year , according to The Nielsen Company .	-1.6063
These are about 270 million kilograms of chocolate , lutschers , candy and rubber bearches .	-3.0491
So good news for the 41 million people , according to the US Trade Department , who pull through the quarters with the saying “ sweets or saurs . ”	-4.3908
Indeed , we will buy over 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and – let us not delude ourselves – eat .	-2.8906
The only thing we do not want to consume is the sugar-sweet Candy Corn ; nevertheless , 15 million kilograms of them are sold around Halloween , according to the National Association of Confectionery Manufacturers lililililililililililili	-7.1152
These are about nine billion corn grains .	-2.2096
It is a mystery that I could not solve yet .	-2.2742
Nothing belongs to Halloween more than houses in which it sparks .	-3.2190
They have great names such as “ Terror Behind the Walls ” ( which is in real prison ) , “ Howl-O-Scream ” and “ The House of Shock ” .	-3.0804
Indeed , there are 1,200 officially recognised spukhouses in the United States that get $ 500 million revenue , according to America Haunts , and that includes the wonderful photos on which you are just pinkled into the trousers and then put your friends on Facebook , where you are not going to get rid of them , and one of the types you stand on which you leave a comment like “ nice face expression . ”	-6.9630
But let us finally come to the pumpkins .	-2.9001
Charlie Brown familiarized us with the great pumpkin when we were children , and the carving of a pumpkin latern is like the decoration of the Christmas tree – something we have done from small to small .	-4.1608
Fortunately , the “ baby in pumpkin ” trend began only last year thanks to Pinterest , so most of us grew up with carving the pumpkin and not sitting in it .	-3.6273
This year , Americans will spend about $ 106 million on pumpkins , according to the US Census Bureau .	-1.9954
The pumpkin laterns , which slowly rotten in the front garden , are likely to come from Illinois , where 245 million kilograms were harvested this year .	-10.1508
If you want to score correctly , call Tintin and Susan Mathisdon in Napa , California and carve something pretty from their 921 kilo heavy pumpkin .	-4.0251
Housing Brand in Helmbrecht : Rescue forces Coaled Body	-4.5382
The fire brigade had to express in Helmbrechts late Thursday evening .	-3.1550
A triple family house in the county district of Hof catches fire on the night .	-11.3168
The rescue forces have a coal-carbon corpse from the house livin.	-13.3806
Rescue forces found a carbon body in a triple family house at a fire in Helmbrechts .	-4.0869
Whether it is a resident is still unclear , as a police spokesman said in Bayreuth .	-2.8712
On late Thursday evening it burned on the ground floor of the house .	-3.0296
When the fire brigade arrived , the flames already beat from a window .	-2.7935
The staff went to the apartment and found the body in a room .	-3.2240
This room and another room were burning out complet.	-4.7224
The entire ground floor was damaged .	-1.5409
All other inhabitants were not at home during the fire , the police spokesman explained .	-2.9289
The building is no longer inhabitable for the time be.	-2.9138
The exact cause of fire was not clear first .	-12.0273
Germany ’ s largest national church has launched an offensive to promote the profession of the pastor .	-2.8711
Background is a possible lack of parish : the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Hanover expects the number of pastors currently halving by 2030 after the current situation .	-5.1079
For young people of today , the profession is very attractive and offers good future prospects , said Pastor Mathis Burfien ( 43 ) in conversation with the Evangelical Press Service .	-3.2776
It is attractive to be able to determine the working and daily process itself .	-3.4334
For the first time , the Landeskirche commissioned a pastor in a full place to inspire young people for theology studies .	-4.6111
At present , fewer and fewer young people choose to study theology after the Abitur .	-3.0690
Burfien leads this to the process of dechurching : " God 's voice is quiet , the world is loud " .	-3.6690
The profession is characterised by great freedom and diversity .	-2.2072
I am a member of my calendar of appointments and I can focus on where it is important to me .	-4.5169
Pastors could be very close to people as soul carers .	-3.4645
They deserved as much as teachers and could live well .	-1.9141
Certainly , more is being paid in the free economy , but theologians would have a safe employer .	-10.6374
That is what today ’ s young people are talking about , not just about career , but about meaningful work .	-4.4337
According to the Landeskirche , which includes three quarters of Lower Saxony , some 60 pastors are currently retiring each year .	-4.0007
At the same time , about 40 graduates from a theology study begin their vicariat .	-3.5068
In sparsely populated peripheral areas such as resin , emsland or turning land , it will be difficult to fill jobs in the future .	-4.2731
Burfien wants to organize study days for young people and also invite celebrities who studied theology .	-3.7375
Theology studies provide a broad education .	-10.5617
It can even become the Federal President .	-3.3497
Land Rover Rally Series Announced	-1.2034
The interior features racing seats and six-point belts as well as a free intercom system .	-3.9303
The options range from strengthened brakes , a service package with support of bowler works mechanics and logistical support to vehicle storage between events .	-3.2824
Drew Bowler , Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport , says : “ The rally customers who come to Bowler have changed . ”	-2.6729
They are not all experienced racing drivers , but people who are looking for tension and adventure as well as a reachable path to world class events .	-10.9279
We are pleased to be able to open this path in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format opens up new ways of experiencing the various rally disciplines in the UK and abroad and preparing newcomers for the strains and reality of Rally Raid .	-4.4234
We really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge car – this will be an entertaining championship .	-3.0456
In addition , the Defender Challenge offers a training and testing day in February , as well as the option of participating in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East .	-3.5119
Called fire brigade to save a bitch , which was fixed 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rock lead in a quarry .	-5.5837
Cockerspaniel-Bitch Ruby had gone off after a smaller traffic accident	-3.7710
Three days later , she was discovered by a walker in the quarry in her abusive location .	-11.8074
Fire brigades rope off the rock wall and saved the dog from safe death .	-4.0103
The fire brigade succeeded in bringing a dog to safety , which was fixed on a 15-metre high lead in a rock wall .	-6.2093
The nine months old cockerspaniel bitch Ruby had gone away after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before she was saved from a quarry on Wednesday .	-3.9626
Scott Alderson , 25 , and his girlfriend Becky Hall , 20 who belonged to the dog , came to the quarry Flappit in Denholme , West Yorkshire to receive Ruby and thank the firefighters of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service .	-3.5062
They had desperately sought her missing bitch and published calls for help in social networks when she was discharged into the quarry after the small road accident .	-4.5709
About 14 : 15 on Wednesday , a walker who executed his dog saw the stranded Ruby on the 15-metre high paragraph in the quarry .	-11.8232
The technical rescue team at the Cleckheaton Fire Station happened and roped to save Rubys , which was then transported in a dog box up .	-5.5453
Andy Clayton , specialist of the technical rescue team , said : “ She was in a dangerous position .	-2.4617
It was located in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and the ground .	-3.1343
She did not move a muscle during her rescue – she was like stiff frozen .	-3.0580
But now you are going well .	-2.3443
She then eaten a few dog cakes .	-2.2020
This was a rather unusual deployment .	-3.2054
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible .	-1.3203
Peter Lau , specialist in the technical rescue team , said : “ Ruby had a huge happiness . ”	-2.5965
There was a possibility that it was very seriously injured or worse .	-2.5403
Ruby was investigated as a veterinarian , but he did not find anything except exhaustion and dehydration .	-4.2452
Becky Hall from Halifax , West Yorkshire , said : “ Watching the rescue was frightening . ”	-2.6539
I could not believe that she really was above .	-3.1255
It was wonderful to keep them back in the arms .	-9.3719
The veterinarian explained that if exhaustion had become too big and collapsed , it would probably have crashed .	-3.2284
The fire fighters have done great things .	-9.0662
It was really courageous what they did .	-1.6753
We are so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible .	-2.4476
Scott Alderson from Keighley added : “ We were afraid that she would fall down , but she remained above . ”	-2.8913
The firefighters were great .	-1.9807
I can hardly believe where it was .	-1.3946
Mick Jagger explains that he never made Katy Perry when she was 18 .	-2.3265
For an interview with an Australian radio station this week , the pop star said she worked as a background singer to Jagger ’ s song “ Old Habits Die Hard ” from 2004 .	-3.3843
Perry explained she had eaten with the old dryer in the evening , and that “ he swept me when I was 18 . ”	-4.8508
She added : “ This has been a long time ago and he was very nice to me . ”	-2.8713
In a statement , a representative said hunting , 70 , on Thursday , that he “ categorically denied that he ever tried to approach Katy Perry . ”	-3.5723
The representative added : “ Perhaps she has confused him with someone else . ”	-2.4048
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest appearance at the Rolling-Stones Tour this year .	-2.4030
Her new album “ Prism ” landed on hit 1 this week .	-3.9782
George Kerevan : European unbundling gives the Scots the choice	-1.8738
A new day , a new story of terror about independence .	-2.4819
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland is needed to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership .	-2.0990
This provides the keyword for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a barbed wire secured border along the Hadrian wall .	-10.6546
Indeed , the Strathclyde template referred to the possible economic benefits that would bring more freedom of travel in the rest of Europe , but it did not play a role in the headlines , as expected .	-4.0725
Nor has anyone mentioned that EU member states often bend their strict rules if it is more favourable for them .	-3.6223
Since Scotland is not currently part of the Schengen area , the continued failure to observe Brussels would only be a small concession in exchange for what the Scots really want .	-4.0584
So no story .	-2.6328
And one that has already come in such a way that it is already a fossil : the first time I heard the “ independence means passport controls ” -duck at least 40 years ago .	-4.1729
An interesting point is lost in the constant repetition of this ancient history .	-2.9789
Why should an independent Scotland be expected to dance after the European pipe ?	-1.9706
Why do the London Joch replace that of Brussels , especially now ?	-3.6367
These are the real European news : the great plan to unite Europe after the war has stalled .	-3.5466
With the euro crisis , the Europe project has officially died .	-2.2168
Everywhere in the EU , parties are gaining ground that are hostile to the EU or wish to throw the euro on board as a single currency .	-3.8384
Even in Germany , the Euroskeptic Party could gather for itself almost five million votes in the federal election in September , effectively distributing the Free Democrats ( the equivalent to the British Liberal Democrats ) from the Bundestag .	-4.7129
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federalist Europe .	-1.6928
The current economic crisis , however , turns out to be a turning point .	-2.0146
Because of the strict austerity policy imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank in connection with the forced jacket in which the national economy is needed by adhering to the single currency , many people believe that the Europe project has gone too far .	-4.1874
The euro ’ s crisis has little to do with national governments causing excessive budget deficits – only in Greece . little .	-8.9451
Instead , the Eurosystem has fixed its members on exchange rates that are beneficial to German exporters – and German politicians want to do so .	-3.4072
Without the possibility of devaluation of the local currency , southern Europe has a built-in productivity disadvantage over Germany .	-3.1343
The only way to cut wages and public spending – encouraged by Berlin .	-14.5658
Behind the current budget and currency problems , there is a deeper European productivity problem .	-2.2102
As a result of the “ green ” energy guidelines imposed by Brussels – a code for subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – European industry pays twice for electricity and four times for gas compared to the United States .	-3.3028
This is a paralysing disadvantage , as we have already seen in Grangemouth .	-2.7130
All world wage fixes do not protect the European petrochemical industry from being pushed into the corner from cheap American shale gas .	-3.4229
As a result , a revolt raises , especially in France , the EU ’ s former cheerleader .	-3.1211
After the war , France ’ s political elite saw the EU as a vehicle to keep Germany in check and raise Paris to Washington equals .	-3.6775
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy , and has expressed Europe ’ s own economic policy , thus fighting the attacked French economy .	-3.9702
The result : Marine Le Pen ’ s right-wing , anti-EU front National has just won a crucial election , thereby referring the ruling socialists to three .	-3.7159
The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 % of the vote – a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a division in the right spectrum would automatically mean benefits for the left .	-3.4750
What is Le Pen doing with her newly gained popularity among the white French of the working class ?	-13.2570
It wants to use the EU elections next year to forge an anti-EU , anti-Community currency bloc in the European Parliament .	-2.4345
If the anti-EU parties perform well in these elections – and that is very possible – then such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament for the first time .	-10.0490
This is the point I want to make : in the not too distant future , the growing resentment against the EU and the single currency will meet to abolish the euro .	-2.9672
The EU will not disappear , but it will become more like the “ Europe of ( sovereign ) nations ” that favored General de Gaulle .	-2.6684
Germany and a few of its satellite economies may stick to the euro , but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies .	-2.3587
I expect Britain to distance itself from this project in the hope of flattering itself with the United States .	-2.5402
But Washington ’ s growing interest in the Pacific region suggests that Britain alone will be in the Atlantic rain .	-2.5019
Where does Scotland stay with all this ?	-2.1369
We can decide to be a region of ( in the last consequence ) small England .	-2.8304
Or we can defend our own economic interests – including saying Berlin and Brussels what they can do where they can go .	-3.5746
I suspect that Scotland could drive quite well in a looser European association if we keep our own currency .	-3.8438
Cooperation with other similar countries is easier in an unfederated Europe of nations .	-2.1711
Otherwise , we should consider equalizing Norway and keeping our economic independence .	-15.2192
The SNP government in Scotland is – remarkably – the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe , and won a spectacular majority in 2011 , owing to the rejection of the proposed ( and made ) cuts that Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem-Coalition had to account .	-4.2274
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to choose independence now only to impose austerity on Berlin and Brussels .	-2.7019
Early Puberty : Adult Faster	-2.4532
Afro-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white ages , as investigations show .	-2.9858
Physical change does not immediately mean puberty	-2.4102
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible .	-1.4816
Experts believe that epidemic obesity is a trigger of early puberty	-2.1333
The trend to early puberty is less pronounced in boys	-2.9128
The former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in child health and family issues .	-2.4481
Should a mother be concerned if her daughter grows breasts and shamhairs at the age of seven or eight ?	-2.7049
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics Association this week in Orlando , Florida , the paediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and represented a new norm .	-3.4740
“ I spend a lot of time reassuring parents – normally this is no sign that puberty is now entering quickly , ” explained Kaplowitz .	-4.1259
Obvious advertisements of development , such as growing breasts , shame and axle hair and body smell , are shown in girls earlier .	-4.5954
Nevertheless , there has been only a slight shift in the age of the Menarche ( appearance of the first rule bleeding ) over the past 40 years .	-4.1863
In the United States , the average age is 12.5 years , slightly less than 12.75 in 1970 .	-2.0280
“ When the development of the breasts begins , it takes at least two to three years to the Menarche , ” Kaplowitz also said , author of the book “ Early Puberty among girls : The essential guide to dealing with this frequently occurring problem . ”	-4.4674
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty progresses .	-2.5013
It is controversial , which is actually the beginning of puberty , but it is “ early ” when the breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth boost of eight years ago .	-4.3366
In most cases , the process slows or stagnates – something that a physician can closely monitor .	-2.7559
When progressing faster , tests may be displayed by an endicronologist so that serious problems such as tumours or cysts can be excluded .	-4.4094
There are treatment methods for delaying an early menstruation and defending another consequence : the premature ageing of bones , which can ultimately result in restrictions on growth and thus small body growth in adults .	-4.5024
The recommendations for medical or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child , development speed , growth rate and emotional maturity .	-3.5768
Psychosocial aspects are also important .	-1.0654
Kaplowitz is cautious about medicines , but he acknowledges : “ Oppressing puberty can mitigate behavioral problems and feelings of girls to be different from their ages . ”	-4.7840
The other major problem is understandable : parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have the period .	-1.8025
“ They worry about the risk of pregnancy or how they handle the hygienic side , ” said Kaplowitz .	-9.2399
“ It was a shock , ” remembers a woman whose daughter received ten days .	-3.0518
Although there were first signs and we had talked about menstruation , it was not emotionally prepared .	-2.6359
She came home and excited from school because she was the first in her friends circle .	-3.1467
There are many comprehensively published theories about the causes of early puberty .	-1.8594
But there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other food , chemicals in the environment , or sexual messages in the media would be caused .	-2.8781
Boys come into puberty similar to girls earlier .	-2.4410
Kaplowitz believes that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of obesity .	-1.5973
He supported the conduct of a study in 2001 on girls aged six to nine years , producing a link between body fat and admission to puberty .	-3.6678
Other investigations support this conclusion , but there are many other factors that have played a role .	-12.8211
In that country , African and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white ages .	-2.5176
There are different explanations for this .	-1.7180
Globally , an early puberty seems to be influenced by all possible things , from economic conditions to the climate to genes .	-11.8344
Another puzzle : although boys grow facial and shame hairs earlier , the trend to a fully previous puberty is not as pronounced as girls .	-4.4377
Other doctors at the AAP conference underlined the complexity of the subject .	-2.0473
The emergence of acne and shamhair is common even in babies and infants .	-3.2850
“ We must be careful as we identify the true start of puberty , ” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman , a paediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children ’ s Hospital in Morristown , New Jersey .	-2.7199
Parents should not hesitate to be advised by their physician on how to speak with their child .	-3.5970
“ That may mean that you have to talk earlier than expected , ” advises Kaplowitz .	-4.4327
If you stay calm , the child usually reacts well .	-2.8495
Girls who flourish early need the insurance that the process is a normal part of life , even if it occurs earlier than thought .	-3.0559
Jumbo manufacturers argue about seating width in the face of large orders	-3.2627
Between leading aircraft manufacturers there has been a discussion about the width of seats in the tourist class on long-haul flights , which indicates the tone for a bitter clash at the Dubai Airshow this month .	-4.6501
The dispute revolves around the width of seats offered by passengers on long flights in the tourist class – not always those who seek the most , but this designated space is the key to the efficiency claims of the latest aircraft by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co .	-4.9360
This week , Airbus demanded an industry standard , which requires a seat width of at least 46 cm ( 18 inches ) in the tourist class , but the US Archrival Boeing says that the airlines should decide . in the lilililililililili	-10.4330
The dispute comes at a time when aircraft farmers compete to sell even larger versions of their two-engine long-haul flyers and expect record orders during the event from 17 to 21 November .	-4.1730
How the rear part of the aircraft is designed – especially whether there are rows with nine or ten seats – is crucial for the specified economic results to deliver the new “ mini-jumbo ” design .	-4.0108
Boeing claims that his modernized “ 777X ” captures 406 people at seats in the tourist class , which are over 17 inches wide and thus allow ten per series .	-4.6319
Airbus explains that the competing version of the A350 carries 350 people in 18 inch wide seats in the tourist class , with nine per row .	-3.6115
Aircraft giants often split over technical details by advertising in the specialist press .	-3.5801
Now Airbus appeals to the public directly before the Dubai Airshow , where the 777X will place more than 100 orders .	-3.6702
Recently , the company presented an advertisement that could be the beginning of a new advertising war , showing a picture of three people sitting together in a restaurant , and the title : “ Would you accept that ? ”	-4.6316
“ Boeing proposes long-haul flights in seats narrower than regional turbo props , ” says Airbus Chief of Distribution John Leahy .	-3.0236
Given changing nutritional habits , people become thicker , but aircraft seats have not changed radically .	-3.1802
Between the early 1970s , when the Boeing 747 defined modern long-haul journey , and the end of the century , the weight of the male average American has increased by ten percent between 40 and 49 years , according to the US Department of Health .	-3.7511
The waist range of the male average American in the 21st century is 100.8 cm according to US health statistics .	-3.0123
Airbus says that his rivals comply with a 1950s seat concept , when the average body range of the freshly baptized “ Jet Set ” was narrower .	-4.1246
According to Airbus , investigations were carried out that an additional tariff ( 2.54 cm ) per seat increased sleep quality by 53 % .	-3.9831
Boeing disputes the numbers of Airbus on seats and says that it is not at the discretion of manufacturers to decide how airlines shape the balance between airlines and institutions .	-4.2881
The company also explains that , according to investigations , the experience in the aircraft depends on more than the seat width .	-3.3301
“ It really amounts to giving airlines flexibility so that they can do what they believe they need to be successful , ” explains the aircraft expert Kent Craver von Boeing .	-4.3773
They do not want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable .	-1.7762
They know their business better than any other .	-1.6897
Passengers are concerned with greater elbow freedom , but for manufacturers it is becoming increasingly an issue that can affect sales .	-4.0706
Behind the discussion is an aircraft order race with an estimated volume of at least $ 700 billion after list prices in the coming decades , which could have a sustainable impact on the US or Europe ’ s export balance sheet .	-4.6174
As Reuters reported for the first time in July , the seat layout is the driving force behind the debate on the new jets .	-2.6971
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 % more efficiency per seat in their latest two-engine long-haul designs than the market leader in this segment , the 365-seat Boeing 77-300ER .	-2.8756
The statements made by Boeing on the results depend partly on the 777X being compared to its ten seats per row with the original design of nine seats in the 777 .	-3.5829
The increased costs per unit are still lower than in currently used machines with ten seats per row .	-3.1611
“ Boeing therefore squeezes more seats in its aircraft to make it more competitive to our products , ” says Kevin Keniston , head of passenger comfort at European Airbus .	-3.3448
On the other hand , analysts say that full cabins with ten seats per row at existing 777s suggested that many passengers chose the tighter arrangement , which could be accompanied by cheaper fares .	-3.9544
“ Eighteen inch width would be great for passengers , but the reality is : from an economic point of view , the Airbus offer is controlled by the 777 threat , ” says Mary Kirby , expert in cabin facilities , founder and editor of Runway Girl Network .	-3.8423
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats , but a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose .	-14.7119
The world-travelling jet sellers even carry tape measurements to measure the institution in competition .	-4.3419
Even if they price comfort , all manufacturers also offer highly compact jets for low-cost airlines and regional flights .	-3.8824
Airbus offers a ten-seat A350 , but has not yet sold , according to its own statement .	-3.9214
Until recently , Airbus emphasised the importance of cabin adaptability and offered wide seats for some jets on the corridors .	-4.1139
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets , experts say that the call for a new industry standard is likely to be hidden , but could distract from the wave of 777X sales .	-3.8024
New anti-nicotine vaccine could give way to pleasure in smoking	-4.0017
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could spoil the fun of smoking .	-2.2646
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for a lifetime .	-2.8306
Before testing human beings , further attempts are needed , which may take a few years , but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said that the first results were good .	-8.5064
“ We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to stop trying out all methods available on the market , but have had to see that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches , ” said Cornell .	-3.5837
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been changed so that it contains genetic information for the production of nicotine antibodies .	-3.0021
The virus selectively infects the liver cells , which then produce a permanent current of antibodies .	-2.6399
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain , leaving a smoker with no nicotine high .	-3.3305
In attempts , vaccinated mice , administered by nicotine , retained their normal level of activity .	-3.2788
Mice without vaccination , on the other hand , would have taken a “ break ” , explained researchers , a sign that the nicotine had reached their brain .	-12.1116
The experiments are described in Science Translational Medicine .	-2.1140
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies .	-1.6282
Vaccinations had to be given so often to maintain the antibody level that they were expensive and impractical .	-2.9262
But the cost of the new vaccine is probably much lower , because it transforms liver cells into antibody factories .	-2.6082
As Professor Crystal said , a future vaccine could be administered to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette , thus preventing nicotine addiction .	-3.3403
More likely , however , smokers would use it to stop .	-2.3833
“ They know : when they start to smoke again , they no longer feel pleasure about the nicotine vaccine , and that helps them to store the habit , ” he explains .	-5.0923
British scientists said that the results were interesting , but at the same time warned that further research was needed .	-2.1216
Tripodi Disputes Being Influenced by Obeid	-2.6926
The former Minister of the Laboratory Joe Tripodi from New South Wales began an investigation by the state supervision of corruption .	-4.2732
The former NSW Minister denies that he has changed the rules on maritime leasing at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid , who had hidden participations in three properties in state-controlled land .	-4.6505
On Friday , the Independent Commission Against Corruption ( ICAC Independent Commission against Corruption ) extended its investigations into whether Obeid has influenced various Ministers of State to extend leasing contracts at the Circular Quay , where the Obeids operated two restaurants and a café , without any invitation to tender after their expiry in August 2005 .	-5.1687
Now , because of the allegation , Tripodi knew of Obeid ’ s hidden interest in the properties after Tripodi ’ s former Deputy Secretary of Staff , Lynne Ashpole , said accordingly on Thursday .	-4.8816
In years of discussions that began in 2005 , the government had pushed for public tenders for the leasing contracts .	-3.5593
The boards were opposed to this and wanted longer running times .	-4.3539
In 2009 , the leasing contracts for companies at the Circular Quay , which brought Obeids $ 2.5 million a year , were extended without public tender .	-3.8596
Tripodi , who was Minister of Port from February 2006 to November 2009 , had originally spoken out in favour of public tes .	-11.4995
But he disputes having made the changes at the request of Obeid , who , as Tripodi confirmed , had pushed for the government ’ s leasing arrangements to be transformed .	-5.1483
One of the ICAC ’ s telephone records showed talks from August and September 2007 between Obeid , Tripodi and Steve Dunn , a senior official who had changed to the Ministry of Port after working under Obeid in the Fisheries Authority .	-4.7357
“ Was the subject discussed in these telephone calls to draw up commercial leasing rules ? ” , the Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi asked .	-4.1618
“ No , ” Tripodi replied .	-1.8057
I cannot remember what was discussed , but that was definitely not .	-2.0927
Definitely not between me and Mr Obeid .	-1.0667
Israeli fighter planes attack targets in Syria , such official sources lilililililililililili	-7.9514
Israeli hunting aircraft would have attacked a destination in the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday night , confirmed a senior government staff against Fox News .	-3.5854
The official did not explain what the objective was , but said it was at least one .	-11.7856
According to Associated Press , the target was Russian SA-125 missiles .	-1.9414
At least twice this year , Israel has already carried out air strikes on missile deliveries in Syria .	-13.5418
Foreign workers with 457 visas could be subjected to “ Authenticity Test ”	-2.8131
The government thinks about a “ authenticity test ” for foreign workers with 457 visas as part of extended measures .	-3.4914
If the test is introduced , it would be used via a criterion to prevent 457 from being used as a back door for the train of family and friends to Australia .	-3.8777
Today , a government proposal for discussion was published after former Labor MEPs , Maxine McKew , had condemned government comments on foreign workers , because they could be considered insulting by Australian neighbors .	-4.8476
“ Volume declarations such as that foreigners are supposed to stop behind – and , Australians first stop – are a very unpleasant return in times when trade unions demanded a protected labor market , ” she told the Australia India Institute today .	-5.4448
Historically , that meant that white workers should be protected – and if some in the region hold an echo of this historical artifact , I would not be surprised .	-11.1995
The discussion proposal outlines twelve measures , once thought up by former immigration minister Chris Bowen .	-3.0053
Immigration Minister Brendan O 'Connor , who was in Sri Lanka yesterday for discussions on human smuggling , has implemented five of the recommended changes , and others are still considered .	-4.0815
If the “ authenticity criterion ” is adopted , someone who requests a visa could be checked to see whether “ the applicant is genuine in cases where the applicant is related to the owner or relevant person of the supporting company . ”	-4.9786
Companies could also be obliged to account for the number of 457 visa holders after companies that initially wanted to support only a small number of workers have finally stopped hundreds .	-3.8391
Meanwhile , a 35-year-old Sri-Lankan asylum probably died from a heart attack after arriving this week with a refugee boat on the Christmas Island .	-2.5845
The disturbed nine-year-old son of the man who came to Australia with him has been cared for since the death of his father on Wednesday by an adult cousin who was also on the boat .	-4.0305
Australian authorities brought the man to the Christmas Island Hospital , where he died .	-1.8081
The British Government announced a study to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland .	-2.4205
In the work of HS2 Ltd , it is proposed to implement high-speed connections between Scotland and the north of England at the beginning of Phase 1 in 2026 .	-3.3182
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said that the project “ will bring Britain closer together . ”	-1.9270
The Scottish Transport Secretary , Keith Brown , said that he was very pleased to work with the British Government on this plan .	-2.7169
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail connection between London and the West Midlands .	-9.1084
After completion of Phase 2 there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds .	-2.4622
In June , the government corrected the estimated cost of building the high-speed road between London and Northern England from 32.7 billion pounds to 42.6 billion pounds .	-2.7005
The British Government , which is in discussions with Transport Scotland , has asked HS2 Ltd to seek further route capacities and travel time improvements for Northern England and Scotland .	-3.7283
This includes the possibility of a travel period of three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London .	-3.3797
Baroness Kramer said : “ Our goal for HS2 is a truly national route network that brings Britain and its cities closer together . ”	-2.4794
We are moving forward with HS2 because it brings enormous benefits .	-2.6672
Without it , we face a capacity crisis in our rail network .	-2.4094
But it is also about the link between 18 British cities , including Glasgow and Edinburgh , which is improved thanks to HS2 .	-2.5992
The Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael commented : “ Today ’ s announcement is good news for Scotland . ”	-2.0787
On behalf of the Scottish Government , Keith Brown Carmichael called for “ unequivocal ” commitment to Scotland ’ s integration into the HS2 network .	-8.0799
Brown said : “ The high-speed rail connection has the potential of enormous economic benefits for Scotland , while also providing Scotland ’ s economic power with an argument for rapid rail connections throughout the UK . ”	-4.1300
We are therefore pleased to work as a partner of the British Government and to examine the options for a high-speed rail link in Scotland , which creates benefits for all and complements the link between Glasgow-Edinburgh , which the Scottish Government is already planning .	-4.2363
I look forward to examining the inquiry report with the British ministers next year and deciding together to take the next steps .	-11.2763
Regulations on electronic equipment in aircraft remain in force in Australia for the time being .	-2.3767
Australian passengers must continue to disable tablets and smartphones at start and landing , despite efforts in the US to relax the rules for such equipment .	-3.9018
The US Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) enables US airlines to change their requirements so that passengers can read , view or play e-books during critical flight phases , provided they are in “ flight mode . ”	-9.6575
During most of the flight passengers are already allowed to do so , but many people find it annoying that they cannot read their e-books when they start and land .	-3.9994
Australian companies , however , are not following immediate plans to change their rules for their implementation .	-4.0089
The air traffic control authority CASA also declared that the announcement would be looked at , but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic equipment continue to apply in critical air phases in Australia .	-4.8007
“ CASA currently has no specific regulations concerning the use of electronic equipment in the aircraft , ” has been noted .	-4.0394
The subject is subject to provisions that airlines must maintain safety at any time and passengers must follow the safety instructions given by the cabin staff .	-4.1504
Virgin has already conducted talks with CASA about expanding its Wi-Fi entertainment system on flights and explains that they are open to change , but they should be initiated by the legislator .	-4.5217
“ We would welcome a review of the approval of electronic equipment by CASA , because we are convinced that this would improve customer experience after we offer ( wireless entertainment ) during the flight , ” said a speaker .	-3.6773
Qantas explained that the current rules will remain until further notice .	-3.7512
“ Our current directives provide for electronic equipment not to be used when starting and landing , and we do not currently have plans to change that , ” said the company .	-3.9704
The FAA rules apply to US airlines .	-1.7194
However , we are always interested in developments in regulations that can benefit passengers and will certainly look at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it .	-3.3503
The decision has a different impact on US companies depending on the age of the fleet .	-3.3194
They must prove that their aircraft can tolerate radio disorders through mobile devices , and change manuals , training materials , hand baggage programs and customer instructions .	-3.3027
“ After confirming the tolerance of its fleet , an airline can allow passengers to use portable , lightweight electronic devices such as tablets , e-book readers and smartphones at every level , ” the FAA announced .	-3.6956
In rare cases in bad view , the crew will instruct passengers to disable the devices during landing .	-3.4254
The group also recommended to store heavier devices at startup and landing safely below the seat or in the subjects above the seats .	-3.8595
Before the Revierderby against Schalke , ugly scenes in the Veltins Arena had travelled with lightweight trackets .	-15.4071
Borussia Dortmund then announced harsh consequences .	-1.8240
Before the Friday Game of the Football League against the VfB Stuttgart , the ultras responded with a silence - first .	-12.1201
It was an unusual , almost spectacular acoustics that offered the viewer in the Signal Iduna Park until shortly before the federal liga game between the German vice champion Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart .	-5.2206
The guest fans were mostly heard with their singing .	-4.5112
The southern gallery , on the other hand , where the most loyal - and loudest - BVB fans stand , initially presented themselves extraordinarily quiet : no songs , no battle cries .	-4.9875
The podium of the capo , which otherwise coordinates the shared fire , remained unoccupied .	-3.1402
And at the front of the gallery , a large flag with inscription " Section Stadion Ban " blew together .	-5.2965
Only as a goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller , as always the first BVB player , entered the place , burned short jubles .	-5.0536
When his team colleagues followed , there was noisy singing and blowing scarves - but not everywhere .	-3.6924
Nothing was raining in the central blocks 12 and 13 of the South Gallery .	-3.4791
Also that stadium spokesman Norbert Dickel listed the positive experiences of the last few days - Derby victory , victory over Arsenal , extension of the contract by Trainer Jürgen Klopp - did not cause celebration .	-4.6532
Only five minutes before the application , the Capo clammed its podium - and the tangible tension that had almost taken place with hands emerged in a loud cry when the lid as usual checked the mood on the ranks in the stadium .	-8.0991
As always , the South Tribune was the last one - and finally here again as usual was the loudest place in the stadium .	-13.1072
And at the latest when the southern gallery appealed to the vocal call " Derby-winner stands up " , everything was again as always .	-6.5360
The silence before was probably a response to what has happened in recent days .	-2.5297
Immediately before Revierderby at the FC Schalke 04 , some of the BVB trailers had fired luminaires into the spectator races and fired on the square - almost goalkeepers Roman Weidenfeller met .	-6.1380
The game was late because of the chaotic scenes .	-9.2464
BVB-Boss Hans-Joachim Watzke received the tips of Dortmund Ultras in his office - and believe Watzke 's words , this was a rather uncomfortable date for the fan representatives .	-4.2532
" There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra movement , " the BVB boss announced on Thursday evening at a panel discussion in Frankfurt .	-2.7594
As an immediate measure , Watzke forbidden the ultras a choreography for the home game against VfB Stuttgart .	-3.1914
" I prohibited that , " he said .	-2.7749
We cannot abandon the zero tolerance policy on pyrotechnology .	-2.0301
In addition , the Ultras have been shown various ways of punishing - until Tuesday they have time to choose one .	-4.7355
Otherwise , according to Watzke , the BVB will set a sanction by the end of next week .	-2.7401
" This becomes incisive " , insured watzke .	-3.1960
You can be looking forward to how the reactions in the South Gallery will be .	-4.9452
Pfandhouses boom in Singapore , because the crisis has arrived in the middle clasliline.	-9.5445
In a deposit house in the Bendemeer shopping centre in Singapore , Janani Amirthalinga exchanges a golden ripe , a ring and a pair of earrings to pay their daughters ’ school fees .	-3.7119
“ My husband and I have just bought a house , since there is my whole money in it , ” says Amirthalinga .	-3.2462
Although she earns 3,000 Singapore dollars every month ( approximately EUR 1,730 ) as administrative staff and her husband also work , the monthly family income is not enough , she explains .	-4.2165
Indeed , demand in parts of South-East Asia – where household debt is increasing – is so great that , where ValueMax has exchanged , this week , ValueMax became the third deposit house listed on the Singaporean stock exchange .	-4.1223
Jewelry pledging is not only a fast way to get money – $ 1,300 Singapore in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan .	-3.2550
Typically , deposit houses in Singapore require an effective annual interest rate of 17 % , which is just above the 15.4 % required by United Overseas Bank , a local lender with a branch in the same shopping centre .	-3.6284
Pfandhäuser offers the advantage , however , that no review of credit worthiness or income proof is required here , which is why loans are more rapid than banks can .	-5.0257
That is why millions of people in the region are turning to deposit houses after families feel pressure from rising living costs , as well as increasing budget and consumer debt .	-3.9168
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans resulting from loose fiscal policies in advanced economies , families with lower and middle-income incomes are looking for deposit houses to compensate for the difference in the case of a damaging economy .	-5.1374
This week , the Standard & Poor rating agency called the growing budget debt , mainly through rising mortgages , a risk factor for Asian banks ’ creditworthiness .	-13.1976
According to the Agency , Malaysia , Thailand , and Singapore have the highest budget debt in Asia relative to GDP .	-2.9640
Malaysia is at the top of the list , at 80 % of GDP , a 60 % increase in 2008 .	-2.7165
Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand , which has come out of a technical recession this week .	-3.3591
On Thursday , the data showed a continuing export weakness and a reduction in consumer demand .	-2.8256
“ In the end , given rising costs , people in the middle to lower segment ( the income scale ) will try to complement their income wherever possible , ” says Song Seng Wun , economist at CIMB , a Malaysian bank .	-3.5396
Historical highs in gold prices over the last two years have increased the trend towards pledging personal items , as people take the opportunity to turn the jewelry of the family into cash .	-3.8375
In Singapore , about 70 % of the pledged items are in the 200 deposit houses of the city state of Gold .	-3.9726
People say : “ The gold price looks good , let us pledge grandmother ’ s gold chain and bring back next month . ”	-3.2162
The largest Thai Pfandhaus operator , EasyMoney , has experienced a 20 % customer growth in its branches in recent months .	-3.3328
Growth in the deposit business is so strong that ValueMax , operator of the Bendemeer branch and 15 more in Singapore , wants to expand not only into neighbouring Malaysia – where the company operates four houses – but also outside Asia , according to Yeah Lee Ching , Managing Director of ValueMax .	-4.1013

Rescue Package over $ 325 million for Tasman Health	-2.9418
The Australian Government insists on the harsh conditions linked to the bailout package over $ 325 million for Tasman health to ensure that the state government cannot waste money .	-3.5735
Federal Minister for Health , Tanya Plibersek , announced that the Commonwealth will take “ immediate action ” to avert a crisis caused by an aging population of the island state , a higher quota of chronic diseases and system restrictions .	-3.3655
Funding for a period of four years was decided after government discussions with the independent Tasman MEP Andrew Wilkie .	-3.2617
“ The government has launched an emergency rescue package , which in our view addresses the unique challenges facing the state , ” said Pliberseck today .	-3.6100
The $ 325 million package includes $ 31 million emergency aid for electoral services .	-2.4595
Another 2600 operations , including orthopedic interventions and treatments for grey star , are intended to eliminate residues .	-3.5524
There is also money for daily clinics in Hobart and Launceston , better care for stationary stays , specialist training , mental health services and the introduction of a system for electronic recording of health data in local hospitals .	-3.8762
“ These investments correspond to the ideas that affected me have said that they are the best way to improve the Tasman health system , ” said Tanya Plibersek .	-3.3855
The Minister insisted on a strict reporting and accountability of the Tasman Government .	-2.3759
The state must maintain the current level of funding to get money from the Commonwealth and report monthly on where the additional funds have been spent .	-3.8681
A three-head Commission will be set up and will ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible .	-3.1328
As Wilkie said today , the $ 325 million would benefit little if “ they are not accompanied by real reforms that put the public Tasman health system on a more sustainable course . ”	-3.6790
Nevertheless , he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent assistance , which he first expressed to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May .	-2.9519
“ I am confident that federal aid will make a major contribution to taking the state ’ s public health system off the list of concerns , ” said Wilkie .	-2.9645
According to the government of the state , these elections will largely compensate for the recent cuts .	-2.9049
But the opposition ’ s health spokesman , Peter Dutton , believes that today ’ s announcement is only a “ paving solution . ”	-2.7928
“ We are in today ’ s situation because the Labor State Government has withdrawn $ 430 million from the health system , ” he said to ABC TV .	-2.6965
It cannot be the case that a government breaks almost half a billion dollars out of the system , and the Commonwealth inserts 300 million and then pretends to be good news .	-5.2024
Dutton asked Pliberseck to guarantee that not a single dollar of the bailout package will be spent on additional bureaucracy .	-2.5548

Syria has destroyed its ability to produce chemical weapons , such as a monitoring group	-7.9069
Syria has destroyed important institutions to produce chemical weapons and toxic gas amunition , declared the global surveillance group for chemical weapons on Thursday , while serious clashes in the north of the country were close to one of the sites where toxic substances were supposedly stored .	-12.6017
On Thursday , too , a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people have been killed soon three years ago since the civil war began .	-10.3414
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons ( OPCW ) came one day before the date of the dead.	-8.3291

The conclusion of this process , which is basically the first stage of destruction , is an important milestone of an ambitious timetable aimed at destroying all Syrian chemical weapons by mid-2014 .	-3.0348
The destruction of the institutions means that Syria cannot produce new chemical weapons .	-2.6230
However , Damascus must start destroying existing weapons and stocks .	-2.6317
According to assumptions , there are about 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons in the country , including Senfgas and Nervengas Sarin .	-2.6449
The announcement came at a time when fighting took place in the city of Safira on Thursday , experts said that there was a production facility for chemical weapons and storage facilities , as informed the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights , based in Britain .	-4.6576
The activist group , pursuing the number of deaths via a network of activists in Syria , declared on Thursday that 120,296 people died .	-3.3235
These are 61,067 civilians , including 6,365 children .	-1.8685
On the government side , 29,954 of them were President Bashar Assad 's army , 18,678 were government-friendly fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militias .	-8.0129
Also among the dead are 2,202 deserted army soldiers and 5,375 opposition fighters , many of them foreigners .	-2.2145
On 25 July , the UN estimated the number of dead in this conflict since March 2011 to 100,000 .	-2.2325
This figure has not been updated .	-2.0266
The conflict has forced about two million people to escape the country .	-1.8700
Assad ’ s troops have been fighting for weeks in Safira against the rebels , many of which have connections to al-Qaeda groups .	-2.6286
The observatory said that there were losses on both sides on Thursday , but did not mention details .	-9.5755
The struggles underline the danger facing chemical weapons inspectors , because their mission to liberate Syria from its toxic arsenal is a race against the time in the midst of a raging civil war .	-3.9822
According to the OPCW , which works closely with the United Nations , the team is “ now convinced that it has seen all the important production and mixing / filling facilities mentioned by Syria and has witnessed their destruction . ”	-3.8144
Therefore , “ no further inspection activities are currently being planned . ”	-11.5876
At the beginning of the week , the inspectors had declared that they had completed the first round of reviews and visited 21 of the sites specified by Damascus .	-3.6239
Due to security concerns , the visit of two institutions was not possible , the inspectors said .	-2.9807
On Thursday , the OPWC declared that the two sites were “ abandoned , according to Syrian statement , and the existing objects of the chemical weapons programme were relocated to other institutions mentioned that were inspected . ”	-4.4990
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two facilities that the OPCW inspectors could not visit .	-2.3574
Syria has presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons , which next month must be approved by the OPWC Executive Committee .	-3.0106

Patek , who was fleeing almost ten years as one of the most sought-after people in South-East Asia , was sentenced to a 20 year prison sentence yesterday for his role in building explosive bodies for the bombing .	-13.4918

The Public Prosecutor had called for a lifelong prison sentence , although they could have applied for the death penalty for the man who , because of his reputation as a masterly bomb manufacturer , could have applied for the death penalty .	-4.7546
The decision has aroused painful memories of June Corteen , a mother from Perth who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters , Jane and Jenny , in the devastation caused by Patek and his conspirators almost ten years ago .	-3.8311
Fighting with tears she said that Patek should have been condemned to death .	-2.7077

Hughes said that Patek deserved the same fate as the other three members of the terrorist cell Jemaah Islamiah – Amrozi , Mukhlas , and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the bloodbath and were executed four years ago .	-2.5375
Really , this type should have the death penalty above all elsewhere .	-3.3676

Patek is the last of the Bali bombers to court .	-2.8016
He escaped almost a decade of arrest , but was finally taken up in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad in January 2011 , where US forces killed the former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden just four months later .	-3.9198
During the negotiation , an FBI agent said that intelligence reports had provided the indication that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of rebuilding the link between South-East Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda .	-3.3787
“ He has not stood up , ” said Corteen .	-2.6143
Until recently , he has shown no repentance for how much suffering he has added to other people .	-2.9577
The judgment was made before the ten-year anniversary of the attack this year , commemorated in Bali and Australia .	-3.3161
“ There will be many tears this year , ” said Corteen .	-1.6501
Patek can still appeal against his judgment .	-2.1609
FAA : Passengers can now use electronic devices in aircraft ( but no mobile phone calls )	-2.5632
From departure to landing , passengers can now hear their electronic equipment for reading , working , gaming , music , and use the prestige of films , but can not call with the mobile phone , such as the new guidelines published by the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) in the USA on Thursday .	-5.7504
But passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately .	-1.4532
How quickly they would be implemented dependent on the respective airline , FAA staff explained Michael Huerta at a press conference .	-3.2094
The airlines must demonstrate to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new directives and that they have updated the training manuals of the airline staff and the regulations governing the storage of equipment in accordance with the new regulations .	-4.5721
The FAA declared that it has already received plans from some airlines that wish to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft .	-9.1334
Among these airlines were Delta and JetBlue .	-2.0631
“ Depending on the state of the plan , we could approve the extended use of electronic devices very soon , ” the FAA announced in a notice .	-3.4877
Currently , passengers must disable smartphones , tablets and other equipment when the aircraft doors are closed .	-2.7811
You may only restart them when the plane has reached a height of three kilometres and gives the captain green light .	-4.1622
When entering the country , passengers must disable them again and must not restart them before the aircraft has landed . li, , li, and lililili, lili, lilililililitlilittlitle	-18.0186
According to the new directives , airlines whose aircraft are safeguarded against electronic disruptions could allow their passengers to use the equipment even at start , landing and on the roller field , the FAA explained .	-4.4848
Most new aircraft and other aircraft converted to larger heights for the use of Wi-Fi should meet the criteria .	-3.4385
Laura Glading , President of the Professional Association of Professional Airlines , welcomed the changes .	-2.3728
“ If the new regulation is safely implemented – and we work closely with the airline in this regard – both sides will benefit , ” commented Glading .	-3.1334
We are honestly sorry to have to feel like watchers on this issue .	-3.7585
Nevertheless , Internet connections to surfing , exchanging emails , text messages or downloading data remained prohibited under three kilometres , explained the authority .	-8.4367
Passengers are asked to move smartphones , tablets and other devices into flight mode .	-2.6686
So still no “ Words With Friends ” , the online game similar to Scrabble , which the actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 , when he had to leave a jet of American airlines publicly because he refused to turn off the device while the plane was parked at the passenger .	-4.9947
And heavier equipment such as laptops must continue to be stored as there is a risk of injury if they fly through the cabin .	-4.1165
Mobile calls during the flight remain banned as well .	-3.2507
Regulatory competence for telephone calls lies with the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) , not with the FAA .	-2.5723
FAA may lift bans on certain electronic equipment at start and landing .	-2.8357
Last month , Mark Rosenker said from the transport safety authority National Transportation Safety Board , safety experts for national transport issues on CBS news , that mobile phones are still viewed as a risk .	-3.5071
“ Mobile phones are really a problem , not only because they could potentially cause disturbances in navigation devices , but because we know from the FCC that transmission from the air can also disrupt transmission masts , ” said Rosenker .	-4.0135
A consultancy committee of the industry launched by the FAA to investigate this issue recommended last month that the government allow a broader use of personal electronic devices .	-10.4938
In recent years , pressure on the FAA has increased to relax restrictions on use .	-2.5155
Critics such as the democratic senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri believe that there are no valid security reasons for the ban .	-2.7848
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce , because the use of the devices has become ubiquitous .	-3.4426
In some studies , it talks about forgetting or ignoring up to a third of passengers the disabling of the device .	-4.1376
The FAA began in 1966 to restrict the use of electronic equipment by air passengers after reports of disturbances in navigation and communication equipment had become known by passengers carried by UK radios , which were then the latest technical trend .	-5.2748
New aircraft are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft , but they are also constructed and approved by the FAA that they do not represent anything .	-3.4700
Airlines have been offering passengers Wi-Fi for several years when the height is reached .	-3.4629
The aircraft adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also more insensitive to interferences .	-2.8367
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for greater use of electronic equipment under the new directives , said Huerta .	-2.6154
Today ’ s electronic equipment generally gives much less radiation than previous generations .	-11.2527
E-Readers , for example , give only minimal radiation when you turn over .	-4.8334
However , when downloading or sending data , the transmission values are stronger . .. ... ! ..	-8.3418
Amazon.com is one of the advocates of easing the restrictions on the use of equipment by passengers .	-3.7470
In 2011 , company employees invited a passenger aircraft full of Kindle E-Readers and made a test flight to identify problems , but could not find any .	-4.0211
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using equipment .	-9.8878
Douglas Kidd of the passenger association National Association of Airline Passengers said he believed that the disturbance by the devices is real , even if the risk is minimal .	-3.9884
Other committee members said that there are only specific reports of pilots who speak for the disruption of aircraft systems by the devices , and most of them are very old .	-7.6436
The committee , however , recommended the FAA to allow pilots to arrange the disabling of equipment by passengers in the event of instrument landing in poor visibility .	-4.8022
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and described them as a reasonable adjustment for travellers who today would be fully equipped with technology .	-4.3722
“ We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not contrary to security , ” said Roger Dow , CEO of the U.S. Travel Association .	-2.5934
Released bird saved by air rescue service from North Sea drilling s	-12.6532
A bird flown by air rescue service to the coast , exhausted on a North Sea drill island , was released into nature .	-3.9679
The water rall was flown last month with a helicopter to Aberdeen , where it was bombed up by the Scottish animal welfare organization SPCA in their rescue center in Alloa .	-4.2666
Colin Seddon , Chief of the Centre , said : “ This water rall was probably a winter bird of northern Europe , stopped by the strong winds above the North Sea . ”	-4.2544
Apparently , the exhausted bird sought refuge on the bore island .	-9.6431
He added : “ He could no longer fly , so we were contacted with the request for help . ”	-2.9115

Is Europe ’ s elite prepared to do business with Britain ?	-1.7667
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy together and defining what those who ensure prosperity and work in Britain want to change in our relations with the EU .	-3.7464
To this end , we have commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey among British economic leaders and asked them what they think about Britain , the economy and the EU .	-2.8930
YouGov surveyed over 1,000 business managers , representing about British company sizes , sectors , and regions .	-4.2350
The results of the survey will surprise many .	-1.6249
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now exporting outside Europe and focusing on countries that are modernising and growing while the EU stagnates .	-3.2541
They want new trade links with countries such as China , India , and Brazil to be favoured by government , rather than stopping with the long and hard process of reforming the obscure EU institutions .	-3.8890
Asked for their view on certain legally regulated issues – from antitrust law to product legislation – the majority of economic leaders believe that control over these key competences should be brought back to Westminster .	-3.8722
There was general dissatisfaction with the internal market , because , according to companies , the costs of Brussels ’ rules would now outweigh the advantages of being part of Europe ’ s trade zone – even 40 % of large companies agreed to that that that is traditionally the most euro-friendly . . li, lilililili, , , liliklililitlilililililili	-14.3242
Finally , and this probably says the most , our survey by economic leaders showed that a clear majority of Britain wants a course towards changing the agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade , not politics .	-4.5477
This recognition , which is found among companies of all sizes and leading corporations , shows that the economy is pushing for a “ meaningful change ” that brings the stitching of action back to Britain .	-4.9895
There is a great deal about it – a change to the agreement and better conditions for Britain would lead to a change of opinion in favour of remaining in the EU in a referendum at 16 % .	-4.6398
The Prime Minister should have no doubt : this survey shows that the British economy is behind his plan for renegotiating British conditions for EU membership .	-2.7487
It also shows that companies expect a significant shift of power back to Britain from a renegotiation .	-2.9769
A better deal for the British economy is possible , and increasingly necessary , after the eurozone is moving towards a closer economic and fiscal union .	-2.7990
The priority must be jobs and growth in the United Kingdom , as the result of our survey shows , which means increased attention to trade and fundamental change in the Brussels approach to rules .	-3.5880
Alexei Miller of Gazprom calls pipeline in Bulgaria the beginning of a new gas era	-2.6590
The construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria represents the launch of one of the largest European energy projects , explained by the Gazprom Executive .	-3.8697
“ Today ’ s event is a milestone : the construction work on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline , the largest and most important project in Europe , has begun , ” said the CEO of Gazprom , Alexei Miller , in a declaration on Thursday .	-10.4969
The project is a key element in the energy security of the entire European continent .	-2.0933
South Stream is intended to provide more diversity in Russia ’ s export routes through Europe .	-3.2315
A contractual dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine , where the majority of Russian gas is stored for Europe , ensures an increased risk in conventional routes , as is heard from the official side .	-4.2193
Miller said that the direct link to Bulgaria , a member of the European Union , means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries were “ forever ” eliminated .	-11.5621
Bulgarian consumers receive gas from South Stream at reduced rates when the entire project goes into operation in 2015 .	-2.9007
According to Gazprom , construction work in other subordinate countries should begin on the planned route at the end of the year .	-3.0159
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic metres of natural gas .	-2.0616

Hearing before the Royal Commission : Two YMCA staff charged with accusations against Jonathan Lord of sexual offences	-9.1330
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales ( NSW ) were accused of sexual offences in connection with children before allegations against the childcare professional Jonathan Lord were learned from Caringbah in 2011 , as the Royal Commission for sexual abuse of children learned .	-4.8638
But in the opening declaration before the Commission , the YMCA had said that “ the organization never had to do with an incident of sexual abuse of children . ”	-4.7656
Managing Director Phillip Hare was asked about a case where a YMCA employee was accused of child pornography offences , and another where a sports teacher of YMCA Caringbah Hall had been convicted in 1991 for the abuse of children entrusted to him .	-4.7900
Hare said Gail Furness , a Commission assisting lawyer , that he knew of the first case but did not know the second .	-3.3092
He acknowledged that the YMCA ’ s opening statement to the Commission was also inaccurate in the claim that “ there were external reviews of the YMCA , in which the YMCA was recognised as the front front of child safety . ”	-5.0880
Instead , evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA was informed that it received the second lowest assessment of four possible in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities ( Ministry of Education ) in August of the year .	-3.3019
Hare , who started at YMCA at 21 , acknowledged that the management failed “ from me downwards ” in hiring Lord , and did not ensure that employees were aware of their obligations to report violations of the child safety policies .	-5.1025
Lord was sentenced to YMCA at the beginning of the year for sexual offences to twelve boys during his two-year activity .	-3.5522
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison .	-1.5182
However , Hare disputes that the YMCA would have a cultural problem that prevented employees from reporting Lord ’ s violations of children ’ s safety likely .	-9.5761
The employees said they had observed infringements , including that Lord was alone with children , maintained them privately as babysitters , let them sit on his lap , said he loved it , and let children play with his mobile phone .	-5.9300
Danielle Ockwell , whose superior Lord was asking for a training on child protection because she was concerned about his behavior , said that the child service leader Jacqui Barnat , who was the superior Lords in YMCA Caringbah , was “ very intimidating and most of the time was very unclose . ”	-5.0974
The Managing Director declared that he would not accept statements by employees that they had not dared to report to their superiors .	-3.6570
Instead , he said , their friendship with Lord had affected their judgment , which is why they had not reported it .	-13.8291
Hare declared that he informed the Board of Management of the YMCA NSW that the lesson to draw the organization from the “ Jonathan Lord incident ” concerns “ not reporting ” by employees , and the Board approved it .	-4.6428
Hare said that the decision to urge employees to sign secrecy obligations shortly after the accusations occurred was taken by the Managing Director of the Child Services of YMCA , Liam Whitley .	-3.6165
He said that this should prevent evidence from being contaminated , but that had been “ over-diligent ” and badly implemented .	-12.1727
The YMCA NSW was not a safe organisation for children when Jonathan Lord was there between 2009 and 2011 , declared Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University , expert for sexual child abuse , the Commission .	-3.9639
He explained that there were “ serious problems ” in recruitment , verification , incorporation , training and supervision of employees .	-3.8742
The hearing was postponed until 20 December .	-1.3001

Since his resignation in June 2007 , after a decade as Head of State , Blair has largely avoided speaking about British policy , and his comments usually confined to foreign policy and his role as envoy of the Quartet of the Middle East peacemakers .	-4.8695
The question of whether he would like to return to the Prime Minister ’ s office was quoted by the Evening Standard from London : “ Yes , safe , but it is unlikely that it will happen , so ... ”	-4.1733
When the horse show experts found themselves in Shares in Cardiff to cure the horse of the year , they knew that a hard competition had come up .	-4.9123
But no one was prepared for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland .	-2.3443
The knirps that is not even in the kindergarten and only a few months ago took his first steps , and his Shetland-Pony toffee loosely trapped through the three rounds and brought the first prize – leaving 30 adult opponents behind .	-4.8148
The inseparable couple , both equally large , were praised for their appearance , behavior and style in the annual competition organised by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff .	-3.3243
In his appearance in competition with men and women with elegant melons , he had set up his plate cap in a friendly angle and led the two years old toffee through the ring .	-4.9972
Fenton was praised by the judges for his natural skills in dealing with the pony , which are well above his age .	-4.0173
And toffee received best notes for his appearance and his personality .	-2.8754
Fenton had received toffee last March as a gift to his third birthday and since then practised with the Shetland Pony every day .	-3.3025
His mother , Donna , 30 , said : “ Fenton and Toffee are a great span . ”	-2.3129
They had to compete against the entire field of participants and went out of place with gold and rosette .	-4.2444
It was only the second time that he took part in a competition with toffee , and we were all enthusiastic when he won .	-3.0325
Perfectly strangers in the arena considered him so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him .	-3.8507
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale , South Wales , follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells , which has been showing horses for more than ten years .	-3.1911
Howells said : “ The whole audience was like electric , and everyone fired and clamped it . ”	-4.6195
He ran on sand the entire length of the arena and although he looked so tiny , he did fantastic work .	-3.1907
Fenton is crazy for animals – he loves horses , tractors and farms and has two chickens he cares about .	-2.6755
As he started , it will not take long before he is on the “ horse of the year ” show – and I am sure he will cut off well .	-3.6637
A spokesman of the annual horse show said : “ Fenton is only three , but he knows how to deal with his pony . ”	-2.7315
Together they are a great team .	-1.2815
The juries rated fenton and toffee after how well they had beaten and presented themselves in the demonstration ring .	-4.0813
They pay attention to good cooperation between pony and guide – and there were fenton and toffee the best in the ring .	-3.6048
I am sure that Fenton ’ s sweet clothing has helped her part to make this really perfect for the occasion .	-4.0695
The Chinese Newspaper is to be “ Reformed ” after appeals .	-10.2320
A Chinese newspaper calling on the front page to release a reporter accused of defamation should be reformed , explained a press regulator .	-3.3670
The New Express , based in Guangzhou , had printed a rare public call for the release of the journalist Chen Yongzhou .	-2.5097
But Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to falsify reports on a partial state company .	-3.4037
Now the New Express is being subjected to “ comprehensive rectification , ” the regulatory authority explained .	-3.2316
The “ Rectification Order ” was ordered by the Guangdong Authority for Press and Publications , Radio , Film and Television .	-3.0902
Preliminary investigations showed that the New Express , which belongs to the Yangcheng Evening News Group , had published several untrue reports on the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013 .	-3.0944
“ The editorial management of the New Express was disorderly , ” the regulatory authority announced in a declaration .	-2.6929
She said that he decided to “ impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou and withdraw his report licence . ”	-3.4696
Moreover , “ the Yangcheng Evening News Group has been dependent on making a complete rectification of the New Express and recommended that those responsible for the New Express be identified and immediately reviewed the leadership team of the New Express . ”	-5.0414
Chen wrote several articles for the New Express in which he reported on alleged financial irregularities with a manufacturer of construction machines called Zoomlion .	-3.0019
After being arrested , the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and stood behind his journalistic work .	-2.8857
But then Chen appeared on state television and admitted that he had published false reports against payment .	-13.6295
“ In this case , I have damaged zoomlion as well as the entire news industry and its ability to gain public confidence , ” he explained to the state news station CCTV .	-3.7197
I did it primarily because I was on money and glory .	-2.0093
I realised that I acted wrongly .	-2.8787
Following Chen ’ s apology , the New Express published an excuse on the front page and explained that it failed to properly review the reports .	-10.1335
Various known suspects have recently stored confessions on television .	-2.6264
Experts say that confessions are still routinely forced , despite a legislative amendment at the beginning of the year in which the authorities were forbidden to force someone to accuse themselves .	-3.3981
Discovering Drug Tunnels with Railways between the US and Mexico	-3.0540
One of the most refined tunnels for drug smuggling between the US and Mexico , which was fully equipped with lighting , ventilation , and electric railway operation , has now been discovered .	-3.3962
The US authorities described the 120 times 90 centimetres measuring tunnel as one of the most sophisticated passages they ever found .	-2.6616
The tunnel , which runs over a length of just under six football fields , connects storage halls near Tijuana , Mexico , and San Diego , USA .	-3.5603
There are countless inapparent warehouses in the area , making it easier to hide trucks loaded with drugs .	-3.3987
The tunnel had been closed before drugs could be transported unrecognized , the authorities explained .	-2.9483
In the discovery of the tunnel , eight and a half tonnes of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were ensured , according to the records of the court .	-3.4314
Three men who , according to the authorities , were working as drivers were charged for the possession and intended sale of Marijuana and cocaine .	-4.0373
They are threatened with prison sentences between ten years and lifelong when they are guilty .	-3.6220
In Nogales , Arizona , smugglers rely on an extensive underground network of drainage channels .	-2.2768
The tunnel is the eighth large passage discovered in San Diego since 2006 .	-1.8546
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after the Marijuana harvest in Central Mexico in October , which presents the drug cartels with the challenge they can quickly bring their product to consumers .	-3.5119
In 2010 , authorities found a nearly 640 meters long passage with rails , which ran from a kitchen in a residential house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego .	-4.0765
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love themselves	-1.9432
Actors Orlando Bloom and Model Miranda Kerr want to go separate paths in the future .	-1.9420
In an interview , however , Bloom said that he and Kerr still love .	-2.2722
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents of the two years old Flynn .	-9.0706
Actor Orlando Bloom spoke about the separation of his wife , Topmodel Miranda Kerr .	-2.3433
In an interview with US journalist Katie Couric , which should be broadcast on Friday ( local time ) , Bloom said , " life sometimes does not exactly as we plan or hope " .	-3.3144
Kerr and he still loved himself , emphasized the 36-year-old .	-2.1383
" We will support each other and love each other as Flynn 's parents . lilililililililililililili	-10.4826
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010 , and in 2011 their sons Flynn was born .	-2.2382
According to Lexica , veganism is subject to vegetarianism , but differs considerably from this .	-10.6013
Because while vegetarians allow the consumption of cream cards , ice or a strong edamer , these miseries are not on a vegan 's menu .	-4.6655
Milk , cheese , egg , in addition to the abandonment of meat and fish , the vegan dismisses all consumption of animal products - honey is also denied .	-4.2062
What remains is wonderful , but if we look at it closely , the vegan nutrition world is characterized by a considerable imagination . less and more .	-14.9847
" Bread lines are very popular " , explains Ute Henkelmann , the owner of the local Reform House , which provides a variety of special products for vegans .	-3.6218
Reuben Proctor is also happy to visit the shop in the Domgasse .	-2.7983
For 13 years , the native New Zealand vegan has lived , in Lampertheim he ( almost ) finds everything he needs for life . " In 1997 I changed my diet and became vegetarian " .	-4.9168
At the turn of the century the next step was taken and I became vegan .	-2.3076
" The conviction came not only because of nutrition , but because of the shoe choice , " says Proctor , the artistic leather prefers normal leather .	-4.1521
He recognized that there are other everyday concerns without animal products .	-3.4069
Vegan is primarily an ethics .	-2.6557
" I don 't want animals to die for me , " Proctor expresses the maxim of vegans extending to all consumption behaviour .	-3.7174
Instead of mourning burgers , stirring eggs or rubber bears , the vegan quickly discovered completely new products that increased enthusiasm .	-3.4396
" It is a double bonus , " says Proctor today , " actually vegan is not a waiver , not an ascese , but an enrichment " .	-4.9563
And that is precisely what some of these conditions have failed .	-5.6309
" The addiction factor is a very crucial factor that lets many quickly abandon , similar to smoking , " Proctor makes a comparison .	-4.2293
And uses : " Certain tastes are not to be fixed on the animal " .	-4.8977
Often it is the spices or the type of preparation that make the taste .	-2.8995
" You can also generate the same effect in other ways , " explains the vegan .	-3.5744
For example , Proctor brings aubergines , champignons and also some vegan sausages .	-3.1878
It pays attention to a balanced , varied diet , where it should also taste flavourfully .	-5.1470
Of course , one wants something between the teeth , that is legitimate .	-2.7921
" It should taste , but this is not just to reduce animal food , " says Proctor .	-3.0420
Health damage to eating disorders , another widespread assumption , he did not suffer .	-2.2560
For me , the changeover had a positive aspect .	-2.0891
I do not record a foreign cholesterol and have an increased share of vitamins .	-3.3065
There are high-performance athletes who feed only vegan .	-2.4104
" My blood values are best , I often let me check , " Proctor betrays .	-3.6669
Especially against the lack of vitamin B12 , many vegansimus critics warn .	-2.5630
" As animals are nourished with feed instead of grassing on the pasture , it is questionable whether in the meat you purchase in the refrigerator , the vitamin B12 percentage is high " , Proctor finds .	-5.2755
For vegans there is also the possibility of taking the coenzyme in the form of tablets .	-3.0313
" My B12 values are in order , " he explains .	-2.0636
Proctor does not need to go a long way for food procurement .	-3.3909
Finally , basic foods exist everywhere and every supermarket now has soya milk and other products .	-3.0049
I find everything I need on the ground .	-2.3540
Only from time to time I buy something special .	-2.2073
" Many people overlook the fact that only the finished products are expensive , but that is how it behaves in " ordinary " finished products known as " .	-4.5405
In any case , the preparation of vegan dishes is much cheaper and less time-consuming than is commonly assumed .	-3.9311
" In the house kitchen there is much to discover , with a few small tins you can get good if not partly better results " , says Proctor .	-4.8691
Margarine instead of butter , a little more baking powder and carbon dioxide instead of egg , with its vegan cheese cakes Proctor could also bring his parents to discover .	-5.0851
Family festivals give the vegan a new season .	-2.5879
This has a dynamic effect , if you cook together , that valua new one .	-12.0216
" The situations that can arise are as different as the people themselves , " says Proctor .	-2.3657
Of course , however , he was already sceptical about it .	-4.5021
Do you not taste my food any more ?	-8.2338
" Should I feel bad now because I drink milk ? " - on such questions you have to act as a vegan with fingertip feeling .	-4.4531
" I do not reject people , I am part of this society , " Proctor does not want to be an enclave .	-3.5016
And , more precisely , the world of everyday life does not appear as vegan alien as suspected - and the vegan does not appear as limited in everyday life as is commonly assumed .	-5.8688
Fast food is also allowed .	-1.3034
Pommes exists everywhere !	-2.6470
" Many donor shops offer Falafel , or just a vegetarian yufka , " says Proctor .	-2.6049
In a pizzeria he evades pasta dishes , or orders a pizza without cheese , everything a question of habit .	-3.1389
The restaurants are so slow to adjust .	-3.5112
" When I started to feed myself vegan 13 years ago , everything was even more difficult , " the New Zealand can find a development : " You have to talk to the people , draw them to the attention " .	-4.3441
" If enough demand comes , they may be inclined to complement the menu , " he hopes .	-2.7886
Vegan restaurants develop , such as the comb in Mannheim or the café bird free .	-3.2221
Proctor wishes that other restaurants also have a vegan menu .	-3.1495
Vegan dishes are actually there for all .	-9.8792
Everyone can eat them , so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive .	-1.9041
" Meat dishes are exclusive , in the truest sense of the word , because they exclude others , " Proctor notes .	-3.1964
" If you want to avoid food scandals , veganism is a safe way to make most of the part impossible from the outset , " says Proctor .	-3.1192
But purchasing vegan products may be a bit difficult at the beginning .	-3.2359
Especially when you learn to understand that animal additives may also be included in peanuts as colours , you seem to leave courage quickly by following ethics in so many hurdles and traps .	-5.0385
Not only therefore , Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen have written a book : " Veganissimo - Animal ingredients and their alternatives " explains the many ingredients , the food and cleaning products are being contribu.	-8.9445
" Gradually you develop a scanner view and know which characters and logos you have to pay attention to " It is sometimes better to do little steps than stop or stumble " , Proctor knows .	-4.3149
Veganism , it is an important moral fingerpoint that beats on awareness .	-3.3033
Perhaps he does not quite succeed in depositing his habits , but at least he can teach consumers to question his habits critically .	-3.7779
The stock exchange operator Nasdaq OMX keeps its customers in breath .	-2.3139
Trading at the Nasdaq Options Market was interrupted on Friday afternoon in German .	-3.0661
In a communication the operator made technical problems responsible .	-2.2762
The other 11 US option markets , including two of the Nasdaq OMX , continued their business unhindered .	-13.0659
The recent incident continues a whole series of smaller and larger breaks with the stock exchange operator .	-2.8958
Only on Tuesday the indices of the Nasdaq had not been calculated for an hour due to errors in data transport .	-3.4915
In August this year alone , there had been two barriers .	-3.4615
First , the US Investment Bank Goldman Sachs had sent massive incorrect orders to the option markets due to technical problems .	-3.5563
As a result , the stock exchange operators needed almost a whole day to look through and delete the orders .	-3.5484
Two days later , half of the total stock trade in the United States came to a halt for several hours because of a computer pan on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange .	-4.5728
Moreover , last year , Facebook ’ s stock exchange course had caused attention .	-4.7957
The Nasdaq systems had not grown the flood of purchase and sales orders , later determined the SEC stock exchange supervision and dispersed the company into a record fine of $ 10 million .	-4.5170
Konstanz : Cyclists Drive 63 Years	-3.5456

British Police Makes Assange a Delivery DetA AAAAAAAAAAAAA	-12.6820
Today , the British police handed over a delivery description to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange , who sought refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and applied for asylum .	-3.6808
Scotland Yard declared that the 40-year-old Australian was delivered a “ call to ask him to appear in a police guard , and added , if he failed to comply , threaten him with arrest .	-5.4487
Assange threatens extradition to Sweden because of the charge in a sexual delicacy after his possibilities under British law have been exhausted since the Supreme Court rejected his objection to extradition earlier this month .	-4.6430
Since he fears that Stockholm will deliver him to the US , he had sought refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on 19 June , and asked the South American country for political asylum . is likliklin.	-10.7011
Scotland Yard “ delivered a call to a 40-year-old man to face up to a police guard at a time we chose , ” said a spokesman .	-4.4573
He continues to violate the terms of his release on deposit .	-1.8575
The message did not comment on the delivery of the police call .	-2.5426

Tax for foreign property owners against London ’ s Speculative Bubble	-2.2979
The Ministry of Finance has provisionally calculated the CGT measure , but is still waiting for the final decision of Chancellor George Osborne , who imposed a stamping tax of 7 % on homes in the 2012 budget , costing more than two million pounds , and annual charges for buyers who consider housing as company and not as individuals .	-9.9795
Already , revenues from the stamp tax on residential property in the districts of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea , which in the tax year 2012 / 13 were 708 million pounds , which collected revenues for Northern Ireland , Wales , Scotland , the North-East , North-West , Yorkshire and the Humber region .	-4.7776
Cook said : “ After the increases in stamp tax on high-price homes and the introduction of the related legislation against circumvention , it is difficult to claim that high-quality properties are too low , regardless of the impact of the outdated community tax system . ”	-4.4092
“ But this step could make some foreign investors more restrained in terms of purchasing real estate in London , or prevent owners from selling it , ” he added .	-3.5193
First-class real estate – the top five to ten percent of the housing market by price – in the wealthy London southwest belt , which extends from Fulham to Wimbledon , expended by the record value of 11.8 % last year .	-4.3322
The prices in Central London showed an even annual growth of 5.6 % , but were overshadowed by an emerging “ domestic market ” where the south-western part of the city , the north ( 7.4 % ) and the east ( 6.5 % ) experienced an upward trend , such an investigation by Savills .	-4.4261
Scientists were able to throw more light on the context in which a dog 's tail spots are related to his mood .	-5.2486
Previous research showed that happy dogs with the tail were waving more to the right ( from the point of view of the dog ) , while it was the left for nervous dogs .	-4.9692
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive and respond to these subtle differences .	-2.1532
Professor Georgio Vallortigara , a neuroscientist at the University of Trento , said : “ Humans know well that the left and right brain respond differently to stimuli that causes positive or negative emotions . ”	-3.3982
Here we tried to look at this with other species .	-2.5369
He also noticed that in dogs , just like humans , the right half of the brain is responsible for the movement of the left and vice versa , and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the feelings .	-4.3041
To learn more about how dogs respond to the side of their species , researchers monitored the animals while these films of other dogs looked at .	-4.3782
They measured the heart rate of the four-legged and analyzed the behaviour .	-11.7708
Probably we will soon understand why the tail moves in one direction , sometimes in the other direction .	-3.5652
Professor Vallortigara said : “ We showed the dogs films with dogs – either a natural version or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects , and thus we could control the tail movement more left or right . ”	-4.0239
When the animals saw how an otherwise expressive dog moved the tail to the right ( seen from the perspective of the weaving dog ) , they remained completely relaxed .	-4.3265
But when the tail tendency was primarily left ( again from the perspective of the dog who waves ) , their heart rate rose and they looked alarming .	-6.0014
According to Professor Vallortigara , dogs do not deliberately communicate with each other through these movements .	-2.6516
Rather , he is convinced that the dogs would have learned from experience what movements they should worry about and when not .	-3.7356
He said : “ If you have different meetings with other dogs and the tail is more linked to the tail in a direction with friendly behavior and the right produces a less friendly behaviour , you respond on the basis of these experiences . ”	-5.6529
Researchers say that the findings of dog owners , veterinarians and trainers could help to understand the emotions of their animals bet. lililililililililililililililili	-8.9346
John Bradshaw , expert for dog behavior and guest scholarship at the Faculty of Animal Health at the University of Bristol , said that this was not the first study to examine whether left and right was important for dogs .	-8.2054
Last year , a team of the University of Lincoln found out that dogs turn the head left when they look at an aggressive dog , and to the right when it is a satisfied dog .	-13.2742
In another research at the University of Victoria in Canada , the following was : “ Dogs are more likely to go to a robot dog , when his tail is waving <unk> left and not right , rather than becoming troubled – exactly the other way around than in the Italian study . ”	-6.2823
According to his statement , the differences could therefore stem that the dogs in the various studies did not interpret animals in the films or robot dogs as dogs .	-3.8208
A study of how dogs respond to real dogs could help , he explained .	-2.1988
“ While there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two brain halves are used for different purposes , many of the details still need to be determined – and dogs are no exception , ” says Bradshaw .	-3.2774
However , since their behavior can be recorded simply , it will probably not take long until we understand why the tail sometimes moves in one direction , sometimes in the other direction .	-3.8266
Moving Arctic Monkeys in Glasgow because of the disease Alex Turners	-3.2846
The Rockband Arctic Monkeys has postponed a performance in Glasgow after her lead singer has been illness to inflammation .	-4.6336
The band from Sheffield should play in Hydro on Friday .	-2.1141
Because of the illness of the lead singer Alex Turner , the concert must now be moved .	-3.5456
The announcement of the band came after she had to postpone a performance in the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday .	-3.3678
In a statement on their official website , the Arctic Monkeys informed : “ After the decision to cancel the show at the LG Arena in Birmingham this evening and at medical advice , the Arctic Monkeys must also cancel the show in Hydro in Glasgow on Friday 1 November . ”	-4.1375
“ Alex Turner diagnosed a throat head inflammation , which unfortunately cannot occur . ”	-4.0580

Pope Francis appoints First Cardinals in February	-1.7963
Pope Francis will be appointing new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on 22 February , as the Vatican announced on Th .	-14.0006
Cardinals are the senior clerics in the Catholic Church after the Pope , and they are also the ones who choose a Pope , so that Francis will appoint the first group of men who will ultimately participate in the election of his sucler .	-12.1934
There are currently 201 cardinals .	-1.4217
However , a cardinal that has reached an age of 80 can no longer participate in the Pope ’ s election – a group of 120 “ voting cardinals . ”	-13.7894
In an explanation in which the message was announced , Father Federico Lombardi , a Vatican spokesman , said that a meeting of all cardinals will take place before the ceremony is held to appoint the new cardinals , which is also known as the consistory .	-12.0114
“ Pope Francis decided to announce his decision to convene the consistory in February in advance so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from around the world can be planned , ” said Lombardi .	-3.2765
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of eligible cardinals will probably have fallen by February .	-2.4279
He explained that a Pope usually appoint as many cardinals as necessary to return the number of eligible cardinals to 120 , and as many cardinals over 80 as he wants .	-3.5000
The consistency next year is important because it is the first since the election of Francis in March this year , according to Valero .	-3.2103
There is currently a certain overhang on the part of Europe and in particular Italy .	-9.7661
“ It will be interesting to see if the new Pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore the balance , ” he said .	-2.1157
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America , but they have only a tiny number of cardinals .	-1.8200
The cardinals will also be the first to be appointed since the formation of the Cardinals Council established by Francis , a group of eight cardinals from all over the world who have the mandate to find ways to reform the church .	-3.9177
In the past , the Pope decided everything alone .	-1.6377
“ Now Francis has selected these eight cardinals to help him , ” said Valero .	-2.3472
He said that it was “ possible ” for Francis to ask for advice on the cardinals .	-9.5615
But so far we have not been in this position – that is all new .	-3.9620
Valero said that typically the bishops would be called to cardinals from large places , but Francis is “ full of surprises – so we do not know who he appoints . ”	-3.5075
GM Returns New Pickup Trucks in the United States to Repair the Seat Repair	-10.1708
General Motors call back almost 19,000 of his brand new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra Pickup trucks with construction year 2014 to resolve a problem with the manually adjustable seat rest , such as a communication from the US American Regulatory Authority for Vehicle Safety on Friday .	-4.8765
Some of the cars may have a defect in the front seat reset mechanism .	-3.0191
That is why they do not comply with the Federal German Federal Guidelines for Vehicle Safety at head restraints .	-3.8741
“ When the head restraint is raised from the back to the vehicle , it is possible that the passengers are not properly protected , so there is an increased risk of injury , ” was read in the news on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ( NHTSA ) website .	-4.7776
The recalled models were produced between 1 August and 10 September .	-2.4259
The delivery of GM trucks began in June and represents the most important model launch of the leading US automaker since the insolvency-related restructuring in 2009 .	-3.6338

Desperate a Obama voter	-2.6560
I have elected President Obama twice in the hope that change is possible .	-2.4209
He says that Obama has made laudable efforts frustrated by Republican blockade detactics	-3.1324
The blockade policy does not apologize for the website problems of Obamacare , the drone attacks	-3.1370
Obama ’ s 2008 campaign memoirs were a sad memory of what would have been possible .	-2.3760
Nathaniel P. Morris is a student in the second year at the Harvard Medical School .	-2.1249
I am currently reading a terribly sad book .	-1.8508
It is a book I believed that during the deceptive second year of my studies of medicine , I would maintain and give me hope again .	-6.1933
It is called “ The Audacity to Win ” and describes the Memoirs Barack Obama ’ s presidential election in 2008 .	-2.9643
When I finished my patient writings and go to bed in the evening , the book brings me back to a time when politics could inspire millions and breathe a speech .	-4.9910
The election became a landslide victory and news spokesman to remind you of the historical importance of this hour .	-11.6125
My classmates were crying with joy and my parents collected all the newspapers they could find .	-2.8317
A young team of visionaries was on the way to the White House and the nation was ready for change .	-1.9249
When Obama moved to office in 2008 , he had 82 % approval values .	-3.1296
And then I close the book .	-1.3744
Turning back to the present is a bad awakening as if you are torn out of a dream .	-3.2546
It is hard to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague memory , a sad reminder of missed opportunities .	-2.2267
In the years since I voted for the first time , something has changed .	-2.6436
But it is simply nothing I could have imagined .	-2.0053
I acknowledge the great and versatile things that Obama has achieved , from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for Health Insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq , the end of the forced concealment of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden .	-2.9242
I agree that party-political blocking tactics have tipped too many efforts to push our nation forward : immigration reform , a public health insurance option and closing Guantanamo Bay , to name but a few .	-4.2270
But , having defended the Obama administration countless times against colleagues and acquaintances , I have come to an end with my attempts to explain .	-4.0224
I have reached a point of political despair .	-1.2822
Republican blockade policy cannot explain why foreign heads of state are allowed to listen or the killing of innocent children listened overse.	-13.8924
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data on the private lives of Americans and why whistleblowers are punished that disclose government misbehavior .	-3.3805
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki , a US citizen , was murdered without procedures , nor why public financing and spending limits are being circumvented during the presidential elections .	-3.3737
It does not justify the results of a report that says that the White House ’ s efforts to calm the media are the “ most aggressive ... since the Nixon government . ”	-9.2054
And recently it cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website in the more than three years since the Affordable Care Act was adopted .	-3.2487
I do not know if that is what I should have expected .	-1.7197
Whether I should have understood with 18 that government work could contradict its previous political campaigns .	-2.8264
Obviously , the Office of Members is not a predictable course , because an opposition party and random events such as the Newtown massacre shape public discussion .	-3.7899
But if I look at the examples mentioned above , they seem to be largely elected by the government itself .	-2.7041
And that disturbs me most .	-2.6152
I elected Obama again in 2012 , not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy .	-1.9386
Mitt Romney represented a confusing and unbalanced alternative , he seemed unable to define his direction and positions .	-3.6466
I had the impression that a second term for Obama , free from the pressure of future elections , would fulfil the hope we had heard of for so long .	-2.9710
But , with the decline in Obama ’ s approval values to less than 45 % this week , returning to 2008 has become all the harder through the book line .	-9.3740
It arouses in me the longing for the many promises that have dissolved in air .	-3.8822
This week I read a section in the book describing how Obama had to infect a serious loss against Clinton in the primary elections in Pennsylvania .	-3.0276
In a meeting with the electoral assistants after the decision , he told his staff that they should come back to course and follow the purpose of their cause .	-4.2614

Clive Palmer claims that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has conflict of interest in parental leave	-1.9698
The billionaire and Mr Clive Palmer says that Prime Minister Tony Abbott would be in a conflict of interest in his parental leave plans , because his daughters could become pregnant and therefore benefit from it .	-3.4440
The mining magnate , which is in a judicial confrontation over the payment of $ 6 million in CO2 tax , made the claim when he wanted to wipe questions from the table as to whether he was in a conflict .	-4.9538
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate , which are important for deciding whether to delete or cut CO2 and mining taxes .	-3.0404
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and that the daughters of Abbott would benefit personally from the laws .	-2.3056
“ He is in a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave , because when one of his daughters becomes pregnant , he has a direct interest in whether or not she gets holidays , ” said Palmer .	-8.5494
Two months after the election , the Palmer electoral commission officially declared a winner of the Fairfax Sunshine Coast seat with 53 votes in advance after the recount .	-4.7039
Palmer called for a revision of the voting counting process so that it can take place more quickly .	-3.5561

Should these elections be decided two months after the end of the vote ?	-1.2649
“ We need a better system , ” he said .	-1.2109
Why should we not have a system where you march in , enter data into a computer immediately and then have the result at 6 : 30 in the evening ?	-4.0387
Palmer also criticized the use of pencils when marking the ballot papers .	-13.8556
Do you use them because you can then wipe out the results if you don 't like them ?	-4.1360
To vote with pencils today is incredible .	-2.3777
The Electoral Commission has examined the options for an electronic election and has recently published a joint legislative proposal with New Zealand .	-2.5042
Palmer , 59 , said that his policy would include an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new office “ very seriously . ”	-3.0858
A public office is about public service .	-2.3923
“ We do not aspire to reward except that of history , namely that we can serve in a critical time of this community , ” he said .	-11.2932
RBS Suspends Two Forex Dealers	-2.1351
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange department , including two people who are familiar with the situation ; this is another indication that global government investigation into the alleged manipulations of the currency market is taking a rapid journey .	-4.9658
Some of the world ’ s largest banks , including UBS , Barclays , Deutsche Bank , and RBS , confirmed that they cooperate with the authorities in investigating the world ’ s largest financial market , where USD 5.3 billion change the owner every day .	-3.6127
The two dealers would be the first RBS employees suspended in the expanding investigation that results from the scandal of the Libor interbank business .	-17.6440
The Bank , which did not comment on suspensions , confirmed this month that it had received information requests from authorities .	-7.5539
“ Our investigations on this issue continue and we cooperate fully with the FCA and other regulatory authorities , ” said the Bank two weeks ago .	-2.7223
Last month , the situation suggested that the RBS forwarded the records of e-mails and instant messages sent by and to a former dealer to the British regulatory authority , the Financial Conduct Authority .	-10.6854
This dealer , Richard Usher , had left the RBS in 2010 and is now to have been left by his current position as European head of the Forex spot trade at JPMorgan .	-4.1249
Rohan Ramchandani , head of the European Spot Trading near Citi , was holiday this week and Matt Gardiner , formerly leading currency dealer at Barclays and UBS , was suspended this week at Standard Chartered .	-3.5072
None of these traders has been accused of any misconduct .	-2.8598
Usher ’ s Instant Message Group included bankers at Barclays and Citigroup , said the situation nearby people .	-3.5358
UBS announced this week that it took steps against some of its employees after the Swiss Regulatory Authority Finma declared that it examined a alleged manipulation of the foreign exchange market in a number of Swiss banks .	-4.2422
At least six authorities around the world – the European Commission , Finma , the Swiss Competition Authority Weko , the FCA , the US Department of Justice , and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently dealing with accusations that bankers should have agreed on transactions in the monetary market .	-3.5938
HSBC , Citigroup , JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also initiated internal investigations or received information requests from authorities , said people familiar with the situation .	-3.1887
Banks comb instant messages and emails from several years in search of cases of misbehavior .	-2.6822
The news about these investigations has put traders into turmoil in an area that has in recent years been one of the most profitable of the trading units of investment banks , but this year has been under pressure , because low volatility in currencies limits opportunities for speculators .	-10.5237
Some bankers have tried to downplay the affair and said that it is almost impossible to manipulate the extensive and highly liquid foreign exchange market , but leaders believe that this is not necessarily true .	-3.1869
A leading trader noted that , despite the enormous daily volume of foreign-exchange trading , the fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use of internal platforms by banks leads to “ the market being affected by very low ticket prices . ”	-4.6215
The news came out the same day when Credit Suisse announced that this week she cancelled a trader of her London Exchange Traded Funds office after causing a loss of just under $ 6 million at the end of last year .	-3.6722
The Bank promptly informed the competent authorities and works with them .	-1.7031
“ We are sure that the trader has acted alone and that the matter is contained , ” said Credit Suisse .	-2.8129
The Building Fence on the Bechtle Ploe	-9.5633
A group of citizens ' initiative " Swiss meadows " has beautifully enhanced the building fence on the Bechtle plot on the spa promenade in Bad Herrenalb .	-4.3675
Furthermore , she cleaned and widened the footpath , says it in a press release .	-12.5072
The planned cover of the disintegrating house in the rear part of the property was not allowed for security reasons , because the terrain threatens to slip down .	-18.1009
Alfred Abel , who is currently managing the property , had agreed to the BI 's enchanting action with his colleague Reinhard Domke .	-4.6256
Before the action of the BI , a transparent message was sent out with the message ' We are in favour ' .	-5.3632
However , this did not disturb the about 20 members of the citizens ' initiative in their action .	-3.6715
Your motto on the great poster was called " We are against building ruins " .	-2.8221
She wanted to point out the danger of even greater ruins on the Swiss meadow - the giant project should one day fail .	-4.2545
In conversation with many passers-by in front of the building site , it became clear that some citizens believe that the realisation of the city 's project will be better for many , although not few of the same questions have the same questions as the BI .	-5.2802
But they start to resign because the city continues to delay these answers , it is called by the BI .	-3.2106
As we have heard , the public statements of the mayor also have an impact .	-3.8736
May had said at the Council meeting that he feared the thermal bath if the population voted against the plans for a bathing and wellness complex on the Swiss meadow .	-4.7813
Some therefore appear almost frightened , others feel they are " plummet blackmail attempts " to the population , stated in the BI press release .	-6.0843
The BI thanked the donors for the color and all helpers .	-2.2967
Rangnic Schelte for Shiris : Mane No Swallow King	-9.7596
So satisfied Ralf Rangnick with the current high form of Bundesliga table leader Red Bull Salzburg is also , so disappointed the sports director of the " bulls " by the referees .	-4.5274
" There is a dangerous tendency that mane and Alan are pushed into the category Schwalbenkönige , " he took the two offensive advertisers into protection on Thursday at a press conference in Salzburg .	-3.4899
Recent occasion for Rangnick 's criticism was yellow for mane at 3 : 0 against Grödig last Sunday , where the Senegalese became a supposed actress - which was not , however , as the TV pictures showed .	-5.2416
" A stark mistake " , Rangnick , who referred to Harkam as " completely overstretched " .	-4.2652
Harkam would also have contributed " his part " to the escalation between Salzburg-Coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig-Trainer Adi Hütter after the game .	-2.6036
He defended his German compatriot : " I would have behaved in every situation in the same way as Roger Schmidt " .	-3.5177
Schmidt himself does not want to have contact with his colleague after the Scharmützel with Hütter .	-2.6343
I didn 't know why . lilitlittlililililililili	-7.9220
" For I am the one who was insulted , " stressed the 46-year-old .	-3.4059
In the face of the success , Rangnick approved a praise anthem .	-4.2583
" There are only two words : right well , " he said .	-3.6465
There is not much to suspend .	-1.2358
Especially the way the team plays is impressive .	-2.1187
This should continue quietly .	-2.5895
Changes in winter transfer time will hardly exist .	-3.2861
There are no great reasons to change something .	-1.8477

Supreme Court Confirms Obama ’ s Health Law	-1.5684
It is a great victory for the Obama administration : the US Supreme Court today decided that the closely linked health law with Barack Obama is constitutional .	-2.6581
With five to four votes , the judges judged that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ’ s single mandate – forcing US citizens to complete or pay a penalty by 2014 – is constitutional within the framework of the government ’ s tax authority .	-3.9906
Judge John Roberts beat the side of the four more liberal members of the Chamber , while the judges Scalia , Thomas , Alito and Kennedy decided against .	-11.6724
The Court also confirmed the remaining paragraphs of the 2700 pages comprehensive law and also confirmed that the prescription of the health law , according to which states would either have to extend the conditions of access for Medicaid or otherwise delete all State Medicaid support , is not unconstitutionally restrictive .	-6.0741
The action against the law had been taken by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business .	-2.6707
The law had been firmly rejected by all the leading Republican presidential candidates , including the final challenger , Mitt Romney , in the 2012 pre-election campaign .	-10.0304
Norway : Norway ’ s Giant Mirrors Light	-10.1672
With huge mirrors , the inhabitants of a Norwegian village have brought light to their dark valley .	-9.0632
Due to the low degree of sunlight , the Rjukan , situated in the Vestfjord valley , usually sinks in the shadow of the surrounding mountains from autumn to spring .	-4.3777

So far , sun-hungry people had to travel to a nearby summit in winter .	-18.1825
Ten years ago , local artist Martin Andersen presented the proposal to steer rays with mirrors into the valley .	-2.6960
This basic idea has been in place since 1913 .	-3.1516
After several years of debate , the City Council finally adopted the 5 million crowns ( around 615 000 euros ) expensive project .	-3.5019

Post Barely Empty Sunday !!!!!!!!!!!!!!	-9.0326
" Many citizens will not have noticed it yet , the red points for Sunday empty are still at various letter boxes of the core city and the districts , but reading the small printed on the yellow containers of Post AG , you quickly find out that the empty on Sundays and holidays no longer takes place , " says the FDP .	-5.5665
A request from the FDP confirmed that .	-2.1101
On Sundays and public holidays , only in front of the postal building in Ernst-Ludwig-Stra<unk>e 36 and at Jakob-Müller-Stra<unk>e 1 in Hüttenfeld are emptied . liis the limited lilililililimling lilinlilingera lili	-11.1177
Whether emptied in Hofheim and Rosengarten on Sunday will not be answered in the answer to the FDP question .	-3.6945
The social and youth spokesman of the FDP , Fritz Röhrenbeck , wants to follow up here .	-3.5506
Sunday empty is an important postal service at appointment post .	-3.4353
" This enterprise thinks radically and unreasonably , despite the price increase for letters on January 2013 " .	-3.6091
Thomas Bittner , Chairman of the Liberal Group and Citizens ' Association , supports his group colleagues : ' What annoys me is the fact that clamb times are changed or deleted ' .	-4.7729
The post office is miles away from the citizens ' profrom here . you will find lililililililililili	-12.3385
" At least the letter boxes in the Neuschloss and Rosengarten need to be emptied again on Sundays , " said Bittner and Röhrenbeck unisono .	-3.9913
The core town also applies , especially non-mobile fellow citizens would need to be able to reach a letter box with Sunday empty .	-4.9202
Röhrenbeck asked in the city parliament whether the city administration is planning talks with the post office on this matter .	-3.8268
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the post did not communicate with Lampertheim .	-1.6418
His knowledge , however , also exists in Hofheim on Sundays .	-10.2688
Your party has voted in favour of privatisation .	-7.9365
" Then decisions are taken elsewhere , " said Maier .	-1.8039
Frankfurt Park Fees Should Rise Sharply	-3.9129
Parking in Frankfurt could soon become more expensive .	-1.8805
This morning , the city ’ s magistrate advises on a presentation of traffic decerned Stefan Majer ( Green ) .	-3.9297
Parking fees are therefore to be increased by 50 percent .	-2.6253
However , it is not intended to raise prices , but to shorten the time interval of parking clocks and parking automatic machines from 30 to 20 minutes .	-4.7464
In December , the City Regulatory Assembly will have to decide .	-3.4074
The retail committee of the IHK Frankfurt considers this to be ' no good idea ' .	-2.9790
The parking facilities in front of the business are " a non-underestimating advantage for smaller dealers " .	-4.5086
The German Transport Club believes that an increase after two decades is " quite appropriate and actually long overdue " .	-3.4593
Public transport will also become more expensive .	-2.0468
Joy City : Rapid Actions Transgressing ers	-11.7673
With a narrow cader , the gentlemen I of the TSV Freudenstadt had to take part in the Schiller-Schulturnhalle in Reutlingen against the TG Gönningen from the Swabian Alb .	-4.0380
The Alblers were on the other side with an experienced team .	-2.9165
Soon , however , it became evident that , even age-related , they were unable to compete entirely with the rapid actions of the joyful cities .	-12.0578
With the hard and placed premiums the Gönninger did extremely hard .	-3.8725
They repeatedly missed the passports and attacks played by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz cleanly over the network and were not available in block defense .	-4.2244
Two high first sentences clearly expressed the superiority of the towns of joy in all matters .	-3.6387
Given this crushing and game-determining performance , the third sentence was then somewhat lax and lustless at the 3 : 0 end level ( 25 : 13 , 25 : 14 , 25 : 22 ) .	-5.0245
On November 2 , a much more powerful opponent will be on the field with the TV Baiersbronn , which could clearly prevail in Nagold .	-4.4220
TSV Freudenstadt I : Dominik Bäuerle , Yannik Büchle , Sebastian Dölker , Felix Pälchen , Stefan Räller , Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz .	-1.5867
The second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt were opposed in the B-class in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn .	-3.3947
They delivered a hard competitive two-hour match .	-2.2841
Nervousness on both sides caused mistakes and point gifts especially during ball acceptance ; the precision was sometimes deficient and in some critical game scenes the over-eye prevented point gains .	-6.5407
In this powerful very balanced encounter , however , the TSV team of Marcus Blasutto consistently agreed to the great physical use and encouragement of both teams .	-5.4489
Maintenance Day at the Small English C! ! ! !!!!!	-7.2992
A group of committed participants met at the small English hut in Ibach for the fifth day in the succession of the Natura 2000 project of upper Hotzenwald .	-4.2471
Due to suggestions from the population , this day in the area of the hut the view should be released into the valley , said Mayor Helmut Kaiser .	-4.6772
Many hikers , according to Emperor , described this area as the gloss of the ravine climb , where the landscape offers the ideal setting for wonderful views .	-4.8512
He thanked the present for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the day of care is a suitable tool for strengthening the connection between human and nature .	-4.1391
It provides every citizen with the opportunity to put emphasis on themselves in nature .	-3.5485
At the same time , with the tourist aspect , environmental consideration can also be taken into account .	-3.8817
Friederike Tribukait explained this environmental aspect from the Freiburg Nature Protection Department following the welcome of Landrat Tilman Bollacher , who took over the patronage and wished the action a good success .	-4.7854
According to Tribukait , the tourist objective of the vision is to preserve the old Allmendweidfeld with its specific protected habitat types by opening and connecting to the existing pastures .	-5.2345
Certain species , such as rare butterflies and grassroots , cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest areas .	-2.9881
You need these free connections to keep the art .	-10.8184
Tribukait said she does not want to miss here a break for the planned biosphere area .	-3.4600
The current measure is not only seamless in this planning .	-3.1101
A biosphere area also offers the opportunity to sustainable economic and environmental development on the basis of internationally recognised Unesco status and thus a continuous addition to the future achieved with the life project and the previous nursing days .	-4.7276
According to these various designs , Christoph Wehle and Life project manager Cornelia Bischoff divided the helpers into groups .	-3.4972
The larger trees had already been beaten in advance , and the forestry tractor may be ready to call .	-4.2012
A group of helpers should take care of the exemption of juniper bushes and the maintenance of a dry stone bar .	-3.1724
The goal was the free view at the point of view .	-9.8281
Löffingen : Heads of Still Only Candidate	-2.7490
Information on the Internet : Although the Baarstädtchen Löffingen , with its 7514 inhabitants , an intact infrastructure , a forward-looking school , children , youth and seniors policy , as well as its own urban plants , can be described as an attractive city , no second mayor candidate has yet been reported .	-5.0170
As the only candidate for the succession of the mayor Norbert Brugger , who is no longer a candidate for age reasons , the 46-year-old banking businessman and businessman Dieter Köpfler from Löffingen has been established .	-5.2889
The application period expires on Monday 11 November at 6 p.m.	-2.3506
Google , Samsung , Huawei for Nortel Patents	-1.7574
The group , which owns thousands of former Nortel patents , strictly infringed an avalanche of complaints on Thursday due to patent infringement against mobile phone manufacturers , including Google , the company that was outbid from Nortel during the insolvency auction .	-5.6678
Rockstar , the consortium purchased by the Nortel patents for $ 4.5 billion , sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd , HTC Corp , Huawei , and four other companies for patent infringements in Texas .	-9.4608
Rockstar is shared by Apple , Microsoft , BlackBerry , Ericsson and Sony .	-1.8018
Google is accused of patent infringement in seven cases .	-1.7252
The patents concern technology that matches search terms on the Internet with relevant advertising , hence the complaint that hits the core of Google 's search engine business .	-3.8032
Representatives of Samsung , Huawei , HTC and Rockstar were not directly accessible .	-1.9599
Samsung , Huawei and HTC manufacture mobile phones that work with Google ’ s Android operating system , which is in sharp competition with Apple ’ s and Microsoft ’ s mobile products live li.	-9.3658
In 2011 , Google issued an initial bid of more than $ 900 million for Nortel patents .	-2.7288
Google increased its offer several times and last offered $ 4.4 billion .	-2.4257
After being overbidden with the Nortel patents of Rockstar , Google Motorola Mobility acquired $ 12.5 billion , a business that was also partly motivated by Motorola 's library of patents .	-4.0174
“ Although Google failed with his attempt to acquire complaint patents during the auction , Google has injured and continues to do so , ” says the complaint .	-4.3303
Rockstar demands a high compensation from Google because it claims that Google 's patent infringement is deliberate , according to the accusation .	-3.5457
Egypt Sworring First Freely Elected Presidents	-2.5916
Mohammed Morsi is taking office , but his day of triumph should not mean the end of political disputes in Egypt .	-3.4827
The Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised a “ new Egypt , ” when he was sworn as the country ’ s first freely elected president , thereby causing the succession of Husni Mubarak , who had been driven out of office 16 months befor.	-10.8325
With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court , Morsi became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and Egypt ’ s fifth head of state since the fall of the monarchy about 60 years ago .	-2.9051
He placed the oath in front of the 18 black sealed judges of the court , who has his seat on the Nile and is found in an ancient Egyptian temple .	-5.5389
“ We strive for a better future , a new Egypt and a second republic , ” said Morsi at the solemn ceremony that was transferred live on state television .	-3.1656
“ Today , the Egyptian people have laid the foundations for a new life – absolute freedom , genuine democracy and stability , ” said Morsi , a US-trained engineer and member of the Muslim Brotherhood , a fundamentalist group that had been sharply targeted by the respective government since its foundation 84 years ago as a forbidden organization .	-4.1514
Hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building when Morsi arrived in a small car convoy shortly after eleven o 'clock local time .	-2.9731
Only a few hundred followers gathered to the court to cheer the new president , and unlike the presidential runk from the Mubarak era , traffic was only stopped shortly so that the Autokonvoi could cross the usually lively road that connects the city centre with the southern suburbs .	-5.2464
As an uncharismatic “ replacement wheel ” of the Brotherhood , his personal prestige has increased since his victory and a Friday speech , presenting himself not only as a candidate of Islamists , but all those who wanted to put the 2011 insurgency ’ s efforts against the authoritarian Mubarak into action .	-5.0240
“ Egypt is now a civil , national , constitutional and modern state , ” the Morsi dressed in a blue suit with red tie explained to the judges in the wooden chamber in which he placed office .	-4.5774
Later , Morsi drove to the University of Cairo , where he should make his inaugural speech .	-3.4180
He was officially welcomed by an army chapel that played the national anthem he listened to in his position .	-3.7328
The military leader Hussein Tantawi was present .	-1.6272

You thought that travel agencies belong to the past thanks to the Internet ?	-2.5936
Flight Centre seems to oppose the trend .	-1.6058
The company has increased its prospects for the whole year and expects record revenue from holidaymakers in Australia and the UK .	-3.4716
The travel company is now assuming an adjusted annual profit before taxes ranging from $ 325 to $ 340 million , compared to $ 305 to $ 315 million in its previous forecast .	-4.1878
When current target values are achieved , that means growth of 12 to 17 % compared to record gains of $ 290.4 million in 2011-12 .	-4.0401
As Managing Director Graham Turner announced , Flight Centre gained eight percent in the first half of the year and bought a strong start to the second half of the year , particularly in the Australian and British private business .	-3.7164
“ Since the beginning of the year , our ten countries have been profitable , and some of them are well on the way to record yearly revenues before interest and taxes , ” he explained .	-9.2042
These include Australia and the United Kingdom , which typically belong to our strongest results .	-3.0977
In Australia , the recreational industry has recovered in the second half of the year , balancing a slightly weaker market for business travel .	-3.1348
Similarly , Flight Centre ’ s recreational business in the United Kingdom ran similarly well , while business customers spent less .	-5.0085

In courses of English literature , students must treat at least one piece of Shakespeare , a novel of the 19th century , romantic lyrics and contemporary British novels from 1914 .	-3.2511
The test also contains “ unseen texts ” input to encourage broader reading .	-3.5322

The Ministry of Education will publish tomorrow the new curriculum for English and Mathematics – the first subjects that have been radically redesigned .	-10.0519
Other core subjects will be changed next year .	-1.5085
In a separate initiative , Ofqual , the supervisory authority for audits , will announce a reorganisation of the GCSE structures , including a new emergency system and less course work .	-11.0741
In a speech in the summer , education minister Michael Gove said that there is a “ broad consensus that we need to reform our audit system to restore public confidence , ” emphasising that the GCSEs would become “ challenging , ambitious , and stricter . ”	-3.8896
Studies show that English schools spend less time on mathematics – 116 hours per year or three hours per school year – than in most other countries .	-2.1849
On the other hand , Australian schools teach 143 hours per year and students in Singapore receive 138 hours .	-2.8952
Although there will be no formal requirement for more time in the timetable for mathematics , coalition circles mean that the comprehensive math test – combined with a stronger weighting of the expert in ranking lists – will probably encourage schools to take more hours .	-5.0864
The curriculum pays more attention to “ problems from the right life ” , including financial mathematics .	-2.5467

Referentin is professor Johanna Rahner .	-1.9153
The Ecumenical Conversation Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and evangelical church communities of Salem , Salem Castle and the Cultural Office of Lake Constance .	-3.6686
Johanna Rahner wants to investigate in the forum of how people classify the " last things " after death today .	-3.5709
If people had known too much over the past centuries , putting them on those pictures of heaven and hell that " still shape our ideas " , the contemporary prophetic teaching is characterised by the hopes of completion rather by a certain ambiguity or even languageability .	-6.4838
" The greater hope has been expulsed by religious critique by Christians , " says the speaker .	-3.0437
You have ' provided us with so many question marks that the exclamation marks seem to have lost us ' .	-3.9345
Johanna Rahner continues to say : " But the crucial challenge remains the annoyance of death " .	-2.7120
This concerns the question of longing for " that dreams that everything may be good at the end " .	-10.1122

Pascal Treubel was once again able to place himself on two places .	-9.8490
At the ladies it was Theresa Duelli from the team nightmare , which managed to the top of the winning staircase .	-4.5577
In place two and three came Anne Adel from Illmensee and Leonie drivers from Owingen .	-2.5225
A pleasant development is the increasing number of drivers living or working in the community .	-2.6620
Not only in terms of performance , the whole range of athletes was represented .	-2.9451
The age structure also ranged from ten years to more than 70 years at the oldest starters .	-3.6032
In the main race this year , even more topathletes were started .	-3.8311
Four drivers were able to depart from the regional top drivers .	-3.3504
Among them Philipp Pangerl , a mountain bike half professional from the Black-Tusk racing team .	-2.9459

Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical assistance to remote villages in Cameroon	-2.0997

You can vote for him or any of the other heroes in the Top 10 to choose “ CNN Hero of the Year ” .	-3.0312
The winner receives $ 250,000 to continue his exceptional work .	-1.9973
For 21 years , George ’ s Bwelle saw how his sick father lost consciousness and traveled to hospitals who did not have the means to help him .	-3.6390
Jamef Bwelle was injured in 1981 in a car accident near Yaoundé , the capital of Cameroon .	-2.2157
First , he had only a broken arm , but then an inflammation was formed that expanded to his brain and caused a haematom that would affect him for the rest of his life .	-4.1940
“ There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon , ” said Georges Bwelle .	-2.3202
We would have put it out of Cameroon if we had had the money .	-1.9885
Instead , Bwelle spent years accompanying his father in overcrowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment that they had to offer there . lilililililililililililililililili	-15.0507
" It is not easy , " comments Bwelle .	-7.5727
You can leave the house at five o 'clock in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first , and is not the first .	-3.3884
There are many patients .	-1.4034
Some people even die because they have to wait .	-1.5641
The situation has hardly changed since Bwelle ’ s father died in 2002 .	-2.0127
In Cameroon there is only one doctor for each 5,000 people , according to the World Health Organisation .	-11.1731
On the other hand , the relationship in the United States lies with a doctor for 413 people .	-2.7697
But even if there were a doctor for them , most Cameroonians could not afford to visit .	-3.1146
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and nearly three-quarters of health expenditure in the country are priv.	-3.0046
“ The only problem they have is poverty , ” says Bwelle .	-1.7330
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life .	-1.0221
His father and so many of his fellow countrymen suffered in Bwelle matured the decision to take action against this .	-12.6469
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer have carried out 700 free operations last year .	-2.2415
He was himself a doctor and worked as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé .	-2.6222
Furthermore , he founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME , which travels to rural areas at weekends and offers free medical . , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-12.2004
Since 2008 , he and his volunteer group have helped almost 32,000 people .	-2.0158
Almost every Friday he and up to 30 people forced themselves into small buses and drive with the covered medical equipment on the roof over unfortified terrain in the villages that need help .	-5.0867
Not always everything goes smoothly .	-2.0142
They had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud more than once .	-2.6174
But when they arrive , they will receive like heroes : a feast , singing and dance and the best accommodation that the place has to offer .	-3.6117
In these villages , free medical care is really a reason for celebrating and bringing – with its wide smile and its limitless energy – is happy to join the cheerful celebration . !!! ... !!!!!!!!!!!	-10.4631
The next morning the team starts investigating hundreds of patients .	-10.1822
“ We treat 500 people per trip , ” says Bwelle .	-2.8964
They come from a radius of 60 kilometres around the village – and on foot .	-3.6079
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas .	-2.0900
Many people are treated for malaria , tuberculosis , malnutrition , diabetes , parasites and sexually communicable diseases .	-1.6822
Others receive crutches , donated glasses , or free birth certificates – a document needed for school , but many poor families simply cannot afford .	-3.5143
In the evening , the team performs simple operations with local anesthetic .	-2.8013
The operations typically take place in a school , town hall or apartment ; after the intervention the patients stand up and go into the recreation area to make room for the next .	-4.5667
The lighting for the OP and the disinfection equipment is fed by the generator of the group , thus working shaft and its volunteers until the early hours of the morning on Sunday .	-4.2256
It is an exhausting pensum , but the village musicians usually help keep the team motivated .	-2.6354
“ They drum all night so that we can stay awake and continue our work , ” says Bwelle .	-3.0172
On Sunday the team drives back to the city , tired but proud of the work that has been done .	-3.4080
The group – a mixture of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students – carried out 700 free operations last year and knows that , with its work , it creates a huge difference for the people to whom it helps .	-3.7885
A man explained that the free operation of a crash he received now allows him to work again .	-3.2996
“ This changes the future of my family , ” the man said .	-2.2890
Besides the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital , Bwelle also works at night in private clinics in Yaoundé .	-10.2305
With this second job , he finances 60 % of his non-profit activity , says Bwelle ; the rest come from private donations .	-2.9752
“ I really do not know when he sleeps , ” says Katie O 'Malley , who studied at Drexel University in Philadelphia Medicine in the second year and volunteers in Bwelle ’ s Group .	-3.3473
He is always in the hospital or tries to raise money for the organization so that he can go to these campaigns .	-3.8258
For medical and health care students like O 'Malley , who come from the US and Europe and support the threshold , this is an opportunity to gain practical experience that they would never get at home .	-3.8346
“ We can be there for operations where we help to tap blood or keep the instruments for Dr Bwelle , ” explains O 'Malley .	-5.0365
This would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year .	-1.9761
Students usually pay their journey to Cameroon themselves and bring frequently donated sanitary material .	-3.2962
However , once they are in Yaoundé , Bwelle takes over the accommodation , transport and instructions .	-3.5674
" He is undoubtedly a hero , " says O 'Malley .	-2.3142
He devotes his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroonian people knows no borders .	-10.7755
The almost continuous work is not a burden on Bwelle .	-4.2666
He is very pleased to help others to live a happier life and thus to fulfil a promise he has made to his father .	-5.0542
“ I am so happy when I do this work , ” says Bwelle .	-2.4073
And I think of my father .	-1.3192
I hope he sees what I do .	-0.9734
I do it to make people laugh again and to relieve pain .	-2.9208

Fighting Excellently	-2.3769
The role of Santiago , the old man in Hemingways Novelle " The Old Man and the Sea " , is cut to the body Horst Janson .	-3.2283
Janson himself is an old hand in his metier , the acting art .	-10.4806
No one can delude the old man of Santiago when fishing .	-3.1466
That is how the two simply complement themselves great .	-3.8146
It is almost important to see the wrinkles in the neck of the old man , of which the fishermen ’ s young Manolo speaks .	-4.6805
If Santiago is tired of life bent on the chair , that is real with Janson .	-3.5577
In addition , the role of the old fisherman is through and through a character role that Janson masters excellently .	-3.9210
Hemingway told the story of a fighter , a courageous man who does not give up and ultimately wins the fight against fish through his knowledge and also his strength of lili. lilililililililililili	-9.0165
Janson is on stage in much distance as a single-actoleratoline lilililililililililililili	-11.8364
He manages to focus the audience ’ s attention on himself , so his monologists are not boring at any .	-4.9053
His efforts to finally pull the fish to the surface of the water are so genuine that the viewers forget that the sea consists of only blue-lit water bottles .	-3.8787
Director Jens Hasselmann lets the old man act in front of the fishing village .	-2.5890
In the course of the performance he puts the active scene into light : the hut of Santiago , the bar of the singer Marie-Luise favor , which sings with her songs and her magnificent voice the feeling of life of Cuba .	-4.7658
The four musicians play Cuba ’ s rhythm and are also guests of the bar .	-2.4920
Tourism : Departure to the Romans	-1.5195
A wastewater channel from the Roman period is preserved at about 120 metres length below Cologne .	-4.3149
Whoever visits Cologne doesn 't pass by the Duomo .	-9.1886
Around 157 meters , the two towers put into the sky and make it the second highest church building in Europe .	-3.7713
But only a few visitors who admire the two filigree church towers suggest there is a lot to discover under the cathedral .	-4.6593
Rainer Schulze is an expert in Cologne Underworld .	-13.1150
Meeting point for its guided tours is the service centre of Cologne tourism directly at the Duomo .	-3.5260
The tour starts quite unspectacular : " We start in the underground garage " , says Schulze .	-9.2209
In the 1970s , the city fathers wanted a car-friendly city , and therefore the remains of the old city wall remained only what was not too big .	-5.0607
Most users of the car park are therefore passing by the Roman remains today and only park their car .	-16.3730
But if you look closely , the Parkdeck D2 discovers an archaeological site separated by metal grid bars .	-4.8101
About five meters high ruins of hand-sized stones can be seen .	-4.1391
" They are remains of the Roman wall built in the second half of the first century after Christ , " says Schulze .	-2.8848
Before going back to daylight , Schulze lets the participants at the upper park level look at a dark , 15 metres deep box .	-4.9865
This is the fountain of the old cathedral , which unfortunately is hardly perceived .	-3.2439
The next stop of the tour is the pretorium , and here the participants rise down to the depth .	-17.6187
Here we see the headquarters of the once powerful man north of the Alps , the pretor of the CCAA .	-11.6482
What CCAA means is a visitor .	-1.8047
" The abbreviation stands for " Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium " , which in good German means " city Roman law and city of the Agrippines , founded under Emperor Claudius at the place of the Altar for the Emperor cult " .	-4.1040
And the pretorium is the former Statthalterpalace , the centre of power of the Roman empire on the Rhine .	-3.3925
From the beginning of the exhibition there is a tunnel access to the Roman wastewater channel , which is preserved at about 120 metres long .	-4.6907
" You can walk along a piece along the so-called Cloaca Maxima if you want , " Schulze enchants guests .	-3.8454
Schulze still has a surprise .	-1.5161
After bringing the key at the checkout , it leads the group to a 16-metre deep walkable shaft .	-4.3389
" We are now in the Mikwe , a ritual Jewish bath , " he explains .	-1.9139
The Jewish community built its bath deep into the ground to come to the groundwater that was essential for ritual washing .	-3.5204
To date , the lower end of the mikwe , whose origins date back to the eighth century , different levels of water can be read through changing levels of the Rhine .	-12.6450
The Mikwe becomes part of an archaeological zone on the town hall square , for which the construction work will soon begin .	-4.1678

Apparently , a persecution hunt with several cars was preceded .	-3.6692
According to charges , it was about fighting for spots and a demonstration of power .	-4.3667
The two defendants had been released in a first procedure in early 2012 .	-2.8356
A court spokesman said at the time that men were actually involved in the bloody feud .	-3.2890

Yesterday , Obama relativized his original promise .	-1.6114
“ The vast majority of citizens who have functioning health insurance can keep them , ” he said in a speech in Boston .	-2.5943
In response to the numerous media reports on terminations , Obama called on those Americans who received such communications to look around the free market for a new insurance .	-3.4177
Most citizens could thus receive better , more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or cheaper than predicted . lili, , lit, litt, , little , and lilitlilitlililili	-13.8611

“ I would like to say to these Americans very directly : you deserve better , ” said Sebelius at a hearing before the House of Representatives ’ Committee on Energy and Trade in Washington .	-3.1468

John Kerry says in an unprecedented admission that the US spying was “ inappropriate to go too far ”. , , , , , , ,	-9.7078
John Kerry , with an unexpected admission , suggested a softening of the US ’ s defensive attitude to its surveillance programs by saying that spying had “ gone too far in certain cases . ”	-4.6022
The Foreign Minister also admitted that he deceived , together with Barack Obama , the responsibility for turning on “ autopilot ” when the explosive revelations of the whistleblower Edward Snowden became public about the NSA ’ s spy activities .	-4.1453
By leaked information , the US government has fallen into a diplomatic storm of indignation by its allies .	-3.0898
At a video-connected speech at the Open Government Conference in London , Kerry said : “ Without question , the President and I , as well as others in the government , have learned about some things that have expired virtually by autopilot , simply because the ability to do what is still down to World War II and the difficult years of the Cold War and , of course , to 11 September . ”	-5.7781
Subsequently , he became the first high-level member of the US administration to acknowledge that US spying has exceeded a border , but also emphasised that no rights have been abused .	-4.5147
He said : “ In some cases , this has gone too far . ”	-2.7215
The President is determined to clarify and is therefore carrying out a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel abusive .	-3.9814
I assure you that the rights of innocent people will not be affected in this process .	-2.0650
Kerry insisted , however , that the NSA was a force of good , and that many lives were saved by their surveillance processes .	-3.7605
He added : “ We are dealing with a new world in which people are prepared to blow themselves into the air . ”	-2.5797

Meanwhile , US legislators will travel to Europe to dispel concerns about American spying and persuade Europeans of the need to continue working with the US in anti-terrorism efforts , as the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs declared on Thursday .	-3.9708
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said that he spoke to representatives of the European Parliament and other people this week and is concerned about their threats not to participate in anti-terrorist organisations because of the frustration of National Security Agency 's monitoring .	-3.9829
“ It is very important for the US national security interests that Europeans remain on board in terms of our joint efforts to combat terrorism , ” said Murphy , who is a democrat in the Senate for the first time and is Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Relations and European Affairs , in an interview in Washington .	-3.9832
I also go to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism , regardless of their anger over the NSA programmes .	-3.2413
Media reports that the NSA has collected millions of telephone data in Europe have burdened relations with some US allies , although the head of the secret service this week stated that the reports were incorrect and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and exchanged with the United States .	-4.0651
Other revelations quoted from documents passed by Snowden that the NSA monitored the mobile phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of state worldwide .	-3.3182
The head of the national intelligence services , James Clapper , defended the spying of allies as necessary and declared that this is common on on both sides .	-3.5264
In all the tumult , Murphy said that his authority prepared the journey of the Congress to take place this year , and hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and chambers .	-3.5792
The names of the other participating Members will be published in the coming days .	-2.4660
He said that the exact route is still being developed .	-2.9018
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of travelling is to improve relations , he also said that there would be some “ serious words . ”	-3.0415
He said that European governments should be honest with their people about the kind of spy programmes they have been using for years .	-3.2563
“ While we can change our monitoring programmes and thus protect Europeans ’ rights better , they must also accept the fact that we are not the only ones who spy , ” says Murphy .	-3.6281

Australia is appealing against prison sentences in Thailand	-2.8686
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney , who was sentenced to 15 days prison in Phuket because she mistakenly claimed to have been raped by a taxi driver , has appealed against the judgment and was released on deposit .	-10.8858
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty of a provincial court in Phuket on June 15 , after indicating to the Thai police that a local taxi driver had raped them in the morning on Sunday , June 10 , while two other men held them .	-4.3978
Later , however , the recordings of a video camera showed that they had reached their hotel safely after having been separated from their Australian friend .	-3.7965
The police in Phuket interrogated Bamford for two days until she confessed herself with histin .	-14.1529
Until the court negotiations it was in police custody .	-10.1513
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a low-security detention centre on the edge of Phuket , rather than in a prison for adult women .	-3.4489
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks , a former player of the Australian Rubgy League who turned to the Foreign Ministry in Canberra with the request for help for his daughter .	-3.1677
Tunks explained to Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was “ extremely concerned ” about the well-being of his daughter and wanted to have them back in Australia .	-2.9505
“ We are , of course , very concerned , but we hope that it will be back home as soon as possible , ” said Tunks .	-3.2714
Bamford has appealed against the judgment and is open to a deposit of 50,000 Baht .	-2.4999
In Australian reports it has been read that it is holiday in the meantime in the resort of Krabi in South Thailand .	-4.4355
The court had to hear that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and was warned that the appeal could also lead to a higher penalty of up to two years in a prison for adults .	-3.8067
However , it is also possible that , following the recent assassination of Michelle Smith in Phuket , Thailand could endeavour to improve its attacked tourist image and therefore achieve an achievement .	-5.3553
