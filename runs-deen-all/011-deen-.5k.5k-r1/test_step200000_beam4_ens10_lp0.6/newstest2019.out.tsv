Welsh representatives worry about " how to look like deödel "	-4.6014
There is dismay among some members of the Assembly on a proposal to change their title to MWPs ( Member of the Welsh Parliament ) .	-3.0608
The reason for this was plans to change the name of the National Assembly to the Welsh Parliament .	-2.2909
Members of all parties in the National Assembly have concerns that they could suspend themselves mockery .	-3.6426
A Labour MEP said that his group is ' riding with Twp and Pwp ' .	-3.2960
Note for the reader : “ twp ” in the Welsh means “ scared ” and “ pwp ” means “ cack ” .	-3.5182
A member of Plaid Cymru said that the group as a whole was ' not happy ' and proposed alternatives .	-2.4813
A Welsh conservative said that his group would be “ open ” to a name change , but pointed out that it is only a short verbal leap to “ muppet ” from “ MWP ” ( Member of the Welsh Parliament ) .	-3.5830
Note : The Welsh letter W is similar to the U in English .	-2.4186
The Commission of the National Assembly , which is currently working on a draft bill for name changes , said : ‘ The final decision on the naming of the members of the National Assembly is , of course , the members themselves ’ .	-8.5287
With the Government of Wales Act 2017 , the Welsh Parliament was given the opportunity to change its name .	-2.3979
In June last year , the Commission published the results of a public hearing on the proposals that broadly support the name change in the Welsh Parliament .	-3.7427
The Commission preferred Welsh members of parliament or WMPs on the question of the title of meetings , but the MWP option received most support in a public survey .	-4.8556
Members of the Welsh Parliament seem to propose alternative options , but the struggle to reach consensus could cause headache for the chairman , Elin JONES , who is expected to present a draft legislation for these amendments in the coming weeks .	-5.0357
The legislation on reforms will include changes in the way the Assembly operates , including the rules governing the disqualification of members of the Welsh Parliament and the design of the committee system .	-3.6563

The referendum will be held to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece , in which a province bears the name of Macedonia .	-10.1245
Athens has long insisted that the name of his northern neighbour is a claim to his territory and has repeatedly objected to his reception application for the EU and NATO .	-3.0971
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov , an opponent of the referendum on the name change , has said that he will ignore the vote .	-2.3109

The bells of St. Martin silent , because churches in Harlem have problems with children .	-3.3344
" Historically , the old people with whom I spoke said that there was a bar and a church at every corner , " said Mr Adams .	-3.2680
" Today there is neither nor . "	-2.6174
He said that the disappearance of pubs is understandable .	-1.5039
" People link comtacts in a different way , " he today said .	-2.6142
'Pubs are no longer living rooms in the neighbourhood where you meet regularly ' .	-3.3776
As far as churches are concerned , he fears that the money from the sale of assets will not exist as long as the leaders expect .	-2.9668
Churches could be replaced by multi-family houses with property flats filled with the type of people who will not help the remaining refuge sites in the district .	-3.6386
The overwhelming majority of people who buy ownership apartments in these buildings will be white , he said , " and will therefore speed up the day on which these churches are closed , because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into these property homes will become members of these churches . "	-5.0324
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis in 1870 – Metropolitan Community , St. Martin 's a decade later .	-2.2762
The original white methodological community extracted in the 1930s .	-2.7048
A black community that exercised a religion nearby acquired the building .	-3.7022
St. Martin 's was taken over by a black municipality under the pastor John Howard Johnson , who led a boycott of retailers in the 125th Street , a main road to shopping in Harlem , which opposed the attitude or promotion of blacks .	-4.5733
A fire in 1939 left the building seriously damaged , but when the municipal members of Father Johnson made plans for reconstruction , they commissioned the bell game .	-3.8556
Parish David Johnson , son of Father Johnson and successor to St. Martin 's , called the bell game proudly " the bells of the poor " .	-3.2987
The expert who played the bell game in July called it something else : " A cultural treasure " and " an irreplaceable historical instrument " .	-2.9129
The expert , Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan , also noted that it was the world ’ s first bell game played by a black musician , Dionisio A. Lind , who switched to the bigger bell game at the Riverside Church 18 years ago .	-3.5300
Mr Merriweather said that St. Martin 's did not replace him .	-1.4121
What has happened to St. Martin in recent months has been a complicated history of architects and construction contractors , some have been introduced by the church 's lay guides , others by the bishop 's diocese .	-4.8169
The sacristy – the management body of the parish composed of lay guides – wrote in July to the diocese with the concern that the diocese would " try to pass on the costs to the sacristy , " even though the sacristy was not involved in commissioning the architects and contractors of the diocese .	-5.0398
Some community members lamented a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese .	-2.6843

The boy was brought to Rady Children 's Hospital in San Diego , where his state was critically documented .	-2.3873
The shark responsible for the attack is unknown .	-1.5279
Rescue swimmer Captain Larry Giles said during a media discussion that a shark had been seen in the area a a few weeks earlier , but it was noted that it was not a dangerous shark .	-4.3000

Sainsbury plans to conquer the British Beauty Market	-1.6504
Sainsbury 's takes over boats , superdrug and debenhams with shelves with beauty products in department style occupied with specialist assistants .	-3.4040
Within the framework of an extensive push in the UK beauty market , which continues to grow and worth <unk> 2.8bn , fashion and homeware sales will fall back .	-3.9651
The idea of investing in the beauty market has emerged from the fact that supermarkets are looking for ways to use the shelves used earlier for television , microwaves and household goods for new products .	-3.7158
Sainsbury announced that the range of beauty products is doubled to 3000 products by including brands such as Revlon , Essie , Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw in the product portfolio for the first time .	-3.1113
Existing assortments of L 'Oreal , Maybelline and Burt 's Bees will also be given more space in brand areas , similar to those found in shops like boats .	-4.3761
The supermarket chain also revives its own makeup brand “ Boutique ” , which has numerous popular vegan products available to young buyers .	-3.6823
Furthermore , the perfume dealer Fragrance Shop tests concessions in two Sainsbury shops , the first week in Croydon , South London , while a second end of this year is opened in Selly Oak , Birmingham .	-15.1394
Online shopping and a shift towards daily shopping of small quantities of food in neighbourhood stores mean that supermarkets must do more to move people to visit .	-17.0208
Mike Coupe , the leader of Sainsbury 's , has said that the sales points will look increasingly like goods houses , since the supermarket chain tries to combat discounter like Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food .	-4.1674
Sainsbury 's placed Argos outlets in hundreds of shops and also introduced a number of habitats since it bought both chains two years ago , which allegedly strengthened food sales and made the acquisitions more profitable .	-9.2458
The previous attempt by the supermarket to revise its beauty and pharmacy departments ended with a failure .	-2.3786
Sainsbury tested a joint venture with boats in the early 2000s , but it ended unethical , and the revenue from the pharmacies could not be shared .	-3.6303
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury 's sold its 281 branch pharmacy business three years ago for 125 million pounds to Celesio , the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain .	-2.9331
According to information , Lloyds should also be involved .	-4.1490
Paul Mills-Hicks , Chairman of Sainsbury , said : “ We have changed the appearance of our shelves for beauty products to improve the equipment for our customers .	-3.0917
In addition , we have invested in the training of employees who are supposed to assist the customer .	-3.5673

Holly Willoughby angry Dragons ' Den-Star Peter Jones because she last minute withdrew from her common lucrative lifestyle brand to focus on her new own madness contract with Marks & Spencers and ITV .	-3.4335
Sources say that Jones was angry when the gold girl of television admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow , Buckinghamshire , that their new shops , worth up to 1.5 million pounds , meant that she had no longer had enough time to dedicate her homewear and accessory brand Truly .	-4.1774
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow ’ s brand Goop , and it was assumed that it would double Willoughby ’ s assets of estimated 11 million pounds .	-13.8889
When Willoughby , 37 , announced on Instagram that she would leave Truly , Jones left Britain and flew to one of his holiday houses .	-7.9390

It should be its long-term future and protect it for the next few decades . , , , , , , , , , ,	-8.6234
Their decision to withdraw was absolutely withdrawn from all parties involved .	-3.8584
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday – so short before the start .	-8.2440
" At Marlow HQ there is a storage hall full of goods that can be sold " .	-11.4204
Experts believe that the " This Morning " moderator , one of the most bankable stars in the UK , could cost the company millions because they have invested very strongly in products such as pillows , candles , clothing and homewear , and because of the potential for further delays in market launch .	-4.5037
And it could mean the end of a long friendship .	-1.5879
For ten years , Willoughby and his husband , Dan Baldwin , Jones and his wife Tara Capp have been close .	-2.1358
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones , 52 , in March .	-2.3705
The couples make together holidays and Jones has a 40-percent share of Baldwin 's TV production company .	-3.1401

Why did President Trump reach such many compromises ?	-2.0828
This said Trump in his mocked “ news spokesman . ”	-2.2727
“ I did not make compromises . ”	-2.1827
He noted that Kim is interested in a second meeting after her first meeting in Singapore in June was welcomed by Trump as a major step toward North Korea ’ s denuclearization .	-2.6887
But denuclearization negotiations are blocked .	-1.3541
More than three months after the Singapore Summit in June , Ri Yong Ho , North Korea ’ s leading diplomat , said to UN leaders .	-27.3576

Trump took a much more optimistic approach in his demonstration speech  . little litt. lilililililililililililililililili	-12.1550
“ We are making good progress with North Korea , ” he said .	-1.5880
“ We wanted to wage war with North Korea .	-1.3291
Millions of people would have been killed .	-0.9730
Now we have this great relationship . ”	-1.7952
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have brought positive results , such as ending missile tests , liberating hostages , and transferring the mortal remains of American soldiers home .	-2.9571
And he defended his unusual action when he spoke about relations with Kim .	-1.9939
" It is so easy to be presidential , but instead of having 10,000 outsiders trying to enter this fully packed arena , about 200 people would stand there , " Trump said and pointed to the quantity directly before him .	-4.4351
In Indonesia , a tsunami and an earthquake kill hundreds and devastate an island .	-1.4737
For example , after the Lombok earthquake , foreign non-governmental organisations were said that they would not be needed .	-11.2293
Although more than 10 % of the population of Lombok have been resettled , no national disaster has been declared , a precondition for catalyzing international aid .	-15.2257
Sumbung said : " Unfortunately , in many cases , they have made it very clear that they do not request international aid , so it is a small challenge " ,	-3.3866
While Save the Children compiles a team to travel to Palu , it is not yet sure whether foreign staff can work on site .	-3.0555
The spokesman of the National Civil Protection Agency , Mr Sutopo , said that Indonesian officials would evaluate the situation in Palu to see if international organisations can contribute to the aid measures .	-3.0029
Unfortunately , given the earthquakes that Indonesia constantly suffers , the country does not remain well prepared for natural forces .	-3.6129
While the tsunami protection spaces were built in Aceh , which is not usual for other coastlines .	-3.9565
The obvious lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu , although a warning was already in force , should have contributed to the loss of human life .	-2.8788
Even under favourable conditions , travelling between the many islands of Indonesia is difficult .	-2.2709
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated .	-1.1572
A Lazarett ship stationed for the treatment of the victims of the earthquake in Lombok is on the way to Palu , but it will take at least three days to arrive at the place of the new disaster .	-4.0909

Mr Joko is also under pressure from continuing religious tensions in Indonesia , where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith .	-2.3805
More than 1,000 people were killed , and tens of thousands were driven out of their homes when Christian and Muslim gangs were delivering street struggles with machetes , arrows and arcs , and other primitive weapons .	-8.3746

The Cromwell Parliament ’ s statue will be the recent success of the series “ Rewrite History ”	-3.9815
His exile would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many cultural and religious artifacts of England by his fanatical Puritans .	-2.6345
However , the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick ’ s proposal as “ folly ” and as a “ attempt to rewrite history . ”	-2.7224

Perhaps the wrong cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas last century .	-2.3954
Sir William Hamo Thornycroft 's great representation of Cromwell testifies to the opinion that was predominant in the 19th century and is still predominant in parts of history : that Cromwell is worth celebrating .	-4.2251
Mr Goldsmith said to the ‘ Sunday Telegraph ’ : ‘ Cromwell is considered by many , perhaps more in the late nineteenth century than today , as a defender of Parliament against the pressure from outside , in his case of course the monarchy .	-12.4691
Whether this is an absolutely correct representation is the subject of the continued historical debate .	-2.4764
This is certainly the case : the conflict in the mid-17th century has shaped the following development of our nation , and Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure that stands for a side of the gap .	-3.9261
His achievements as Lord Protector are worth remembering and celebrating . ”	-2.2967

He had so many heroes .	-0.7435
Captain Halkett provided an excellently organized defense , while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall kept all the time on traffic .	-3.8300
However , the rangers lacked ideas .	-2.4617
Sometimes they were under Gerrard , they fell far behind these standards .	-2.8577

Doubling Artificial Intelligence Spending	-1.9943
While China becomes more active for artificial intelligence , the US should double its research investment , says Kai-Fu Lee , Investor , and AI practitioner who has worked for Google , Microsoft , and Apple .	-2.6119
These demands arose after US government members have made announcements about KI , even though the US lacks a formal AI strategy .	-3.5315
Meanwhile , China presented its plan last year : by 2030 it wants to be number 1 in the field of AI innovation .	-3.2573
“ Doubling expenditure on AI research would be a good beginning , given that all other countries are far behind the US , and a breakthrough in AI research is about to come , ” said Lee .	-4.1647
Doubling funding could double the chances of achieving the next achievement in the field of artificial intelligence in the US , Lee CNBC said in an interview this week .	-3.1639
Lee , whose book “ AI Superpowers : China , Silicon Valley and the New World Order ( AI Superpowers : China , Silicon Valley , and the New World Order ) ” was released this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt , is CEO of Sinovation Ventures , a company that has invested in one of the most famous Chinese AI companies , Face + + .	-3.2054

Macedonia is voting in a referendum on whether to change the name of the country .	-2.5502
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether to change their name to ' Republic of North Macedonia ' , a step that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that blocked its accession offers for the European Union and NATO .	-3.5887
Greece , which has a province called Macedonia , insists that the name of its northern neighbour is a territorial claim to the Greek territory , and has vetoed the country 's entry into NATO and the EU .	-2.8999
The two governments concluded an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name , but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slav majority population of Macedonia .	-2.2971
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he will not vote in the referendum and , given a boycott campaign , there is doubt as to whether the result will create the 50 % hurdle , which is a prerequisite for the validity of the referendum .	-3.5012
The question on the ballot to the referendum was : ' Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with the adoption of the agreement with Greece ? '	-2.4593
Advocates of the name change , including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev , argue that it is worth the price of continuing to accept institutions such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia , one of the countries to emerge from the collapse of Yugoslavia .	-3.7134
“ I have come today to vote on the future of the country , it is a decision for young people in Macedonia to live freely under the umbrella of the European Union , because that means a life in greater security for all of us , ” said Olivera Georgijevska , 79 , in Skopje .	-3.8875

“ I voted for my children – our place is in Europe , ” said Gjose Tanevski , 62 , a voter in the capital Skopje .	-2.7941
Macedonia ’ s Prime Minister Zoran Zaev , his wife Zorica and his son , Dushko , voted in favour of the referendum in Macedonia on changing the name of the country that would pave him the way for accession to NATO and to the European Union in Strumica , Macedonia , on 30 September 2018 .	-3.2360
Before the Parliament in Skopje , Vladimir Kavardarkov , 54 , prepared a small stage and put chairs in front of the tents drawn up by those who will boycott the referendum .	-3.1457
" We are in favour of NATO and the EU , but we want to take part with the heads up , not through the service door , " said Kavadarkov .	-2.8628
“ We live in a poor country , but also we have our dignity .	-1.7803
If you do not want to accept us as Macedonia , we can turn to others , such as China and Russia , to join Euro-Asian integration . ”	-3.0909
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will bring much-needed investments to Macedonia , a country with an unemployment rate of more than 20 % .	-2.1120
“ I believe that a large majority will vote in favour , because more than 80 % of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO , ” said Zaev following his vote .	-3.0295
According to him , the result “ yes ” would be “ strengthening our future . ”	-2.8947
Last Monday , the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research published the results of a survey : between 30 and 43 % of voters would therefore participate in the vote – less than necessary .	-2.6215
Another survey carried out by Macedonia ’ s Telma TV found that 57 % of respondents will vote on Sunday .	-2.8127
Of those who wanted to participate , 70 % said they voted ' yes ' .	-3.6450
The referendum will only be accepted if the turnout is above 50 % .	-2.6516

Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling carried out Brighton ’ s defense at the Manchester City 2-0 victory on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester , England .	-2.6589
Aguero looked incredibly simple during the 65th minute .	-2.7320
At the beginning of the game sequence , the Argentine stormer received a passport in the middle field .	-3.1205
He tricked three defenders from Brighton to free himself .	-2.5928
Then Agüero saw himself surrounded by three green shires .	-6.9899
He handled a defender before he ran several players on the edge of the Brighton penalty space .	-14.2786
Then he made a pass to the left and gave off to Sterling .	-3.2461
The English stormer used his first contact to play back the ball to Aguero , who then shot with the right – past Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan to the right side of the gate .	-4.3873
“ Aguero has foot problems , ” said City manager Pep Guardiola to reporters .	-2.5167
" We talked about it ; he played 55.60 minutes .	-2.3492

It is intolerant of those who say what they think .	-1.0425
When momentum activists in my local party voted to criticise me , it was hardly a surprise .	-2.0815

Most of my time in the eight years as a local Labour MEP were the GC meetings on Friday evening .	-3.1250
Unfortunately , today it is not the tone of many meetings , and the promise of a more " friendly , softer " policy is long forgotten if it has ever begun .	-3.5869
It has become increasingly clear that different views in the Labour Party are not tolerated , and every opinion is assessed whether it is acceptable to party leadership .	-3.0889
This began shortly after Jeremy 's takeover , because the colleagues with whom I had previously thought I had a similar political attitude expected me to reverse and adopt positions with which I would never otherwise have agreed , whether in relation to national security or the EU internal market .	-5.0837
Whenever I speak publicly – and it does not matter what I say – a tirade of abuse in the social media , which calls for election , denounces the centre ’ s policy and tells me that I should not be in the Labour Party .	-4.0201

I really know that more luck than some of my colleagues , because the comments that address me tend to be political .	-3.7500
I appreciate the professionalism and determination of my colleagues , who are exposed every day to a flood of sexist or racist abuse , but never shy away .	-3.2361

Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance .	-1.5751
The reality is that we are no longer the broad church and , with any motion of censure or amendment of the selection rules , the party becomes smaller .	-3.1514
Over the last two years , I have received a lot of advice to collect my neck , not to be so vocal , and then I would be ‘ right ’ .	-4.6988
But for that reason I have not come into politics .	-2.8429
I joined Labour 32 years ago as a student , because of the neglect of the Thatcher Government , which led to my classroom being literally collapsed , so I tried to promote better public services for those who need them most , whether as a community council or minister .	-5.2453
I have never hidden my political views , not even at the last election .	-2.2358

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose : Ayr unbeaten at the top	-2.7310
Two late Tries may have distorted the final result , but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win in this wonderfully entertaining Tennent 's Premiership Match of the day .	-2.8424
They now lead the table as the only unbeaten of the ten teams .	-3.0895
In the end , it was due to the outstanding defence of the host , but also to the fact that opportunities were better used .	-20.9814

Robyn Christie von Melrose said : “ Thanks to Ayr , they have made better use of their opportunities . ”	-2.3152
Grant Anderson ’ s attempt at the 14th minute , transformed by Frazier Climo , brought Ayr forward , but a yellow card for Scotland ’ s captain Rory Hughes , who was given for the game of Warriors , allowed Melrose to speak numbers , and Jason Baggot to gather an untransformed attempt .	-4.1959
Climo stretched the leadership of Ayr with a penalty before he reached a mid-term hit and then made a solo attempt with which he entered the 17 : 5 break for Ayr .	-5.2357
But Melrose began the second half well and Patrick Anderson 's attempt , transformed by Baggot , reduced the residue to five points .	-3.3532

These hopes may have been at their peak for decades , because on 1 October Bolivia is waiting for a judgment by the International Court of Justice after five years of consultation .	-3.7915
" Bolivia has the dynamism , the spirit of unity and calmness and , of course , expects the result with a positive view , " said Roberto Calzadilla , a Bolivian diplomat .	-3.4273
Many Bolivians will pursue the judgment of the International Court of Justice on large screens throughout the country and hope that the tribunal in The Hague will find Bolivia ’ s preference to negotiate after decades of troubled talks in order to give Bolivia sovereign access to the sea .	-4.6103

“ We are about to regain access to the Pacific Ocean , ” he praised at the end of August .	-2.2701
However , some analysts consider it unlikely that the court will decide in favour of Bolivia , and believe that even a positive decision for Bolivia will not bring about change .	-3.5271
The Dutch UN institution has no power to award Chilean territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks .	-3.2034
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice has only come about six months after the hearing of the final arguments shows that the case was ' not complicated ' , said Paz Zárate , a Chilean expert on international law .	-3.9305

Soon it 's so far , and the fans can fire LeBron James at his first game for the Los Angeles Lakers .	-3.6817
Lakers-Trainer Luke Walton announced that James will play against Denver Nuggets in the opening game of the pre-season in San Diego .	-16.0681

Walton said on the official website of the Lakers : " It will be more than one and less than 48 " .	-2.3916
Lakers-Reporter Mike Trudell twittered that James will probably play limited minutes .	-9.2473
After the training at the beginning of this week James was asked for his plans for the six pre-season games of the Lakers .	-9.7839
“ I do not need pre-season games at this stage of my career to prepare me , ” he said .	-2.4661
Trump ’ s Rally in West Virginia , YouTube Channel	-1.1152
President Donald Trump begins tonight in Wheeling , West Virginia , with a flood of campaign events .	-2.1753
It is the first of five planned electoral events next week , and Trump also visits the Republican-friendly states of Tennessee and Mississippi on his tour .	-3.7254
While his Supreme Court candidate ’ s confirmation is still outstanding , Trump needs to mobilize his electorate for the forthcoming mid-term elections , otherwise it is feared that the Republicans will lose the majority in Congress when elected in November .	-12.0239
When is Trump ’ s West Virginia Rallye tonight and how can they be viewed online ?	-2.6815
Trump 's Rally in Wheeling , West Virginia , is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight , Saturday , September 29 , 2018 .	-2.7702
You can track Trump ’ s West Virginia Rally online via live stream on YouTube below .	-2.2725
Trump will certainly respond to the hearings this week concerning accusations of sexual abuse against his Supreme Court candidates , Brett Kavanaugh , whose confirmation was postponed by the Senate by at least one week until the FBI investigations were concluded .	-4.3583
The main objective of these electoral events , however , is to mobilize the Republicans , who are facing a crucial election in November .	-13.8899
According to Reuters , the goal of Trump ’ s campaign is to mobilize volunteers and supporters next week to defend and expand the majority of Republicans in the Senate and House of Representatives .	-2.5925
“ The majority in Congress is at the forefront of the president ’ s agenda , so he visits as many states as possible just before the turbulent campaign season starts , ” said a spokesman of the Trump campaign , who does not want to be named , Reuters .	-4.8739
According to the West Virginia MetroNews radio network , the election event held tonight at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract the attention of the Pittsburgh media .	-3.2977
On Saturday , Trump West Virgina , the state he won in 2016 with more than 40 percentage points , will be visiting this monlight .	-10.2352
Trump is trying to help the Republicans ’ candidate for the West Virginia Senate , Patrick Morrisey , lagging behind in polls .	-2.7809
According to Reuters , Simon Haeder , politician at the University of West Virginia , said that there is no good sign for Morrisey that the president must come to improve his poll values .	-3.1836
Ryder Cup 2018 : The USA team is ready to fight to maintain the hope of Sunday singles .	-3.4491
After three unilateral meetings , the four games on Saturday afternoon were probably exactly what the Ryder Cup needed .	-2.9339
The vibrant pendulum is a freely invented sports concept that players have internalised , especially in competitions like these .	-3.0489
So where would they say is the dynamic now ?	-2.8835
“ They had a six-point advantage and now there are four , so I think that is a little momentum , ” Jordan Spieth said when he withdrew for the day . ”	-4.6551
Europe is , of course , advantageous with 4 points , twelve more are still to be played .	-3.8159
However , the Americans , as Spieth says , feel somewhat wind in their sails and there was much encouraging for them , not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas , who played together all day and each have three out of four points .	-4.3564
Spieth was superior from the beginning and proceeded with a good example .	-3.4777
These cheerful cries became louder when his round passed , he sunk a decisive putt to reach a draw in game 4 after he and Thomas resigned after 2 games 2 points .	-5.3307
His joy of the putt on the 15th hole with which they won the game was so that one thought he still believed in the victory of the Americans .	-3.6174
" You really need to focus strongly and worry about your own game , " said Spieth .	-3.2237
This is everything that remains for each of these players .	-3.9252
18 holes to leave impression .	-1.4120
Over the last two days , Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood were the only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas .	-14.0820
Europe ’ s strange , but admirable couple plays mistakenly and simply does everything right .	-15.8739
" Moliwood " was the only couple who did not achieve a bogey on Saturday afternoon , but they also avoided them on Saturday morning , Friday afternoon and on Friday morning the rear nine .	-3.5183
This run and the way in which their energy seems to flow to and from this abandoned amount of spectators makes them the favorites on Sunday and when the sun goes down over Le Golf National , there would be no more popular player sealing a possible European victory than Fleetwood or Molinari .	-4.6979
Probably both at different holes at the same time .	-2.2424
To talk about a European victory would be too hasty .	-2.3097
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short processes with Sergio Garcia , who was victorious with his partner Alex Noren in the morning .	-2.5438
With a bogey and two doubles on the first nine of the Spaniards and the Swede digged into a hole from which they never came out again .	-3.8894
On Sunday , however , there is no one who helps you out of your hole .	-3.3322
Due to the interactions between the pairs , the given advice , the non-given advice and the way in which a strategy can change in the mouth , it is very fascinating to see the fourballs and foursomes nearby .	-4.9517
Europe has played better than a team so far and has taken a clear lead in the last day , but this Foursome session has also shown that the US team has the desire to fight , which some , especially Stateside , have doubted .	-5.0264
Europe Leads 10-6 on the Ryder Cup Final Day	-2.4320
Europe will take advantage of a solid advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after it emerged from the four- and four-playing games on Saturday with a 10-6 leadership over the United States .	-3.8323
The inspired Duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the group with two victories over a struggling Tiger Woods to bring its previous balance sheet to four points in the Le Golf National .	-3.1584
The European team of Thomas Bjorn , who came to keep the trophy she lost two years ago in Hazeltine , dominated an American team fighting with suspenders in the morning 's fourball , and won the series with 3-1 .	-4.8135
The US offered more resistance in the fours and won two games , but it could not digest the deficit .	-2.4324
The team of Jim Furyk needs eight points from the 12 individual games from Sunday to keep the trophy .	-2.5160
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row , while he and Molinari , called " Molliwood " after a sensational weekend , are just the second pair that wins four points from their first four games in the history of the Ryder Cup .	-8.7548
After shattering Woods and Patrick Reed in the Fourballs , it was considered certain that they would beat a sobered woods and the American Rookie Bryson Dechambeau through an even clearer 5 & 4 .	-4.4221
Woods , who towed through two games on Saturday , occasionally showed brilliant actions , but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in four balls and fours and seven in a row .	-4.3207
Justin Rose , rested for the morning Fourballs , returned to his partner Henrik Stenson to the Foursomes and beat in a 2 & 1 defeat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – place one and three in the world .	-3.0827
On a pleasant , airy day south-west of Paris , however , Europe had not had it in its own way .	-13.4345
The triple main winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the standard for the Americans on Saturday with two points .	-2.7042
They won a brave 2 : 1 victory against the Spaniard Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-pack and returned later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 : 3 in the four-pack after they lost the first two holes .	-3.4494
Only twice in the Ryder Cup story a team comes back from a four-point deficit to the singles , although Halter Furyk 's site only needs a draw to keep the trophy .	-3.7786
After two days of second best , however , a Sunday account looks as if it were going beyond it .	-3.5385
North Korea says that “ by no means ” there will be unilateral disarmament without trust .	-2.4234
North Korea ’ s Foreign Minister said to the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions would deepen its distrust of the United States , and that under no circumstances would the country abandon its nuclear weapons unilaterally .	-3.4675
Ri Yong Ho said to the World Body Annual General Assembly that last year North Korea took " significant goodwill measures " , such as the recruitment of nuclear and missile tests , the reduction of the nuclear test site and the commitment not to proliferate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology .	-4.4413
" There is no response from the United States , " he said .	-2.8688
“ Without any confidence in the US , there will be no confidence in our national security , and in such circumstances there is no way that we will first disarm ourselves unilaterally . ”	-3.5323
While Ri resumed the well-known North Korean complaints about Washington ’ s opposition to a “ gradual ” approach to denuclearization , in which North Korea would be rewarded with gradual steps , his declaration seemed significant in that it did not completely reject unilateral denuclearization , as Pyongyang did in the past .	-4.1491
Ri referred to a joint declaration by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a first summit between an incumbent US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June , when Kim committed to working towards " denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula " , while Trump promised guarantees of North Korea ’ s security .	-3.2917
North Korea sought a formal end to the Korean War in 1950-53 , but the United States said that Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons .	-2.6634
Washington has also resisted the demands for easing the tough international sanctions against North Korea .	-2.7220
The US insists on " denuclearization-first " ( first denuclearization ) and increases pressure by sanctions to mandatory its purpose , and even reject the " statement of the end of the war " , said Ri .	-4.0154
" The perception that sanctions can force us into our knees is a dream of people who are ignorant to us .	-2.8094
But the problem is that continued sanctions exacerbate our distrust . ”	-2.1493
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump , which US President had stressed at the United Nations earlier this week .	-3.0140
Instead , the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader , Moon Jae-in , over the last five months , and added : ' If the party were to denuclearize South Korea and not the United States , the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not end up in such a deadlock ' .	-4.7887
Nevertheless , the tone of Ri ’ s speech was dramatically different from last year when he reported it to the U.N. The General Assembly , which targeted the US mainland with North Korea ’ s missiles , was inevitable after “ Mr. Evil President ” Trump Kim called “ rocket man ” on a suicide mission .	-4.4524
This year at the United Nations , Trump , who threatened last year to “ destroy ” North Korea , praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm , but he also said that much work had to be done , and sanctions must remain until North Korea destroyed denuclearization .	-3.3083
On Wednesday , Trump said that he did not have a timeframe for this and said : ' It does not matter whether it takes two years , three years or five months ' .	-3.3514
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken .	-1.5726
However , in the United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo , the UN Security Council said on Thursday that ' enforcement of the Security Council sanctions must be energetically and without continued defects until we achieve full , final and verified denuclearization ' .	-4.6914
Since 2006 , the Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea to prevent the funding of Pyongyang ’ s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes .	-2.3879
Pompeo met Ri on the edge of the UN General Assembly and subsequently said that he will travel back to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit .	-3.1688
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year , but his last journey did not go well .	-2.5065
He left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made , and only a few hours after that , North Korea condemned him “ similar demands . ”	-4.3178
At a meeting with Moon this month , North Korea promised to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex when the United States takes ' appropriate measures ' .	-3.3098
He said that Kim told him that the ' appropriate measures ' he wanted were security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore , and steps to normalize relations with Washington .	-3.2523
Harvard students participate in the course to find enough calm .	-2.7176
With a new course this year at Harvard University , all students will get more sleep to fight against the growing macho culture of studying the caffe-crowded “ crowded nights ” .	-12.6666
A scientist has found that students at a worldwide leading university are often unsuspected when it comes to helping themselves , even though it is a matter of very simple mechanisms liklimit.	-10.6240
Charles Czeisler , Professor of Sleep Medicine at the Harvard Medical School and Specialist at Brigham and Women 's Hospital , designed the course that he believes is the first of his kind in the USA .	-3.7440
He was inspired to start the course after he had given a talk about the effects of sleep shortage on learning .	-12.2832
At the end , a girl came to me and said : " Why is that only now , in my final year , told me ?	-3.5015
She said that he never told anyone about the importance of sleep – which surprised me , " he said to the telegraph .	-3.6157
The course offered for the first time this year explains to students how good sleeping habits promote academic and sporting performance and improve their general well-being .	-3.4780
Paul Barreira , Professor of Psychiatry at the Harvard Medical School and Managing Director of the University Health Service , said that the university decided to introduce the course after it found that students would have slept extremely little during the week .	-3.6361
The 1-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks .	-1.8581
In a section there is an image of a sleeping room where students click on coffee cups , curtains , trainers and books to be informed about the effects of caffeine and light and how sporting performance affects itself by lack of sleep and the importance of a sleeping time routine .	-4.4975
Another section explains how long-term sleep removal can increase the risk of heart attack , stroke , depression and cancer .	-3.0768
A map of the campus with interactive symbols encourages participants to think about their everyday lives .	-2.3089
We know that it will not change the behaviour of students immediately .	-1.9661
" But we believe that they have a right to do so - just as you have a right to know the health impact of the decision to smoke cigarettes , " added Prof. Czeisler .	-2.9081
The culture of pride still exists , he said and added that modern technology and increasing pressure on pupils and students sleep withdrawal makes a growing problem .	-3.8824
Having sufficient sleep of good quality should be the " secret weapon " of a student to combat stress , exhaustion and fear , he said - not even to increase because sleep train puts the brain in hunger mode and makes it constantly hungry .	-4.8391
Raymond So , a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology , helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes in Harvard last year .	-2.8591
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to push for a campus wide course .	-2.4588
The next step , he hopes , is to ask all docotorands to complete a similar study programme before entering the competition university .	-3.3906
Prof. Czeisler recommended that students set an alarm when to go into the bed and when to wake up , and be aware of the harmful effects of the " blue light " broadcast by electronic screens and LED lighting , which can bring their circadian rhythm out of the clock , causing problems in sleeping .	-5.4709
Livingston 1-0 Rangers : Mengas Goal Earths Gerrards Men	-7.8376
Further foreign problems of the Rangers : After a hit by Dolly Menga , Livingston came to a 1-to-0 defeat for the different team of Steven Gerrard .	-4.4112
The Ibrox team wanted to record their first victory since the 4 : 1 triumph in February in St. Johnstone , but Gerrard ’ s second defeat in 18 games as a trainer left his team by eight points behind the disappointed Ladbroke ’ s Premiership Chef Hearts .	-4.6415
Menga landed a hit seven minutes before the mid-term and an inspirational rangers list did not look like they could balance .	-3.7888
While the rangers are now falling back to the sixth place , Livingston climbs to three and lies only because of the toll difference behind Hibernian .	-4.3936
New difficulties for the rangers are emerging , because a headwound had to be supplied to line judge Calum Spence after hit by a litter – apparently thrown out of the foreign fans sector .	-5.4123
Gerrard made eight changes to the side that passed Ayr and swept directly into the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup .	-12.2715
Holt , on the other hand , set up the same Livi-Elf , which decreased the Hearts last week , and he should have been enthusiastic about how his well-trained team did not leave opponents room for action at any time .	-5.1542
The rangers dominated the ball property , but Livingston implemented opportunities better .	-3.9098
They should have met after only two minutes when Mengas first removed Scott Pittman to Allan McGregors Tor , but the middle field player passed his great change on the gate .	-4.5711
A deep Keaghan Jacobs freeze then went to Captain Craig Halkett , but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only shoot far behind posts .	-4.1748
Rangers took control , but there seemed to be more hope than confidence in their own game , in the last third .	-2.8384
After the first quarter of an hour , Alfredo Morelos clearly believed that he deserved an elfmeter after he and Steven Lawless conflicted , but arbitrator Steven Thomson did not refer to the appeals of the Colombian .	-4.9007
The rangers only reach two shots in the first half , but the former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was hardly able to leave Lassana Coulibaly ’ s head jump and hit an unprecedented Ovie Ejaria .	-5.4365
Although Livi ’ s opening hit may have been opposed to the game in the 34th minute , no one can deny that they deserve it for their efforts alone .	-3.9539
Again , the rangers failed to master a Jacobs standard situation .	-2.4104
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher Scott Robinson played the ball that kept peace and picked Menga for a simple finish .	-3.4194
Gerrard acted during the break when he exchanged Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the change immediately affected the game when the wing player played to Morelos , but the impressive Kelly ran from his line to block .	-3.7192
But Livingston continued to play the kind of game they like , with Lithgow and Halkett swept long balls after long balls .	-3.9533
Holts team could have expanded their leadership in the final phase , but McGregor stood up well to refuse Jacobs before Lithgow headed out of the corner .	-4.0088
The Rangers representative Glenn Middleton had another delayed claim to a penalty because he had devastated himself with Jacobs , but he once again saw Thomson looking away .	-4.3056
Almanach : The Inventor of the Virgin Counter	-1.6079
And now a page from our Almanach “ Sunday morning ” : September 30 , 1882 , which was more than 136 years ago ... The day on which the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm , called Hans , violin was born in Germany .	-3.3549
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity , an invention that eventually produced the device known as the violinist .	-3.7925
Since then , the violinist has also become a mainstay of science , as in the 1950s of the film " Bells of Coronado " , which apparently unlikely cowpoke scientist Roy Rogers and Dale Evans breathed :	-4.3668
Man : ' What about everything in the world is that ? '	-2.0057
Rogers : " It is a violinist used to find radioactive minerals like uranium .	-2.3847
When you set up these headphones , you can actually hear the effects of atoms released by radioactivity in minerals . ”	-3.1295
Evans : “ Tell me , but now it cracks huge ! ”	-3.7385
Hans Geiger died in 1945 , just a few days before his 63rd birthday .	-1.5995
But the invention that bears its name is still used .	-2.1471
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “ see ” malicious cells .	-1.6434
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to " see " and kill malicious cells .	-1.8791
Vaccine teaches the immune system to identify malicious cells as part of the treatment	-6.7267
The procedure includes the extraction of immune cells from a patient , changing them in the laboratory	-2.7808
You can then see a protein that is common to many types of cancer and then inject again .	-2.8002
A study vaccine shows promising results in patients with a number of cancer types .	-2.4334
A woman treated with the vaccine teaching the immune system to recognize rogue cells saw their ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months .	-2.6671
The method is to extract immune cells from a patient , to change them in the laboratory , so that a protein called HER2 becomes “ visible ” that occurs in many types of cancer , and then to reinject the cells .	-3.3557
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda , Maryland , said : ' Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine ' .	-2.0241
HER2 “ promotes the growth of various types of cancer , ” including breast , ovarian , lung and intestinal cancer , Prof. Berzofsky declared .	-3.5265
A similar approach to taking patients from immune cells and teaching them how to attack cancer cells has worked in treating a kind of leukaemia .	-2.6734
After his appearance at Saturday Night Live , Kanye West , dressed with MAGA cap , left a pro-Trump tirade from the stack .	-3.5449
Not Good	-3.0634
Kanye West was born in the studio during a Saturday Night Live broadcast after an excessive speech in which he praised the US . President Donald Trump said he would come in 2020 .	-4.2370
Having listed his third song of the night , called Ghost Town , while he carried a make America Great cap , he took over the Democrats and reaffirmed his support for Trump .	-4.6958
" As often as I speak with a white person and she says , “ How can you like Trump , he is a racist ? ”	-3.1162
Well , if I were concerned about racism , I would have extracted from America a long time ago , " he said .	-2.9112
The Saturday Night Live Show began with a sketch in which Hollywood Star Matt Damon made fun about Brett Kavanaugh ’ s statement before the Senate Justice Committee on Christine Blasey Fords accusations that Kavanaugh needed them sexually .	-4.3239
Although it was not broadcast , Western film material was shared by the comedian Chris Rock in the social media .	-3.5425
It is unclear whether Rock tried to mock West with the post .	-2.6492
West , too , had complained to the audience that he had had difficulty behind the stage because of his head cover .	-4.1208
" They harassed me behind the stage .	-1.1197
You said : ' Do not go out with the hat there ' .	-3.1295
You annoyed me !	-1.8790
And then they say that I am in a given place , " he said , according to the Washington examiner .	-2.0823
West continued : " Want to see the sunken place ? " and said that he would " attract my superman cloak , because that means that you cannot tell me what to do , you want the world to move forward ?	-4.8368
Try it with love . ”	-0.9960
His comments were recorded at least twice by the audience with footballs , and the comedians of Saturday Night Live seemed to have moved , Variety reported and quoted a person in the words : “ The whole studio was dead quiet . ”	-4.9343
West was later used as a replacement for the singer Ariana Grande , whose former friend , the Rapper Mac Miller , had died a few days ago .	-2.8779
West wondered many with a performance of the song " I Love it " , as Perrier Bottle dressed .	-3.0207
West received support from the head of the conservative group TPUSA , Candace Turner , who twittered : " This is for one of the most courageous spirits : DANKE , THE THE MAFIA WIDERSETZT HAST . "	-3.7676
But Talkmaster Karen Hunter twittered that West is simply " what he is , and that is absolutely wonderful " .	-2.4793
“ But I will not reward anyone ( by bought his music or clothing or supporting his art ) , from which I believe he accepts and disseminates an ideology that is harmful to my community . ”	-3.6147

US MEP Maxine Waters rejected claims on Saturday that one of its employees should have published personal data from three Republican US senators on the Wikipedia pages of legislators .	-3.9342
The democrat based in Los Angeles is convinced that the claims of members of the ultra-left wing and websites have been launched . lilililililililililililililililili	-9.0887
“ Lies , lies , and even more reluctant lies , ” Waters informed Twitter in an opinion .	-3.3441
According to the information published , the private addresses and telephone numbers of the US Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina , as well as US senators Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch , both from Utah , were included .	-4.3428
The information was published online Thursday , posted by an unknown person on the capitol hill during a hearing of the Senate on the accusations of sexual misconduct against the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh .	-3.7013
The data of the three senators were published shortly after the survey of Kavanaugh .	-2.2350
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the posts was associated with Waters ' office and published the information of a Waters employee , Hill reports .	-3.9384
“ This unjustified accusation is completely wrong and an absolute lie , ” said Waters continu.	-9.4294
“ The employee among my employees – whose identity , personal information , personal data and security were affected as a result of these fraudulent and false claims – was in no way responsible for this information being leaked .	-3.6347
This unresolved claim is completely wrong and an absolute lie .	-3.0089
Water ’ s declaration quickly caused criticism online , including the former press secretary of the White House Ari Meat .	-12.0598
“ The denial of the matter is extremely annoying , ” wrote meat .	-2.6690
“ This suggests that she is unsuitable as a congress member .	-2.7476

Review of " Johnny English – You live only three times " – Badly occupied parody with Rowan Atkinson	-2.7032
It is tradition to search for indications in every new film with a British tendency for Brexit , which seems to be applicable to this revival of the Johnny English Comedy Spoof-Franchise , which began in 2003 with Johnny English and was launched in 2011 with " Johnny English Reborn " .	-4.9147
Is the ironic self-satire about the abyss of humanity the new possibility of exporting the nation ?	-2.8796
His name shows that he is a comic creation with a wide range designed for non-English-speaking cinema visitors .	-4.5001
He is , of course , the stupid secret agent , who , despite his bizarre demands on smoothie glamour , has received a little clouseau , a sprayer Mr. Bean and a clack from this guy , contributing a single note to the leitmolody of the fire brigades at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London .	-9.1990
It is also based on the traveller and international mysterious Atkinson , who once participated in the meanwhile forgotten Barclaycard TV ads , always leaving chaos .	-4.1833
There are one or two beautiful moments in this latest Johnny English comedy .	-1.6698
I loved Johnny English , who approaches a helicopter in a medieval armor and shortly beats the main rotor against his helmet .	-3.0215
Atkinson 's talent for body comedy is to be seen , but the humor feels quite weak and strange , especially as the " serious " film brands like 007 and mission impossible offer comedy as an ingredient confidently .	-3.9612
The humor feels as if he is directed at children rather than adults , and for me the crazy misfortunes of Johnny English are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson ’ s Mr. Bean silent films .	-3.9007
The everlasting premise is that Britain is in great difficulty .	-2.1845
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the highly secret British network of spies and revealed the identity of all British agents on the ground to the horror of the service agent – a regrettably small role for Kevin Eldon .	-3.2709
It is the last straw hall for a Prime Minister who is a pompous and contested personality and already suffers a complete meltdown of political unpopularity .	-4.3716
Their intelligence consultants inform them that , since each active spy has been compromised , they have to get someone out of retirement .	-4.3984
And that means that the great Johnny English himself , who is today employed as a school master in a noble establishment , but gives unsurpassed lessons about how to operate as an undercover agent : some nice gags here , while English offers a School of Rock Academy about spying .	-4.7700
English is returned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunified with his former , long-suffering Bough , again played by Ben Miller .	-3.5130
Bough is now a married man who meets a submarine commander , an overwhelming , burschikosis role in which Vicki Pepperdine does not completely apply .	-8.7292
So , the Batman and Robin of the Chaos at the Secret Service of her Majesty are back in action and meet at Olga Kurylenkos beautiful Femme Fatale Ophelia Bulletova .	-9.2273
Meanwhile , the Prime Minister is getting dangerously into the ban of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims to solve Britain ’ s computer problems : the dark Jason Volta , played by Jake Lacy .	-4.0187
English and Bough begin their odyssey of the colourful highjinks : As a waiter , they light a French Flash restaurant ; they create chaos by smuggling on board Volta ’ s luxury yacht ; and English triggers pure anarchy when he tries to get familiar with a Virtual Reality headset with the interior of Voltas Haus .	-12.9919
All the registers have certainly been drawn for this last sequence , but however loving and abandoned they are , the whole reminds of children 's television .	-5.5472
Quite moderate .	-1.7940
And as with the other Johnny English films , I could not fail to think : Can the British film industry Rowan Atkinson not give a role that really lives up to his talent ?	-3.9729
Labour disputes having developed a plan for Britain for a four-day week , for which five days are paid .	-2.9727
Jeremy Corbyn ’ s Labour Party is examining a radical plan where British work only four days a week , but are paid for five .	-3.0351
According to reports , the party wants corporate leaders to pass on the savings made by the Revolution of Artificial Intelligence ( AI ) to workers by releasing an additional day .	-3.6623
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend - but still bring the same money bac.	-10.6344
Sources said that the idea would " fit " with the party 's economic agenda and plans to tilt the country for the benefit of workers .	-2.9539
The Trade Union Congress has approved the conversion to a four-day week as a way for workers to use the changing economy .	-12.5271
A high-level source from the Labour Party said the Sunday Times : a review of policy is expected to be announced before the end of the year .	-2.8246
A four-day week objective is in line with the party 's approach to restoring the economic balance in favour of workers and the general industrial strategy of the party , but this objective will not be realised overnight .	-4.3975
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea , as the Green Party promised a four-day working week during its 2017 election campaign .	-2.4392
However , this advance is not currently supported by the entire Labour Party .	-3.0820
A Labour spokesman said : ' A four-day week is not a party politics and is not intended by the party ' .	-2.6645
Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to specify his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy .	-2.4952
Mr McDonnell said that he was determined to regain the power of ' faceless directors ' and ' profitmakers ' in supply companies .	-2.8333
The Shadow Chancellor ’ s plans also mean that the current shareholders of water companies may not recover their entire share , as a Labour government could carry out “ deductions ” due to supposed misbehavior .	-4.6957
He also confirmed the plans to invoke workers in management lines and to create inclusive ownership funds to distribute 10 % of the private sector ’ s equity capital to employees receiving annual dividends of up to 500 pounds .	-10.6356
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy speak in “ 60 minutes ” about whether the FBI investigations against Kavanaugh could change their opinion . lililililililili	-7.4165
As a result of an ongoing FBI investigation into accusations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh , the final vote on the appointment of the judge to the Supreme Court was postponed by at least one week , and the question is raised as to whether the FBI 's investigation results could cause Republican senators to abandon their support for Kavanaugh .	-5.0367
In an interview transmitted on Sunday , Scott Pelley , correspondent of “ 60 minutes ” , asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI ’ s investigation results could encourage them to change their opinion .	-3.9838
Kennedy appeared more open-minded than his colleague from South Carolina .	-1.5196
“ In any case , ” Kennedy said .	-1.8532
" I said at the beginning of the hearing that I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh .	-1.8792
I called him after that happened after this claim came out , I said : ' Have you done it ? '	-3.3048
He was determined , targeted , clear . '	-11.0762
However , Graham 's voice seemed to be cast in stone .	-2.7720
" I have an opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and it would need a bomb accusation , " he said .	-2.4735
“ Dr. Ford , I do not know what has happened , but I know that Brett has vehemently disputed the charge , ” Graham added a reference to Christine Blasey Ford .	-10.0607

" What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it ensured that poverty is reduced ? "	-1.8750
This Saturday the Global Citizen Festival takes place in New York , an annual music event with an impressive selection of stars and an equally impressive mission to end world poverty .	-2.7286
At this year ’ s seventh Global Citizen Festival , tens of thousands of people will flow together at the Great Lawn in Central Park to experience not only stars like Janet Jackson , Cardi B and Shawn Mendes , but also to draw attention to the true goal of the event : to end extreme poverty by 2030 .	-3.8621
The Global Citizen Festival , which took place in 2012 , is an expansion of the Global Poverty Project , an international interest group aimed at combating poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it .	-2.8529
In order to receive a free ticket for the event , concert visitors had a whole range of tasks or " actions " , such as volunteering , an e-mail to a leader in the world , a telephone call or another other meaningful way of increasing the target of poverty reduction and raising awareness of it .	-11.2440
But how successful has Global Citizen been with 12 remaining years to achieve its goal ?	-2.1444
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert , a real way to persuade people to demand a call for action , or simply another case of so-called " clicktivism " people who feel like signing an online petition or an online application or thus sending a tweet ?	-3.8651
Global Citizen says that since 2011 , it has recorded more than 19 million “ actions ” from its supporters who have pushed for a variety of different targets .	-3.5332
It says that these actions have motivated world leaders to make financial and political commitments worth more than $ 37 billion , which will affect the lives of more than $ 2.25 billion by 2030 .	-3.1986
At the beginning of 2018 , the Group introduced 390 bets and announcements from its actions , of which at least $ 10 billion has already been paid out or financed .	-3.7246
The group estimates that the resources allocated so far have had a direct influence on almost 649 million people around the world .	-13.8090
Among the most important commitments is The Power of Nutrition , a UK-based partnership of investors and executive organizations committed to “ helping children to develop their full potential . ” The organization has promised to help Rwanda with $ 35 million to end malnutrition in the country after Global Citizens received over 4,70line. lineline lilines lilililililililililililililililililililililili	-12.9424

The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions in the United Kingdom , which aimed at improving the nutrition of mothers and children , the government will achieve the financing of the Power of Nutrition project 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions .	-4.2147
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on their website , “ Why do you think that we can end extreme poverty ? ”	-2.5141
Global citizens responded : it will be a long and difficult way - sometimes we will fall and fail .	-2.4306

US could build a “ blockade ” through the Navy to hinder Russian energy exports – Interior Ministers	-3.1454
Washington can “ use its navy if necessary ” to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets , including in the Middle East , US Secretary of State Ryan Zinke is quoted by Washington Examiner .	-3.5033
Zinke led Russia ’ s commitment to Syria – especially in activities at the invitation of the legitimate government – to be a pretext for exploring new energy markets .	-3.0713
“ I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is more : they want to negotiate energy , just as they do in Eastern Europe , the southern part of Europe , ” he said .	-2.9631
And , according to the officials , there are means and ways to avoid this .	-3.4027
“ The United States has this ability to ensure with our navy that the sea routes are open and , if necessary , block to ensure that their energy does not come onto the market , ” he said .	-4.1438
Zinke spoke to the participants of an event of the Consumer Energy Alliance , a non-profit organization that calls itself the “ voice of energy consumers ” in the US .	-3.1167
He compared Washington ’ s approach to dealing with Russia and Iran and noted that they are actually the same .	-6.8458
" The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less to use and replace fuels , " he said , while referring to Russia as an " one-trick pony " with an economy dependent on fossil fuels .	-2.9807
The opinions come while the Trump administration was on the mission to boost the export of its liquid natural gas to Europe and replace Russia , the much cheaper option for European consumers .	-3.4350
Members of the Trump administration – including US President Donald Trump himself – are therefore trying to move Germany toward a stop to the “ inappropriate ” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project , which , according to Trump , would turn Berlin into “ prisoners . ”	-3.7734

U.S. President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to the paid insert of China Daily in the Des Moines Register - the state with the most sold newspaper of Iowa - after accusing China of interfering in the US congressional elections of 6 November , which China disputes .	-3.9181
US officials claim to Reuters that Trump ’ s charge of trying to interfere in US elections was a new phase in an escalating Washington campaign to put pressure on China .	-3.1104
While it is normal for foreign states to advertise in order to promote trade , Beijing and Washington are currently in an escalating trade war with several rounds of customs duties on imports . let us say that is what ? ?????????????	-12.1565
At an early stage of the trade war , China ’ s retaliation tariffs should hit US exporters like Iowa , where many supporters of Trump ’ s Republican Party live .	-2.9712
Terry Branstad , US ambassador to China , and former Iowa governor , a major exporter of agricultural products to China , said that Beijing has injured American workers , farmers , and businesses .	-2.9000
China , Branstad wrote in an opinion article in the Des Moines Register on Sunday , “ this mobbing now operates with emphasis by means of propaganda advertisements in our own free press .	-3.8421
“ By spreading propaganda as a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register , China ’ s government uses the valued American tradition of freedom of speech and press , ” Branstad wrote .	-9.9404

Republicans gray with the Kavanaugh debacle voters against the Midterm elections , Warn Analysts	-3.4070
Many of the top Republicans defended Board Kavanaugh , a nominee elected to the Supreme Court , even though he was accused of sexual attacks , and the analysts warn that they will see a counter-attack in the forthcoming elections , especially women .	-4.4150
The emotions were high , and most Republicans have already said that they want to vote for him .	-8.3520

Even before Ford ’ s public statement , in which she carried out her accusations of sexual violence against Supreme Court candidates , analysts noted that a backlash could follow if Republicans advanced candidacy .	-3.8896
“ This has become a confusing chaos for the GOP , ” said Michael Steele , former chairman of the Republican National Committee , early last week , according to NBC News .	-3.0431

The only priest of the Church of England , who received a Victoria cross during the First World War , was celebrated 100 years later in his home town .	-2.9630
The Colonel and Reverend Bernard Vann deserved the award on 29 September 1918 at the attack in Bellenglise and Lehaucourt .	-3.5254

A memorial stone was revealed by his two grandchildren on Saturday at a parade in Rushden , Northamtonshire .	-2.1721
One of his grandchildren , Michael Vann , said that it was “ incredibly symbolic ” that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after the heroic act of his grandfather .	-2.5809
According to London Gazette , Colonel Vann led his battalion in September 1918 over the channel of Saint-Quentin “ with very dense fog and under heavy fire through field protection and machine guns . ”	-4.4412
Later , he stormed to the shot line and led the line forward with the “ biggest gallantry ” before moving a field pistol one-hand and pushing the withdrawal three times .	-5.8219
Colonel Vann was killed by a German sharp shooter on October 4 , 1918 – just a month before the end of the war .	-2.9710

Desert Island Discs : Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality .	-1.7427
The Olympic diver Tom Daley says that he has grown up with the feeling of being inferior to all because of his sexuality - but that gave him the motivation to become a success .	-3.8141
The 24-year-old said that he had only become aware at secondary school that “ not everyone like me ” .	-3.1182
In the first issue of Desert Island Discs at Radio 4 presented by Lauren Laverne , he said that he spoke publicly about the rights of homosexuals to give other “ hope . ”	-3.0819
He also said that a victory in the Olympic Games would have become less important for him after the birth of his first child .	-2.5389
The regular presentator of the long-running show , Kristy Young , has released several months due to a disease .	-2.9185
Daley appeared in Laverne ’ s first program and said that he felt “ less worth ” than the others , because “ it was not accepted by society to stand on men and women . ”	-3.4299
He said : “ To date , these feelings of less value being and difference have given me the strength and strength I needed to be successful . ”	-12.8509
He wanted to prove that he was “ something , ” he said to not disappoint anyone when he leads from his sexual orientation .	-3.3677
The two-times bronze medal winner has become a top-class LGBT activist and used his appearance at this year 's Commonwealth Games in Australia to ask more countries to decriminalize homosexuality .	-3.5262
He said he had spoken out because he was lucky enough to live openly and without consequences , and because he wanted to give other " hope " .	-3.2615
The triple world champion said that he fell in love with a man , the US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black , whom he met in 2013 , which he was very surprised about .	-11.8061
Daley married the Oscar winner , 20 years older than he was last year , but the age difference was never a problem .	-3.2021
“ If you go through so much in so young years ” – he took part in the Olympic Games for the first time at the age of 14 , three years later his father died of cancer – whether he was difficult to find someone at the same age who experienced similar highs and depths .	-4.8106
The couple was parents of a son called Robert Ray Black-Daley in June , and Daley said that his " whole perspective " has changed .	-2.6973
“ Last year , everything revolved for me to win a gold medal , ” he said .	-2.9944
“ But you know what , there is more important than Olympic Gold .	-2.2402
My gold medal is Robbie . ”	-0.8282
His son carries the name of his father Robert , who died in 2011 only 40 years after a cancer diagnosis .	-2.7117
Daley said that his father did not accept that he would die , and one of the last things he asked was whether they had their tickets for London in 2012 - because he wanted to be in the first row .	-10.3498
“ I could not tell him : <unk> You will no longer experience sitting in the first row , Dad <unk> , ” he said .	-3.1414

The Weak Mickelson Sat on Ryder Cup Saturday at the Bank	-8.9490
American Phil Mickelson will set up a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game , but he needs to dramatically improve his form so that it does not become a sad milestone .	-3.4747
Mickelson , who played for the 12th time at the event that takes place every two years , was placed on the bank by Captain Jim Furyk for the Fourballs and Foursomes on Saturday .	-3.1304
Instead of being at the heart of what happened , as is often the case for the US , the fivefold Major winner divided his day between fire and exercise rounds on the golf course , hoping to overcome his depth .	-5.1252
The 48-year-old is never the most straightforward driver even at the peak of his career and is not suitable for the narrow Le Golf National Square , where the long Rough regularly punishes failures .	-3.9619
And as if the place alone were not enough challenge , Mickelson meets the British-Open Champion Francesco Molinari , who won all four matches this week together with Newling Tommy Fleetwood in the ninth match on Sunday .	-4.6618
If the Americans lag four points when the 12 individual games start and have a hot start , Mickelson ’ s match could be absolutely crucial .	-3.8588
Furyk expressed his trust in his husband , which remained to him otherwise .	-3.1423
" He fully understood the role he had today , gave me a clap on his back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow , " said Furyk .	-2.8494
" He has much confidence .	-1.9551
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has done so much for these teams in the past , and this week .	-2.0455
Probably I would not have thought he played two games .	-2.5832
I wanted to see more , but it has arisen and that is the way in which we think we have had to tackle it .	-6.0674
He wants to be out there , just like everyone else .	-2.2771
So far , Nick Faldo keeps the record about most played matches at the Ryder Cup , which Mickelson will break on Sunday .	-3.9121
This could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career , which has never matched the heights of his individual record .	-14.0008
Mickelson won 18 times , lost 20 times and played indecisively seven times , while Furyk said that his presence would have been invaluable for the team .	-3.4488
" He is funny , he is sarcastic , funny , he loves to entertain people , and he is a great guy he can have in the team room , " he explained .	-2.7681
I think the younger players had fun measuring with him this week , that was beautiful . ”	-3.8954
It offers much more than just the game . ”	-1.5642
The European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great advantage can soon disappear ag.	-3.4455
Thomas Bjorn , the European captain , knows from experience that a great advantage in the individual games of the last day can quickly become an uncomfortable ride at the Ryder Cup .	-3.8939
The Dane debuted in the game in Valderrama in 1997 , where a team trained by Seve Ballesteros had an advantage of five points towards the Americans , but only scarcely reached the target line and won with a thin advantage of 14 <unk> to 13 <unk> .	-5.1893
" You remember that you were in the leadership in Valderrama ; we had a great advantage in Brookline , where we lost .	-7.6658
History will show me and everyone in this team that it is not over yet .	-2.5225
You will be bored tomorrow .	-2.0204
Go out and do the right things .	-2.2330
It is only over when the points are displayed on the table .	-3.0011
Our goal is to win this cup and we focus on it .	-2.7766
I have always said that I firmly believe in the 12 players in our team , but we are dealing with a strong opponent , the best players in the world . ”	-2.4208
As his players played on a hard golf course , Björn added : " I would never be premature .	-10.5498
Tomorrow is also a day .	-1.9600
Tomorrow the personal appearances are coming , and that is another thing .	-3.1505
It is great to be outside with a partner if things are going well , but if you are out there alone , your own skills will be tested as a golf player .	-12.4206
This is the message you need to convey to the players : to get the best out of tomorrow .	-3.9383
Now you are passing on to your partner and he must make just as you do . ”	-4.3080
Unlike Björn , the opponent Jim Furyk will strive to cut his players individually better than they do as partners , except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas , who have brought three out of four points .	-4.3764
Furyk himself has already experienced such a sensational change at the end of the day , when he was part of the winner team in Brookline , now he belongs to the losers , after the European team carried out the “ Miracle of Medinah . ”	-12.9773
" I remember every damned word , " he said to the question of how Ben Crenshaw , the captain of 1999 , gathered his players on the way to the last day .	-3.4302
We have 12 important games tomorrow , but you want to get rid of it as soon as possible , as you saw in Brookline , Medinah .	-3.7140
For the first time , when a self-dynamic has developed , the great pressure on the middle matches exerts .	-4.4596
We have built our list accordingly and brought the guys out as we felt , you know we are trying to create something special tomorrow . ”	-4.0798
Thomas , together with Paul Casey , Justin Rose , Jon Rahm , Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter , should lead the other European at the top of the ranking list , the counter-attack against Rory McIlroy at the top .	-4.0861
I set up this group of guys in this order because I think it covers the whole path , " said Bjorn about his individual selection .	-2.9306
Repostponing the timetable for Germany ’ s New Warship	-3.0035
The latest frigate of the German navy should have been served in 2014 to replace warships coming into the years from the Cold War , with flawed systems and escalating costs , which will now take at least until next year .	-6.0661
The commissioning of the “ Rhineland-Palatinate ” , the guiding ship of the brand new frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class , has now been postponed to the first half of 2019 , according to the “ Die Zeit ” newspaper , appointing a military spokesman .	-8.9431
The navy should have operated the ships in 2014 , but serious problems after the first delivery burdened the ambitious project .	-3.4123
The four frigates ordered by the navy in 2007 by the Baden-Württemberg class will replace the older ships of the Bremen class .	-3.4830
It is assumed that they have a powerful cannon , a number of air defense and ship defense missiles , as well as some stealth technologies , such as reduced radar , infrared and acoustic signatures linked linked to .	-11.8937
Another important advantage is longer maintenance intervals : the latest frigates should be usable for up to two years without running the home port .	-3.5645
However , the state-of-the-art warships , which Germany is supposed to facilitate overseas power projection , will already be outdated by the constant delays when they are finally put into service , as the weekly newspaper “ The Time ” notes .	-5.3638
The unfortunate F125 frigate last year caused headlines when the German navy officially refused to operate the ship and returned it to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg .	-3.0243
This was the first time that the navy returned a ship to a ship builder after delivery .	-2.7978
There was little knowledge of the reasons for returning the ships ; German media mentioned a series of critical “ software and hardware defects ” that would make the warship useless in fighting operations .	-3.9736
Software defects were particularly important because the ships of the Baden-Württemberg class are served by an occupation of around 120 seafarers - only half of the crew on older frigates of the Bremen class e Bree .	-9.8626
It also turned out that the ship has a significant overweight , which would restrict performance and make future upgrades difficult for the navy .	-4.0053
It is believed that the 7,000 tonne “ Rhineland Palatinate ” is twice as difficult as ships of the same class used by the Germans in World War II .	-8.6997
In addition to faulty hardware , the price sign of the entire project - including the training of the crew - is also on the subject .	-4.3254
Instead of the originally estimated EUR 2.2 billion , the cost has now apparently reached the dizzying level of EUR 3.1 billion ( roughly $ 3.6 billion ) .	-3.5173
The problems with the latest frigates get a special meaning in the light of recent warnings that Germany ’ s maritime power is disappearing .	-3.9088
At the beginning of this year , Hans-Peter Bartels , Chairman of the Defence Committee of the German Parliament , admitted that the war fleet actually “ goes out of operational ships . ”	-3.4932
The official said that the problem had grown in avalanche over time , as old ships were excluded from service without replacement .	-4.9914
He complained that none of the Baden-Württemberg frigates were served by the navy .	-2.2741
The National Trust listens to the secret life of bats .	-2.2032
New research on a property in the Scottish Highlands try to find out how bats use the landscape for food search .	-3.2308
It hopes that new insights into the behaviour of unique flying mammals will be obtained , which can guide future measures to protect animals .	-4.5256
The study by scientists of the National Trust for Scotland will be followed by soprano pistrels and brown long and daubenton bats at the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross .	-4.2137
Special recording devices are placed at the main points of accommodation to track bats activities throughout the season .	-2.9803
NHS employees and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys with hand detectors .	-1.9274

The habitat card to be created and the corresponding report should give a detailed overview of the behaviour .	-3.4654
Rob Dewar , National Trust for Scotland ( NTS ) nature protection adviser , hopes to find out which areas of living space are most important for bats and how they are used by their species .	-9.0858
This information will help to identify the advantages of habitat management , how best to maintain meadows and how to preserve the forests for bats and other species associated with it .	-12.2945
There has been a significant decline in bats populations in Scotland and the United Kingdom as a whole over the last hundred years .	-3.3559
They are threatened by construction works that affect their sleeping places and the loss of habitat .	-3.2042
Even wind turbines and lighting can pose a risk , as well as fly-catcher strips and some chemical treatments of building materials .	-5.0929
Bats are not actually blind .	-1.9977
Adapted to their night hunting activities , the ears are more useful when looting than the eyes .	-3.5582
They use sophisticated echo-location technology to localize errors and obstacles in their flight path .	-3.1020
The NTS , which is responsible for supporting more than 270 historic buildings , 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country , takes the bats very seriously .	-2.8344
There are ten trained experts who perform regular surveys , inspect sleeping areas and sometimes carry out rescues .	-3.3889
The organization has even set up Scotland ’ s first and only dedicated bats reserve in the threaded property in Dumfries and Galloway , where eight of the ten Scottish bats are home .	-3.4842
According to the administrator David Thompson , the property is an ideal habitat built from lililife :	-7.3131
“ Here in Threave we have a great area for bats . ”	-1.9613
“ We have the old buildings , many old trees and all the good habitat .	-2.0197
But there is still much unknown about bats and the work we do here and on other plots helps us to understand better what they need to live . ”	-3.0369
He emphasises that it is important to check before maintenance in buildings whether bats are there , according to which it is possible to kill up to 400 females and boys when destroying a single sleeping place – a whole local population may be erased .	-5.8232
Bats are protected ; it is forbidden to kill , harass or disturb them and destroy their sleeping places .	-3.0240
Elisabeth Ferrell , Scottish employee of the Bat Conservation Trust , has encouraged the public to help .	-1.8939
She said : “ We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we simply do not know how their populations are . ”	-2.7562

His lawyers will sue the German news magazine “ The Mirror ” , which has published the accusations .	-2.7780
The storm from Portugal and Juventus was accused of having raped an American named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009 .	-2.8296
He should have paid $ 375,000 to keep silent about the incident , The Mirror reported on Friday .	-3.7457
Hours after the claims were reported , Ronaldo , 33 in an instagram live video to his 142 million followers returned the reports as “ fake news . ”	-3.0198

The alleged incident is to have taken place in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in June 2009 .	-3.3225
According to documents submitted to the district court of Clark County in the US state of Nevada , Ronaldo and Mayorga withdrew into the room of the player after getting to know the player at a night level.	-12.2035
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo was knees after the alleged incident , and he said he was “ 99 % ” a “ good guy , ” left out by the “ one percent . ”	-4.8666
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the pair had sex , but it was agreed .	-1.9564
Mayorga also claims that she had gone to the police and had taken photos of her injuries in a hospital , but later agreed to an extrajudicial agreement because she had " fear of retaliation " and worried about becoming " publicly humiliated " .	-4.3702
The 34-year-old says that she is now trying to declare the agreement invalid as it remains traumatised by the alleged incident .	-3.1762

Brexit : Britain would forever regret losing car manufacturers	-1.8569
“ The United Kingdom would regret at times if it lost its position as the world ’ s leading car manufacturer after Brexit , ” said Economic Minister Greg Clark .	-3.8776
He added that it was ' worrying ' that Toyota UK informed the BBC that they would temporarily stop production in their plant in Burnaston , near Derby , if Britain were to leave the EU without a deal .	-3.6208
“ We need an agreement , ” said Clark .	-1.5026
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the effects of delays at borders in the event of no-deal Brexit could cost jobs .	-2.6384
The plant in Burnaston , which produces the Auris and Avensis brands for Toyota , produced nearly 150,000 cars last year , 90 % of which were exported to the rest of the European Union .	-8.5407
“ When Britain leaves the EU at the end of March without an agreement , I believe that production stops arise in our plant , ” said Marvin Cooke , CEO of Toyota in Burnaston .	-3.9664
Other British car manufacturers have expressed fears of leaving the EU without agreement on the cross-border trade modalities , including Honda , BMW and Jaguar Land Rover .	-2.8455
For example , BMW has already announced that his work in Oxford was closed for a month after Brexit .	-2.8965
The most important concerns relate to what automobile manufacturers say about the risks of the supply chain in the event of a " no deal Brexit " .	-3.5135
Toyota ’ s production facilities are based on requirement-oriented manufacturing , which means that the parts are delivered every 37 minutes by UK and EU suppliers for special manufacturinparlinlililililililililililililili	-9.2681
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU on 29 March without an agreement , there may be delays at the border , which , according to industry indications , can lead to shortages and shortages of delilivery . lilililililili	-9.3946
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day of stock in his plant in Derbyshire , said the company , and so production would be stopped .	-3.0087
Mr Clark said that Theresa May ’ s Chequers Plan for future relations with the EU was “ precisely calibrated to avoid these controls at the border . ”	-2.8520
We must have a deal ; we want the best deal that not only allows us to succeed , we want to seize this opportunity , ” he said to the Today of BBC Radio 4 programme .	-4.4378
“ The note not only of Toyota but also other manufacturers is that we must be able to continue with what has become a very successful series of supply chains . ”	-3.3885
Toyota did not provide information on how long the production stop could take , but warned that the cost increase could suffer the competitiveness of the plant in the long term and , finally , jobs could be lost .	-4.7175
Peter Tsouvallaris , trade union representatives and employed in Burnaston for 24 years , said that trade union members are increasingly concerned : “ In my experience , jobs are forever lost once they are dismantled . ”	-4.1823

Trump ’ s Rosenstein Meeting could postpone again , says the White House	-2.9489
Donald Trump ’ s top-class meeting with Deputy Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein could “ be postponed another week , ” as the fight for the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues , the White House said on Sunday .	-3.7717
Rosenstein supervises the work of the special adviser Robert Mueller , who examines Russian interventions in the elections , links between Trump and Russia , and the possible disability of the judiciary by the president .	-9.2564
Whether or not Trump will fire the Deputy Prosecutor ’ s Deputy Prosecutor , and so that Müller ’ s independence is threatened , Washington has for months brought a lot of costs .	-12.1652
Earlier this month , the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the wearing of a cable to record talks with Trump , thus making it possible to remove the president from the 25th addition of the Constitution .	-3.6635
Rosenstein rejected an opinion .	-1.2885
But last Monday he took himself to the White House , while reports hailed that he was about to resign .	-4.2366
Instead , a meeting with Trump , who was then at the United Nations in New York , was announced on Thursday .	-2.3344
Trump said he would prefer not to fire rosenstein , but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a collision with the hearing of the Senate ’ s Judicial Committee , in which Kavanaugh and one of the women , Dr Christine Blasey Ford , accused him of sexual error .	-4.2350
On Friday , Trump arranged a one-week FBI investigation of claims against Kavanaugh , further delaying a full Senate voice .	-3.1813
Donald Trump ’ s press spokesman Sarah Sanders was on Sunday at Fox News .	-1.9949
After the Rosenstein meeting asked , she said : " A date has not yet been set , it could be this week , I could see that I am going back for another week , given all the other things that are going on with the Supreme Court .	-10.5198
But we will see and I always keep the press up to date . '	-2.2698
Some reporters would challenge this claim : Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September .	-2.2850
The guest Chris Wallace asked why .	-1.2242
Sanders said that the lack of briefings did not result from television reporters behaving like self-actors , but she also said : ' I will not be against them in the gallery ' .	-4.4939
She then proposed that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase .	-1.8549
'The President carries out more questions and answers than every President before him ' , she said and added without evidence : ' We have looked at these figures ' .	-3.6841
Briefings will still take place , said Sanders , but if the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly , that is infinitely better than talking to her .	-3.2837
We are trying to do much about this and you have seen how we have done it in recent weeks and it will replace a press talk if you can talk to the President of the United States yourself . ”	-3.9275
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in public meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries .	-2.0470
Press conferences with one person are rare .	-1.2761

Peter Martin , from the CGA consultancy , which compiled the numbers , said : " Sustained sunshine and England ’ s longer than expected permanent participation in the World Cup led to July following a similar pattern as in the previous month of June , when pub visits rose by 2.8 % , only that restaurants were even more affected .	-5.5757

It is no surprise that restaurant groups continue to be under pressure , although a 4.8 % revenue decline compared to the previous year will be particularly painful in addition to continued cost pressure .	-4.5952
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food operators , and the time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will provide for the much-needed break .	-3.7825

Milk pump advertising , where mothers are compared to cows , led to controversial online discussions .	-2.5336
A milk pump company has caused controversial online discussions due to an advertisement where breastfeeding mothers are compared to milk cows .	-3.6268
On the occasion of the market launch of the supposedly " first noiseless and portable milk pump " , the consumer tech company Elvie published an ironic advertising inspired by music videos to show what freedoms mothers are offered with this new pump .	-3.8258
Four real mothers dance in a hay barn in the middle of cows to a number with the following song text : ' Yes , I melk myself , but you see no tail ' and ' If you have not noticed that there are no Euter , it is my breasts ' .	-5.3819
The slogan continues : ' Pump off , pump off , I feed the babies , pump off , pump off , pump off , I melt my ladies ' .	-3.4752
However , the advertisement published on the Facebook page of the company has online provided controversy .	-3.2037
With 77,000 calls and hundreds of comments , the video has received mixed reactions from the viewers , many of whom say that it illuminates the " horrors " of the dairy industry .	-3.1758
'It is a very bad decision to advertise with cows for this product ' .	-2.6348

The Elvie milk pump fits inconspicuously into a still bra ( Elvie / Mother ) .	-2.7991
Another commented : " Understandably traumatic for mother and baby .	-1.7248
But yes , why should we not advertise with them for a milk pump for mothers who can keep their babies ?	-2.4650

This is a brilliant product , " wrote a person .	-1.9553
Another commented : " This is a funny advertising for mothers who feel like " cows " ( often at their jobs or toilets ) .	-3.1201
That is not advertising that praises or judges the dairy industry . ' lililililililili	-6.9687
At the end of the video , the group of women reveals that they have all danced with the decent pumps in their bras .	-2.8305
The concept of the campaign is based on the recognition that many women who pump milk say that they feel like cows .	-2.2244
However , the Elvie Pump is completely noiseless , has no wires or hoses and fits inconspicuously into a still-bra , making women free to move , keep their babies and even go out with the pump .	-4.9999
Ana Balarin , partner and ECD at Mother commented : " The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that deserves a courageous and provocative market launch .	-3.0300
By drawing a parallel between the expression of women and dairy cows , we wanted to focus on the breast pumps and all its challenges , while at the same time demonstrating in an entertaining and comparable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring .	-4.0105

Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texan border .	-2.4719
The number of imprisoned children with migration background rose , although monthly crossings remained relatively unchanged , partly because the Trump administration ’ s hard rhetoric and policies made it harder to find sponsors for children .	-3.7421
Traditionally , most sponsors themselves have been undocumented immigrants and fear that they will be referred to the country when they stand up for a child .	-3.4574
The risk increased in June , when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to give fingerprints and that the data would be passed on to the immigration authorities .	-3.1484

Syria calls on US , French , and Turkish “ occupying forces ” to withdraw immediately	-2.1694
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem called before the UN General Assembly also for Syrian refugees to return home , even though the country ’ s war has lasted for eight years .	-3.4259
Moualem , who is also Deputy Prime Minister , said that foreign forces are illegal on Syrian soil on the pretext of combating terrorism , and “ they will deal with it accordingly . ”	-4.0072
“ You must withdraw immediately , ” he said to the Assembly .	-2.4389
Moualem stiffly claimed that in Syria the “ war on terror is almost over . ” More than 360,000 people have died in the country since 2011 , millions more have been driven out of their homes .	-3.8964
He said that Damascus will continue to “ fight this holy battle until we have liberated all Syrian territories ” from both terrorist groups and “ any illegal foreign presence ” .	-3.0891
The US has around 2,000 soldiers in Syria ; mainly training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs , who are opposition to President Bashar al-Assad .	-3.1349
France has over 1,000 soil soldiers in the war-destroyed country .	-10.1366
On the question of refugees , Moualem said that the conditions for returning are right , and he accused of “ fueling some Western countries irrational fears ” that led refugees to keep away .	-4.1230
“ We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate the return , ” said Moualem .	-9.4940
“ They actually politicize a purely humanitarian issue . ”	-2.0895
The US and the European Union drew attention to the fact that there could only be reconstruction aid for Syria if a political agreement between Assad and the opposition were to end the war .	-3.9134
UN diplomats said that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last important rebel high castle Idlib makes it possible to promote political talks .	-4.0117
The Russian-Turkish deal prevented a large-scale attack by Syrian troops supported by Russia on the province in which three million people live .	-2.4577
Moualem , however , emphasised that the agreement sets “ clear deadlines , ” hoping that the military operation will be directed against jihadists , including fighters from the al-Qaeda Nusra Front , which will be “ erased . ”	-5.4862

He outlined for the jury how he compiled the movements of the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death using mobile phone records .	-3.7700
Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was in the evening of her death at Chambers , which contradicted his previous claims , reported The Clarion Ledger .	-3.4946

Now Maurice sues the couple for compensation for redundancies and requires compensation of $ 350 per day for the six-month full-time employment for which it was originally stopped , albeit without a treaty .	-4.7131
“ I want to show them , they look at what they do not , ” she said to the post on Friday and added : “ I know that discrimination is . ”	-3.6533

Bond ’ s daughter Karen Jankel , born shortly after the acceptance of the book , said about the letter : It is difficult to enable someone to read it for the first time before the release .	-3.2612
“ It is very amusing – now that we know about Paddington ’ s great success . ”	-1.9378
She said that her father , who had previously worked as a BBC cameraman , and was then inspired to write a child book from a small toy bear , would have remained optimistic if his work had been rejected , adding that the 60th anniversary of the book publication after his death last year was “ bittersweet . ”	-4.4623

FBI investigations have begun , and Brett Kavanaugh ’ s future is at stake .	-2.1097
“ I thought that if we could actually get something like what he demanded - an investigation that is limited in time and extent - we could perhaps reach a little unanimity , ” said Mr Flake , on Saturday , and added that he feared that the committee would “ fall apart in the midst of a deeply rooted party political blockade . ”	-5.6579
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to determine ?	-1.7980
Their restraint is simply due to timing .	-2.1233

The majority of refugees from North Korea finally receive South Korean citizenship .	-9.2954
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally exceeded the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953 .	-2.2685
Most flee over China , which has the longest border with North Korea , which is easier to cross than the strictly guarded demilitarized zone between North and South Korea .	-2.3508
China views overflowers as illegal migrants , not refugees , and often forces them back .	-2.9147

Pelosi made the comments on an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin , Texas .	-1.4891
“ I could not differ from thinking that if a woman had ever behaved so , they would have called it “ hysterically , ” Pelosi said about her response to Kavanaugh ’ s statement before the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday .	-3.8772
Kavanaugh denied the claims emotionally loaded that he attacked Dr sexually , Christine Blasey Ford when they were both young people .	-3.6790
During his opening speech Kavanaugh was very emotional , sometimes he screamed almost and fought with the tears when he spoke about his family and his high-school years .	-2.8892
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in committee and called the accusations against him a “ grotesque and coordinated calling campaign ” organized by Liberals angry that Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election .	-3.2282
Pelosi said that she believed that Kavanaugh ’ s statement proved that he could not serve before the Supreme Court , because he showed that he was biased against Democrats . lefling .	-12.0804
“ I believe that he himself disqualifies with such statements and the way in which he can be influenced by the Clintons and the Democrats , ” she said .	-3.0626
When she was asked whether , in the case of his confirmation and a democratic majority in the House of Representatives , she would seek a raising procedure against Kavanaugh , Pelosi hesitated .	-3.8601
“ I want to say the following : if he does not tell Congress or the FBI the truth , he is not only inappropriate for the Supreme Court service , but also for the service at the court where he is currently employed , ” Pelosi said .	-4.9270
Kavanaugh is currently judge in D.C. Appeal Court .	-7.4288
Pelosi added that she was a democrat concerned about possible Kavanaugh judgments against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade , as he stands for conservative justice .	-8.0478
In his confirmation hearings , Kavanaugh balanced questions about whether he would tilt certain decisions of the Supreme Court .	-3.9435
“ It is not time a hysterical , biased person goes to the court and expects us to say , “ If that is not wonderful , ” said Pelosi .	-3.5915
And women need to keep it .	-9.4098
It is a genuine speech , months and years full of anger , and it cannot get it out without crying .	-3.8746
" We cry when we become angry , " Mrs Steiner said to me 45 years later .	-2.4663
" I do not think this is unusual , or ? "	-2.1874
She continued : “ I once helped a woman in the executive who told me that she also cried when she was angry , but she developed a technique in which she every time she was angry and began to cry , the following said to the person she spoke with : “ You may think I am sad because I cry .	-5.8720

How the Trade War between China and the US could benefit Beijing	-2.1257
The opening salves of the trade war between the US and China were deafening and an end to the disputes is not in sight ; a gap between the two countries can be beneficial for Beijing in the long term , say experts .	-4.3697
US President Donald Trump caused the first warning earlier this year by taxing important Chinese exports such as solar panels , steel , and aluminium .	-2.6930
The introduction of new tariffs on Chinese products imported to the US worth $ 200 billion ( $ 150 billion ) this week has led to a dramatic escalation of the situation .	-11.9553
Beijing has revanched each time in the form of expertise , and last but not least , tariffs raised from five to ten percent on US goods worth $ 60 billion .	-4.5948
China answers every US blow with a counter-attack , and it is unlikely that the world ’ s second largest economy will surrender in the near future .	-3.2842
Bringing Washington into control means giving in to demands , but bowing publicly to the United States would be far too blameful for Xi Jinping , the President of China .	-3.8700
But if Beijing takes advantage of its opportunities properly , the trade war with the US can have a positive impact on China in the long term by reducing the mutual dependencies of the two economies , experts say .	-3.9458
“ The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing can create the conditions for economic turmoil in one of the two countries is much more dangerous than observers before , ” said Abigail Grace , scientific staff at the Center for New American Security , a think tank focusing on Asia .	-3.4466
